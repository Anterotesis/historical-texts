         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p> That which slender iudgements call greatnesse, because themselues cannot compasse it, is not so, but a bumbast of titles and other shreds of fortune, wherwith the least mynds are often stuft out: But a mind well grown then best shewes it owne hight when it stands downe, and puts off the slippers of fortune. Heauen resist that this should euer befall your Lordships, because your vertues put them on, and they sit cleane on you: Yet when I sought first of what size I might make my respect, my imagination stript you of all honour till I found your worths so well set and limbd, that I could not make your estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too great. I shall bee much bound to your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble apprehension, if out of all this circumlocution it extract this meaning, That not your fortunes but vertues begat my loue; so happily you will tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerat the troublesomnesse of it for the parents sake: Yet I hope it wil not be altogether a fruitlesse trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

And though much hereof bee beyond your time, yet is it not beyond your knowledge, for hee whose vnderstanding is not elder than himselfe loseth the noblest inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of his auncestors, and sticks in the worst kind of minoritie. You haue a most exact commentarie of your owne vpon this work, the all sufficient and most vnderstanding viscount <hi>Liste</hi> your noble vnckle, who hath scarce bin euer absent in any ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice where honour hath bin present among them.

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Is errors and blots who transcribes the actions of an Age past-by out of sight, are almost indiscernable, at least incorrigible: Antiquitie of whom, and posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to whom he speakes, lye at his mercie, the same of the one, and faith of the other, often suffering mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably vnder him. But he that speakes to the face of a Time present, must either speake truely, or make roome in his patience to receiue the lie, and vndergoe a shamefull detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Of this second kind is mine Author, who tells thee little but what perhaps thou hast alreadie heard from the mouth of the canon, or, if the crampe of feare benumb'd not thy spirits, hadst an hand in: So that thou mayest securely hearken to him, since thy knowledge will not be so vnkind as looke on and see thy beleefe abused. Let not any mans ignorance per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suade thee that it is superfluous to read ouer this Copie, hauing the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in thy memorie: thou must lay it neerer to thee than thy memorie, in thine vnderstanding. Againe, not to endure the rehersall of thine owne actions, is an argument of their deformitie; else thou wouldst asmuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to looke in this booke, as a faire woman in her glasse, or on her pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture. This I can safely promise, That if thy judgement can reach them, among these leaues, thou mayest find much fruit worth the tasting. In the noble and prosperous familie of <hi>Nassau</hi> thou mayest obserue, That a vertuous sonne makes an immortall father in despite of treacherie and death. In the whole course of the warre, how that deluge of bloud wherewith her enemies hoped to haue drowned the Netherlands, did like the inundation of Nile but fatten and inrich them. By the basseling and coudgelling that proud Armada, that vnlesse the Lord of Hosts be

the Godfather, the name of inuincible is improper and ridiculous to any humane armie. By the Hollanders marine expeditions, that vertue like the heauenlie Spheares must neuer stand still, and that whiles shee goes not forward, she becommeth retrograde. In the English, who brake the ice of Nauigation to them and had the wind of same of them in that art, idlenesse striking the sailes of their industrie, are fallen much to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in reputation, perhaps in sufficiencie. In the late treatie of peace, that they who beat the furnace for Innocents, are oftentimes so ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reacht by their owne flames, that they are faine to quench them in their derided t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those escapes either of mine owne or the printers which thou shalt meet with all, furnish thee with good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to requite my paines taken for thee, by fauourably correcting them.</p>

               <p>Within this building is a large and spacious hall, built (as the auncient chronicle of Holland saith) of a certaine wood brought from Ireland which will neuer rotte, nor beare any spiders or other venimous worme. This hall is inuironed with diuers and sundry shoppes, well furnished with all manner of books in all languages, and with goodly pictures.</p>
               <p>But the most excellent of them are, the siluer coate armours, trumpets and ensignes which hang there in great number, woon from the enemie at the defeat of Turnhout, and at the battaile of Flanders, which are hung vp in the roofe of the hall for a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remembrance.</p>

                  </note>In the yeare 1584 in the beginning of May, there came to the Princes Court in the Towne of Delft, a young man of the age of seuen and twentie yeares, of a middle stature, simple countenance, and euell aspect, his name vvas <hi>Baltazar Gerard</hi> borne at Ville<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans in Burgondie, he had changed his name, and termed himselfe <hi>Francis Guyon</hi> of Besançon, sonne to <hi>Peter Guyon</hi> of Lyons vvho had beene put to death for his Religion, and for enterprising somewhat in behalfe of those of the reformed Religion. This fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low deliuered a letter to the sayd Prince, shewing vnto him the zeale he did beare to the reformed Religion, and how desirous he was to serue him; and withall, how that passing through Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, he had visited a Cosin of his called <hi>Iohn du Prè,</hi> Secetarie to Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> vvith whom he had continued for a time, till at last he resolued for the quiet of his conscience to leaue him: The vvhich he was the sooner enforced to do, because the Iesuits began to suspect him: He told him besides how that he had gotten from his Cosen diuers blanks signed by Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> whereof hee thought good vse might be made for enterprising vpon certaine towns of Luxembourg &amp; elsewhere, with many other such like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses &amp; circumstances, tending to this end to insinuat himselfe into the Princes fauour, and to enter into his seruice. He grew like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise familliar vnder colour of Religion vvith certaine of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

houshold seruants, and vvas present at Sermons and vsuall Prayers, carrying eyther a Psalme Booke Bible or Testament still in his hand.</p>
               <p>The Prince acquainted vvith all this, answered that he thought those signed blankes would doe small good in any enterprise, but onely serue to safe-conduct messengers from Bruxels to Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, and therefore vvilled him to leaue some of them. And at vvhat time the Lord of Schoonwall vvent into Fraunce, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie thought good to send the sayd <hi>Baltazar</hi> vvith him to the Marshall <hi>Byron,</hi> who men thought should haue beene Gouernour of Cambray, that he might make vse of these signed blankes: And vvith him he vvent into Fraunce.</p>
               <p>After that, he returned from Fraunce with Letters both to the Prince and States, mentioning the death of the Duke of Brabant &amp; A njou, in vvhich regard the Prince sent for him into his Chamber as he lay in his bed, that he might particularly informe him of the Dukes death.</p>
               <p>He hath confest since, that if his dagger had beene then about him, hee vvould haue killed him in his bed.

                  </note> that his name was <hi>Baltazar Gerard</hi> of Ville sans in Burgondie, and that for the space of sixe yeares he had a desire to kill the Prince, which he imparted to diuers, who reprehended him for it. But, some three yeres past vnderstanding that the Prince of Orange stood attainted and condemned by the King of Spayn, he vsed meanes to come hither to execute that sentence: yet hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that a certaine <hi>Biscan</hi> had alreadie dispatcht him, he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe into the seruice of <hi>Iohn du Prè,</hi> Secretarie to Count <hi>Mansfeldt</hi>: but within a while after hauing notice that the Prince still liued, he resolued to kill him whatsoeuer should happen, hoping to find meanes of secret departure from Count <hi>Mansfeldts</hi> Campe, to the Prince, and by seeming to be of his Religion, to present him certain blankes of the sayd Earles signed and sealed with red wax, and so to watch a time to kill him with lesse daunger. But at last being hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by sundrie occasions, in March he left his master and came to Treues, where he confest himselfe to a Iesuit, vnto whom he bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his designe, intreating him after Easter to acquaint Count <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feldt</hi> therewith. This Iesuit aduised him to impart it likewise to the Prince of Parma, which he afterwards did by letter in the Citie of Tournay, but he durst not tarie for an answer fearing least he would take the carrying of those blankes in bad part; with which hee went to Delft to put his plot in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: But finding no fit opportunitie to doe it, he went into Fraunce with the Lord <hi>Caron,</hi> from whence he was sent backe with letters both to the Prince and States, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the death of the Duke of Anjou: and afterwards he watcht all occasions to performe his diuellish enterprise, thinking it the fittest time to dispatch him, either at a Sermon, or when he should bee at
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14840:14"/>
meat: and that thereupon he had bought two Pistols, and charged them, the one with three bullets wherewith he shot the Prince, and the other with two which he could make no vse of, being hindered by the Gard, for which he was verie sorie, affirming that if at that time he had beene two thousand miles from thence, he would haue returned backe to kill him. All this did he voluntarily and without torture confesse and set downe in writing. Afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Prison, he confest at sundrie times that which followeth, and perseuered in it to the verie death.</p>
               <p>First, (without any torture) he declared that not long before he vnderstood the Kings proscription against the Prince, being in May last at Delft, he would haue done the deed, if he could haue found a fit time, and meanes to escape: Afterwards he sued to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie letters of the Dukes death, and that the day before, he thought to haue slayne him, but that he durst not then attempt it, because he saw no meanes of escape. But the same day he did it, he wholly resolued to contemne all daunger and to kill the Prince, though he were inuironed with fiftie thousand men.</p>
               <p>Concerning his declaration to the Iesuit he persisted in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer confession: and how that being in Fraunce, this businesse did so torment him as he could not rest night nor day: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, he quarrelled with some of his fellow seruants, that he might the sooner be dispatched away with letters; And if in that journey he should haue missed his purpose, his meaning was to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into Fraunce and to haue become one of the reformed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in some Congregation or other; and to haue so delt with the Consistorie, as he would haue obtayned letters of recommendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to get him accesse to the Prince, and by that meanes to perform the deed. Being tortured, &amp; likewise before, he confest that he had acquainted <hi>Doctor Gery</hi> Warden of the Friers at Tournay with his purpose. After his torture he confessed that the sayd Frier had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him, and giuen him his blessing, promising to pray to God for him.

And we, according to her Maiesties and his Excellencies pleasure, holding him displaced, haue taken vnto our selues the generall gouernement of the sayd countries in matters which concerne the common defence and vnion thereof, that we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the Treatie made with her Maiestie, in the administration of the Councell of State of the sayd countries, to the end that all matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the common defence and vnion thereof against their common enemies, may be managed and conducted by the aboue mentioned Lord <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bie,</hi> Gouernour Generall of her Maiesties forces, The Gouernours of the respectiue vnited Prouinces, and the two Counsellors chosen by her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, being her owne subiects, brought in, or yet to be brought in to that end, into the sayd Councell, according to the aboue named Treatie, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Counsellors of the vnited Prouinces, whom we haue appointed, or may hereafter appoint: Therefore we certifie all Gouernors and Captains of Prouinces, townes and members thereof, all Admirals, Vice admirals, all Colonels, Captaines, and souldiers, both by sea and land, and moreouer, all Presidents, Counsellors, Officers, Treasurers, Receiuers, Bailifes, Scouts, Marshals, Iustices, Magistrats, Gentlemen, Vassals, Bourguers, and other subiects and inhabitants of these countries, of what estate or condition soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they be, that they are all together, and euerie of them in particular, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,

The which oath we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them faithfully to keepe and discharge, euen as they will answer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and these countries. And for want of doing hereof, we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against the transgressors according to the laws of marshal discipline. And as these countries haue not otherwise treated, concluded, or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with her Maiestie of England, than in the maner abouesaid, and that we likewise are assured from her Maiestie, by sundry declarations, that she pretends no further claime or title to these countries, townes, members thereof, nor craues nothing more of them but the obseruing of the aboue mentioned Treatie, which we likewise for our part haue euer, and still doe desire, faithfully to accomplish in euery point, and to her Maiesties good content, who hath likewise at sundrie times expresly declared, That it would be much against her good wil &amp; meaning, if any dissention, breach, or disunion, should vnder her name be caused or made. This notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we find that sundrie inhabitants of the said Prouinces, being badly informed of the aboue mentioned Treatie, imagining matters that are not, and forgetting their duetie, haue done diuers bad offices, to the preiudice of the quiet and vnion of the said Prouinces both in generall and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that vnder this colour sundrie other malicious persons, for the most part strangers, and come hither from other Prouinces, hauing little or nothing to lose here, haue gone about by their turbulent disposition, and desire tending to sedition, by secret practises and false pretence, to seduce the inhabitants of the said countries, to disunite others, and to stirre them vp to rebell, inciting the souldiers paid by the countrey to mutinie, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that to commit treason, falsely therein vsing her Maiesties name and authoritie. That diuers likewise, borne in other countries, haue calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the state of these Prouinces, townes, and members thereof, discoursing of it as if they were naturall subiects, according to their owne rashnesse and seditious affection, and as if it were lawfull for them there to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise any noueltie, not considering that they more than any other ought mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly to containe themselues, and to remaine quiet, enioying the protection and defence of these countries in as ample manner as the naturall inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14840:20"/>
and all this vnder colour of her Maiesties name and authoritie, who is highly offended therewith, the same being cleane contrarie to her intent and meaning: all which is like to procure the generall ruine of the said Prouinces. For the conseruation whereof all good and loyall inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants and subiects of the said countries, who being driuen forth of other Prouinces for religion, are retired hither, haue indured much, liuing peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably vnder their lawfull Magistrats both in prosperitie and aduersitie. So that now by these presents expresse prohibition is made to euerie one, of what nature or condition soeuer he be, henceforth neither by words, secret practises, writings or deeds, to enterprise any alteration, noueltie, or sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the state of these countries, among the Burguers, inhabitants, and souldiers, seruing by land or water, be it vnder colour of her Maiesties name and authoritie, or that of the Earle of Leycester his Excellencie, or to attempt, solicite, or performe it by any other, on paine that wee the States of the respectiue Prouinces, or Officers, Iustices, and Magistrats of the countries and townes, will proceed without respect of persons, or any fraud or dissimulation, against them, according to the lawes and customes of the countrey, ordained and obserued against disturbers of the publike peace, that they may serue for example to others.</p>

and constraint. But they could not preuaile with General <hi>Senoy,</hi> whom the late Prince of Orange had made Gouernour of North Holland, neither by faire meanes, or mediation of sundrie great Lords, so as he could not be brought to giue obedience to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie as Gouernour Generall, nor yet to my Lords the States as chiefe Lords: Whereupon they were constrained to vse force, because that to reduce him to obedience did greatly import the countries. And for that we wil set downe euerie thing according to truth, we will adde in this place, in manner of an introduction, the reasons which moued my Lords the States and his Excellencie so to do, euen as it was printed by their owne Printer in</hi> anno <hi>1588.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is knowne to all men, that the most illustrious, high, and mightie Lord, the Prince of Orange of happie memorie, was so affectionat to the wealth and commoditie of the Netherlands, and especially of Holland, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and West Frizeland, vnder his owne gouernement, as he hath for the conseruation of those Prouinces offered and exposed not onely his own substance, and that of his kinsmen, but euen his owne person, and those of my Lords his brethren, and others of his kindred; so that the said Lord Prince (being pursued by the King of Spaine by all hostile meanes, for the cause abouesaid, and by the Duke of Alua during his tyrannie in the Low Countries) perceiuing the state of these countries to be wonderfully op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest, he hath shewed so many honourable, commendable, and heroicke markes and testimonies of his affection to the good of these Prouinces, as during his absence from thence the inhabitants thereof, and namely the countries of Holland, Zeland, and West Frizeland, did mutually determin to free themselues from the tyrannie of the said Duke of Alua, to embrace the Christian and reformed Religion, and to liue free vnder the lawfull gouernement of the abouesaid Lord Prince. And for the maintenance of the sayd resolution, he did at the beginning of the warre appoint and send into sundrie parts and townes of the afore mentioned countries vnder his gouernement, such persons as himselfe thought fit for the seruice of the countrey, with such Commission as the affaires of the time then required: and among others sent the Generall <hi>Senoy</hi> into North Holland and West Frizeland, who vpon his Excellencies commission was willingly &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any contradiction receiued there, the inhabitants of the said countries hauing no respect to the person of the man (who was a stranger, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and borne forth of the countrey) but onely for loue which they bare to the said Lord Prince, and for that they were there desirous to shew what honour and respect they did beare to his commaundements. It
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14840:21"/>
is a matter likewise knowne, that euer since that time the sayd Generall hath beene verie honourably respected by his Excellence of happie memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and by the countrey: as also that after the lamentable death of his said Excellencie, the States of Holland and West Frizeland, and the high and mightie Lord <hi>Maurice</hi> Prince of Orange, Earle of Nassau, and Marquesse of Vere, Fiessingue, &amp;c. son to the aboue named Prince, after that he had receiued the gouernement of Captaine Generall of the countries of Holland, Zeland, and West Frizeland, haue continued and maintained the said Generall in the same office and authoritie in the sayd place, as he had before his Excellencies lamentable death. And although the sayd General ought to haue acknowledged these benefits receiued from the countrey, at the least not to enterprise anything contrarie to the lawes thereof, or to his Excellencies Commission, as Gouernor general of Holland, Zeland, and West Frizeland; especially seeing that the sayd gouernement was solemnely giuen to his Excellencie vpon sound consideration, &amp; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in signe of acknowledgement of the good and commendable seruices done by the late Lord Prince his father. Neuerthelesse, meanes hath bin made by some men (for the most part borne forth of the countries, badly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to them, and vngratefull to the house of Nassau) that the said Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall hath obtained a certaine ample Commission from the Earle of Leyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (whom the generall States had made Gouernour Generall of the Low Countries) vnknowne to the States of Holland and West Frizeland, or to his Excellencie of Nassau, absolutely to commaund in all matters concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the state and gouernement of the countries and townes of North Holland, and West Frizeland, as Gouernour and Lieutenant to the sayd Earle of Leycester: And besides this, hath likewise obtained other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions directly contrarie to the priuiledges and lawes of the sayd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and authoritie of the Gouernour thereof: By vertue whereof hee hath likewise begun to appoynt new Receiuors of the reuenewes of the countrey, vsing forcible meanes to commit them into the possession of their pretended Commissioners. Of which the States of Holland &amp; West Frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land being aduertised, they haue (according to the charge of their calling, for the defence and confirmation of the vnion and lawes of the said coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as also of the gouernment and authority of his said Excellency) writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the sayd Generall, to acquaint them with the sayd Commissions, and not in vertue therof, attempt any thing without the knowledge of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie and States. But all this being to no purpose with him, the States of Holland, Zeland, and West Frizeland, complained to the Earle of Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester concerning the graunt of the sayd Commissions, as hurtfull to the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14840:22"/>
lawes and customes of the said countries, and to his Excellencies authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and by consequence repugnant to the oath made by the said Earle of Leycester; crauing a reuocation thereof. Whereupon the said Lord Earle at his first departure into England, on the foure &amp; twentieth of Nouem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1586, did vpon mature deliberation and knowledge of the matter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, That he was content, if the Commissions of the sayd Generall were preiudicious to the countrey, and to the authoritie of his Excellencie of Nassau, that the States should take order therein: Which Declaration be subsigned with his owne hand. Hereupon, within a while after, the States and his Excellencie of Nassau wrot to the sayd Generall to come and bring those Commissions to the Hague, that order might be taken therein, for the conseruation and vnion of the customes and priuiledges of the countrey, as also for his Excellencies gouernement and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Vpon this commaundement the sayd Generall, in Ianuarie 1587, came to the Hague to his Excellencie and my Lords the States, and deliuered his Commissions aswell concerning the sayd gouernement, as Captaineship of the Castle of Medenblick, into the hands of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie. Which Commissions being well perused, were directly found to be contrarie to the customes of the sayd countries and townes, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to dissention and disunion, and likewise contrarie to the authoritie of the Gouernour and Captaine generall of Holland and West Frizeland. His Excellencie and certaine chiefe Lords appointed to administer iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the sayd countries, and verie zealous in the true Christian and reformed Religion, together with many Noblemen of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey and townes of Holland, did acquaint him with the loue and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which his Excellencie of Nassau and my Lords the States did beare vnto him; and that they were desirous to continue him in the same authoritie and commaund which he had had ouer the troupes now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and which were hereafter to be appointed for defence of the townes and forts of North Holland, in the time of his late Excellencie of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie memorie, and to giue him Commission to that end, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation, That, seeing at all times the conseruation and assurance of all the Townes, forts, and quarters of Holland and West Frizeland had beene vnder commaund of the Gouernour and Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the sayd countries, who for conseruation and assurance of them, hath euer appointed such Commaunders, Captaines, and souldiers, as hee thought fit to defend them against all men, the Generall <hi>Senoy</hi> was bound, for the conseruation of the rights and vnion of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, as also of the gouernement thereof, to respect and obey his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14840:22"/>
in the same manner as hee had done the late Prince of Orange, his father, to receiue Commissions from him, and to be sworne to him. All this the sayd Generall accepted, and promised to obserue. And though at his owne request his former Commissions were restored vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, yet before the restitution of them hee made a solemne promise, neuer afterwards in any sort to make vse of them. At the same time the sorrowfull newes were brought, of the sale of the town of Deuenter, and forts before Zutphen, by the traitors Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> and <hi>Rowland Yorke,</hi> together with the forts vnder their commaund, by reason whereof time would not permit the sayd Generall to tarrie so long at the Hague till his Excellencie of Nassau had dispatched the sayd Commission, and taken his oath. But his Excellencie relying on his word, and desiring nothing more than the preseruation of those countries, did presently after these sad newes commaund the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to depart into North Holland, to prouide, as many shot as need should require, for the safetie of the towns ther, &amp; namely to send more aid to the townes and forts of Guelderland and Ouer-Yssell (where certaine troups of his Regiment alreadie were.) Whereupon his Excellencie promised to send him two Companies in their stead which should be sent forth of the townes of North Holland, and West Frizeland, to the townes and forts of Guelderland, ouer whom his Excellencie was content he should commaund, as well as ouer those that were alreadie in garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the sayd townes. Hereupon the Generall departed, promising, That hauing once receiued his Commission, hee would remaine in the countrey, and bee obedient to his Excellencie, vnto whom for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof he gaue his hand. And because that, after the treacherie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at Deuenter and forts before Zutphen, the principall cause of that losse was found to be, for that the Commaunders, Captaines, and souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that were there, would not acknowledge any superiours in these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, nor obey the States Generall, Councell of State, nor Gouernor of the countries wherein they liued, nor yet her Maiestie of Englands Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall that was in the Low countries; but sayd, That they were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder commaund of his Excellencie the Earle of Leycester, who was forth of the countrey, and had crost the seas, and could not haue any command of the gouernement of the countrey, nor prouide for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation thereof: and also for that diuers aduertisements were giuen, That vpon occasion they would propound the same to other Captaines and souldiers. So as by that meanes diuers other townes would bee deliuered vp to the enemie. Whereupon the Sates of Holland, West Frizeland,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14840:23"/>
and Zeland, being assembled, did with mature deliberation determine, that it was necessarie for the defence of the sayd countries and townes, that all the regiments vnder the commaund and pay of the sayd coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, besides their oath made to the Earle of Leycester, as Gouernour Generall appointed and committed by the States in these countries, should likewise make oath to be loyall and obliged to the vnited Prouinces, and namely to the countries of Holland, West Frizeland, and Zeland, and to the townes thereof: And that they being in any townes or places belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the gouernement of his Excellencie of Nassau, and Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of the sayd countries, should be obedient to them in whatsoeuer they should be commaunded for the seruice of the sayd countries. All which points were for the most part comprehended in the oath made, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed with that which had beene treated of with his Excellencie the Earle of Leycester, at what time he receiued the gouernment: For allTreaties, Commissions, and Instructions, imported loyaltie to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and townes both in generall and particular, which namely had beene done by the Earle of Leycester; and the verie words of the oath made, (by which they promised to obey the Commaunders which were appointed) contained obedience to the Gouernour and Captaine Generall, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to the Lieutenant Generall of the sayd countries of Holland, Zeland, and Frizeland; seeing it is a thing most certaine, that a Gouernour or Captaine Generall of a Prouince, hath the commaund of all souldiers ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing there. This resolution taken, and his Excellencie hauing beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to execute it ouer all his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, beside the promised Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Excellencie sent a Commissarie to the sayd Generall to take his oath of obedience: He likewise sent, according to his promise, a band of soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, whose Captaine, Officers, and souldiers, were for the most part borne in Holland; and had giuen order that the sayd Companie should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in the towne of Medenblick in their steads who after the yeelding vp of Deuenter had beene sent into the countries of Guelderland and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-Yssel, for the better defence of the townes and forts there. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the Generalls former promise, he would not suffer the sayd Companie, nor yet the Captaine <hi>Arent</hi> of Duvenuord, to come into the towne. The said Generall likewise, contrarie to his former promise, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make oath: And although hee had his Excellencie of Nassau his Commission, yet would he not gouerne himselfe thereby. Whereat his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie being moued (as one that expected better dealing from the sayd Generall) thought it fit, by the States consent, to goe himselfe in person to Medenblick, as well to vnderstand the Generalls intent, as to prouide
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14840:23"/>
all things needfull for the assurance, conseruation, and quiet of the sayd towne, and others in North Holland, and West Frizeland. But going thither accompanied by Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> and diuers other Lords and Commissioners of the townes, with the ordinarie traine of his haushold, hauing no forces at all with him, the said Generall would not suffer his Excellencie in person to come into the towne, to the great griefe and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the Burgomasters and inhabitants of Medenblick: which is a thing neuer before heard of in Holland and West Frizeland. And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that his said Excellencie of Nassau had iust cause in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to conceiue sinisterly of him, yet did he in no sort alter his affection towards the said Generall: and therefore sent certaine trustie persons to the Generall at Medenblick, to demaund of him the reason of his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. And vnderstanding by them, that the said Generall had entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some idle impression and imagination on no sure ground, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie did againe send some of the most eminent persons of the countrey, men verie zealous to the reformed Christian Religion, &amp; louers of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, to bring him to some reason, and to persuade him to doe whatsoeuer was needfull for the good of the countrey, and maintenance of the true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, together with the rights, priuiledges, franchises, and laudible customes of the said Prouinces: and to diuert him from any sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster conceit of his Excellencies true meaning, who desired to perfect the worke begun in these countries by my Lord his father of happie memorie, and to proceed no otherwise with the Generall but in louing, iust, and friendlie manner, promising to forget all former vnkindnesses. And though the said Generall, vpon the remonstrance of these Commissioners, did not absolutely condescend to that which his Excellencie required of him for the seruice of the country, because he said that he had aduertised the Earle of Leycester thereof, whose answer he daily expected, yet in regard hee had by prouiso both by word of mouth and writing, declared that he was sorie for denying entrance to his Excellencie of Nassau into Medenblick, vnto whom and to the States of Holland and West Frizeland, he confest himselfe to be much obliged; and that therefore he would not deliuer the towne of Medenblick to any, without commaundement from his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and my Lords the States. But concerning the acceptance of his Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and taking the oath which his Excellencie commaunded, hee therein craued delay for a time. So that his Excellencie and my Lords the States wrot vnto him, That they did relye vpon his aboue mentioned Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and were willing for a time to deferre that which they had required of him, so that vpon mature deliberation he would make a more ample
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:14840:24"/>
Declaration thereupon. He was moreouer requested to continue his loyall seruice, and not to charge the townes and citizens of Medenblick with too great garrisons, which would breed confusion in the state of the countrey. Two monethes after this the Generall made no farther Declaration, and in the meane space the truth of that came to light, which his Excellencie of Nassau and my Lords the States had long before doubted; namely, that the good of those countries, by the apparent losse of the true, Christian, and Reformed Religion, together with the rights and franchises, were in great hazard, by a determination held to treat with the enemie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon his Excellencie and my Lords the States thought good, being well and amply informed of the said apparent danger, to aduertise the sayd Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall thereof, by a man verie trustie, and zealous of true religion, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie inward with him, and to intreat him, That he would weigh the sayd dangers, and at last resolue vpon that which they hadso often craued of him for the good of the countrey, or else that he would come to the Hague to his Excellenie, to conferre with him concerning these affaires, to the end the said dangers might be preuented.</p>
                  <p>The Generall, vpon his Excellencies word and promise, being come to the Hague, was by him so louingly entertained and respected, as if none of all this had euer beene. And being fully instructed concerning all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of his Excellencies intention, he continued his former Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and promise, requiring for the rest, that they would delay it for a while longer, promising that he would make suit, so soone as the Earle of Leyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should returne, to be discharged of the Commission which he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him. And thereupon his Excellencie of Nassau and my Lords the States, gaue him free leaue to returne wishing him to haue a care for the good of the countrey, and not to ouerburthen the towne and citizens of Medenblick; and that in so doing he should be well assured of his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie and my Lords the States affection, as well to the common good of those countries, as particularly to himselfe. The Earle of Leycester retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning afterwards into these countries, his Excellencie and my Lords the States did for many monethes expect the true performance of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals promise: but as nothing ensued thereupon, but on the contrarie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers things so handled, as there was great likelihood that misprisions, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and diuisions, would ensue, and so by consequent the ruine of those countries, rather than the preseruation of them. The States and his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie did at last request the Councell of State and the Earle of Leyce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (as he from whom be had receiued his Commission) openly to declare what they were to expect of that which for an whole yeare had been held
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14840:24"/>
doubtfull and vncertaine. Whereupon the sayd Councell declared, That the Commission granted by the Earle of Leycester to the said Generall, was repugnant to the authoritie and Commission of his Excellencie of Nassau, and contrarie to the vnion and customes of the countrey. Whereof they likewise hauing written to the Earle of Leycester, they thought good to send for the said Generall, to conferre with him thereupon, and to that end gaue him all assurance. But the Generall making a slight excuse to the Councell, would not come himselfe, but sent <hi>William Mostaert</hi> in his stead: vnto whom the said Councell declared, That they vnderstood that the Generalls Commission was contrarie to his Excellencie of Nassaus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, and that he was alreadie discharged thereof by his Excellencie the Earle of Leycesters owne Declaration, dated the foure and twentieth of Nouember: That the said Generall was likewise bound to receiue his Commission from his Excellencie of Nassau, and to respect and obey him. Whereupon the said <hi>Mostaert</hi> made a Declaration in the Generalls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balse, how that he doubted not but that the Generall would be well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so to doe, prouided, that the Commission might be made to his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. And as the Councell commaunded the said <hi>Mostaert</hi> to set downe in writing, vpon what points the Generall would haue his Commission made, he deliuered them as they are hereafter inserted: wherein, as likewise by that which hath beene added to it, may be seene how vnreasonable a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was. In the meane time the generall States, the Councell of State, his Excellencie of Nassau, as Gouernor and Captain Generall of Holland, Zeland, and West Frizeland, together with the Gouernours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunders of other chiefe Prouinces, for the assurance of the state of the countries, had giuen order for the munition of the frontire townes and forts: wherein, to preuent all outward confusion, it was among other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thought fit, that the towne of Medenblick should be ordinarily man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an hundred and fiftie souldiers, and no more: And because the Generall kept fiue or six hundred souldiers there, contrarie, or at least without the commaundement of his Excellencie and Councell of State; and that the Councell of State had oftentimes commaunded him from the Earle of Leycester his Excellencie, to send the souldiers ouer &amp; aboue the two hundred that were there, forth of the towne, for the countries ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, hee thereupon made an impertinent answer, how that he could not dismise his souldiers, but that it behoued him to retaine them for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his owne person. In this regard the said generall States, the Councell of State, his Excellencie of Nassau in qualitie aboue said, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the States of Holland and West Frizeland, did on the 28 and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14840:25"/>
29 of Ianuarie last past, determine to write to the said Generall, That according to the said order he should keepe but an hundred and fiftie soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in the towne, and send the rest to gard the frontiers. An order was likewise taken the same day, that the hundred and fiftie souldiers appointed to remaine in Medenblick, and others going to their appointed garrisons, should presently receiue a moneths pay: Concerning which, my Lords the States generall, the Councell of State, his Excellencie of Nassau, and the States of Holland, dispatched letters on the twentie ninth and thirtieth of the said moneth, among which the contents of the Councell of States let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was, That the Generall should obey his Excellencie of Nassau. So that it seemes, that indirectly and in contempt, to hinder the effect of the said commaundement, the Generall, according to his former actions and rash speech, boasted, That he had conquered and kept the townes of North Holland: Words not onely tending to the diminution of the late Lord Prince of Orange his reputation, by whose meanes and good conduct those countries had beene defended and preserued, but to the great dishonour of all good people of the townes and countrey of North Holland, and West Frizeland, who in regard of the Generall his Commission, and for the said late Lord Princes sake, had willingly receiued and entertained him then when he wanted and was vnprouided of all things, and who according to his owne speech had verie valiantly defended themselues; saying not long before, That he had rather see the ruine of the countrey, than to desist from his determination and purpose: so as he raised sedition and mutinie among the souldiers in the towne of Medenblicke (the which hee was not ashamed to write of to the Councell of State) which spread it selfe so far abroad, as the Commissarie that was sent thither the same day of the stir, to craue the execution of the said commaundements, receiued an answer from the Generall, That he could not rule the troupes being so disordered. And the souldiers who since their last pay had receiued more monethes means than the other Ensignes, and whose monethlie pay still ran on, said, That they would not goe forth of the town till they had first receiued their full pay for seuentie two monethes; of which seuentie two monethes they had alreadie receiued the two third parts, according to the generall reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution made <hi>anno</hi> 1581, by the generall States, in the towne of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, in presence, &amp; by the consent of my Lord the Prince of Orange. The Burguers of Medenblick (who for the good of the countrey had euer borne themselues loyally, and were to be defended by the souldiers) were by them disarmed, and enforced without delay to carrie their armes to the towne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, where the Generall was: and not the souldiers alone, but the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14840:25"/>
and Officers were constrained to giue weekely as much as their entertainment amounted to. This disobedience, riot, disorder, rebellion, and mutinie, in Medenblick, without any vrgent necessitie, caused the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons of other townes and places (which were worse paid) to doe the like, so as the whole countrey was in a verie dangerous estate. And after that his Excellencie of Nassau and my Lords the States of Holland and West Frizeland, were aduertised that matters did euerie day grow worse and worse at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Medenblick (the said Generall giuing them no aduertisement thereof) his Excellencie and the States of Holland and West Frizeland, who were most interessed therein, thought good to send, beside his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, certaine noble men, to the townes of those countries, to prouide for the redresse of those disorders. His Excellencie being come to the towne of Alckmaer, did by letters request the said souldiers to send some among them to him, to treat of their affaires and end them. But at the same time, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the sixteenth of Februarie, <hi>anno 1588,</hi> the Generall, with the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>Christal</hi> and <hi>Wolfswinckel,</hi> being in the said towne (the better to deceiue the souldiers vnder a fauourable pretence, for the maintenance of his particular designe, and to keepe them at his owne deuotion) made a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest complot, That none of them either in whole or part should go forth of the towne, till such time as not onely they, but likewise all the said Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls regiment, being partly in Guelderland, Frizeland, and Ouer-Yssell, had receiued their full and entire paiment: whereof by letters they like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise aduertised the Captaines that lay in Harderwijc, Campen, and other townes, which were signed and sealed by the Generall, and the said Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines <hi>Chrystall</hi> and <hi>Wolfswinckell</hi>: and those whom they had sent forth of Medenblick with the said complot and treatie, were enioyned to induce other Captaines and souldiers to doe the like. For a second colour the Generall persuaded the Captaines and souldiers, that they were sworne to the Queene of England; which, without direct vsurpation on the State of the countrey, could not be true, seeing that her Maiestie neuer would pretend any right to these countries; for she onely promised to aid these countries during the warre, with certaine forces of horse and foot, vnder promise, that the money lawfully by her disbursed, and knowne to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, should by the States be repaied vnto her; and thereupon the towne of Briell, and forts thereunto belonging, with the towne of Fles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singue, and castle of Rammekins, haue beene deliuered ouer to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie as cautions, onely for her assurance; which she still keepes for the States of the country, her Maiestie pretending no right to the said towns, other than for assurance, as plainely appeares by the contents of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14840:26"/>
made with her: wherein is expressly conditioned, That the Gouernours, Captaines, Officers, and souldiers, Burguers, and inhabitants of the towns should not only sweare vnto her Maiestie, for assuraance of the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the money which she was to disburse, but likewise to the States, for conseruation of their right in all other matters, which they had expresly reserued to themselues, forth of the said assurance. And as concerning her Maiesties promise for greater aid, beside the garrisons of the cautionarie townes (seeing that the same was onely promised by her Maiestie for the seruice of the countrey) it was expresly conditioned in the last article of the said Treatie, That both the Generall, Colonels, Captaines, Officers, and others, should take the oath of fidelitie to the States alone, as they had done before any Treatie was made with her Maiestie, reseruing onely the homage which was due vnto her. And with this reseruation the Colonels <hi>Morgan, Chester,</hi> Generall <hi>Norris,</hi> with other English Colonels &amp; Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, haue successiuely since the beginning of the warre embraced the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of these countries: So that it is a verie strange thing to see any man so rash, as to dare to say contrarie to the said Treatie, That himselfe or soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, being in the pay of the said countries, are tyed by oath to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie. And touching the oath made to the Earle of Leycester, he was in no sort sworne vnto, as hauing authoritie and Commission from her Maiestie, seeing that himselfe vpon the same Commission was bound to sweare vnto the States of the countrey as well as others: but it was done vpon the Commission and authoritie giuen (besides the Treaty made with her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie) by the States to the said Lord Earle, as Gouernor generall. These two pretences concerning the complot &amp; their entire paiment, and persuading the souldiers that they were sworne to her Maiestie of England, and so by consequent should receiue their full pay from her, caused letters to be sent back in the soldiers names of Medenblick, answering those of his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; by which they craued to haue some Commissioners sent vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the businesse together with the soldiers intentions. Thereupon his Excellencie sent the Lord of Famars, General of the Artillery, the Lord of Sweuezeel, <hi>Peter Kyes,</hi> Burgomaster of Harlem, &amp; master <hi>Adrian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonie,</hi> Burgomaster of Alckmaer; who being come thither acquainted the soldiers with his Ex. &amp; my Lords the States good meaning, exhorting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their dutie according to their oth, honor, &amp; bond, and requested them to submit themselues to reason, and to be ruled by the power of the countrey. The soldiers answered them, That they would be wholly paid, not onely for themselues, but for the said Generals whole regiment: so that these Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners iourny was in vain. They wrot afterwards to the soldiers, That
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14840:26"/>
his Excellencie and the States Commissioners were resolued to make them some reasonable offer, and that for the well vnderstanding thereof, they should vnder good assurance, which was promised them, send Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to Hoorne: the which was denied, so as they did againe demand new Commissioners. Whereupon the States wrot backe, That they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye on his Excelencie and the States Commissioners, and that therefore they were to send theirs at the countries charge. Whereunto the souldiers answered, That they would send none, and that they had alreadie declared their intent; demaunding moreouer, that his Excellencie would send o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commissioners to them, vnto whom they offered safeconduct. Which his Excellencie &amp; the States Commissioners vnderstanding, thought good to set downe some reasonable offers in writing, whereby they promised the souldiers to giue them their present pay, &amp; a moneths wages before hand: and promised them moreouer, that concerning the rest that was behind, they should be paid as much, and at the same time, as others that serued the countrey, and should be as well dealt with as the best. They did like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise declare vnto them, That it was not in the countries power to doe more, and that they ought to rest contented seeing they had been best paid, and that they being for the most part borne in the country, they ought more to loue their honour and credit, than by demanding impossibilities, to seeke the ruine of the Prouinces; with protestation, That if they would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to reason, his Excellencie and my Lords the States would hold themselues excused before God and the world, of the inconueniences which might ensue thereof. And to make them this offer, to shew them the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of it, and to persuade the souldiers to reason, his Excellencie and the Commissioners sent Master <hi>Nicholas Brunine,</hi> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sellor to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and <hi>Bartholdus Guillelmi</hi> Minister of the word of God in Hoorne, to Medenblick, who (notwithstanding all their labour) receiued no other answer of them, but that they would be wholly paid. And as it was well perceiued by their answer, that the aboue mentioned mutinie was made for the reasons heretofore alledged, and that their desire was vniust and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible; so as other souldiers which had done better seruice vpon the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and had beene without comparison badlier paid and dealt with than they, would desire the like, which would not be effected with fiftie times an hundred thousand Florins: That the said souldiers had likewise vaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That they knew how to raise their pay vpon the countrey, and that they would haue it by force. Whereupon the Generall had alreadie procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and in effect fortified himselfe against the countrey, tyrannizing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the villages neere to Medenblicke. His Excellencie by the aduice of the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14840:27"/>
States found it necessarie, both for the preseruation of the countrey, and to bring the Generall and souldiers to some reasonable accord, and hinder their bad determination, to prouide for the besieging of the same towne, and therein to make vse, beside the souldiers that were then readie, of certaine Burguers and harquebusiers forth of some townes of North Holland, as from Alckmaer, Hoorne, Enckhuysen, Edam, Monickendam, and Purmereynde, with certaine boores of the countrey. Before the siege, the Lord <hi>Barbese,</hi> Counsellor of State to his Excellencie, and one of the Commissioners, was intreated once more to goe to Medenblick, to let the Generall and souldiers know the wrong they did to themselues, and to trie if he could reduce them to their dutie: who told the Generall both in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and priuatly, That the Councell of State knew, that himselfe as Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall could not make vse of his Excellencie of Leycesters Commission, and that he did wrong to that of Nassau, in not obeying him according to his duetie: Likewise, that those souldiers who were better dealt with than any other, whom they might haue sent against the enemie (yet suffered to liue in garrison where victualls were good cheape) did much forget them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, by doing things tending to the countries ruine: intreating them to vnderstand reason, and to desist from their bad and pernitious enterprise, with promise that all matters shold be forgotten, and themselues verie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably dealt with. All this notwithstanding, he could get none other answer, either from the Generall or souldiers, than that which they had made to the former Commissioners. Within a while after the Generall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued himselfe as an open enemie, burning and wasting the countrey at his pleasure: in regard whereof no man ought to thinke it a strange matter, if his Excellencie and the States make vse of those means which God hath giuen them, for furtherance of the good of these countries, against the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, rebellion, and vniust proceedings of those which enterprise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these Prouinces. Which they thought fit and necessarie to be publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to the world, that euery man vnderstanding the condition of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, and causes of the said proceedings, may rightly iudge thereof, and impute the inconueniences which may arise thereupon, to those who by their great ingratitude to the house of Nassau, haue been authors thereof; especially seeing the said familie hath suffered and done so much for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of these countries, with so great expence of meanes and bloud, by whom the said Generall, from low condition, was raised to such high e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, and exceeding great wealth, who by his ingratitude to the countrey and inhabitants thereof (which had louingly receiued him, and inriched him with their meanes) had shewen so great obstinacy &amp; rebellion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14840:27"/>
in continuing one whole yeare, vttering proud and swelling speeches, to the preiudice of the house of Nassaus Princelie reputation, and against the state of these countries, which he threatened with ruine and destruction, making vse of the souldiers appointed to serue the countrey, for defence of his owne person, disarming the good citizens of Medenblick, whom hee ought to haue defended, afflicting them with seruitude and intollerable burthens. The which Generall, spurred forward by his owne auarice and ambition, from one sinne to another, shall by Gods assistance be brought to shame and confusion; so that all good souldiers which loue Gods word and their countrey, will detest the obstinacie, rebellion, rashnesse, and malicious proceedings of the said Generall, and for that cause will againe take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them the defence of their deere countrey, as in former time: and we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily hope, that the souldiers of Medenblick being well informed, That Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Senoy</hi> by his proceedings hath none other intent, but onely to shew vnder these two false pretences (namely of an oath made to her Maiesty, or to the Earle of Leycester in her name, and that he would be a meanes to procure them the full paiment of all arrerages) his hatred and ill groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded quarels against the countrey and house of Nassau (by which, from a poore estate, he was made rich) will not consent to any thing against their countrey and house of Nassau, and will not hazard, to their owne shame, and dishonour of their friends, the losse of their honour and reputation, nay of their own liues: Especially seeing that by quitting Generall <hi>Senoys</hi> priuat and vniust quarell, they may be reconciled to their countrey and his Excellencie of Nassau, and preserue their liues, goods, honour, reputation, and whatsoeuer be, which hath nothing but what he hath gotten by these countries, and the house of Nassau, doth deceitfully promise them.</p>

               <p>The Duke of Parma, with many thousands of men, had caused great and deepe channels to be digd in Flanders, as the channell called Iperlee, the better to conuey certaine boats from Autuerpe, by Gant to Bruges, where he had prouided more than an hundred boates called Heudes, which he laded with victuals and muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, supposing to send them from Sluce to Sea, or else through the channell of Iperlee, into other Hauens of Flanders.</p>
               <p>He had likewise prepared seuentie flat bottomed vessels in the little Riuer at Waten, each of them beeing able to carrie thirtie horse, with Bridges fit to ship them: he had likewise two hundred more of these Boates (though not so big) readie in the Hauen of Newport.</p>
               <p>He had rigd two and thirtie ships of warre at Dunkirke, &amp; wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mariners, he drew diuers from Hambourg, Breme, and Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
               <p>He had two thousand emptie vessels readie at Grauelin, which in a short space might be soon fastened together in maner of a bridge, with all prouision to make bridges, to choake vp hauens, and to found them; and neere to the Hauen of Newport hee had prepared great heapes of Fagots, and other substance to make Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions: in many of his Boates, were two Ouens to bake bread: he had likewise great numbers of Saddles, Bridles and furniture for horse with all sorts of ordnance, and munition necessarie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>Beside, he had a Campe readie not farre from Newport com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:14840:37"/>
by <hi>Camillo</hi> the Campe-Master, and thirtie Ensignes of Italians, tenne of Walons, eight of Scots, eight of Burgonians, in all fiftie sixe Ensignes, euerie Ensigne an hundred men compleat. Neere to Dixmuyde hee had sixtie Spanish Ensignes, sixtie of Almans, and seuen of reuolted English vnder the commaund of of Sir <hi>William Stanley.</hi> The Earle of Westmerland and the Lord Paget, English fugitiues, were there likewise readie to imbarke. In the suburbs of Courtray, he had foure thousand horse, 900 horse at Watene with the Marquesse of Guastos Cornet who was Generall of the horse.</p>
               <p>Pope Sixtus the fist, the better to strengthen the sayd Armie, and weaken the Queene of Englands power, did for his part doe all he could, imploying his spirituall armes (as they terme it) published his Croizades and Bulls for the aduancement of this enterprise, and gaue great pardons, which were printed and distributed abroad: He had likewise (as it is reported) giuen the Realme of England to the King of Spaine with this Title, of <hi>Defender of the Christian faith,</hi> commaunding him to surprise it, on condition, that if he should win it, he should enioy it as a seodatarie to the See of Rome, and to this end, the Pope contributed a million of gold or ten ne hundred thousand ducats, the one halfe in hand, and the other when eyther England, or some famous Hauen should bee woon.</p>
               <p>And for the better furtherance thereof the Pope sent an English Doctor (called <hi>Allen</hi>) into the Low-countries, who should haue had the managing of all Ecclesiasticall affaires: He, caused a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Popes to be Printed at Antuerpe, confirming his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors sentence of excommunication, deposing and degrading the Queen of England from all her titles and dignities as an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which, for the aduauncement of the enterprise, he would haue published in England.</p>
               <p>The Spanyard, the better to couer and conceale his practises, or else peraduenture to make the world beleeue that his designe was rather for the vnited Prouinces than for England, made a solemne treatie of peace with the Queen at Bourbourg in Flanders. But the Prouinces Towns and Forts neere to the Sea, gaue aduertisements, protested and sought all meanes to hinder and breake off this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of peace, aduising the English rather to stand upon their Gard: Yet some in England stood fast for peace or truce, as most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:14840:37"/>
&amp; profitable for the State of their countrie, as well for their traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique &amp; nauigation, as to cut off the great expence of a long &amp; te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious war; others by this meanes thought to diuert the fleet from them &amp; so to auoid the tempest. In a word, <hi>Parma</hi> hereby did lull full diuers Englishmen a sleep, who were desirous of peace in the Low countries; himselfe thinking on nothing lesse than peace, studying how he might conquer England, which he had alreadie promised to himselfe. Whereupon the English &amp; the vnited prouinces, were in some sort prepared for defence, against the force of this fleet, but not according to the greatnesse of the danger: for it was giuen out that this great Armada was onely to conuey the Spanish fleet to the Indies, and bring it safe home againe; which was the rather belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, because the ships being so great, some thought that the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards would not hazard them in the narrow seas, nere to England.</p>
               <p>In May the French King sent a message to the Queene of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Queene of of England pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares a fleet.</hi>
                  </note> by which hee aduised her to prepare for defence, for that he was truly enformed that this tempest wold light vpon her. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Queene speedily prepared a fleet of her owne ships, and that of her subjects, &amp; sent part thereof to Plimmouth, in the West parts, vnder the commaund of the Lord Admirall, <hi>Charles</hi> Lord <hi>Howard</hi> of Effingham, now Earle of Nottingham, together with Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> Vice-Admirall, to the number of 100 saile. An other fleet lay betwixt Douer and Calais vnder the commaund of the Lord <hi>Henrie Seymer,</hi> sonne to the Duke of Somerset, to the number of 40 or 50 saile.</p>
               <p>All England was in Armes vnder valiant and trusty Captaines. And because it was reported that the Spanyards, conjoyned with <hi>Parma,</hi> would come vp into the Riuer of Thames, a Campe was made nere Grauesend, with forts on both sides the Riuer by <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric Ienibelli</hi> an excellent Ingeneir. The Queene came in person to the Campe, like a second <hi>Tomyris</hi> or <hi>Pallas</hi>; other Camps were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise placed in other parts.</p>
               <p>As for the vnited Prouinces of Holland, Zeland &amp;c. they by a mutuall consent resolued to doe the like. But because they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the Spanish ships were too bigge to come nere their shallow shoares, they were more afraid of <hi>Parma</hi> and his flat bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed Boats, &amp; notwithstanding their own incessiue broiles, they made readie a fleet of ninetie vessels, which they sent to gard al the Hauens of Flaunders, euen from the Scheld and Lillo as farre as
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14840:38"/>
Grauelin, and had placed strong Garrisons in all their Sea Townes.</p>
               <p>And to make some opposition against the Spanish fleet, they sent Captaine <hi>Cornelis Lonck</hi> of Rosendael with fiue and twentie or thirtie vessels to joyne with the Lord <hi>Henrie Seymer,</hi> and to lye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Calais and Antuerpe. But the ships were by Tempest and Northerlie winds enforced to quit the coast of Flanders, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into England, yet when the tempest ceased, they returned, with <hi>Iustinus</hi> of Nassau, who was there in person with <hi>George le More</hi> Vice-Admirall of Zeland, being in number fiftie fiue vessels great and small, of 80 and two hundred and fiftie tunne, excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well mand with souldiers and mariners, beside one thousand two hundred old choyce musquetiers drawne from all the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who were resolute and skilfull in Sea fight. This was dore to keepe <hi>Parmas</hi> fleet from comming forth of the Hauens, which was a matter of most importance.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Spanish fleet set sayle on the</hi> 29 <hi>of May.</hi>
                  </note> In the meane time, on the nine and twentieth day of May 1588 the aforesaid mightie Nauie sayled forth of the Hauen of Lisbone, vnder conduct of the Duke of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina, to the Groine in Galicia, which is the nearest Hauen to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where it tooke in more men and munition. By the way, a tempest arose which scattered them. The Duke and some eightie sale kept together, the rest followed by little and little, except 8 which had spent their masts. Of foure Portugal Gallies one escaped, the rest were taken by an Englishman called <hi>Dauid Guyn,</hi> wherein D. <hi>Diego de Medrena</hi> was slaine.</p>
               <p>The fleet being refreshed at the Groyne, &amp; commanded daily by the Kings Letters to depart, did set fayle on the 21 of Iulie, and held on it course till it came within kenning of England: from thence by small boats they sent word to the Duke of Parma of their arriuall, aduising him to embarke his forces for England.</p>
               <p>They were discouered by an English Pinnace, at the same time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the English fleet lay at Plimmouth, who supposed that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tempest wold delay the enterprise of the Spanish Nauie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Lord Admiral of England receiued letters from the Qu, how she had intelligence, that the Spanish fleet wold not come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, or at least not in a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time, &amp; that therfore the Admiral shold do well to discharge some of the great ships, and send them away.</p>
               <p>But he, hauing receiued newes of their approch on the 29 of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, at foure of the clocke in the afternoone, gaue speedie comaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14840:38"/>
that the whole fleet should put forth of the hauen, &amp; that the souldiers should bee embarked, which was not done but with great difficultie. The Lord Admirall the same night came in to the road with sixe ships, and the next day by noone which was the 30 of Iulie, they descried the Spanish Nauie, which with a South West wind bent it course (as it seemed) directly towards Plimmouth, but when they perceiued the English were forth of the hauen, they passed on forward.</p>
               <p>Here (according to the opinion of some sufficient and vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men) the Spanish fleet committed a great error: for D. <hi>Alonso de Leyuas</hi> aduice was, to haue gone and assaulted Plimmouth, for therein was great likelihood of good successe, seeing that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish were vnprepared, &amp; had bad intelligence of the Spanish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, whereby they might haue surprised them on the sodaine: That the hauen was verie fit and commodious for the aduauncement of their design &amp; that there they might haue made some trial of their valor, &amp; had some proose of the strength of the English fleet, &amp; the peoples affection, and that by giuing an alarme to those parts, the chiefe strength of the countrie would haue bin drawne thither, and <hi>Parma</hi> therby haue had better meanes to haue come forth with his forces. But their instructions from their king and his Councel for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it, who expresly comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded them not to enterprise any thing by the way, but onely to joyne with <hi>Parma,</hi> and together with his troopes and vessels to make an attempt vpon Margate, which they thought might bee easily done; which would haue so amazed the English &amp; Low-countrie fleet, as each of them would haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne themselues to their own defence, to keep their countries &amp; Hauens from inuasion.</p>
               <p>It is reported that some of the chief of the Spanish commanders which were skilful in Nauigation among whom were the Vice Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral D. <hi>Iuan Martin de Ricaldo,</hi> &amp; <hi>Diego Flores de Valdez</hi> &amp; others, had protested that it would bee an hard matter to follow those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, especially in a Commission with such restrictions, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging that in such enterprises, many matters were to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as the wind, time, and tyde to come forth of the Hauens of Flaunders into England, with the places, roads, and deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse thereof, which are subject to wind, &amp; other hazards, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore verie dangerous. But they were strictly tied to their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, which was to come to an anker before Calais, where the prince of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14840:39"/>
Parma should meet them with his flat bottomed boats and other munition, which, vnder the couert and protection of the great Nauie, should passe on, and land their forces in some part of the downes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Spanish Armies proiect.</hi>
                  </note> But, as some of the Spanish prisoners reported, their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall project was vpon the Riuer of Thames, where they might on each shoare land their men, and by passing vp the Riuer sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the Citie of London the Metropolis of the kingdome, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the lesser vessels might follow them, seeing that London not strong, but rich, mightie, and populous, and the inhabitants ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of vnacquainted with warre, might at the first encounter bee easily terrified. They did likewise hope that the Queene should be bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed, and that some discontented faction might arise of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholikes. According to their instruction and commission they went forward, often aduertising the Duke of Parma of their arriuall and intention, and so vpon the thirtieth of Iulie they pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Plimmouth. The English forthwith followed and got the wind of them, by which meanes they might assaile the Spanish fleet, &amp; themselues not be assailed by it, so that the two fleets made towards one another. The next day beeing the one and thirtieth of Iulie, the English came within musquet shot of the Spanish fleet: The English admiral thundred with his ordna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vpon the Spanish Vice-Admiral, who perceiuing themselues to be greatly annoyed by the English Canon, fell into a close forme of an halfe moone, hoysting their sailes but halfe mast high, because they would not fall soule one of an other. Anon, one of the Galleasses was fore opprest by certaine ships,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The fleet aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons D. Pedro Valdez his ship which bad spent her most on the</hi> 31 <hi>of Iune.</hi>
                  </note> and their battaile so assailed, as the chiefe Gallion of Sicile, wherein was D. <hi>Pedro Valdez,</hi> which D. <hi>Basco de Sylua,</hi> and D. <hi>Alonzo de Sayas</hi> with diuers other noble men, brake her mast against another ship, so as she could not follow, and the fleet would not stay to rescue her, but left her behind. The English Admirall looking on <hi>Valdez</hi> ship, and supposing that there were no men in her, went on with as many ships as hee had neere him, beeing loth by night to loose the fleet. For Sir <hi>Frauncis</hi> Drake who that night carried the lanterne gaue chase to fiue great ships diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the fleet, and finding them to be Merchants of Norway let them goe; so as the English Admirall, did all that night, follow the Spanish lanterne, thinking himselfe among his owne men, and in the morning finding that he was in the middest of his enemies, he withdrew himselfe from so great daunger. The morrow after,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:14840:39"/>
which was the first of August, Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> met with <hi>Valde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> ship wherein himselfe and foure hundred and fiftie men were, and sent to hale her. <hi>Valdez</hi> for his owne honor would haue propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded certaine conditions, which hee sent to <hi>Drake</hi>; who aunswered that he would not spend the time in treaties, but if he would yeeld he should find fauour: and on the contrarie, if he would fight, hee should find him a souldier. <hi>Valdez</hi> and his people, perceiuing that they were fallen into <hi>Drakes</hi> hands, and moued by report of his fame, yeelded themselues and found fauor. <hi>Valdez</hi> with his gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and some fortie or fiftie followers, went aboord <hi>Drake,</hi> and the rest were carried to Plimmouth where they remayned a yeare and halfe, till they had payed their ransome or were exchanged for others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Valdez</hi> comming into <hi>Drakes</hi> presence kissed his hands, &amp; told him that they had all resolued to die, if they had not bin so happie to fall into his hands, whom hee knew to bee noble and curteous, and famous for dealing well with his vanquished enemie, so as he doubted vvhether his enemies had more cause to loue him for his valour, or feare him for his fortunate exploits, which had alreadie attained to the highest degree. Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> did curteously im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace him, and caused him to eat at his owne Table and sleepe in his owne Cabbin, where <hi>Valdez</hi> reported vnto him their strength, how that the four Gallies were dispersed, &amp; that they had thought to haue entred the hauen of Plimmouth, without feare of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Nauie, which they supposed durst not haue made resistance, and so haue become masters at sea: They likewise admired the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of the English, who durst with so few &amp; small vessels approch their inuincible Nauie, &amp; get the wind of it, with other such like dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses. <hi>Valdez</hi> and his followers were afterward carried into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: he was a man much respected in his countrie, kinsman to the same <hi>Valdez</hi> who in an. 1573 had besieged Leyden in Holland. In his ship some of the kings treasure was, amounting to the summe of 55000 Ducats in siluer, which was all pillaged.</p>
               <p>The same day, the Vice-Admirall <hi>Oquendo</hi> his ship was fired, where was great store of powder and munition, all the vpper deck was burnt, with all the men, of whom few were saued It was taken and carried into England with many men in her, halfe burnt, and yet all the powder which was in hold was saued, which was a matter to be admired. In the meane time the English Lord Admiral in his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:14840:40"/>
ship called the Arke had that night so far followed the Spanyards, as in the morning he found himselfe in a manner alone in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest of his enemies, so as it was foure a clocke after noone ere all his fleet came vp to him. Some say that D. <hi>Hugo de Moncada</hi> Generall of the foure Galleasses did at the same time with great earnestnesse intreat the Duke of Medina to giue him leaue to boord the Lord Admirall, which the Duke would in no sort permit being loth to passe the bounds of his Commission.</p>
               <p>Tewsday, the second of August, the fleet being before Portland, the wind turned to the North, so, as the Spanyards had a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous gale; but the English did againe get the wind of them, their ships being lighter and of better saile. By this meanes the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards then seemed more to incline to fight than before; &amp; to speake truth, that dayes fight was most fierce and bloudie. In the middest of the fight the English Admirall cried out aloud to Captaine <hi>George Semmer,</hi> saying, ô <hi>George</hi> what dost thou, wilt thou now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake me, or wilt thou deceiue my opinion of thy valour? which words did so inflame him, as hee assayled the enemie so furiously, as that day he woon greatest commendation. But the English ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing with all sorts of ordnance sought with them from morning, &amp; yet ceased not, the Spanyards did againe inclose themselues in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battaile, whereby their enemies perceyued that they one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sought meanes to defend themselues, and to goe to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed place nere to Dunkirke, there to joy<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne with the Duke of Parma, who vnder protection of those great vessels might execute his designe with more safety.

               <p>The English fleet in the meane time did dayly encrease &amp; grew strong by ships and men that came to it forth of all hauens, seeking to win honour, and to doe good seruice to their Countrie, among whom were diuers noble men, and others of great note, as the Earles of Oxford, Cumberland, &amp; Northumberland, of Knights, Sir <hi>Thomas Cecill, William Hatton, Walter Raleigh, Horacio Palauici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> Gentlemen, <hi>Henrie Brooke, Robert Carie, Charles Blunt, Ambrose Willoughbie, Henrie Nowell, Thomas Gerard, Robert Dudley, Edward Darcy, Arthur Gorges, Thomas Wood, William Haruey,</hi> &amp; many other noble gentlemen, so as they were in number some hundred saile, &amp; being come nere to Douer they were increased to an 120, which for the most part were too small to boord the Spanyards, except

               <p>The same day a Councell was held, wherein was resolued, That the English fleet should be diuided into foure squadrons, the one vnder my Lord Admirals conduct, the other vnder Sir <hi>Frauncis Drakes,</hi> the third vnder <hi>Hawkins,</hi> &amp; the fourth vnder Captaine <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biser.</hi> The Spanish ships in sayling kept a close order of 3 or 4 ships in ranke, not farre one from another, and the greater vessels enclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them.</p>

               <p>The English likewise ankored within Canon shot of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Lord <hi>Henrie Seymer</hi> brought his fleet of twentie vessels.</p>
               <p>Whilest the fleet lay there, the Duke of Medina sent aduertize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Parma,</hi> &amp; diuers Gentlemen went on shore to refresh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The Duke of Parma hauing intelligence that the fleet lay vpon the coast of England, made great hast to make one in person in that enterprise, resigning the gouernement generall of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to old Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi>: Himselfe went on Pilgrimage into Haynault to our Ladie of Halles, and from thence returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bruges, where hee arriued on the seuenth of August.

               <p>On Tewsday the ninth of August about noone, he came to Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirke, euen when the fleet was alreadie past, none of his Ships da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to goe forth to giue them the least hope of aide, because they were afraid of the thirtie fiue Hollanders that lay in gard vnder the conduct of the Admirall <hi>Iustine</hi> of Nassau, which were excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prouided of good mariners, and beside the ordinarie souldiers, with 1200 braue musquetiers, and lay only there to keepe <hi>Parmas</hi> fleet from issuing out of the Hauen, which was a matter of greatest importance. As for the great ships, they feared them not, because the Sea was too shallow in those parts: Beside, all <hi>Parmas</hi> forces were not readie nor imbarked, onely 700 reuolted English vnder Sir <hi>William Stanleys</hi> commaund were shipt, and thought to get the aduantage by landing first in England: His other souldiers were male content and vnwilling, especially the mariners who were few in number, the prouision likewise of Beere, Bread and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals was not yet readie nor imbarked: The mariners were so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of the Hollanders as they ran away dayly, fearing least the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers would enforce them to doe that which they knew could not

be done. Then they wanted Gallies from Spaine, which might haue beaten the Hollanders from the coasts of Flaunders.</p>
               <p>The Spanish fleet lying thus at anker before Calice, the better to consult with the Duke of Parma concerning their enterprise, they concluded to execute their designe on Friday the twelfth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,<note place="margin">

                  </note>The same day, being the eight of August, as the Spanish fleet sell againe into order, it was again fiercely assailed by the English, right ouer against Graueling, where they voluntarily lost their aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the wind, chosing rather to let the wind driue them before Dunkirke, than to open themselues or change their order, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing onely on defence.</p>
               <p>Though the English had gallant tall ships, yet but 22 or 23 of them were comparable to the Spanish, which were ninetie. But the English had the aduantage by being lighter &amp; better of saile: so, as they came oftentimes within a pikes length of them and dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their whole tyre of ordnance vpon them, and then their smal shot, continuing it the whole day, till their powder and shot began to faile; and then, they held it no discretion to boord the Spaniards who still kept themselues together in close order, the English bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing satisfied with chasing them from before Calice and Dunkirke, and keeping them from joyning with the Duke of Parma.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards the same day, receiued much hurt, losing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men, and had diuers of their ships shot through: They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise with their ordnance plaid fiercely vpon the English, but did them no great hurt,<note place="margin">

                  </note> for they lost few men, and neuer a Shippe or man of note; and in all that time, and in the whole journey, they lost but an hundred men, and yet Sir <hi>Frauncis Drakes</hi> ship had beene shot aboue fourtie times, and his Cabbin twice shot through: And towards the end of the fight, a Gentlemans bed whereupon hee rested himselfe, beeing weatie, was taken from vnder him by a great shot: And as the Earle of Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Sir <hi>Charles Blunt,</hi> afterwards Lord <hi>Mountioy,</hi> and Master <hi>Henrie Nowell</hi> sat at meate, a demie Culuerins shot flew through the cabbin, and ouerthrew 2 men. The like accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in other ships which wold be tedious to recite, yet it appears that God did wonderfully assist the English: For as the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall wrote to the Queene, there was no likelihood that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish (in mans judgement) and according to the apparance of the circumstances should haue dared to approch the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, but that God had an admirable hand therein, vnto whom

they willingly ascribed all the honour of their magnanimitie and valor, for that he had confounded their enemies in their own deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and counsell.</p>
               <p>The same day, so many Spanish ships were shot through, as that night and the next day three of them sanke. Among others Captain <hi>Crosse</hi> fought with and sank a great Biscan ship, forth of which some few escaped, who reported that the chiefe in the ship flew one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because one among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spake of yeelding, who thereupon was slaine, and his death presently reuenged by his brother, and in the meane time the ship sunke vnder him.</p>
               <p>Two Gallions of Portugal of seuen or eight hundred tun a piece, were the same night forsaken by the fleet, <hi>viz</hi> the S. Philip, and S. Mathew, which had verie great leakes in them. In the S. Philip was D. <hi>Francisco de Toledo,</hi> brother to the Earle of Orgas, Campe master, or Colonell of 32 ensignes, with other Gentlemen, who sought to run a ground on the coasts of Flaunders, their masts being broken; but being not able to doe it, the chiefe of them escaped in a boat to Newport, and the ship was taken by the Flushingers.</p>
               <p>In the S.

This ship was none of the greatest, but most strong, for onely twentie shot of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit numbers that plaid vpon her, did pierce her. In the sight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Graueling it was shot, and receyued a leake, whereupon the Captaine sent word thereof to the Duke of Medina, who sent him a boat for himself &amp; some of the chief to escape, which for his own honor he refused: the same night she tooke in such abundance of water, as fiftie men did continually plie the pompe to keepe her from sincking, and finding her selfe forsaken of her Admirall the Captaine sought to runne her a ground vpon the coast of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and for sauing his owne life, craued the helpe of poore Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen. But being descried by foure or fiue men of warre that lay vpon the coast, they made towards him, haling him vp, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to yeeld, which hee refusing, they discharged all their ordnance vpon him, and slew aboue forty men, so as hee was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to yeeld himselfe prisoner to <hi>Peter Vander Does,</hi> who car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the sayd vessell and the other likewise into Zeland,<note place="margin">

               <p>An other lesser ship was likewise enforced to run a shore at the same time nere to Blanken burrow in Flaunders; but Sir <hi>Iohn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> gouernor of Ostend with those of his Garrison, seeing this ship, sent three fisher boats thither well manned, who perceyuing that the Spaniards were gone forth of her, &amp; that they had landed two pieces of ordnance, enforced the Spaniards to quit them, and pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the vessell, and carried it to Ostend.</p>
               <p>In this manner it pleased God not onely to shew vnto England, but likewise to Zeland, their enemies great vessels, to haue them see and confesse how weake they were against so great a power, had not he giuen them discretion and courage, and in sundrie manner fought for them.</p>

               <p>And vnderstanding that order was likewise taken in Scotland that small aide should be giuen them there, and that Norway could yeeld them but bad assistance; they tooke certaine fisher boats in Scotland, and carried away the men to serue them for pilots and

               <p>Of 30000 men, that were in the fleet, the greatest part of them were slaine or drowned, and most of those that returned home di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reason of the miseries they had indured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:14840:44"/>The Duke of Medina Sydonia being a braue Lord and well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, vpon whom they had imposed that burthen much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his will, laid the fault vpon his Pilots, and on want of the Duke of Parmas forces which were not readie.</p>
               <p>He was suffered to goe home to his own house, but not to come to Court, where it was thought he had much to doe to purge him selfe from the calumnious accusation of his enemies. Many other noble men died soone after, as D. <hi>Iuan Martines de Ricaldo,</hi> D. <hi>Diego de Valdez, Michel Oquendo,</hi> D. <hi>Alonso de Lieua,</hi> D. <hi>Diego de Maldona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> D. <hi>Francisco Bouadillo,</hi> D. <hi>Georgio Manriques,</hi> all of the Councell of warre. Diuers were drowned, as among other, <hi>Thomas Perenot</hi> of Granuell of Cauteroy, nephew to Cardinall <hi>Granuell.</hi> D. <hi>Diego Pimentel</hi> Campe-master, and Colonell of thirtie two Ensignes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned prisoner in Zeland, with diuers others, taken in the same ship. D. <hi>Pedro Valdez</hi> a man much respected in his Countrie was prisoner in England, with D. <hi>Vasco de Sylua,</hi> and D. <hi>Alonzo de Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as.</hi> Many Gentlemen were drowned in Ireland, and many slaine by the Irish. Sir <hi>Richard Bingham</hi> Gouernour of Conach, had receiued two hundred of them to mercie, but vnderstanding that a troope of 800 of them were landed and in armes, he thought it fit for his owne better safety to kill the 200, of whom some escaping, carried tidings to the 800 who were likewise going to craue mercie (as they sayd) but thereby despairing, they returned and made readie an old decayed, vessell in which they put to Sea, where they were all drowned, and many Gentlemen with them. Yet, D. <hi>Alonso de Luson,</hi> Colonel of thirtie two ensignes of the Tertios of Naples, with D. <hi>Rodrigo de Lasso,</hi> and two noble men of the house of Cordu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba were from thence sent into England, who were deliuered to Sir <hi>Horace Paluicin,</hi> by them to set the Lord <hi>Odet</hi> of Teligin at libertie, who had beene taken nere to Antuepe, and lay in prison in the Castle of Tournay. In a word, therere was no noble house in Spain, which in this fleet, lost not, either, a son, brother, or kinsman. There were aboue 1200 souldiers and mariners, prisoners in sundrie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in England, with 30 Gentlemen and commaunders, whom the Queene released for meane ransome.</p>
               <p>Those ships, which escaped from the English and Hollanders, and from the Irish rockes and tempests of the Ocean, being few in number, did after much labour, miserie and daunger, returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spaine, leauing behind them (as hath beene alreadie sayd) so
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:14840:45"/>
many ships of sundrie sorts, so many Lords of note, Gentlemen, braue souldiers, good mariners, and others, such store of ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and warlike munition, money, plate, jewels and other wealth, which if it should be seuerally reckoned, would amount to an incredible summe of money. But by how much this fleet was great, strong and potent, by so much more likewise was the victorie great, and greater occasions haue these two countries to be thankefull to that great and inuincible God, to honor and serue him all the dayes of their life, for preseruing and defending them from so great daunger. In this regard, the Queene of England and my Lords the States of the vnited Prouinces, did, whilest the fleet houered vpon their coasts appoint sundrie dayes of prayer and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, beseeching God to turne away so great &amp; imminent danger from them and their countrie, and not to looke vpon their sinnes which had deserued such a punishment, but to aide and assist them for the glorie of his name, and for or Iesus Christs sa
ke, seeing it was his owne cause, which the Pope and King of Spaine sought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminat. And because these praiers were made to Gods glorie, and in praise of his inuincible power, he therefore heard them, and graunted their requests.</p>
               <p>And a good while after the fleet was gone, namely vpon the 19 of Nouember, the Queene in England, and my Lords the States in the Low-countries, appointed a solemne day for thanksgiuing, which was spent in preaching, praying, and hearing the word of God.</p>
               <p>The Queene of England, for so great a deliuerance, made a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian triumph in the citie of London, and went with all the Lords and officers of her Kingdome in solemne manner vpon a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Charriot from her Palace to the Cathedrall Church of Saint <hi>Paule,</hi> where the Spanish ensignes and banners were hung vp. The citizens of London in their liueries stood on both sides the street as she passed along. Her maiestie and Lords, gaue thankes vnto God, and were present at a publike Sermon made in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, tending onely to thansgiuing and so with great acclamations of people that besought God to graunt her a long and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous life to his honour and ruyne of her enemies, shee returned in the same manner as she came.</p>
               <p>In this manner did this magnificent, great, and mightie Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, termed, the inuincible, and such an one as in many hundred of

               <p>BErghen-op-Zoom, is a Towne in the Duchie of Brabant, the first and chiefest of the 17 Prouinces in the Low-countries.</p>
               <p>In time past it was but a Seignorie, but in anno 1533 the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Charles</hi> the fist honoured it with the title of Marquisat.

It hath beene a Merchant Towne, not onely in our predecessors dayes, but there are yet some liuing that haue so knowne it in their time, whether, Spanyards, Frenchmen, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, English, and Scots, came to traffique.

The three other are opposit to it, <hi>viz.</hi> Flaunders, towards the South, Holland towards the North, and Zeland towards the West. It hath also a verie good Hauen, which diuides the South Countrie from that of the North (for so are both the countries named, scituate on each side of the Hauen) which lieth but 535 foot from the towne, where it turneth towards the West, and diuiding it selfe into two armes it openeth it selfe &amp; runneth into the towne. One of the Armes, towards the South, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth certaine water mils and salt pits, which now are within the town, &amp; that towards the North makes the towns Hauen, Berghen is in circuit 10175 foot beside the Bulwarks: There is a verie high earthen rampier, &amp; dikes round about it, it is likewise in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fortified with palisadoes, &amp; in other parts which hedges &amp; wals on top of the rampiers: there are also diuers new bulwarks made for the towns defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

               <p>The Marquis his court, is a great ornament to it.

               <p>After that all Brabant (Berghen-op-Zoom excepted) by the duke of Parmas conduct was reduced vnder the Spanish gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the troopes of his Excellencie and my Lords the States made diuers incursions into the countrie, especially then when the Duke of Parma had assembled all his forces at Dunkirke, there waiting for the Spanish fleet. Those of Brabant, Flaunders, and other prouinces vnder the kings obedience, seeing and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the defeat of the Spanish Armada, and feeling to the quicke the spoyle which the souldiers of Berghen daily made, protested against the Duke of Parma, and made complaint that all the townes of Brabant obeyed the King (Berghen-op-Zoom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) which was a verie nest of theeties and receptacle of ras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kals, from whence forces were daily sent to surprise poore tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers and merchants that brought prouision: that the same mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe did likewise often light vpon their Burghers, who were vndone by imprisonment and great ransomes: yet this might in some sort be tollerated, prouided, they might liue securely in their Townes; but Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet, if the Duke of Parma would bring his victorious Campe before Berghen, wherewith hee had woon so many Townes, the enemies joy conceiued by the retreat of the Spanish fleet vvould bee soone conuerted to sorrow: And, Berghen once taken a way, would then lie open to surprise the Islands of Zeland one after an other; at least Berghen and the Isle of Terthole might bee taken both at once. These vvere the Barbanders complaints. It is not to be doubted but that the Duke of Parma vvas much grieued
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:14840:46"/>
at the flight of the Spanish fleet, and for that he could not swallow England which he had alreadie deuoured in conceipt, as appeares by the preparation which he caried with him to Dunkirke, seruing rather to be carried away in triumph into England, than by force to surprise so mightie a kingdome. He was likewise badly beloued in the court of Spaine, for not assisting the fleet in necessitie. Now that he might in some sort wipe off this staine which blotted his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: he enterprised to reduce the towne of Berghen vnder his commaund. From that time, diuers reports thereof were cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, not onely in the Low-countries but also in England: whereof her Majestie aduertised my Lords the States by letters dated at Greenwich the seuen and twentieth of August 1588. At the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of September when there was no more hope of the fleets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, and that the Duke of Parma was come backe from Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into Brabant, all men held it for certaine that some attempt would be made vpon Berghen.</p>
               <p>Certaine horsemen of <hi>Bacx</hi> his companie, sent forth for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, brought backe with them two prisoners, who confidently reported that there was nothing more certaine, than that Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen should be besieged. One of the prisoners was a Gentleman, and an officer belonging to the ordnance; and the other was master of the munition: when our men tooke them nere to Eckeren castle, and askt them whether they were going, they answered that they went to the kings camp that lay before Berghen. Being brought to the towne, they assured vs that all things were in readinesse to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege vs: that before they were taken the armie was on the march, and that they verily thought to haue found it before the town, and wondered to find the contrarie: they likewise affirmed, that there were 36000 men horse and foot in <hi>Parmas</hi> campe.</p>
               <p>The 9 of the said moneth of August the lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> General of the English, came to Berghen, and had made Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> knight, gouernor of the towne. The next day they mustered, &amp; had in all 12 ensignes of foot, 9 of which lay in the towne &amp; the other 3 in the forts; besides 4 cornets of horse. The Dutch captaines were <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; <hi>Marcelis Bacx</hi> brethren, the English were commaunded by captain <hi>Parker</hi> &amp; captain <hi>Pooly</hi> who was cornet to my lord <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>: From Holland they receiued a certaine quantitie of powder. The Forts whereof we now spake, are vpon the hauen; which being too farre off from the townes defence, sundrie Forts were made
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:14840:47"/>
to secure it: For the hauens mouth lieth 532; foot from the towne: from S. <hi>Iames</hi> his gate, it extends 535 foot towards the North, and from thence falleth into the Scheld. In this turning stands the first, which is called the little Fort, because it is lesser than any of the rest. The other Fort lieth 3320 foot from the head, and is called Valkenbourg, by the first Captaines name that kept it: from thence ye goe to the North Fort, distant from the Houdt-port two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand nine hundred and sixtie foot.</p>
               <p>In Southland nere to Valkenbourg stands the new Fort, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely from Valkenbourg by the Dike, and this Fort lies open behind. By a conduit they can emptie the water of the Dike into the hauen, or keepe it in at their pleasure. From the new Fort they haue made a new dike as farre as the towne, which is commonly called the new hauen. Right ouer against the lesser Fort, the sluces of the hauen of Northland were opened to keepe the enemie from accesse to the North fort. The Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> went into Holland to my Lords the States to take order for al necessarie prouisions for the town: But before his departure, he conferred with the Magistrat, and appointed the towne to be diuided into eight quarters, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie quarter to be commanded by a sherife, to ouersee the Burgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and to looke that they laboured in the fortifying of those parts of the towne that were weakest.</p>
               <p>The Burgomasters for that yeare were <hi>Frauncis Manteau,</hi> and <hi>Peter Suidlants</hi>: the Sherifes were, <hi>William Frauncis</hi> the old Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomaster, <hi>Cornelius Iohn, Cornelius Denis, Marke Martin, Adrian Iohn, Iohn Clarke,</hi> and <hi>Cornelius</hi> of Heusden. The receiuers were, <hi>Marin Nicholas</hi> the old Burgomaster, &amp; <hi>Nicholas de Ranst.</hi> When the sherifs vpon important businesse could not ouersee the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then some of the chiefe Burghers of euerie quarter supplied their places.</p>
               <p>Foure dayes after the Lord <hi>Willoughbies</hi> departure, the Burghers began at S. <hi>Iames</hi> his gate, as ye go from the head to the new worke, making first a trench vpon the bank or causey which leads from the same gate to the new hauen. All along the hedge, which is planted from the powder tower to the woodden gate, fortifications were likewise made in manner of trenches, they did also labor verie dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, in other places. On the high way from Wouwe, some of the enemies horse were descried, wherupon, the sentinel on the watch tower, rang the alarm bell. Sir <hi>William Drury</hi> the gouernour made
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:14840:47"/>
a sallie, and caused the enemie to retire. All the horse troopes in the towne followed the gouernour, who with those forces that sailled with him pursued the enemie euen to Wouwe: part of the horse and foot, made a stand at the entring of the heath of Wouwe, and the Downes of Berghen. In the meane time the gouernour retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hauing lost one of his horsemen and two horse; for he went as farre as the Churchyard of Wouwe, where he skirmished with many of the enemies. Diuers condemned this his attempt, saying, that he had greatly endaungered himselfe and the towne, by his too greedie desire of fight: For the enemie was superiour to him in strength, and he had too farre engaged himselfe to returne with safetie to the towne, if the enemie should haue assailed him. Retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from this sallie, he caused the bridge at the Bulwarke of Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stede to be broken down: for they that had vndertaken the works, had made a bridge ouer the dike, to fetch earth from the hill of Varij-Bogaert to make an end of their worke.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cornelius Iohn,</hi> the cities sherife, sent messengers from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaltie of the towne, into Zeland, to aduertize my Lords the States, that the enemie threatned to besiege the towne of Berghen, and to that end lay with his campe at Wouwe, and that the towne was badly prouided of necessaries for maintenance of a siege, and that therefore, the magistrats of Berghen besought them of aid and assistance in their necessitie, as their neighbours and confederats; that the cause was common, for if Berghen should bee lost the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slands of Zeland would bee mightily endaungered. The next day (which was the 14) a boat came from Zeland loden with plankes and other necessaries.</p>
               <p>And because the States of Holland, Zeland, &amp; those of the town of Dort, did, during the siege, carefully send prouision of all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries to the towne: In that regard I will truly say, that it was wel prouided of corne, butter, cheese, salt, herring, salt fish, hay, straw, oates, powder, plankes, nayles, lead, bullets, match, pike, ozier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twigs to make gabions &amp;c. The Zelanders sent fiue Culuerins of Portugal, each of them carrying a bullet of 26 pound weight; they were of those which <hi>Peter Vander Does</hi> Vice-Admirall of Holland found in the Gallion of D. <hi>Diego Pimentell,</hi> which he tooke nere to Blankenberg, and brought to Flushing. The enemies horse shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues againe on the high way of Wouwe were soone put to flight by our men, because their number was not great. About
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:14840:48"/>
the same time diuers fires were seene betwixt Rosendael, &amp; Calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout, made by such as went from Calmthout towards Steenber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen to assemble all their forces to go and inuade the land of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Montigni at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to enter the land of Tertholen.</hi>
                  </note> as it afterwards appeared: For, the night before the 17 of September, great numbers of the enemie vnder the conduct of the Lord of Montigni, went along the bank called Matreben to a place called Eendrecht, meaning to surprise the Island. All the causey of Tertholen, especially where the water is so low as the riuer may be crossed, is fortified with a trench, and forts well mand with sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, are made in many needfull places. The Count of Solms was gouernour of the Island: There where the enemie thought to passe is a large extent of ground, where on Tertholens side are 3 forts, the one Southward towards Tholen, called the Botshoost, that in the middest is called Papen-mutse, or priests cap, because it is square, and the third stretching Northward, is stiled the new Weer, or passage. The water being low, certaine ensignes attempted to passe ouer to the Fort of Papen-mutse: But the water was not so shallow as they imagined, and the current was verie strong, so that diuers of them were drowned and slaine by our mens shot: some of them notwithstanding passed ouer, and being protected by the banke, made signes to their fellowes to come ouer. But all this beeing to no purpose, because the rest of them fled away, they were enforced to take the water where they were all drowned. And as those which were in the water striued to passe ouer, their fellowes who stood vpon the causey on Brabant side, shot furiously vpon those of the Island, yet they slew but one of our men, which was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon soldier of <hi>Berchens</hi> companie, but the enemie lost 200 men. When the enemie first offered to passe ouer, there were scarce for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of our men to oppose them, but within a while after, Captaine <hi>Lagro</hi> of Tholen came thither with his companie. And though those of the Island had fortunatly repelled the enemie, yet they thought not themselues free from daunger, knowing that he had not idlely made that attempt, but that he intended to surprise the Isle of Tholen, thereby to molest those of Berghen, together with all Zeland, assuring themselues that it would not bee long ere he returned againe, and perhaps the next night following. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they wanted men, to furnish all places, they requested those of Berghen to send <hi>Adrian Guillaume,</hi> and <hi>George Brissaulx</hi> with three hundred men vnder their commaund to them. This <hi>Adrian
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14840:48"/>
Guillaume</hi> had in the first wars of Zeland beene Admirall of Zieri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>czee, and was then Lieutenant General to Count Solms, ouer al the forces of Zeland: <hi>Brissaulx</hi> was son to <hi>Iames Brissaulx,</hi> a verie good &amp; religious man, who in former time had bin Burgomaster of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. These two were sent from the States of Zeland to Berghen, so soone as they vnderstood that the enemie meant to march towards the Towne.</p>
               <p>The nineteenth of September the Drossart returned from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam where he had bought great store of planks and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries fit for fortification:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>An officer, so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for which we in English can giue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name.</hi>
                  </note> For besides his place of Drossart (which next to the Marquis is the highest degree in Berghen) the fortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the towne and sorts was committed to him. His name was <hi>Elias Lion,</hi> sonne to Doctor <hi>Albert Lion,</hi> a verie learned man, who for the space of foure and twentie yeares, had beene chiefe profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor of the ciuile law at Louayne, and was at that time Chauncellor of Guelderland, and chiefe Counsellor to my Lords the generall States of the vnited Prouinces. The night following, being the 20 of September, the enemie came to Raberch, and about noone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Wouwe: Nothing at that time was done on either side, for it rayned all that night, and likewise at noone after the enemies departure. The Magistrats sent certaine commissioners into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Zeland to my Lords the States, to acquaint them with the state of the Towne, and to craue aid. <hi>Cornelius Iohn,</hi> the Townes sherife, went to Zeland, and <hi>Adrian Guillaume,</hi> the Secretarie, into Holland. The two and twentieth of the said moneth, by day break, there was an alarme, the trumpets sounded, drums were beaten, and the alarme bell was rung: For the gouernour had assembled a troope of souldiers to reenforce the morning gard, because the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was wont to make his attempts about that time when the gard is most drowsie; wherewith hee had not acquainted the horsemen who had the gard vpon the market place. Some of them going through the streets, met with these souldiers, and demanded who they were, and whether they went, but one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them giuing a discourteous aunswer, they returned to their officers acquainting them therewith: they not knowing the matter, and thinking all was not well, did presently giue the alarm. The gouernor tooke this in bad part, and complained to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the wrong done vnto him therein, seeing his soldiers were assembled by his commaundement. The Captaines of the horse
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14840:49"/>
answered they were ignorant that it was done by his commaund, and that they ought to haue beene made acquainted therewith, in regard of the state of the Towne: Thereupon proclamation was made, that none should dare to ring the alarme bell without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse charge from the gouernour.</p>
               <p>The next day, the souldiers spoiled Generall <hi>Fremins</hi> baggage: He, had beene gouernour of Wouwe Castle, and about a certaine quarrell that arose betwixt him and a Merchant of the same Castle, came into Holland to complaine to my Lords the States, to haue him cassierd, and likewise to make prouision of all necessaries for keeping of the sayd Fort. The States had giuen him great store of musket and faulconet bullets, match and barrels of powder. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the said <hi>Fremins</hi> returne, the Merchant had alreadie driuen all those sorth of the Castle which tooke <hi>Fremins</hi> part, and had secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made an accord with the enemie. Within a while after, about the seuenteenth of Ianuarie 1589, he sold the castle to the enemie for 20000 crownes, and himselfe retired into Fraunce. Vntill then, <hi>Fremin</hi> had carefully kept all these things: But as he was readie to depart and had shipt all, the souldiers who had an inckling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, thinking they had found a just cause of excuse (because it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law of Armes to carrie away such things forth of townes besieged) seised on all the munition, together with his owne goods and made bootie of it, beeing neuerthelesse enforced to restore backe the greatest and best part thereof. The next day after, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was discouered vpon the highway from Wouwe, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching directly towards the towne. Our horse and foot made a sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie vpon him: but as they approched the Downes of Berghen, the enemie turned vpon the right hand and went along the sandie way towards Riselberg and Nortgeest, where he incamped. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the water of the channell, which some did improperly terme the riuer of Zoom, was kept in by the sluces of the womens gate and that of Steenberghen, all the fields betwixt Wouwes gate, and that of the women were drowned, so as none could goe from Wouwes gate to the North quarter. Our men returned againe to the towne, and fallied sorth at Steenberghen gate with displayed ensignes, alluring the enemie to fight, who had enclosed himselfe in his campe.</p>
               <p>The morrow after, he encamped towards the South, extending his camp from S. <hi>Gertrudes</hi> hill as farre as the vale, therein compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14840:49"/>
Burghvliet, Zudgeest, the Raberg, and part of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghens wood, which lies Eastward from the towne. The Raberg is so termed, because that Rat in the Dutch tongue signifieth a wheele whereon malefactors are broken and executed; and vpon that hill execution was commonly done. The enemie within a day or two alter his arriuall, burnt the gallowes vpon the hil, Southward from the towne, as yee goe towards Antuerpe. S. <hi>Gertrude</hi> is worshipt by superstitious people, because (as they say) she preserues them from rats and mice. In former times she was patronesse of the town, and it is said, that she was Ladie of the whole countrie of Berghen: Her chappell, which in time past stood vpon the hill nere to the drowned countrie of Southland, gaue it that name. The vale is part of the arable grounds which lie betwixt the wood, towne and champaine countrie, extending it selfe, partly towards the West, and in part towards Wouwes gate: The Southgeest is an high place, and Burghvliet was a village, where a castle stood which was burnt by the French (as hath been said.) Those of Tholen had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thirtie men in the castle of Halteten, which tooke it name from the village, not that they thought them strong enough to resist the enemie, but onely to serue for Sentinels to those of the Island, and to giue them notice of the enemies approch. The souldiers, being threatned by the enemie, yeelded vp the castle on safety of their liues and goods. The same day, two horsemen were slaine with the canon from Reigers-tower: one of them was a man of note, and was afterwards buried at Antuerpe with 800 torches.</p>
               <p>About the same time we receiued supplies from all parts. My Lords the States, notwithstanding that the Isle of Tholen was to be prouided for, sent vs great numbers of Hollanders and Scots Those of Flushing, Briell, and Ostend, sent vs store of choice soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers. There came likewise fourescore men from Gertrudenbergh, conducted by an English captain called <hi>Brock</hi>: these men had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken the States pay, and serued among the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Besides all this, sixe ensignes of foot came to vs from England, about the first of Nouember. So that the number of soldiers which at the beginning of the siege were in all, both horse and foot, but one thousand fiue hundred, as appeared by the muster rolls, did before the enemies departure amount to fiue thousand. The Captaines of the horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men perceiuing the enemie to be encamped, thought it necessarie to make some sallie forth vpon him whilest they might doe it, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:14840:50"/>
the gouernor, Sir <hi>William Drurie,</hi> that it behoued them, now at first, to giue the enemie some affront, and that it would greatly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them, if they should not make some proofe of their valour. But others, of a contrarie opinion, sayd, that euerie victorie was vncertaine: and that if they should chance to be vanquished by the enemie, it would greatly endaunger the Towne: and that if them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues should ouercome, the enemie might easily beare that losse: that they had to doe with a mightie and victorious enemie: that it was true that sallies are commonly thought prejudicious to the besieged, but it was only in such places where the enemies were few in number, and where the besiege might in such sort be shut in by the enemie, as he could not easily receiue new supplies: but our numbers were great enough, and we might daily receiue fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from the vnited Prouinces, by meanes of the commodious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of our hauen. Captaine <hi>Paule Bacx</hi> made answere, We like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, are not ignorant (quoth he) how it behoues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vs to deale wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly therein: we know verie well that the enemie hath a mightie and victorious campe, and many men; we likewise haue often made triall what souldiers they are. But if it shall not please the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to graunt the demaunds of the Captaines of the horse, for my part, let this mightie and victorious enemie make his approches, and at last (for I will vse his owne words) come and draw vs by the eares one by one forth of the towne into his campe. This speech being not allowed of by many, he went his way without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther talke. But the gouernour called him backe, together with the rest that were there present, and said, seeing your request tends to the good and preseruation of the Towne, I will no longer denie it. Then euerie man went and armed himselfe, no drum was beaten nor trumpet sounded, to call the troopes together, but each man gaue notice to his fellow, of the sallie, and forthwith, at the houre appointed, they were all readie together. A Gentleman of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, whose name was <hi>Vchtenbreck,</hi> cornet to captaine <hi>Paule Bacx,</hi> was sent forth to draw the enemie into the field betwixt the camp &amp; towne, he was seconded by 14 or 15 harquebuziers, who went alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether towards the campe. Nere to the towne dikes there is a low way which stretcheth from Steenberghen gate as far as Helst point, and it is ouerlookt by the hill of Varigobart, which ends nere to this point, and there makes a vallie. The Lanciers went this way towards the sayd vallie, holding downe their lances, keeping them

from the enemies sight who was encamped on the Rijsselberg, and Northgeest.<note place="margin">

The musketiers were beaten from their shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and were enforced to quit their armes, and to craue that they might be taken prisoners: many of them were slaine, and many ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, for they were so encompassed by our men, as they could not escape.<note place="margin">

                  </note> The enemie taking pitie on his people, sent three cornets of horse to rescue them, who were soone put to rout by the two brethren <hi>Bacx</hi> that led the vantgard, and enforced to retire to Rijs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selberg, from whence they saw their musketiers slain and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners. During the fight certain prisoners were sent into the towne, among whom was a young gentleman, Nephew to that <hi>Groesbeke</hi> who in former time had beene bishop of Liege, surnamed <hi>Amste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode,</hi> and was Lieutenant generall to a Regiment of Almans, who had receiued a great wound in the face. Our men determined to returne backe to the towne so soone as they should haue executed some notable enterprise vpon the enemie, not meaning to tarrie till the whole force of the campe shold fall vpon them, being too weak to resist; and to speake truely, they had woon honour enough and might freely haue returned with their prisoners in triumph: which they had done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but for captain <hi>Parkers</hi> couragious resolution, who could not be satisfied with the flight of the enemies horse, which at their ease beheld the vsage of their owne men; so as charging them in a place where they had great aduantage, he repulsed them once or twice; but as himselfe was likewise constrained to retreat to the hil, where the enemie stood, to driue them thence, where the whole campe was by this time in armes, and the enemies cauallerie recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both new aid, and courage, making a fierce charge vpon him, he and his troope were in danger either to haue bin oppressed with
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:14840:51"/>
multitude, or to haue been taken prisoners: thrice did the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie lay hold on <hi>Parker,</hi> and thrice did he free himselfe from them, and brauely defended himselfe with his sword. The brethren <hi>Bacx,</hi> and captaine <hi>Poolie,</hi> perceiuing the daunger wherein captaine <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> was, and being spurd forward by a desire of honour, galoped into the thickest throng of the enemies, making more account of the preseruation of so braue a souldier, than of any gaine, bootie, or prisoners: so that seuentie prisoners who had been taken at the beginning of the fight, and were not yet carried into the towne, were in all hast slayne, yet some escaped. The arriuall of our men opened <hi>Parker</hi> a large way to escape from the enemie: whilest they were busied in fight, the Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> and the Generall <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> came from Holland, who without entring into any house sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied forth with great numbers of foot to reskew the horse, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had brauely executed their enterprise, returned towards the towne in good order, being pursued by the enemies who were extreamely grieued that <hi>Parker</hi> escaped from them. <hi>Parker</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued certaine musket shot on his armour, but was not hurt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was of proofe. Where the heat of the fight had been, great heapes of dead men and horse lay. Of our horsemen some foure or fiue were slaine, but many were hurt, and the losse of horse was great. It is reported that two hundred of the enemie were slayne. This was done on the fiue &amp; twentieth of September after dinner. Whilest the horsemen fought with the enemie, the masons broke downe a certaine wall of the remainder of the Abbie, because the enemie should not make vse of it against the towne. Presently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this fight the enemie shortned and tooke in his campe, which he had at first much amplified and enlarged, &amp; forsooke the high Northgeest, strongly fortifying and entrenching himselfe both to the South and Northward of the towne to defend himselfe from our sallies: for he expected no such dealing, and neuer thought that there had bin so great courage and valor in those of the town.</p>
               <p>Towards euening the Drossart, Burgomasters &amp; sherifs assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled themselues, with whom joyned the captaines, <hi>Vere, Scot, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skeruile,</hi> &amp; <hi>Salisburie</hi> to consult together what was necessarie for the preseruation of the town. And euer after, they obserued this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that the gouernour and chiefe of the Councell of war, did once a day meet at the state house, to conferre of matters concerning the present estate of the town, which was a matter verie commendable,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:14840:51"/>
especially in a town besieged. For by this means all difficulties were at first easily remoued that did arise at such a time betwixt the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Burghers, when any thing is done by mischaunce on one part or other to the prejudice of either.</p>
               <p>Euer since then, the Magistrat, to shew his diligence, did daily meet twice, namely, at eight of the clocke in the morning, and two of the clocke after noone.</p>
               <p>The lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> requested the magistrat that the Burghers might arme, &amp; keep <hi>Corps du gard</hi> in the streets; and the matter was brought so far forward, as captaines &amp; officers were chosen: but by reason diuers excused the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues through want of armor, which the mutinous French had taken from them in former time, nothing ensued thereof.</p>
               <p>On the 28 of this moneth, Sir <hi>Tho Morgan,</hi> who had bin gouernor of the town, returned from England. The Queen and my lords the states had sent him to be gouernor in Sir <hi>William Druries</hi> place. The states had a while before, sent <hi>Lancelot Parisijs</hi> commistarie of the musters, enjoining him to tel the Councel of war &amp; magistrats, that it had pleased her Ma. to write vnto them of late, as likewise to the lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Queene of England makes Morgan gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of Berghen.</hi>
                  </note> that it was her expresse wil &amp; pleasure that <hi>Morgan</hi> shold be gouernor; and to this end they likewise sent her Ma. let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by the said <hi>Lancelot</hi>: And in this respect they wold herein doe nothing contrary to her Ma. command. The contents of whose let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was, that hauing intelligence how the Duke of Parma had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to besiege Berghen-op-Zoom; in that regard she thought it fit to giue the gouernement of the town to Sir <hi>Thom. Morgan,</hi> the better to assure it against the enemies power, and that her pleasure was to haue him forthwith installed in <hi>Druries</hi> stead, who had lately bin reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended to her by the states, not that she in any sfsort doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Druries</hi> loyaltie and valour, but <hi>Morgans</hi> long experience in war, together with the peoples loue towards him, had caused that alteration. The cause why the Queene spake thus of the peoples loue towards <hi>Morgan,</hi> and the recommending of him to my lords the states, was, because my lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> did not greatly affect <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.</hi> Sir <hi>Thom.</hi> perceiuing this, &amp; that he could not build vpon <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughbies</hi> fauor for the gouernement of Berghen, &amp; that there were diuers that sued for it, found means to get the fauor of the magistrats and Burghers, by whose means he obtained letters of recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her Ma. both from the states, and comminalty of Berghen.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:14840:52"/>
The Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> in the meane time had by sundrie practises established <hi>Drurie</hi> in the gouernement; but because it was done without the States consent, they therefore wrote vnto the Queene, that no opposition might be made against her highnesse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. After <hi>Morgans</hi> arriuall, sundrie quarrels arose, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, betwixt the two Gouernours, but among the Captaines and souldiers.</p>
               <p>The English held more with <hi>Drurie</hi> than <hi>Morgan,</hi> the Low-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie men and Scots tooke <hi>Morgans</hi> part: <hi>Willoughby</hi> fauoured <hi>Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> against <hi>Morgan</hi>; and therefore he gaue the gouernement of the towne to <hi>Morgan,</hi> but made <hi>Drurie</hi> captaine of the Forts, saying he did so, because her Majestie spake onely of the towne and not of the Forts. <hi>Morgan</hi> on the contrarie maintained it to be a verie absurd matter, because the towne and forts depended one vpon an other, and neuer had different gouernours.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Solms</hi> and Generall <hi>Villers</hi> came opportunely from Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land whilest the gouernors contested about the gouernement, and exhorted them to peace and concord. Yet, for all that, <hi>Drurie</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded the Forts of the Hauen, and <hi>Morgan</hi> the Towne. Those of <hi>Druries</hi> faction were likewise placed in the Forts. <hi>Drurie</hi> came not often into the towne, and spake seldome to <hi>Morgan,</hi> but there was still some quarrell or other; he did also highly complaine of the Magistrats and my Lords the States: who were much displeased with this discord, especially because their authoritie and command was directly contemned: euery man feared that some inconuenience would ensue.</p>
               <p>The nine and twentieth of this moneth, the imposition vpon wine &amp; beere was let to ferme, which was payed during the siege as in time before. The next day, <hi>Willoughby</hi> made an other sallie vpon the North side of the Campe, and though he vsed the same order and meanes as at the first sallie, yet he did no great matter; for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie behaued himselfe more wisely, and would no more be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised from behind the hill of Varibogart as at first: the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kept within the trenches of their Campe, or behind the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes not farre off, and did no more assaile our men as before. Our footmen stood in battaile vvithin musquet shot of the Towne, yet the Cauallery incountred one an other, and the fight was sharp on both sides, our men gaue a braue charge, and the enemie made gallant resistance; each did their best. <hi>Poolies</hi> horse who
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:14840:52"/>
vvas Cornet to the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> was slayne vnder him, and was presently remounted to reuenge his losse. In the skirmish, <hi>Marcelis Bacx</hi> encountred a certaine Albanois, whom after hee had thrust through with his sword, he tooke by head and shoulders, &amp; drew him and his horse by force forth of the enemies throng, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his resistance, and carried him away prisoner. After he had done this noble deed, his horse fell down dead vnder him, for he was shot through on both sides: the ordnance, on the bulwarke of the Friers Minors and on Steenberghen gate, plaid furiously vpon the enemie, carrying away both men and horse into the ayre. Yet this could not discourage the enemie, who was superiour to vs in number, and this fight seemed a combat for honour and not for life, so doubtfull and vncertaine was the euent thereof, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till night and darkenesse separated them.</p>
               <p>The Captaines, Lieutenants, Cornets, Quartermasters, Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and common souldiers had receiued sundrie shot vpon their armour, yet verie few of them were hurt, the greatest losse was in horse: how it went on the enemies side I know not.</p>
               <p>Those which lay towards the South did, on the 1 day of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, begin to draw their trenches from the Ball as far as the Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Two daies after, a certain Spaniard came &amp; yeelded himselfe; he had slaine 1 of his fellowes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The strength of Parmas Campe.</hi>
                  </note> &amp; for that cause came to our side. Being questioned concerning the state of the camp, he said that there were 30000 men in it, that they had already brought 6 canon with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; did daily expect 50 more: that the enemie determined to make his batterie towards the water mill, &amp; so confirmed the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon report how that 60 pieces of ordnance were comming to the campe. This Spaniard was sent to prince <hi>Maurice</hi> and the States. And because the rampier, next the water mill, was too weake to resist the Canon they fortified it and made it thicker. To this end the Magistrat sent the Burgomaster <hi>Suydland</hi> into Zeland, to the States to craue some helpe towards the fortifications, because in many places, the towne was verie weake, and vnprouided of money, workemen, and other necessaries, the enemie daily more and more enuironing it, &amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his best to win it.</p>
               <p>The second day, after the Burgomasters departure, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie made a Fort there vvhere the Hospitall had stood, which was within Harquebuze shot of the towne. Then euerie man assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe that the enemie would there likewise make a batterie.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:14840:53"/>
vpon the high way toward Calmthout great numbers of Carts and wagons were discerned, which the horse could hardly draw, so as they came but slowly on to the towne-ward. The Burghers and souldiers thought them to be the other canons which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard talked of; so as the Burghers began to fortifie betwixt the gate of Wouwe and that of the Nuns, that the rampier might be free from the enemies smal shot. They likewise brake down the wals of Wouwe gate which were too high, that they might do no hurt when the enemie should play vpon them with his canon. A way was likewise made athwart the gardens at the foot of the rampi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that the caual lerie might lie safe, if the enemie should batter the towne. But it was farre from the enemies meaning to make any bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; for those carts and waggons had brought no ordnance, but onely boats, hauing some other designe, as the euent declared. The morrow after, which was the seuenth of October, fiftie two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of foot came on the North side of the campe, commaunded by Count <hi>Egmont,</hi> these companies encamped on the lower part of the Northgeest.</p>
               <p>There is a causie on Northland nere to Benmoer, called Eester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike, because certaine trees called Eesters had beene planted there. This causie looseth it name nere to Dryanneland. It beginneth at the nether end of the Northgeest, and extends it selfe towards Northlands causie as far as the Sea, and diuides first the land from Benmoer, and next, the countrie of Dryanneland from North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; in that manner making three wayes, as farre as the Sea-dike.</p>
               <p>My Lords the States had alreadie of a long time pierced the sayd causie of Dryanneland, hoping that the water would enter into it, by the Geux Gullet or hole, and that entring into Northland nere to Bariebas, and so together through the Gullet of Dryannelands causie, the water would make a great breach, and thereby take all meanes from the enemie to come vpon Northlands causie. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was often seene vpon that of Dryanneland, making good obseruations of all things. Our men presently suspected the truth of the matter; how that they intended to make a bridge ouer that Gullet, thereby to come vpon Northland causie, which done, they might then keepe our vessels forth of the hauen. Much speech was made of this causie: some were of opinion to leuell and make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; others said it was necessarie to build a fort there where the causies did meet, and for the effecting thereof, had conference with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:14840:53"/>
Count <hi>Solms.</hi> Now because the first wold haue bin too great &amp; cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a labor without any profit at all (for if the causie had bin leuelled and made plain it would haue stood the enemie in better stead than before) and that the second was not without danger, because the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was so nere that place, neither the one nor other was done. The next night after, the enemie himselfe seazed on that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, placing two great shallops in the Gullet, with which he passed ouer his souldiers, and within a while after, he made a bridge there. At the same time likewise, hee seazed on the causie of Matteberg, whereof we haue heretofore spoken in mentioning the enemies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise vpon the Isle of Tholen. Vpon that causie he planted his canon, and thereby tooke all meanes from those of Tholen of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Holland.</p>
               <p>In the gullet of Tholen, the causie was likewise pierced through in 2 places, &amp; there they had also built a fort, called the Gueux hole.</p>
               <p>Opposit to the gullet of Tholen, lay certaine boats of war, which the enemies canon enforced to ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eat. Right ouer against Barlabas, lay the Admiral of Zeland with an other man of war. So soone as it was day, the vice-Admiral, <hi>George More,</hi> discharged two or three ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons: after some shot made these two ships were enforced to retire to Romerswael, being shot through in diuers places, not without losse of some souldiers and mariners. As our boats went forth of the Hauen, some towards Holland, others to Zeland, they were likewise saluted by the enemies canon. The first that went forth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding it receiued certaine shot, went forward on her jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, the two last returned backe, one of which was shot through, in which a Burghers wife with her child in her lap was slaine, and two other women hurt. These, fearing the enemie, were flying into Holland and Zeland. For at the beginning of the siege somewere so terrified, as they thought their onely preseruation to consist in getting forth of the towne. This feare was not lessened, when the people saw the verie captains send away their wiues, children, and goods. Some of those, who receiued no pay, nor were vnder any command, liuing only by bootie, in all impious and voluptuous pleasures, did in troopes forsake the towne, and spared for no cost, so they might be gone.</p>
               <p>Toward the euening, a boat came from Holland, whereat the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie made sundrie shot, yet but one soldier was slaine, who stood at the Helme.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:14840:54"/>The horsemen made complaint that they wanted hey &amp; prouen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for their horse, but that want was soone supplied from Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>About the same time, the souldiers of Geertrudenberg tooke certaine ships laden with Delfts beere, cheese, butter, herring, and oyle, which they brought into our hauen. These boats were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenced by my Lords the States to goe to Antuerpe and Breda. The merchants were imprisoned at Geertrudenberg, and the souldiers hung vp their passeport vpon the gallowes. Our men would haue imitated them, and tooke certaine boats; but my Lords the States, commanded them to desist. The goods were restored to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, by the States commandement, presently after the enemies departure; and they sent supplies of horse and foot to those of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, which were landen at Venusdam, opposit to Romerswael.</p>
               <p>The enemie doing his best to take the Hauen from those of the Towne, the townes-men in like manner did their vttermost to keepe it, and made sundrie new workes, the first vpon the North causie some sixe hundred foot from the North Fort, called the Priests cap, extending it selfe towards the Towne. On the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens banke, nere to Helst, they made a trench. The fort called Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uast, was begun the foureteenth of October: vpon the Northland causie is a place called Barlabas, one thousand one hundred &amp; fiue foot from the North fort, where the causie was pierced through in two seuerall places. These two holes hindred the enemie from bringing his canon to batter the North fort. Our men fearing that the enemie in the end would doe that there, which hee had done at the causie of Dryanneland, did themselues make good the place, &amp; built a fort there, which the people called Stauast, because they were to stay there to free the Hauen from the enemie: and for the sooner building of it, they tooke away the Burghers fagots, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially from bakers and potters.</p>
               <p>And because the sandie bank of Romerswael stretched as farre as our Hauen, and that it was verie daungerous for such boats as would at that place enter into it, because they were to hold on their course too nere the enemies Canon; to preuent this, the shippers or saylers tooke an other way behind Romerswael, and so by the South entred the hauen, where was lesse danger: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the sandie banke, &amp; the causie where the enemie had planted his canon, the Scheld runs, so as the boats could not auoid the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:14840:54"/>
canon, which lay within 2000 foot of the fort of Stauast, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof, they could bring their canon no nearer the hauens mouth; for notwithstanding he discharged his ordnance vpon the boats which entred the Hauen, yet could he neuer touch any of them; which was a manifest worke of God.</p>
               <p>Nere to the gullet of Tholen, lies a drownd land called Broeloose, the which confines vpon the causie called Steendijke. There did the States of Zeland make a new hauen, verie nere to the causie of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len opposit to Molsgat (a Fort so named) on the riuer of Eendrecht. By this meanes the Isle was fortified, and a commodious passage found to goe to Tholen: for the Gullet of Tholen was verie dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous because of the enemies canon, who since that time had small vse for his ordnance.</p>
               <p>Eight horsemen of <hi>Bacx</hi> his companie,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eight of Bacx his horsemen take three cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines prisoners</hi>
                  </note> embarked themselues on the 13 of October to go towards Lillo, landing in a certaine place, where they tooke their way as though they had come from Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerpe; by which deuise they tooke 3 of the enemies captaines with their baggage, who came from Antuerpe towards the campe, and with their bootie returned to their boat.</p>
               <p>The strife betwixt <hi>Morgan</hi> and <hi>Drurie</hi> was not yet ended. Vpon the 14 of October, at night, prince <hi>Maurice</hi> &amp; General <hi>Villers</hi> came to Berghen. The Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> had threatned to imprison <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> and great harme was likely to ensue about this contention. But his Excellencies arriuall pacified the matter after this manner; That <hi>Willoughbie</hi> so long as hee remayned in the Towne, should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund all men as her Majesties Lieutenant, and in his absence, <hi>Morgan,</hi> and that <hi>Drurie</hi> should get him gone, who neuerthelesse remayned there till the end of the siege It was reported that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie had an intent to seaze on the remainder of the causie of Southland by passing through the drownd lands at a low water, thereby to keepe boats from entring the hauen at that place. And nere to Burghvliet, the footsteps of those who had beene sent by night to view the place, were discerned.</p>
               <p>Gabions and three piece of ordnance were planted vpon the head, the greatest of which carried a bullet of 44 pound, and the other two of sixteene pound. The canons in euerie Fort did likewise play vpon the enemie, when any boat arriued. The causie whereon the enemie lay was by the continuall raine and souldiers treading become so deepe and slipperie, as they could hardly stand vpon it.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:14840:55"/>
They had neither plankes nor straw, and the souldiers were enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to stand in the raine in the trenches without any shelter vp to the knees in water. There was daily great tempests of wind and raine, and it seemed though the enemie besieged Berghen that they themselues were besieged by raine, wind, and sundrie other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous discommodities. Those of the towne began to leuell the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie of Southland, but perceiuing their labour to be vaine, they gaue ouer that resolution. At the causies end was a verie broad dike; all men thought it fit there to build a Fort, because that nere to the said dike there was a great piece of ground which was commonly drie, so as the same dike might serue to defend the Fort against the enemie; the Scheld likewise is not verie broad in that place, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great dike opposit to Southland, where in former time the toll house of Zeland stood. There, diuers men of warre lay at anker; but if the enemie with his Shalops had brought his ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanceto the Southland causie, he might easily haue driuen them thence, as hee had done before Barlabas, and the Gullet of Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>George More</hi> Vice-Admirall of Zeland, hauing viewed the place, said as much: they onely wanted workemen. <hi>Willoughby</hi> would haue had the Burghers to make the Fort; but they tired with labour and trauaile, and afraid of the enemie, who lay not farre from thence on the firme land, refused to doe it, saying that he did them wrong to cause them to labour so farre from the towne, and in daunger of the enemie: For this dike was distant three thousand one hundred and thirtie foot from Valckenbourg, and Valckenbourg foure thousand foot from the towne, which together, amount to seuen thousand one hundred and thirtie foot.</p>
               <p>The Drossart, Burgomasters, and the two preachers, namely <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Baselis</hi> the elder, and <hi>Iacob Baselis</hi> the yonger, did so farre pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with the Burghers, by remembring them of their duetie due to their country, as they voluntarily offered their labor for ending of the work, euerie man promising to be readie at the sound of the drumme. The afternoone, Sermon ended, for it was vpon Sunday, the drumme began to sound.</p>
               <p>The Burgomaster <hi>Sudland</hi> with certain of the Magistrats, &amp; <hi>Iacob Baselis</hi> the younger, with the elders of the Church, euerie man a shouel in his hand did, in the euening meet at the place where the fort was to be built, and were in a maner followed by all the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:14840:55"/>
A cornet of horse was sent forth to defend them from the enemie, if he should haue come downe from Burghvliet. But because the plot of the worke was not yet made, and those which should haue made it different in opinion, nothing was done that night.</p>
               <p>The Italians that lay in campe nere to S. Geertrudes, seeing so many men assembled vpon the Southland causie right ouer against them, went forth to see what it meaned: they set Sentinels euerie where and were all of them vp in armes.

               <p>The eighteenth of October, our men made an other sallie on Steenberghens side: but the enemie kept himselfe within his tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and would not come forth, whereupon they returned to the towne.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The enemie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the North Fort.</hi>
                  </note> On the twentieth of October, at night, the enemie cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to haue surprized the North Fort; the manner where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will set downe at large. We haue heretofore mentioned, how that our horsemen, some two or three dayes before the siege, had taken two Spaniards prisoners. These were committed to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of an English victualler called <hi>Redhead,</hi> of whom <hi>Grimston</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe to <hi>Baskervile</hi> bought his prouision: by this meanes, both of them fell acquainted with the prisoners, who did at last earnestly solicit them to doe some notable seruice to the king of Spaine. This did they discouer to the Lord <hi>Willoughby,</hi> and craued his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice how they should proceed with the Spanish prisoners. <hi>Willough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> injoyned them to treat with them about yeelding vp the North Fort to the Duke of Parma. After sundrie conferences and consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with the prisoners, they did in the end agree to deliuer vp the Fort, which was an easie matter for the ensigne to do, who was oftentimes captaine of the watch of the Fort when <hi>Baskerviles</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie had the gard of it: This thus concluded, the ensigne and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualler feigned themselues fugitiues, and caried the prisoners let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the Duke of Parma, vnto whom they had many times writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten about that businesse.</p>
               <p>On the 20 of October, when it was darke, they went to the duke (who to this end, did the same night lodge at the low North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geest) telling him that all things were in readinesse for the surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Fort: It is reported, that he stood in some doubt of them, and that therefore he made sundrie demands concerning the fort, as who commaunded in it, how many souldiers it had, and by what
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:14840:56"/>
meanes they would deliuer it vnto him; That he did beside, take their oath that they should deale faithfully with him therein, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them to receiue the Sacrament of the Altar (as the Papists terme it.) Being assured of their loyaltie, he gaue to each of them a chaine of gold, promising them a good summe of money the deed being once done. Then hee made choyce of a certaine number of his best souldiers, to goe and receiue the Fort in his name, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Grimstons</hi> and the victuallers hands to be bound behind them with match, and gaue two ponyards to two souldiers commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to kill them, if they perceiued the least suspition by the way.</p>
               <p>The Lord <hi>Willoughby</hi> in the meane time manned the Fort with valiant soldiers, and on each side of the causies placed certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of musketiers, &amp; in the gate whereat the enemie was to enter, he caused an yron port-cullis to be hung vp by roopes, which cut, the port-cullis would fall downe and stop the passage.</p>

               <p>The next day no ensignes were seen wauing in both the camps, which was a signe that the enemie lamented the losse of his men: the two Spanish prisoners by sentence of the Councell of war were hanged, for that being prisoners, they had sollicited the ensigne &amp; victualler to commit treason.</p>
               <p>Much good ensued to vs hereby: For by this meanes we were wholly freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feare of treacherie, because the enemie being thus deceiued, wold neuer giue credit to any other, though they meant neuer so faithfully: and yet <hi>Grimston</hi> and the victualler were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by all men for renouncing their Religion and for perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, so as their owne Nation did greatly tax them.

At night all the ordnance in the town and forts were discharged, and the souldiers vpon the rampiers thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred forth many volleys of small shot, so that nothing could bee heard in the towne for the noice of trumpets, drums and bels. They which had no harquebuzes fastened wispes of straw to the end of their pikes which they did set on fire holding them vp into the aire, so as the towne and forts seemed to burne: for beside the fire which the souldiers made, others were kindled on the Rampiers and in the towne. The souldiers cried out to the Spaniards how that the Spanish fleet was comming to helpe them to win the North fort: &amp; euer after the enemie began to lose his courage.</p>
               <p>A certaine boat laden with corne, thinking to enter the Hauen
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:14840:57"/>
was by the wind driuen vpon the North head: the enemie shot at this boat, and toucht it thrice, yet no man was hurt, and at last by the mariners diligence it was brought into the towne. Euerie day there were skirmishes, and euerie houre some new matter or other was performed in the plaine betwixt the town and enemies camp: But the Burghers being tired with continuall labour, complained saying that they could doe no more; whereupon, gouernor <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> aduised the magistrats to impose some tax vpon euery Burgher, and with the money hire labourers to end the worke. The Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master <hi>Manteau</hi> assembled the great Councell, and propounded to them the gouernours demaund. This great Councell is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of the new Councell, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Magistrats then in authoritie, and of the old, namely, of such as haue beene Burgomasters, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifes, receiuers, and counsellers chosen out of euery companie, who haue a place in this great Councell. The Gouernours demand was allowed, and the Burghers were discharged from their labour, and the worke which was imperfect, was within a while finished.</p>
               <p>There was great want of planks, so as they were enforced to teare vp diuers new floares to serue for the workes, which, after the siege, the towne paid for. But this want, together with that of other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries being not fully supplied, the Burghomaster <hi>Sudland</hi> was on the sixe and twentieth of October sent into Holland, not onely to my Lords the States, but to the magistrats of the town of Dort, who during the siege, shewed themselues verie affectionat to the good of the towne. Certaine Scots lay in a Burghers house called <hi>Iohn Dyalle,</hi> who among other things fit to burne, pluckt vp a piece of timber called a summer which supported the whole frame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the whole house fell downe vpon them, and slew 3 of them: thereupon, proclamation was made on paine of life, that no souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er should breake vp any timber in any house.</p>
               <p>On the Rampiers of the towne and forts, pitch barrels full of chips and straw were placed, to giue light if the enemie should in the night make any attempt vpon the towne. The seuen and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of October the great bell was rung to publish the Faire or free Mart, not in hope that many people would come to it, but because the towne is bound so to doe for feare of loosing the priuiledge of the Mart. During this time, which continued sixe weekes, all fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues may boldly come thither (traitors, theeues, and banished men excepted:) and no man is called in question for debt, but onely for
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:14840:57"/>
that which he shall fall into during the Mart. The day following, his Excellencie came into the towne, by his presence to encourage the souldiers and Burghers to view the fortifications, and to take order for all necessaries belonging to the siege. The same day, the imposition heretofore mentioned was much raised, which did in no sort please the Burghers: who vnderstanding that my Lords the States were come into the Isle of Tholen, sent the Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master <hi>Manteau,</hi> and <hi>William Frauncis</hi> the old Burgomaster to them; these at tenne of clocke at night went in the companie of his Excellencies seruants to Venusdam, and preuailed so farre with my Lords the States as they promised to giue them three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand florins towards the fortification of Berghen, and they recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued one thousand eight hundred in hand. The morrow after the Burgomasters departure, the enemie forsooke the causie of Matte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg. Those of the Island perceiuing it, did without any noyce set fire on the enemies campe. The time was not long ere the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie would be enforced with great disgrace and losse to retire: For despairing to take the towne he could expect no lesse, but to haue his campe ruined by little and little, with continuall sallies, canon shot from the towne, raine, foule weather, and sicknesse which ensued:<note place="margin">

The mony before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned being graunted by my Lords the States, the imposition was lessened and certaine Boores hired to end the worke. Our men planted two canons on a certaine place called Boeten-verdriet, with which they scoured the valley betwixt the high and nether Northgeest, and shot into the enemies Campe, so as sometimes with one shot, they ouerthrew tents, barrels of wine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the meane time, a rumour was spred that the enemie had made a Mine from Holweghen, as farre as the towne Dike, to blow vp part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and though most men thought it a vaine and idle reeport, yet, because the water in the South Dike was on the sixt of Nouember fallen one foot, this fable was receiued for truth. The Lord <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughby</hi> with two or three other went directly to Holweghen: this way is so low, as a man from thence can scarce discerne the top of a pike, notwithstanding that he that carries it should aduaunce it as high as he could: and although the enemie was not far from them vpon S. Gertrudes mount, yet the lord <hi>Willoughbie</hi> wold not return ere he had from aboue wel viewed and considered the depth of that way, where he found no markes or signes of any Mine.</p>
               <p>The ninth of Nouember the Earle of Northumberland and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Norris</hi> came from England with a gallant traine of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: At their arriuall all the ordnance great and small was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and the great Bell was rung: The Earle came to see the Low-countries and Berghen-op-Zoom: Generall <hi>Norris</hi> was by her Majestie sent to my Lords the States to procure some aid for D. <hi>Antonio</hi> King of Portugal; for the Queene prepared a mightie fleet to re-establish D. <hi>Antonio</hi> in his kingdome, from whence he had beene expulsed by the Spaniards.<note place="margin">

The Almans which were encamped on the Rabergh came downe into the plaine at the foot of the hill, and made a stand not farre from Wijngaerts hill, many retired behind the hedges and bushes, others allured our men to come forward. Captaine <hi>Veer,</hi> with some thirtie souldiers, driues away the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans from their place of aduauntage, <hi>Parker</hi> assailes and pursues them as farre as the Rabergh, and suffereth few of them to escape.</p>
               <p>A young Gentleman, Captaine of a foot companie, beeing on horsebacke, and charging together with <hi>Parker,</hi> was taken prisoner, being carried by the furie of his horse into the middest of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies campe, and was afterwards exchanged for D. <hi>Iuan de Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doza,</hi> both of them being almost of one age: All prisoners that were taken did constantly affirme that the Duke of Parma determined to raise the siege.</p>
               <p>On the eleuenth of Nouember, a generall sallie was made on Steenberghens side by all the horse and foot, some few excepted, who here and there garded the gates and the Rampiers. Generall <hi>Balfort</hi> with sixe hundred choyce souldiers, both Dutch &amp; Scotch, came thither at the same time from Tholen. Captain <hi>Veer</hi> conducted the free booters that were to begin the skirmish. Captaine <hi>Marce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis Bacx</hi> with his harquebuziers marched directly towards the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies camp. <hi>Balfort</hi> embattailed his troops on the highway of Steen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berghen. Those of the towne stood in the plaine on the right hand of that highway towards the West. The Lanciers went somewhat on the one side towards the Sand-Wegh. The footmen which went before with captaine <hi>Veer,</hi> shot furiously vpon the enemies, who shewed himselfe open aboue from their fortifications. Certaine of the enemies horse made a braue sallie, and were as brauely salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with small shot, and forthwith enforced to returne to their campe, with losse of some of their horse. In this manner was the time spent, the enemie still continuing himselfe in his trenches which were too strong for vs to breake into. Our men retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into the Towne, thinking they had woon honour enough, in that for two houres space they had dared the enemie to fight, and in a manner halfe assayled their Campe. Of Captaine <hi>Veers</hi> souldiers, foure were slayne, and 12 hurt with the enemies shot.

               <p>BEfore we come to the taking of Breda, it shall not be imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent briefely to set downe the situation thereof. Breda next to the foure chiefe cities of Brabant, is among others one of the principall, hauing the same franchises as the townes of Tilemont, Louvain, and Niuelle. It stands in the land of Kempen, eight miles from Antuerpe, sixe from Boisleduc or Sertoghenbusk, sixe from Berghen-op-Zoom, and two from Geertrudenberg, in a plaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding with corne, the fields and medowes beeing inuironed with trees, and the countrie wood die: there are some woods, as Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peu, the New wood, and the wood of Lies, through which two small riuers runne, which emptie themselues into the Dikes of Haeghdijck, and runne vnder a water Mill into the towne. One of these two riuers will beare boats beyond Ginneken, and towards Hoochstrate it is called the Aa, within, &amp; below Breda, the Mercke.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:14840:61"/>
We find in auntient Registers that the Danes possest and dwelt in a certaine Fort or Castle, which by permission of the Lord of the Countrie of Breda, they builded in the Crowes wood, where He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons doe now breed. <hi>Henrie,</hi> Lord of Breda, assisted by the Lord of Weesmaell and the Marshall of Brabant, vpon some controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie tooke that castle and wholly raced it in Anno 1124.</p>
               <p>There are in it diuers goodly houses belonging to Gentlemen, a verie beautifull Church, on the North side whereof the Counts of Nassau haue built a goodly Chappell, wherein is a stately monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Renatus</hi> of Chalon: and in a vault vnderneath it the Tombes of the auntient Lords of Breda, of Count <hi>Engetbrecht,</hi> Count <hi>Henrie,</hi> and of the aboue mentioned <hi>Renatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The towne of Breda is of a reasonable bignesse, and beautifull structure, yet in former time it hath been much disfigured by fire, for in anno 1534 on the 23 of Iulie, a thousand houses were burnt downe to the ground. And because it was the chiefe abode of those of the house of Nassau, they haue beautified it with many goodly buildings, as especially, Count <hi>Henrie</hi> of Nassau, who was a braue and valiant Lord; he caused the towne to be fortified with large Rampiers, and in anno 1534 both in the Castle and round about the towne he caused fiue great bulwarkes to be made, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended one another, together with verie deepe dikes.</p>
               <p>During these warres, foure rauelins more haue beene made, and before euerie gate, an halfe moone, so as this towne, among those of the low or plaine Countrie is held one of the strongest in all the Netherlands. In former time, after the racing of the aboue mentioned Castle, the Lords of Breda opposit thereunto, nere to the Market place, at this day called the Herons nest, began to build a Palace and Castle where Count <hi>Henrie</hi> of Nassau afterwards (suffering part of the old building to stand stil) caused a new court and stately Palace to be built, moated round about, and without that, a verie sumptuous edifice with a verie lordlie gallerie, suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by pillers of blew stone, with a gilded frontispice: within the Court are many goodlie Chambers, a large and stately Hall buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on Pillars, with an artificiall winding staires of blew stone, which cunning workemen hold for a master-piece: in the Hall there is likewise a Chappell. There is a verie goodlie Armorie sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all sorts of Armour, and much ordnance, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, diuers old cast pieces, which a king of Hungarie had in time
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:14840:61"/>
past giuen to the house of Nassau in recompence of their good seruice done to him against the Turke. There were in it likewise 52 great canons and small field pieces, which the Emperour <hi>Ferdinand</hi> gaue to the last prince and Lord of Breda, which since then, haue beene taken away by Duke d'Alua.</p>
               <p>Among the most remarkable matters of Breda, as well aunti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent as moderne, these are much to be obserued, How that the lord and countrie of Breda (in time past a Lord and countrie diuided from the Duchie of Brabant) hath beene joyned to the said Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie in the time of <hi>Henrie</hi> of Lorraine &amp;c.

               <p>Being thus prepared, they resolued to execute the enterprise on the 25 of Februarie, but the frost hindred them certaine daies, not without great daunger of being discouered.</p>

of the frost and a contrary wind, enduring extreame cold, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting victuals, not being prouided for any long time, so as they were enforced, in the night, to leaue the boat and to retire to Nordam. <hi>Herauguieres</hi> was enforced to endure many murmuring speeches of his souldiers, but by faire words and his owne example he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased them, propounding daunger and shame, profit and honor to them, and thereby caused them to resolue to vndergoe all daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with him.</p>
               <p>Hauing well refresht themselues one whole day in the Fort of Nordam, on Thursday, the first of March, at night, they returned to the boat, staying within a quarter of a mile of Breda, and in this manner continued from Friday till Saturday Morning at tenne of the clocke, before the Herons wood nere to the Castle, where the boat went on ground, so as they were enforced to tarrie till an high water.

               <p>That done, he went from thence into Bommeleerweert, and on the 3 of October tooke he house or castle of Heel, reducing it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the States obedience: from thence he made hast to the new fort of Ter-heyden, which Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> had made to bridle those of Breda; which, notwithstanding the strength thereof, was by the canon enforced to yeeld on the 11 of October.

               <p>BEfore we come to set downe the siege and taking of the towne of Zutphen, which is one of the chiefe townes of the Duchie of Guelderland, and yet a countie a part, seated nere the riuer Yssell, a mile and a halfe from Doesbourg, foure miles from Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, and six from Nimmeguen: we will briefely speake of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Castles of Turnholt and Westerloo, which were woon a little before, as a preparatiue to the sayd siege: As also the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page of boats, and other warlike prouisions necessarie for a siege.</p>

                  </note> they likewise tooke the Castle of Westerloo notwithstanding it was vnder contribution. The young Lord of Merode made his aboad there, who beeing one day gone on hunting, they layed hold on that occasion, and by that meanes did easily become masters thereof, finding it fit and commodious to reduce the rest of Brabant vnder contribution, and there to busie their enemies whilest themselues should be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed elsewhere. At the beginning of August, they did cut off a rich Conuoy going from Brussels to Namur.</p>
               <p>The States of the vnited Prouinces hauing now built their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement on a strong and sure foundation, and so reckoned their contributions, impositions and reuenues, as they could for certaine moneths in the yeare encrease the number of their souldiers, defray the charges, and send them to the field prouided of all necessaries, and were thereby able to assaile the enemies, and to make an offensiue warre: So as all the Summer they made their prouisions of Canon, great numbers of Boats, Gabions, Bridges, Powder, Bullets, Tents and other such like necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:14840:67"/>To attend vpon the canon they made choice of skilfull mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, finding those men fit to ship &amp; vnship the ordnance, to plant and transport it, and vpon necessitie and want of horse to draw it with their hands through marshes and ouer causeis; and likewise to serue sometimes in stead of gunners.</p>
               <p>The States did likwise send with their gouernor Generall prince <hi>Maurice</hi> as chiefe commaunder of the armie, certaine of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of State to assist him in all affaires, as the Venetians make vse of those whom they call Prouidatori: He had likewise a skilfull Councell of warre with all manner of officers requisit in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. Their souldiers were voluntaries, well paied, skilfull, and readie, and though they were but few, yet for that time they made vse of their old forces, not raising new, thereby to giue no cause of suspitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but they were verie careful to haue their companies ful &amp; compleat, and did earnestly intreat the Queene of England, That her ayd (according to the tenor of their contract) might not bee wanting, which was commaunded by Sir <hi>Frauncis Veer,</hi> a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of a noble house, a gallant souldier, and more fauoured of the Low-countries than all other strangers whatsoeuer.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> thus prepared, made shew as if he intended to besiege Sertoghenbusk or Geertrudenberg, sending many souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to Breda, and diuers boats vpon the Mase: which caused the Duke of Parma to giue the more credit to it, because (as hath been sayd) that the States had alreadie taken the Castles of Turneholt and Westerloo, as places of retreat, with diuers other signes; which made him likewise to fortifie the garrison of Geertrudenberg, and commaunded those of Sertoghenbusk to fortifie their towne, but they refusing to receiue a garrison, he fortified some waies nere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> in the meane time had secretly sent certain soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, vnder the conduct of Sir <hi>Francis Veer,</hi> towards Doesbourg, commaunding him to begin the enterprise, and himself went spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to Vtrecht, and from thence to Rhene and Arnham, and there crossing the Veluwe, towards Zutphen.</p>

                  </note>On the three and twentieth of May, nine souldiers were sent on the further side of Yssell towards the Fort of Zutphen, foure of them clad like Boores, and the other fiue like countrie women with butter, cheese and eggs. These, at the opening of the Ports stood before the Fort nere which a sufficient number of souldiers
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:14840:67"/>
were hidden: So soone as the gate was opened, the greatest part of the souldiers who had watched that night came forth, and cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the water to goe to the towne: These counterfeit Boores lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon their staues, and they which were disguised like women sat vpon the ground, offering their commodities to the gard, who beheld them without any suspition, till one of the women drew forth a Pistoll and shot one of them, which done these counterfeits threw off their disguise, assailed the enemie, and seazed on the gate: The souldiers that were hid hauing heard the report of the Pistoll, ran speedily to the rescue of their fellowes, forced the gard and gate, and so tooke the Fort, taking twelue souldiers prisoners that remained behind: this was done on the 24 of May in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>The Fort thus surprised, his Excellencie did not faile the next day to enuiron and besiege the towne of Zutphen. On the sixe and twentieth of the said moneth Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassau came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the seuen and twentieth they were busied in shutting in the towne, intrenching themselues and making a bridge ouer the Yssell. The eight and twentieth of May, eighteene great canon were planted in three seuerall places, with such speed and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie as is almost incredible, all these were discharged thrice, which amounted to foure and fiftie shot. Then they sent to summon the Towne; the Burghers in their answer craued time to consult, which was denied, so as they sent two Captaines to craue three dayes respit to haue an aunswer from <hi>Verdugo</hi> the townes gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, this was likewise denied, and no time of consultation giuen them: whereupon, the same day beeing the 30 of May, they made an accord, <hi>viz.</hi> that the garrison should depart the same night with their ensignes, armes, and baggage, together with all Ecclesiasticall persons, and such Burghers as were willing to be gone had free libertie so to doe: Those which would tarrie, whether they were Clergie men or others, should enjoy the same benefit as the other inhabitants of the vnited Prouinces did.

braue and gallant young Lord. This strong towne was taken on a sodaine, vnprouided of strong garrison, there being in all but sixe hundred men in it, the circuit whereof is verie large: For they thought themselues not able to defend so great a breach as so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny canons would haue made; they did likewise want powder and victuals. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> presently entred it, at the verie same time as Count <hi>Solms</hi> brought the companies of Zeland to him.</p>

               <p>SO soone as his Excellencie had taken the towne of Zutphen, stored it with all necessaries, and giuen order for the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, he made hast to pursue his victorie, laying hold on so faire an occasion, so as the verie same night, he sent to begirt the towne of Deuenter, seated two miles from Zutphen, and foure from Zwoll, on the right side of the riuer Yssell. The Canon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the vsuall celeritie was likewise shipt, and carried to Deuenter; the whole armie presently followed. His Excellencie made two bridges ouer the Yssell, and on both sides of the riuer planted eight and twentie canons; and hauing made some shot, he sent to summon the towne; but they within would not heare tell of yeelding: so as on the ninth of Iune the batterie began, which in a short space, had beaten downe a great quarter of the wall nere to the Key. This wall was double, and on the inside thereof was a thicke earthen Rampier. It being thus beaten downe, certain flat bottomed boats were sent into the Hauen, on which a Bridge was made to goe to the assault, for which, the English, Scots, and Dutch, were in readinesse, euerie Nation vnder his commaund, striuing who should march first. All things beeing readie, the Bridge proued too short, so as they could not continue the assault: Some that went forward gaue a furious assault to the breach, on which, Captaine <hi>Lamberts</hi> ensigne first leaped, and was there shot,

               <p>In the towne, were seuen companies to defend the breach, on whom the canon often plaied, and did great hurt: The gouernour Count <hi>Harman</hi> of Bergue, lost an eye, and Captaine <hi>Muller</hi> stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nere him had his head shot off. Colonel <hi>Nicholas Metkerke,</hi> sonne to the president of Flanders, a braue and valiant gentleman, was shot vpon the breach: he was much lamented, for the next day after the towne was taken he died, together with another captaine.</p>
               <p>There likewise happened a matter worthie of note,<note place="margin">

His Excellencie commaunded that no man should aunswer him; but the Lord of Ryhoue being not able to endure his braues, entreated the Generall to giue him no leaue to abate his pride, who presently ran vpon him, &amp; doing great matter with their launces, they proceeded to other weapons.

               <p>AFter the Duke of Parmas departure, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> left Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons in the places nere adjoyning, and being not yet satisfied with all his victories, but desirous of the countries good, and his owne honour, he was loth to loose any faire occasion, but by the aduise of his Councell, made a new attempt vpon the Towne of Hulst in the Land of Waes in Flaunders. Great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations were made in Zeland, where they shipt ordnance, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ladders, bridges, and all other necessaries for a siege.</p>
               <p>These did Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> send speedily by water, together with 4000 foot, and by Brabant seuen Cornets of horse: himselfe with other forces went vp the Riuer of Scheld, and landed in Flanders, where without delay on the 19 of September he besieged Hulst, the chiefe towne in the land of Waes, the Duke of Parma suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting no such matter.</p>
               <p>The one and twentieth of the said moneth, the canon was plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and all the Forts nere adjoyning were taken, the horse made incursions to the gates of Gaunt and Veer. By the way they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred certaine souldiers and Boores, who had barricadoed themselues in a Church, and would by no meanes yeeld, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they fired the Church and burnt them all. And fearing least those of Antuerpe would send forces to surprise them, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched the way, and opened the sluce of Calloo, drowning the Countrie round about.</p>
               <p>The garrison of Hulst (from whence the gouernour a while before was gone with a Conuoy) perceiuing the Canon to bee planted, the vtter Rauelin to be battered, themselues too weake to resist so great a power, and despairing of any ayde, fell to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, and two hundred and sixtie men, did, on the foure and twentieth of September depart forth of the Towne with their Armes and baggage. A Spanish captaine, who supplied the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors place, whose name was <hi>Ieronimo Stribanij,</hi> was by the Duke of Parmas commaund beheaded, either because he had so soone yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

vp the towne, or else, for that his companie which shold haue beene two hundred strong, was found to be but sixtie. The Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghers capitulated to be delt with in the same maner as other towns in Holland, conforming themselues accordingly. All Ecclesiastical persons departed likewise.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Solms,</hi> Colonel of the Regiments of Zeland, was made gouernour both of the towne and countrie with full and ample commaund, and was well prouided of men and other necessaries.

               <p>But <hi>Mondragon,</hi> with <hi>Steeland,</hi> baylie of the Land of Waes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined presently to fortifie some great Villages nere to Hulst, to stop our mens incursions, as the Dorp called S.

               <p>Those of Bruges, and other townes in Flanders, craued that they might be vnder contribution to those of Zeland, because that the Zelanders garrisons made great incursions vpon them; the like did those of Ostend, Axell, Hulst, the Fort of Ternheuse. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made meanes to trade in the towne by paying customes, as they did in Antuerpe and the State of Gaunt: But the Duke of Parma wold not suffer it, notwithstanding that the Zelanders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their incursions, who in Iune went towards Gaunt, where they did beat three hundred Spaniards and Walons, and tooke ninetie prisoners. The same moneth they made an other road with greater forces, but nere to Newport they found resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; so as in stead of getting bootie they were beateh and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red towards the Sea shore, vnder the defence of the Flushingers men of warre, and lost some 30 or fortie men.</p>
               <p>The news of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> entrance into Flanders was brought to Antuerpe at the same time that <hi>Parma</hi> lay there, whom the towne did feast and giue presents to. <hi>Mondragon,</hi> Captaine of the Castle, did presently assemble all his forces, and made vse of the Prince of Parma as a meanes to moue the Spaniards that lay at

               <p>HIs Excellencie of Nassau, beeing animated and encouraged by his former victories, and loath to omit any meanes to van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish his enemies, whom, it seemed, God deliuered into his hands; perceiuing likewise that <hi>Mondragon</hi> went about to stop his further passage into Flaunders, and hauing notice that many things were in readinesse for his attempt on Nimmeguen, he resolued to quit the land of Waes, notwithstanding that many profitable and hopefull enterprises offered themselues in sundrie places &amp; Forts of Flanders; whereupon those of Zeland did earnestly solicit him, for the better extention of their bounds. The canon being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine speedily embarked, foureteene small boats by too much hast were sunke, which they were enforced to quit, so as the Spaniards at a low water burnt them.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with his men and ordnance leauing Flaunders, was kindly welcomed and entertayned in Zeland, from whence he presently made hast to goe to besiege Nimmeguen, hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that <hi>Verdugo</hi> made incursion into the land of Iuliers and was too weake to raise the siege of Nimmeguen, part of his forces beeing gone into Fraunce, and the other halfe called away by <hi>Mondragon</hi> for the reliefe of Flaunders: Hee had likewise sound aduertizement of the State of the Towne, by <hi>Hugo</hi> the Secretarie, who had a long time beene prisoner there. These things hastened his Excellencie to besiege that town before winter, where with all his forces he arriued on the foureteenth of October, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a bridge presently ouer the Waell, which was broken by the canon from S. Huberts Towers, so as he was enforced to make it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:14840:72"/>
further off from the Towne, where Captaine <hi>Rols</hi> and others were slaine. By meanes of this bridge, he soone approched the towne by his trenches, and planted foure canon nere to the gate called Hoenderport, and at the foot of the hill called Hoendenberg in a place termed Oye, sixteene, and in the Betuwe, opposit to the tower Lappentorne, twelue more, to make a breach betwixt the Court called Valckenhof and Hoenderport, where he supposed to haue most aduauntage, and best meanes to hinder them from repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
               <p>Those of Nimmeguen hereby terrified, sent to <hi>Verdugo</hi> sor ayd: there were three strong companies of foot in the towne, but verie few horse commaunded by <hi>Henrie Kieboom, alias Neuse,</hi> who had betrayed and sold Geertrudenberg to the Duke of Parma, who so soone as motion was made of parley, did on a sodaine leaue the towne, and passed through the campe to the Zelanders quarter. The Townesmen perceiuing the canon planted, did mure vp the gate of Hoendenport and intrenched the voyd place betwixt the riuer and castle, diuiding it from the towne by a rampier which they made, in which men, women, and children laboured, to the end that if that place were taken, the town might yet hold out, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting nothing which valiant men might performe. The canon planted, and the towne summoned to yeeld, they aunswe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> was a young louer, and that Nimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen was a Virgin to whom he made loue, which he could not so easily win, and therefore it behoued him to take more paines. But, when they were hopelesse of ayd the towne being much annoyed by the canon, especially from Knodsenbourg fort, whence many thousand shot had beene made vpon it, the Burghers ran to the State-house, complaining that the king had forsaken them, for whom they had a long time spent their goods, bloud, and hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their liues; that they had too often sent to <hi>Parma,</hi> who still had other matters in hand; so as at last they resolued to capitulate, and on good termes to compound: and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> sending once againe to let them know that hope of succour was vaine, and that his canon was readie to play vpon them: they sent their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners to the campe on the twentieth of October, requiring to haue the excercise of both religions: That the Magistrat might continue in the same state he then stood, that an easie garrison might be giuen them, with diuers other requests, which they could
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:14840:73"/>
not obtaine: And therefore, the next day, they sent the Burgoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Flemming</hi> with ample power to capitulate, by whose meanes they obtayned many of their demaunds, as the disposing of the Church goods, power to giue regall offices, and other matters; but, concerning religion, they were of force to conforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues like to other Countries and townes of the vnited Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; They should likewise receiue sixe ensignes of footmen, and two Cornets of horse, and the Magistrat should be altered at the discretion of his Excellencie and my Lords the States. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the souldiers departed to the towne of Graue. Fiue and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie brasen cast pieces were found in the Towne, and twelue of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
               <p>Thus was the towne of Nimmeguen yeelded on the two and twentieth of October, and was annexed to the vnited Prouinces. Count <hi>Philip</hi> of Nassau, sonne to Count <hi>Iohn,</hi> was made gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and <hi>Gerard,</hi> the younger, gouernour of Knodsenbourg, was appointed his Lieutenant. This done, his Excellencie sent his troopes to garrison, hauing in a short space, and in lesse than fiue moneths, woon the Fort and Towne of Zutphen, the Towne of Deuenter in the Prouince of Ouer-Ysell, the Fort of Delf-zijll, and many others in Frize-land; He enforced the Duke of Parma to raise his siege from before Knodsenbourg, and defeated his Cauallerie; He did afterwards take the Towne of Hulst, in the view of <hi>Mondragon</hi> and those of Antuerpe; And now in winter, Nimmeguen, the chiefe Towne of Guelderland, making the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell her frontier.

               <p>The armie consisted of 6000 foot and 2000 horse, with which his Excellencie departed towards Steenwijck with all his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, where he encamped on the 28 of May. Steenwijck is a towne in the prouince of Ouer-Yssell, standing vpon a small riuer called Blockziell, which nere to Meppell a mile from Steenwijck, empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it selfe into Zuidersea: it is a passage into Frizeland, seruing for defence to a great extent of ground, being verie strong in rampiers; it was verie well manned, for there were 16 ensignes of foot, &amp; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine troopes of horse in it.

               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:14840:74"/>Before we come to the siege of Steenwijck, we will speake of a certaine enterprise which was intended vnder colour of this siege: The Spaniards and those of Steenwijck thought to haue surprized the towne of Enchuysen, by meanes of a certain mariner that dwelt there, who was lately come from Spaine, where he had spoken with the king, and had receiued a good summe of money, both of his Majestie, and Duke of Parma, as well for his owne seruice which he was to doe, as to win other Captaines and souldiers to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the enterprise. But this Burgher bewrayed all to my Lords the States and to his Excellencie, of whom he receiued such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, as he persuaded the Spaniards, that the best way was, to attempt the Hauen, and to that end they should send a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men from Steenwijck, which was not farre off, which should be shipt in a night, in the beginning of May, whom he without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny suspition would conduct, hauing alreadie woon the captaines and chiefe of the towne, who wrote v
pon their credits all things were sure. And the better to colour it, and to blind those of Steen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wijck, this Burgher offered to remaine as hostage among them, and to vndergoe all manner of punishment, if he should deale o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than faithfully with them, or if matters succeeded not well according to his direction. And in the meane space, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> should be at the same time in Enchuysen to surprise the surprisers, which might easily be done, because that the Hauen is drie at low water; and hauing taken them all prisoners, he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently send his armie before Steenwijck, to besiege it, and threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, that vnlesse they would presently deliuer this Burgher, he would hang vp all his prisoners: but somewhat croft this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, so as the enterprise went not forward: yet Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> went on with his armie to besiege Steenwijck.</p>
               <p>From the thirteenth of May, till the ninth of Iune, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie was busied in making of trenches, and finding out solid and fast ground whereon to plant his canon: he made a Cauallier of 19 foot high, on which he layd three pieces, wherewith to beat down their defences, and lay them open; fortie fiue pieces being planted, on the thirteenth of Iune the towne was battered; yet at that time they did no great matter: for they could hardly batter the curtains, notwithstanding they discarged many thousand shot. They shot wild fire into the towne, which at first did terrifie them, but it was soone quenched.</p>

                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:14840:74"/>His Excellencie, perceiuing that the canon was to smal purpose, and that those in the towne did not greatly regard it, resolued to shoot no more, but made two mynes towards the Counter-scarp, which likewise did no great matter; they digged till they came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Counter-scarp which he woon from them, and in a certain place at the foot of the pallisado, discouered how they within la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in the dikes, so as to giue an assault wold be but lost labor, vnesse those within were beaten from thence: and therefore they brought certain pieces into sundrie places in the dike, to beat down the fortification at the foot of the pallizado; &amp; being protected by their canon they came into the dike, where they shadowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues so well, as the townesmen could not hurt them: so as by that means they possest the foot of the rampier of the principal Bulwark on the East side, where they digged 23 foot vnder the ground ere they came to make any chambers: they spent to daies in this work, du
ring which time, the besieged made 2 sallies; in the first they tooke an ensigne, &amp; defeated certaine Englishmen; in the 2 they slew captaine <hi>Olthof,</hi> who in the former siege had bin in the towne &amp; defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it, with certain others of note, &amp; part of those which had the gard in that place. Our me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cold neuer take any of the besieged prisoners. On the 23 of Iune the besigers batered one of the towns rauelins; when those within perceiued the battery, they forsooke it.</p>
               <p>From the 24 till the 27 of Iune, our men were busied in making a woodden tower on wheeles, which in Dutch is called Lijmstang, in English, discouer Pot, it was inuented by captain <hi>Iohn Corput</hi> of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da. This Tower was square and made of Mastes fastened together by yron vices; there were nine floares in it one aboue another, each of them twelue foot high; they might at any time be taken downe and had curtaines of canuas towards the enemie. This new tower beeing brought nere the Towne Rampiers, and musketiers placed in it, they did not onely beat the besieged from the Rampiers, but shot those that went vp and downe in the streets: The townesmen, with two canons, and helpe of the wind, did in two dayes beat downe the two vttermost floares, so as no man would any more go vp vpon it.</p>
               <p>From the 27 till the 29 of Iune, they were busied in prepayring two Mynes in the rampier vnderneath the Bulwark. The thirtieth of Iune, the Townesmen sent three Captaines to parley, <hi>viz. Bernard de Moutberck, Dauid du Wall,</hi> &amp; an other called <hi>Vandensand,</hi>
                  <pb n="140" facs="tcp:14840:75"/>
sonne to the Prouost of Herderwijck, and in their stead Captaine <hi>Peter Dorp, Asseurs</hi> and <hi>Buck,</hi> were sent as Hostages. They craued to depart with their armour, ensignes and baggage, which was granted on condition that they should presently crosse the Rhyn, and for sixe moneths space, serue no more in those quarters, which they refusing, the parley was broken off.</p>
               <p>The same night, <hi>Verdugo,</hi> gouernour for king <hi>Philip,</hi> sent three hundred souldiers to the towne, each of them with a bag of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of fifteene or sixteene pound weight, seuentie of whom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the rest were defeated, and taken prisoners.</p>
               <p>The first of Iulie, his Excellencie gaue a false assault, hauing made foure hundred shot to note the behauiour of countenance of the besieged, who on euerie side were readie for defence. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Iulie, by night, he brought all his men secretly into the trenches, intending in the morning to giue fire to the Mynes, and to make a generall assault. Euerie Captaine with his men stood in his place appointed. The third of Iulie, in the morning, after that the canon had played for foure howres, the besieged perceiuing all things readie for the assault, came to the rampiers, and then the Mynes were fired; one of them did in such sort ouerthrow the rampier, as a breach was made for tenne men to enter in front; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that place where Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassau stood with the companies of Frize-land to giue the first assault: and at the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets sound, the English were to giue the second.</p>
               <p>The other Myne towards the South-West, brake forth without, and buried many Hollanders aliue, who stood there readie for the assault: all this while, his Excellencie had giuen no signall. But Count <hi>William</hi> perceiuing the townesmen to be terrified, assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and tooke the Bulwarke which had beene ouerthrowne on the East-side, and commaunded and discouered the whole towne.</p>
               <p>On the other side towards the South they likewise tooke a gate with great losse to the besieged, who perceiuing themselues disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered on euerie side, did the same night send a drumme to parley; but Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> for the time would not heare him: yet the next day, the aboue mentioned Captaines had audience, but all their demaunds were denied; in the end, they were content to imbrace whatsoeuer his Excellencie would graunt; for the canon by this time commaunded all places in the Towne, and all the houses and Churches were for the most part beaten downe, so as the people
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:14840:75"/>
kept in cellers. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> graunted to the gouernor <hi>Antonio Quocquelle,</hi> and to the Lord <hi>Waterdijke,</hi> captaines and officers of the garrison of Stenwijck, &amp; likewise to the Clergie &amp; Burghers, these conditions following, dated before Stenwijck the 4 of Iulie 1592.</p>
               <p>That they should depart forth of the said towne, the gouernor, captaines, officers and souldiers, hauing first sworne and promised not to beare armes for the king of Spaine on this side the Rhyne, for the space of sixe moneths.</p>
               <p>That they should depart with their baggage, wiues and armes, warlike munition and victuals.</p>
               <p>Such souldiers as had reuolted, and to escape the hand of justice for enormous crimes committed, were retired to the said towne &amp; serued there, should not enjoy the benefit of his accord.</p>
               <p>That all prisoners should be deliuered and set at libertie, paying twelue pence a day for their expences.</p>
               <p>That all Burghers and officers belonging to king <hi>Philip,</hi> might without molestation depart thence.</p>
               <p>That an hundred wagons should be graunted them, according to their request to carie them to Coeuord, on condition they wold be obliged to send them back without any harme.</p>
               <p>That the Surgeons and hurt people might remaine in the town till they were healed, and then depart whether they pleased.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie graunted them two commissioners to conduct them beyond the Rhyne, vpon caution of the Gouernour and Captaines.</p>
               <p>After this accord, the souldiers went their way on the fift of Iulie. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> beside all this, in regard they were valiant souldiers, did of his princelie curtesie graunt the Gouernour his horse; the like did he to Captaine <hi>Waell,</hi> and to all his men to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one a horse, and to the soldiers their swords. Those which went away were fiue hundred and threescore footmen, most Walons, all healthful and well disposed, and two hundred that were hurt, with some sixtie or seuentie horse. There were slaine in the towne some three hundred and fiftie, &amp; among others Count <hi>Lodwick</hi> of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen, a young Lord of some eighteene or nineteene yeares old, together with the Captaines <hi>Blundel, Hessel,</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>On Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> side, fiue or sixe hundred were slayne &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hurt, and among the rest, the Prince himselfe, presently after the Myne was fired, beeing desirous to see what effects it had
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14840:76"/>
wrought he was shot in the right cheeke, without any great daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. At the same time Captaine <hi>William Dorp,</hi> Colonel of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Hollanders, was hurt whereof he died. Sir <hi>Francis Veer</hi> was likewise hurt. The souldiers beeing gone, foure companies were put into the towne, commaunded by the Captaines <hi>Berestein, Rijswick</hi> and others, and the Campe remained there till the ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and Dikes were repaired. In this siege all things were more plentifull and better cheape than in any towne, by reason that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision was easily brought thither, and because they payed no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>post. Certaine souldiers who had beene actors in betraying the towne of Gertrudenberg, not comprehended in the contract were taken and hanged. And thus the Towne which was thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable was enforced to yeeld, his Excellencie hauing made more than nine and twentie thousand canon shot vpon it, and was annexed to the vnited Prouinces, being hitherunto preserued from all the enemies power and attempts.</p>

               <p>AFter that his Excellencie of Nassau, had taken Steenwijck, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the rampiers, and taken order for the gouernement thereof, he determined to march with his armie to Coevoer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and appointed certaine numbers of horse to goe and begirt the little towne of Ootmaersen, whereof <hi>Alonzo de Mendoza</hi> was gouernour for the king of Spaine, hauing sixtie horse and two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes of foot; where <hi>Charles</hi> of Leuin, Lord of Famars, was shot, he was a valiant Lord, and one of the Commissioners to the Noble confederats, who in anno 1566 had presented the supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He had continually borne armes for the countrie, and was now master of the ordnance, he was verie much lamented. The towne of Ootmaersen was battered with the canon and enforced to yeeld on composition, on the thirtieth of Iulie, like the towne of Steenwijck. That done, his Excellencie did in August besiege Coevoerden; those within it burnt the houses nere adjoyning; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with his trenches made his approch, &amp;
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:14840:76"/>
hap taken away the sluces from them, and drawne the water forth of the dikes, taken the Counter-scarp of the Castle, &amp; broken down the bridge.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Frederick</hi> of Berghen, hauing prouided all places round about, did with a strong garrison enter into it himselfe; it was a strong towne and famous for the situation thereof, it was artificially fortified, on such foundations as the Lord of Senoy had formerly begun to lay.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his souldiers being vpon the Counter-scarp, did for their defence make a gallerie in the dikes, vnder couert whereof they might easily come to the rampier to digge and Myne without daunger of the enemies canon, which they soone effected by the helpe of a Cauallier they made; they did also beat down a Rauelin: with much to do sundrie Mynes were made in the rampiers, which still sunke: the besieged made counter-mynes, which by taking aire were vnprofitable: yet our men did not giue ouer myning, &amp; fired some of them: whereupon, an assault was giuen, so as they got vpon the rampiers, where by meanes of the Cauallier they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified themselues, &amp; tooke from the besieged all meanes of defence, as they had done at Steenwijck. They within the towne began to be discouraged hoping still for succor, they likewise wanted water and other necessaries.</p>
               <p>The Councell of State of the vnited Prouinces, hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that the Duke of Parma made preparations to enter Frize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, leuied a regiment of supplies vnder the commaund of Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Stolberg,</hi> who passed Muster, nere to a place called Heerenberg in the presence of Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi>: For Count <hi>Philip</hi> of Nassau was sent into Fraunce with three thousand men; and the Queene of England had likewise called away her forces to send them into Fraunce, and were alreadie departed from the armie, and gone as farre as Swoll: but vpon intelligence of the Duke of Parmas com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming they were countermaunded. Count <hi>Philip</hi> in the meane time and his troopes returned opportunely from Fraunce, who were sent to Garrison in Holland to be refreshed. And the old Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were presently sent to the armie, and other some to Grauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weert, the better to anoy and stop <hi>Parmas</hi> passage. The armie was but weake, and by reason of the bad waies the campe could not be well prouided of victuall and munition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verdugo,</hi> gouernour of Frizeland for the Spaniards, had ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:14840:77"/>
solicited the duke of Parma for men and money, which in great abundance was at the same time sent from Italie: thereupon, <hi>Parma</hi> graunted, that the regiments of Count <hi>Charles</hi> of Mansfelt, Mondragon, Gonzaga, the two regiments of Arenberg and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laymont, with certaine horse and ordnance should march to his ayd: with these he crossed the Rhyne, making a Fort on the other side of the riuer, and so marched towards Groll, and from thence to Oldenzeel, where they arriued on the third of September.</p>

               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> hauing intelligence thereof, sent three hundred horse to view and skirmish with them, but he could not draw them forth of their aduauntage; he tooke a certaine boore whom hee suspected to carrie letters to the enemie, wherein he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: for the boore fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> strengthened this place with men and ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which was planted on the high way, through which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie was to passe: and standing thus secretly on his gard, <hi>Verdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> came on with all his forces, wearing white shirts vpon their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and on the seuenth of September, at night, they gaue in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the trenches in their seuerall places, crying victorie, victorie.</p>
               <p>But, his Excellencie, Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> and Count <hi>William</hi> of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw with their troopes did beat them back, and in their retreat the canon played vpon them: many were slaine vpon the place, many men and horse stucke fast in the mud, 136 were the next day found dead in the place, and two and fiftie horse; many were carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hurt: Two and fortie wagons full of dead and hurt men
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:14840:77"/>
were conducted by foure cornets of horse towards Oldenzeell: In a word, three hundred men were slayne. On his Excellencies part onely three were slaine and sixe hurt, and Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassau was hurt in the bellie, but not dangerously.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verdugo</hi> thus put to rout, did the next day make great prouisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fagots, to make a way through the Marshes; and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie wayes beeing many and verie narrow, he made shew as if hee would haue intrenched the passages, and by that meanes cut off vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals from his Excellencies camp: But at last, those of Coevoerden perceiuing their succour to faile, began to parley; and in the meane time, <hi>Verdugo</hi> did againe shew himselfe in battaile, and came to view his Excellencies trenches and fortifications, who came from receiuing and welcoming the English to his Campe. These two Armies hauing thus viewed one another, <hi>Verdugo</hi> discharged two canon: Those of Coevoerden aunswered him with two more, which done, he marched towards Velt-huyse in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Benthem.</p>
               <p>Those of Coevoerden, being thus forsaken and continually bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, to the great losse of their souldiers (our men by meanes of their myne being lodged on their rampiers and curtaines) resolued to compound. His Excellencie was likewise willing to grant them any reasonable conditions, in regard <hi>Verdugo</hi> lay not farre off, and might haue attempted somewhat to his prejudice, as also, because the countrie and wayes were verie bad, and vnfit for bringing of victuals to the campe: and on the 12 of September, graunted them this accord following. The commissioners were <hi>Evert de Ens, Christophero de Vasques,</hi> and <hi>Alonzo de Marteny,</hi> Captaines of the Cauallerie.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> in fauour of Count <hi>Frederick</hi> of Berghen, his louing cousen, doth by these Presents permit and suffer him, together with the Captaines, officers and souldiers of the garrison of Coevoerden, to depart with their ensignes, armes, horse, bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, &amp; whatsoeuer belongeth vnto them (the ammunition of war and victuals excepted) whether they shall thinke good.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie graunted the like to the Clergie, Ladies, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, children and domestick seruants of those of Coevoerden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned.</p>
               <p>And for the better furthering of their departure, wagons &amp; a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie conuoy for their safetie shal be granted them; for which the

sayd Count shall giue caution for their safe returne to the campe. And his Excellencie promiseth in the word of a Prince, that no harme either in bodie or goods shall be done to the said Earle, or to any other that comes forth of the sayd towne. Giuen before Coevoerden on the 12 of September 1592.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, the Earle and his souldiers came forth, himself was royally feasted by his Excellencie, his kinsman, and other Lords of the house of Nassau, who discoursed with one another, questioning how it came to passe, that they being children of brothers and si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, should be so diuided in loue and affection, and serue seuerall parties. Fiue hundred souldiers, that were in health and able to march, came forth of the towne, and many that were sicke of the bloudie flix. It was a strong towne, and 9 canon were found in it.</p>
               <p>My Lords the States, in perpetuall memorie of the taking of these 3 townes, Steenwijck, Oetmaersen and Coevoerden, made seuerall coynes of siluer and brasse, attributing the honour of these victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to God alone. The young lord of Nieunoort was made gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Coevoerden.</p>
               <p>The campe remained there, till all the fortifications were repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the towne prouided of all necessaries. <hi>Verdugo</hi> lay at Velt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huyse, and made shew as if he wold besiege Oetmaersen; but it was presently fortified.</p>
               <p>On the fifteenth of October, his Excellencie with his armie went toward Zwoll, and there resolued to march to Emmerijc, &amp; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp nere the Rhyne, to be better able to passe on from thence vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occasion shold be offered by <hi>Parmas</hi> forces, vnder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of <hi>Verdugo,</hi> beeing readie to besiege <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His Excellencie, on the 8 of Nouember, came to Arnham and quartered his camp in the towns nere adjoyning, the ammunition ordnance, &amp; bridges of boats were put in certain ships, to be readie at an houres warning, to make a running campe; for it was thought
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14840:78"/>
that his Excellencie had an intent to crosse the Rhyne, and to march into the countries of Valckenbourg and Luxembourg, to find the duke of Parma at Spa, but the said Prince his departure from thence to Bruxels brake off this enterprise.</p>
               <p>Those of Groeninguen were not yet moued by these exploits, nor by the losse of Steenwijck, and Coevoerden, to come to any agreement with their neighbours the Ommelands, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of Frize-Land, notwithstanding that a thousand head of Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile had been taken from them in a road, and had but one passage left open, namely Bourtaign, nere to Wedde: but Count <hi>Frederick</hi> of Berguen went thither in winter, with sixe ensignes of foot, and certaine horse for the countries safetie.</p>

               <p>AFter the Duke of Parmas death, the king of Spaine bestowed the gouernement of the Low-countries on Count <hi>Peter Ernest</hi> of Mansfelt, by prouiso (as they terme it) vntill the comming of Arch-Duke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> in which meane time, Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> and <hi>Stefano Diuarra,</hi> both Spaniards, were joyned with him as chiefe counsellors.

               <p>During this gouernement, the Spanish Counsellours would presently haue set the late Spanish crueltie committed by the Duke d'Alua, on foot, and commaunded the souldiers to keepe no more Quarter (as they call it) <hi>videlicet,</hi> not to release priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in exchange for others of the same qualitie, or in paying a moneths entertainement for their ransome, but would haue all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners to be rigorously chastised by the hand of the executioner.

This did they, the better to moue their owne people for feare of the gallowes to fight to the last man, and to be rather slayne fighing, than yeeld themselues prisoners. But common souldiers, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the warres more for pay than for honor, and makes an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation of the art militarie, wish for no such rigour, especially, seeing valour at this day is so slenderly rewarded, honoured and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed. Vnder this word Quarter, they likewise comprehend, not to pay any ransomes or contributions to the enemie. This did much trouble the Clergie, Gentlemen, and Boores, who haue the most part of their wealth lying abroad, and not in townes, beeing rather willing to pay small contribution for their safetie, than to haue their goods burnt and spoyled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mansfelt</hi> then by the aduice of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> published a declaration, dated the 5 of Ianuarie 1593, That no man should after that, pay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ransoms or contributions to the enemie, nor procure any pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from him on paine of death: but that euerie man should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to hinder the enemies incursions, to arme and fortifie against him, and by the larme bell to assemble themselues to kill and take their enemies prisoners and to hang them vp: whereupon, diuers souldiers on either side were hanged.</p>
               <p>The generall States of the vnited Prouinces, did likewise against this, publish a declaration dated on the seuen and twentieth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruarie, wherein they shewed how their enemies the Spaniards being straungers, sought nothing but the ruine and destruction of the Countrie, together with the peoples bloud and goods: en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating and exhorting all men to looke well vnto themselues, their Countrie, wiues and children, to resist such Spanish crueltie, and to deliberat thereupon, giuing them respit till Aprill follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, after which time, they would keepe no more Quarter, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them al for mortal enemies, intending to cause the Authors and counsellors of this rigorous Decree, to repent their rashnesse: and likewise all townes and villages, which following the tenure of <hi>Mansfelts</hi> letters, should arme, fortifie, and make defence against them, together with all those which should refuse to pay such rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable contribution as they were rated at. By this meanes after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, all these things were on either side permitted.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> in the time of winter, in anno 1593, assembled his forces vnder the conduct of his sonne <hi>Charles,</hi> vpon the fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Fraunce nere to Guyse, sending them into Fraunce there to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:14840:79"/>
employ them. In the meane time, my Lords the States of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prouinces, sent Count <hi>Philip</hi> of Nassau into Luxembourg, with foure thousand horse and foot, hoping to take some townes there, as S. Vit, and others; which he effected not, but caused all the garrisons to be drawne forth of Brabant. For so soone as the news of his being there came to Bruxels, all the horse and foot, both Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards and Italians, were taken forth of the townes of Liere, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines and other places, and were sent in great hast to the Countrie of Luxembourg, conducted by Count <hi>Barlaymont.</hi> Count <hi>Philip</hi> hauing notice thereof, retired, and in the meane time burnt many villages in the Countrie, and likewise leuied great exactions in the countrie of Limbourg, bringing many places vnder contribution, sacking the town of Hanuijt in Brabant, and hauing got much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, horse, and a great bootie, they returned to their Quarter.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, the States of the vnited Prouinces resolued to besiege the town of Geertrudenberg, a dependant on Holland, though seated in Brabant nere the Mase on a riuer called the Douge. This towne, in ann<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1589, was by certaine traitors sold to the Duke of Parma for 15 moneths pay (notwithstanding all honest and reasonable offers made vnto them) whereupon, they were all as traitors to the countrie condemned to be hanged, wheresoeuer they should be caught; most of whom were executed. The sayd States, had of a long time on sundrie pretences kept victuals from thence, by way of licence, and in Februarie, did cut off a Conuoy of all necessarie prouisions that was going thither: and hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that the gouernour was gone forth to meet the Conuoy, and that two did striue about the gouernement, they thought this occasion might greatly profit them, and thereupon gaue commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> to enuiron and shut in the towne with his Cauallerie, which he did, all the forces being returned from Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embourg, and the captaines hauing re-enforced their companies; and on the nine and twentieth of March he begirt the towne both by land and water, at such time when the Spaniards most doubted the siege of Sertoghenbusk or Graue.</p>
               <p>And because this siege is verie memorable and famous, we will relate the most remarkable matters; for the towne was strong, manned with more than a thousand old souldiers, and well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of all necessaries.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie lying before the towne, did at first quarter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:14840:80"/>
on the West-side thereof, with the regiments of Count <hi>Henrie</hi> his younger brother; of Count <hi>Solms, Groenevelt,</hi> and <hi>Balfour.</hi> Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> encamped towards the East, in a Village called Raemsdone beyond the riuer Douge, towards Oosterhoude, with the regiments of the Lords of Brederode, Lokres, and others, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie regiment presently fortifying his Quarter.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards had a Fort abroad, within musket shot of the town, vpon the causey of Steelhof, which secured the passage to the town: Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> did presently intrench before it, &amp; brought the channel of the riuer into those trenches, and with great danger of his life, tooke the free accesse of the fort to the towne from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, and planted the canon in an Island opposit to the conuoy and fort. Whereupon, the captain and garrison (perceiuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be cut off from the towne) yeelded the fort on the sixt of Aprill, and for their labours were imprisoned by the Marquesse of Varembon.</p>
               <p>The Fort being woon, his Excellencie made two bridges ouer the riuer, the one on boats, verie strong and broad, and the other vpon masts, that the two campes might helpe one another, which by reason of the marshes, lay a good mile from each other. On both sides the bridges before the towne, he placed ships of war to keepe continuall watch. For the riuer was as a dike, defending a great part of the camps trenches, there being diuers water mils and sluces to keepe the dikes of their trenches continually full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but by reason of the high tides, they were often hindred in their workes.</p>
               <p>On the waters side they enclosed the town with an halfe moone made with boats of warre, lying at anker, made fast by cables, and supported by small boats, wherein watch was kept. Without the said halfe moone ships of warre went too and fro, keeping good gard. Within it, certaine small boats stood sentinel beneath the towne: these, tooke a Spaniard swimming, that carried letters from Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and others; his Excellencie gaue him his life, and sent him backe to the enemies, to tell them how he was intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched.</p>
               <p>Without the halfe moone, towards the West and East of the towne, the boats that brought victuals lay, and were shrowded from the enemies canon. The campe on the water, was a German mile in length, euerie campe hauing his boats of ammunition and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:14840:80"/>
victuals. The mariners had likewise their campe apart, and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themselues valiantly by carrying wodden canons and emptie boats by night nere to the shore and Key, to cause the besieged to bestow their powder in vayne, whereof they had great need.</p>
               <p>His Excellencies campe on land, was enuironed with high ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers and deepe ditches without, with foure great and strong Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, on each of which lay two canon. Such was Count <hi>Hohen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> campe, extending it selfe two miles in circuit, and fortified with trenches, bulwarks, strong rauelins and broad dikes. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the campe, many stakes were pitched in the ground, and in each of them an Iron pike called Turkish ambassadors, so nere to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, as a man could hardly put his knee betwixt. The chief high waies were fortified with strong forts and rauelins stored with ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, so as an hundred canons were planted there, vpon the waies caltraps were laid, and deepe pits made stuft full of powder.</p>
               <p>Being thus intrenched abroad against the enemie, they likewise began to fortifie themselues against the townesmen, bringing their trenches vnder the Towne-walls: they planted their canon, and made galleries, vnder whose couert they might come to the towns rampiers. The besieged, beside their rampiers and caualleries, had two strong rauelins on the Land-side, opposit to which lay the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers and souldiers of <hi>Vtrechts</hi> batterie, which did so oppresse the towne, as euerie house almost was shaken, especially the Prince of Orange his Palace which was vtterly ruined.</p>
               <p>For making of these great workes and fortifications, the States had sent certain hundreds of boats prouided of al necessaries: and though the boores wrought in euerie place for pay, yet most of these great workes were done by souldiers, according to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the auntient Romans, not by constraint but for daily hire; and those dayes they were not vpon the gard, each of them was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in what labour he best liked, getting tenne or fifteen souls a day; by meanes whereof they wrought so hard, as they made themselues inuincible against the kings power which came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue the towne.</p>
               <p>So great good order &amp; discipline was likewise obserued among the soldiers &amp; mariners, as not only the boores which were in the campe, were freed from all outrage and violence, but they allured their neighbours of the countrie, to bring their corne, cattell and goods to the campe as a place of safetie and refuge; and by reason
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:14840:81"/>
of this strict discipline, they were as free as in any well gouerned towne, bringing their geese, hennes, eggs, butter, cheese, milke, and flesh to the Market, without any feare or trouble, to the great wonder of all men: yea the verie owners of the Lands nere adjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, did in diuers places plough, and till their grounds, whereby all things were cheaper than in any towne round about, whereas victuals in the enemies campe were sixe times dearer. Many came from all parts to behold his royall campe, which was so well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as euerie one admired it. The Princesse of Orange came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the Ladie <hi>Loysa,</hi> daughter to the Prince of Orange, who was going into Germanie to her husband the Elector Palatine of the Rhyne, with many other great Ladies. Diuers things were as remarkable in this siege, as in any other that hath beene these hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares.</p>
               <p>Those of the towne made braue defence and valiantly behaued themselues, they were well prouided of all necessaries, and made sundrie sallies. But the canon at last played on euerie side, and counter batteries were made vpon their canon, so as the wayes and rauelins were intrenched and beaten downe. Some hope and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of reliefe was sent them by many cunning meanes. Among others, the Lord of Waterdijke, on the seuenteenth of Aprill, sent letters vnto them from Sertoghenbusk by a pigeon which fel down in Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his campe, containing, that forces were readie to raise the siege, which they would without all doubt performe, and therefore they should doe well to heighthen the platforme of Ramsdouck, and from thence giue signals by fire according to the instructions sent them. His Excellencie by the same pigeon sent another letter to deceiue them.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> vpon a time caused the nearest ordnance to be secretly turned vpon the townes tower, from whence they vsually viewed the campe, and the besieged hourely expecting succours, he made a false alarme among his own soldiers as though aid had beene come, whereupon the gouernour and other commaunders ran presently vp to the tower to see what the matter was, on which on a sodaine Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> at once discharged all his ordnance, wherewith the gouernour and others were slaine, which did much weaken them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mansfelt, Fuentes,</hi> and other of the king of Spains commanders, weighing this disgrace if they did not relieue this town standing in
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:14840:81"/>
Brabant, called home <hi>Charles</hi> of Mansfelt from Fraunce, mustered all their regiments and sent them towards Turnhout, vnder the conduct of the Marquesse of Varrabon, which were often assailed by Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his cauallerie, which for the most part lay forth of the campe in the neighbour towns of Breda, Heusden, and Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen-op-Zoom. Among others, the lord of Risoyre, <hi>Marcelis Bacx,</hi> and captaine <hi>Egmont,</hi> did, on the eighth of Iune, with one hundred and ninetie horse, nere to Turnhout, encounter 400 horse, comming from the campe, and were going towards Antu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erpe to conuoy <hi>Varrabon</hi> and <hi>Barlaymont,</hi> whom they charged and defeated, chacing them to the castle of Turnhout, whether the Marquesse and count <hi>Barlaymont</hi> escaped; they brought three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score horse, and three captaines prisoners to Breda.</p>
               <p>About the 6 of May, <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and all his captaines came into the field, with his troopes of Lorrainers which came from the warres of Straesbourg, together with Suisses, Almans, Italians and Spaniards, who wold not willingly march without the companie of old <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dragon,</hi> that durst not leaue his castle of Antuerpe. <hi>Mansfelt</hi> in this maner being 30000 strong, came with 18 canon, many boats &amp; other prouisions, and encamped nere to his Excellencies quarter, in a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage called Hout, where he began to build a Fort on the causey of Steelhoof: wherupon, diuers skirmishes were made: but perceiuing that place to be too strong, he raised his camp towards the later end of May, and went to a village called Oosterhoudt, where he entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his armie, &amp; hauing staied there certain daies, &amp; vsed al means to annoy the princes campe, he departed likewise from thence with his campe towards a village called Waesbeec nere to count <hi>Hohen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los</hi> quarter; where (as in other places) he entrenched himselfe, the better to get victuals which hee wanted, so as count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> often skirmished with him, whereupon, <hi>Mansfelt</hi> durst no more make any attempt vpon his Excellencies campe.</p>
               <p>Whilest hee lay there, his Excellencie vpon some occasion sent a trumpet to him, of whom <hi>Mansfelt</hi> demaunded, why his Lord had so fortified and intrenched himselfe, telling him, that Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> like a braue and valiant young Lord that was iealous of his owne honour, ought to come forth of his fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and giue battaile: The Trumpet made this wise aunswer, saying, His Excellencìe of Nassau is a young Lord, that would willingly proue an old souldier, like vnto your Excellencie: this
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:14840:82"/>
made those that were present to smile, and caused <hi>Mansfelt</hi> to hold his peace, hauing met with so wittie an answer.</p>
               <p>During Count <hi>Mansfelts</hi> aboad there, one thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot, and twelue cornets of horse came to encrease h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s forces, which Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> sent him, together with foure great canon, foure and twentie firkins of money, and all sorts of ammunition for the campe.</p>
               <p>The day before the towne was taken, Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and Sir <hi>Frauncis Veer,</hi> made a braue skirmish, wherein (beside those that were slaine) they tooke fortie soldiers prisoners, &amp; 3 captains, euen in view of the towne, which daily made many signals by fire, and was wholly discouraged, so as the towne was taken in this manner following, in the view of Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> and his mightie armie.</p>
               <p>On the 24 of Iune, in the morning, as the Captaines <hi>Haen</hi> of Tournay, <hi>Beuerie,</hi> and <hi>Calfe,</hi> went vp to the gard to relieue those in the trenches vnder the townes North rauelin, they resolued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselues to mount vpon the rauelin to see what was done there, and caused a wodden bridge to be made ouer the dike oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to the bulwarkes point. <hi>Haen</hi> and <hi>Beuerie</hi> tooke two musketiers, two targuetiers, and two halberdiers with them, being in all eight persons, and so went vp verie secretly.</p>
               <p>Being mounted, and the Sentinel giuing th'alarme, these Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines called for more souldiers to assist them; whilest they fought with those of the gard, one of their targuetiers was slaine, and the most of their souldiers mounted: they fought hand to hand a long time, so as 16 of the besiegers were slaine, &amp; of the besieged 9, who were enforced to quit the rauelin &amp; to retire into the towne: &amp; because the towns gouernor was slain at the same time whose name was captain <hi>Tigean,</hi> &amp; had bin the third gouernor, they were much danted, &amp; sent to craue a parley, which was hardly granted, because the souldiers more and more got vpon the rauelin. At last they sent two captaines and the Auditor of the garrison to Count <hi>Solms</hi> who had alreadie entred it.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> &amp; those of the Councel of war were busied in skirmish with <hi>Mansfelt,</hi> &amp; so soon as they heard this news, they scarce beleeued it, thinking the captaines had made a skirmish by chance, hauing no commission so to do.

               <p>After the departure of the enemies souldiers, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with his forces entred the towne, and found it so well prouided of all necessaries, as had it not beene taken in this manner he would haue lost more men in the attempt, so as himselfe gaue the glorie vnto God, and exhorted others to doe the like: His officers found eight hundred pound weight of powder there, beside, flesh, fish, bread, beare, salt and corne, of all which they had plentie. In this siege three hundred men were slaine, and foure hundred hurt. He made his brother Count <hi>Henrie Frederick</hi> gouernour there (vnto whom the Prince his father, of happie memorie, by his testament had bequeathed the towne) and the Lord <hi>Arent</hi> of Duvenvoord his Lieutenant, and on a sodaine all the trenches were leuelled. <hi>Mansfelt</hi> perceiued not that the towne was yeelded, till such time as he saw our men to displant the canon on euerie side, and that the armed men burnt straw vpon their pikes ends.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Mansfelt</hi> hauing intelligence of the townes losse, raysed his campe on the 26 of Iune, and marched by the Lang-straet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bommeler-weert, thinking by force to haue surprised the Fort of Crevecoeur, which stands nere the Mase at the mouth of the riuer Diese, opposit to Heele in Brabant: But those of Gorcum and Bommell, had in part preuented it, by stopping the water nere to the sayd fort, whereby all the water which runneth by Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toghenbusk forth of the riuers Dommell and Aa, drowned the countrie round about.</p>

Those of Crevecoeur Skonse, did presently bend all their ordnance thitherward, with which they greatly annoyed the enemie who lay open without any shelter, and imprisoned by water: So as many of them were miserably slaine there.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> fortified the frontiers and Bommeler-weert,

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:14840:84"/>
towne of Groeninguen to extremitie; but the sayd Earle percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the enemie to be too strong for him, and that he had taken the towne of Ootmarsen, and fearing if he should go to encounter <hi>Verdugo,</hi> the enemie might inuade Frizeland, he marched with his forces towards the Lecke, and knowing that the forces of Sloch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teren, Wintschoten and Wedde, with other small Skonses in the vaert or passage, could not long hold out against the canon, hee sent them word on paine of death not to yeeld the sayd places, till the canon were planted against them: this he did to win time, and to be the better able to finish his chiefe fort vpon the Bourtagne, which he had begun; to master and oppresse those of Grounin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guen, and he had alreadie brought it so forward, as by the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof no canon could be brought to batter it: The rampiers were of the hight of a pike, the Dike was at least fourescore foot broad, full of water and verie deepe: It had fiue bulwarks, two of them faced the enemie, the storehouse was built, and the souldiers cabins made, and it was prouided of all necessaries for two mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths, and beside, they might fetch whatsoeuer they needed from the countrie of Westphalia, in despite of the enemie. There lay fiue ensignes of foot in it, commaunded by the Gouernor <hi>Gerard</hi> the yonger, and if this fort could be kept, they made no doubt but in time to take the towne of Groninguen. Therefore Count <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> perceiuing <hi>Verdugo</hi> to be master of the field, and that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected greater forces vnder the conduct of Count <hi>Herman</hi> of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen, he durst in no sort stir abroad, but stood on his defence, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for more ayd vnder the comaund of Sir <hi>Frauncis Veer</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and his Excellencie had promised him if need were, to come himselfe thither with an armie.</p>
               <p>The Grouninguers requested <hi>Verdugo</hi> to diuide his forces into two troopes, and to besiege Reyden, and Bellingwoderzile, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to cut off victuals from the fort of Bourtange, and to that end they were readie to send him sixe double canon: But he allowed not thereof, fearing least Count <hi>William</hi> comming to Slochteren Skonse would cut off his passage betwixt that and Grouninguen, and hinder the comming of his canon: and though he should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege those towns, he was in doubt to be daily assailed by him. And because <hi>Verdugo</hi> in that place could not make vse of his horsemen, he resolued to goe and besiege the Fort of Bourtange, where in a short space he wanted victuals, and was enforced on a sodaine to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:14840:84"/>
raise his siege, causing a report to be made that he ment to besiege Coevoerden, and so matched on Groeninguens side, from thence craftily taking his way in October towards Count <hi>Williams</hi> campe, to assaile him on the sodaine and vnlookt for, which he might easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue done, had not a souldier stollen forth of a little Skonse by which <hi>Verdugo</hi> passed, and giuen th'alarme, by which meanes the campe arriued, which the same day began to fortifie and intrench, and had almost made it defensible: the enemie could come no nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer it than within musket shot, and onely made some skirmish which continued sixe or seuen houres till night, in which time <hi>Verdugo</hi> sought to draw them forth into the field; but Count <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> would not come forth of his fortifications, so as <hi>Verdugo</hi> was enforced to retire towards Groeninguen with great losse, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his long skirmishes. Count <hi>William</hi> lost one Captaine and many braue souldiers, the Scottish colonel <hi>Balfour</hi> was hurt in the foot with diuers others.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verdugo</hi> perceiuing his attempts on Count <hi>Williams</hi> campe to be vaine, and that winter would driue him forth of the field, and fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but small store of victuals in the countrie, because that the boores of the Ommelands and countrie of Drent were retired into the forts and townes, he marched towards Coevoerden: and seeing that the countrie on one side of the towne was high, he caused a way to be made within canon shot of it, with hurdles and fagots, couering them with grauell taken from vnder the mudd in the marshes, and on this way he caused two or three forts to be built as farre as the Drossarts house, and that of Steenwijck, and by that meanes did shut vp the towne passages from those of Coevoerden, in that maner besieging them. But these forts being wet and mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, many souldiers died in them that winter to the number of two thousand. <hi>Verdugo,</hi> with the remainder of his forces, went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Oldenzell, where most of his souldiers afflicted with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie and sicknesse ran from him both horse and foot. Of 2000 Lorraines, onely foure hundred were left; seuen ensignes of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons were brought to so small a number, as they durst not for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie shame vnfold their colours. <hi>Verdugo</hi> went to Lingen to meet with a new regiment of foot, leuied by the young Duke of Saxonie, whose Lieutenant Colonel was by the garrison of Deuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum and others, taken prisoner, and an hundred of his men slaine, the rest fled. In the meane time, <hi>Verdugo</hi> and Count <hi>Herman</hi> sent
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14840:85"/>
consolatorie letters to the Groeninguers, which were intercepted, whereby they intreated them to take courage, for they were going into Brabant to craue more ayd of <hi>Ernestus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Count <hi>William</hi> thus freed from his enemie, sent part of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to garrison, and placed another part at Visflit to keepe the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Vrijse against the enemie, and himselfe with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men embarked at Zoltcampe, and went towards Bellingwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derzill, to recouer the Fort of Wedde, which they tooke, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finished the new Fort of Bourtange, making prouisions to send to those of Coevoerden during the frost. The Grouninguers in the mean time made readie a conuoy to send to <hi>Verdugos</hi> forces before Coevoerden; but Count <hi>Philip</hi> of Nassau lay in wait for it with 500 horse, and his enterprise being discouered, hee tooke but fiftie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.</p>
               <p>Coevoerden by reason of <hi>Verdugos</hi> forts hauing beene oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by 300 foot, and foure hundred horse; the vnited Prouinces, did in Germanie leuie a regiment of Almans vnder the conduct of count <hi>Euerard</hi> of Solms, cousin german to prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> together with certaine horse: the Queene of England likewise permitted them to raise a regiment of English in her realme, who were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded by Sir <hi>Frauncis Veer. Verdugo</hi> and Count <hi>Herman</hi> were busied at Bruxels, crauing more ayd of <hi>Ernestus.</hi> The Grounin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers sent a present of siluer plate, and twentie goodly horse to count <hi>Ernest</hi> of Mansfelt, which were taken by the States souldiers. That done, his Excellencie with his whole Cauallerie, and two and fiftie ensignes of foot went towards Arnham, there to receiue his cousen count <hi>Euerard</hi> of Solms, the regiment of Almaus, and certaine horse, but their arriuall was delayed by reason of the high waters and bad wayes, so as they were enforced to come by boat. <hi>Verdugo</hi> had likewise done his best to assaile them nere to Lippe at a narrow passage: He went from Coevoerden with eleuen cornets of horse, and certaine foot companies, but he came too late, because they were alreadie gone. These forces beeing come nere to Ys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seloort consisting of two thousand sixe hundred foot, and 260 horse, the States sent a commaund to the next garrisons to meet nere to Zwoll, whether Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> likewise came, to goe and raise the siege of Coevoerden. <hi>Ernestus</hi> suspecting it, sent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thither from Brabant, but his Excellencie made shew to stop their passage ouer the Rhyne, and so kept them backe as much as
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:14840:85"/>
as in him lay. In the meane time he made hast to joyne with count <hi>William</hi> of Naslau, who had alreadie prouided 1000 wagons, with all manner of prouisions, and had now 10000 foot, and 2000 gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant horse, who met both together at Zwoll, and on the 5 of May, they went from thence in good order to Dae'ffem, &amp; the 6 of May, in like order to Ommen: <hi>Verdugo</hi> thought it not good to attend them, but resolued, on the 6 of May, to raise his siege and to quit the forts by night, and the same day he departed without sound of drum, 'ogether with al his old regiments, as those of Chimay, Aren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, the counts <hi>Herman</hi> and <hi>Frederick</hi> of Berghen, marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Lingen, diuers of his men running from him by the way, so as Coevoerden was freed from the siege, and the forts taken and manned against the enemies assaults.</p>

                  </note> Count <hi>William,</hi> on the last of May, sent 8 ensigns of Prisons before the fort of Auwaerd-zijll, where 135 men lay, who were assaulted and battered, with 8 pieces of ordnance; &amp; after 182 shot had made a breach, they gaue an assault on the one side with bridges and ladders, whilest some on the other side (the besieged mistrusting no such matter, because the marshes lay on that side) passed on hurdles &amp; bridges secretly vnder the rampiers, &amp; moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:14840:86"/>
the fort, firing the powder and cabins; where captaine <hi>Prenger</hi> was slaine.</p>
               <p>The besieged, being terrified with their surprisal, begged for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which was not graunted, because, not long before the taking of the fort, they had vsed some crueltie, and giuen vile and hautie spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the drum that summoned them to yeeld: whereupon, they were all slaine (some 8 or 9 excepted.) It was a verie strong place, 20 of our men were slaine there, and threescore hurt.</p>
               <p>On the 28 of May, his Excellencie summoned those of the fort of Slochteren, who refused to yeeld, yet they fled away by night, as did those of the fort of Hagenbrug, &amp; other Skonses. Before the taking of these forts there was scarcitie in the camp, these skonses enclosing all the passages, but afterwards all things were verie cheape there, by reason of a channell they made, by which all prouisions were brought to the great campe by boat.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie had with him more than sixtie pieces of ordnance of all sorts; and the better to plant his canon, was constrayned to begin a farre off, because the townesmen made a fierce counterbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie vpon him, for they had store of ordnance, with more than 400 great barrels of powder and other necessaries, so as few townes in the Netherlands were so well prouided. The towne is verie popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the Burghers trained vp in armes, of great antiquitie, and haue a long time liued in freedome: there was no garrison in it, but the meaner sort of the inhabitants serued in stead of souldiers, and receiued pay from the king of Spayne. Beside these, they had still <hi>Verdugos</hi> troopes at their commaund, and now during the siege, fiue ensignes of old souldiers, vnder the conduct of colonel <hi>George de Lauckema,</hi> who lay without the towne in a strong place called Schuytendiep, beneath the town walls, and were there readie vpon any occasion.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> with his ordnance did no great harm to the town, whose rampiers, bulwarks &amp; rauelins were exceeding strong, from whence they made aboue 4000 shot vpon the campe.</p>
               <p>They likewise made sundrie fallies, especially vpon the English quarter, where, among others, the Captaines <hi>Brooke</hi> and <hi>Wray</hi> were slaine. Those of Schuytendiep, also, did on a time in the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, surprise <hi>Hittinga</hi> and <hi>Hardo,</hi> Captaines of two companies of Frizons, whose matches the raine had put out; they slew fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen men, and tooke seuenteene prisoners, together with the two
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:14840:86"/>
ensignes: whereupon, the trenches round about the campe were made stronger.</p>
               <p>Our men shot wildfire into the towne, so as many that were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in quenching it, perished by the canon: and the besiegers profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted little by battering the rampiers, because the besieged did speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaire them: our men did beat down a gate, and a way or bridge leading to a Rauelin, and did likewise vndermine certaine Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes, filling the Dikes, so that the Burghers by little and little began to be discouraged, as also for that their messengers sent to <hi>Ernestus</hi> and <hi>Verdugo</hi> gaue them small hope: whereupon, by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine trumpets and other messengers they began to treat on meanes of capitulation. This treatie being suspected by diuers (as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and Iesuits) who feared that the meaner sort would carrie it away, did, vnknowne to all the rest, call the fiue companies that lay at Schuytendiep into the towne,<note place="margin">

               <p>ALthough it may seeme impertinent to set down (among the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallant victories which the Authour of all goodnesse hath by his Excellencies conduct graunted to these countries) the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, strange, and tedious voyages to the Northward, Way-gate, and Noua Zemla, as also towards the East-Indies; yet for diuers reasons following, I cannot forget or passe them ouer in silence. First, albeit the Northerne voyage hath not much profited these countries, yet those to the Easterne Indies, haue on the contrarie beene verie commodious: So as my lords the generall States haue much annoyed the king of Spaine in those parts, who thinkes that these countries doe alone belong vnto him; and haue thereby much diminished his power and reuenews, and freed the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands from more grieuous and tedious warre. Secondly, I thought good here to insert them, that when the Reader shal look vpon the victories which these vnited prouinces haue obtained against the king of Spaine, he may here likewise find the valorous actions of our countrimen, and al that they haue done and endured abroad in forreine countries many thousand miles from home, to the ruine &amp; diminution of the greatnesse of this Spanish <hi>Pharao:</hi> as also by this meanes the better to moue and incite their children &amp; successors to the like, or if it be possible to greater &amp; more noble enterprises. 3. To
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:14840:90"/>
the end that the inhabitants of these vnited Prouinces may neuer forget but alway remember, that the Almightie and onely good God, hath not alone thus blessed, preserued and defended them from the power of the king of Spaine and his bloudie Councell: but likewise how so small a countrie hath beene able to make head against the mightiest potentate of Christendome, hauing not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept their owne, but inuaded him in his owne land, as we alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die haue and will hereafter set down: Beside, that these countries for the space of fortie yeares that the wars haue lasted (contrarie to the nature of war) are become so rich and potent, as in the midst of all these great sieges so dearely bought, they haue yet been able to send forth ships (with exceeding expence) to annoy their enemies. We will first speake of the Northern voyages, and of Noua Zemla.</p>
               <p>The vnited Prouinces liuing vnder a free gouernement, hauing shaken off the Pope and king of Spaines yoke, excelling all nations in the world in nauigation and number of ships, the countrie bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of good mariners and men skilful in marine matters, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are more expert than others, as appeares by their works and learned Cosmographies, thought it fit to lay hold on that occasion which in former times had bin snatched from them by their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the 5 and his son king <hi>Philip,</hi> in regard of the Spaniards and Portuguise, who were first discouerers of the new &amp; Eastern Indies; so as by aduise of diuers Pilots and learned Cosmographers, they haue caused a way and passage to be sought out to the North-East, to passe by Tartarie to the countries of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thay, China, and Eastern Indies, and so to the Islands of Iapan, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucques, &amp;c. which, by two voyages made by the English, the first by sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> and the other by <hi>Candish,</hi> who compassed the world, hath bin more and more discouered. The Englishmen haue often sought out this way to the Northward, as in an<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1553, by <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> &amp; <hi>Rich. Chancelor: Willoughby</hi> went into Groenland, where he was frozen, and there found more than a yere after, together with his men and prouision. But <hi>Chancelor</hi> arriued in Muscouy, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered that way which the English &amp; Flemmings haue euer since yearely vsed. After that, <hi>Setphen Burrows</hi> in anno 1556, and after him in the yeare 1580, <hi>Arthure Pet</hi> and <hi>Charles Iackman</hi> English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, found out a passage by Way-gate towardes Tartarie: And then <hi>Oliuer Brunell</hi> of Holland discouered the riuer of Pechora. But al these (though they seemed not to be far off from the passage)
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:14840:91"/>
could neuer find it. The English likewise sought out a passage to the North-West, along the coast of America, or new Fraunce, as sir <hi>Martin Forbisher</hi> thrice with diuers ships.</p>
               <p>After him, <hi>Iohn Dauies</hi> discouered two hundred leagues further, thinking to find America to be an Island, and to passe behind the North to the Southward, and so to goe to China, but hitherto no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been done.</p>
               <p>In this regard, the States of the vnited Prouinces, did, toward the end of the yeare 1594, sent foure ships to those parts, one, a ship of Amsterdam, vnder the commaund of <hi>William Barrentsen</hi>; one of Zeland, of Campeveer, vnder <hi>Cornelius Cornelison</hi>; and one of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuysen, with <hi>Iohn Hugh</hi> of Linschoten, who had remained in the Indies with <hi>Isebrand Tetcales.</hi> All these setting saile on the fifth of Iune, those of Amsterdam tooke an higher course seuentie seuen degrees to the Northward (where in August they met with store of yee and sea monsters) giuing names to hauens: but the mariners being vnwilling, who feared that they should not be able to passe forward, they resolued to returne. The two other ships met with Islands, vnto which they gaue names. At last, they likewise found a passage, euen in a mist, as if God had brought them vnto it, for which they thanked him. They found that strait to be verie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medious and deepe, wherein great and small ships might ride, and to be fiue or six leagues in length: and after that sailed into a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, larger and warmer Sea, where they saw the yce to melt before their faces, and so went to the coast of Tartarie neere to the riuer Oby,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The strait of Nassau found out to the North-East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in anno</hi> 1595.</note> where they found Islands, men, and a fertile soile. They gaue names to those countries, and called the strait, <hi>the strait of Nassau,</hi> and as they supposed they might haue passed on farther, if they had had commission so to doe, and more prouision; and so rejoycing, they returned to the strait, setting vp markes euerie where, and on the sixteenth of September in anno 1595, they came backe to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam.</p>
               <p>Vpon the report, the States resolued to further the voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirous to plant the Christian faith in those countries, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Spanish manner by force of armes, but by Christian means, dealing gently with the inhabitants, therby seeking to augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t their nauigation, fishing and traffique; this way being two thousand Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man leagues shorter than the Portugals voiage, by the cape of Good hope, much safer and free from Pirats, and lesse subject to diseases,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:14840:91"/>
because they need not passe the Equinoctiall lyne as the Portugals doe, foure times, forward and backward.</p>
               <p>The States of the vnited Prouinces, caused another voyage to be made, and the yere following sent forth seuen ships, two from Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, two from Enchusen, two from Zeland, and one from Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam: six were loden with all kind of Merchandize and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, euerie ship hauing his committee for traffike: the seuenth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a small vessell, was commaunded to returne, so soone as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were past the cape of Tabin (which they met with before they come to the last point of Tartarie) to bring home newes of the other ships. <hi>Iacob de Heemskerck,</hi> was committee general of the fleet, and <hi>William Barrentson</hi> chiefe Pilot. Some of them were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to winter in those quarters, to know how long the winter and yce doth continue, hauing to that end prouision with them to make Stoues. The most learned Cosmographers doubt not of the passage, but onely of the promontorie of Tabins extension more to the Northward, which diuers thinke to be impossible, because that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Indians (as Plinie writes seuentie &amp; two yeres before the birth of Christ) were by tempest throwne vpon the coast of Germanie,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and presented to <hi>Quintus Metellus Celer,</hi> gouernour for the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans in Fraunce. Since then, some came into Swethland, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as <hi>Dominicus Niger</hi> writes) came in the Emperour <hi>Frederick Barbarossus</hi> time, in the yeare 1160, and after that (as <hi>Otho</hi> speakes in his Historie of the Goths) certaine Indians of the Eastern Indies were cast vpon our coast: so as there is hope, that by the same way that these people came (being aliue and in health and not knowing any place) our men being wel furnished of all necessaries may make discouerie, or may fal vpon the riuers of Oby and Quian, which go farre vp into Tartarie; from whence they may more and more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer countries. If this passage could be found out, traffike would be changed ouer the whole world; for those countries do abound in silke, cotton, wooll, lead, tinne, copper, gold, siluer, and pretious stones. The chiefe aduenturers in this voyage, for Zeland, are, <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob Valck</hi> Tresorer of Zeland, <hi>Christopher Roelsins</hi> pentioner to the States of Zeland, with diuers merchants, as <hi>Balthasar Moucheron</hi>; and at Amsterdam, <hi>Peter Plancius, Iohn Ianson Charles, Dirrick de Osse,</hi> and many others.</p>
               <p>These seuen ships, vpon hope of good successe, did altogether on the second of Iulie, depart from Texell to the Northward, and

sayling towards the North-East, in an<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 1595, they found too much yce at the strait of Nassau; for by reason of contrarie winds they came thither too late: and after sundrie daungers and difficulties, without attaining their wished Port, returned, on the 18 of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uember, the same yeare, into the Mase, not despairing for all that to find out the passage some other time. Whereupon, the same voyage was againe attempted the third time by the Magistrats of the towne of Amsterdam (because the States of the vnited Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were no longer willing to prosecute that discouerie at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries cost, but promised to giue a good summe of money to him that should find out the same passage) who, at the beginning of the yeare 1596, manned forth two ships, and agreed with the mariners on two conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> what to haue, if they performed not the voyage, and what recompence they should haue if they found out the way to China: promising them great reward if they could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer the passage. They tooke as few married men as could be, because they would not haue them to returne home by their loue to their wiues and children, before they had prosecuted the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
               <p>The Master, and Committee for trade in one of the ships, was <hi>Iacob de Heemskerck,</hi> and the chiefe Pilot <hi>William Barentsoon</hi>; and in the other <hi>Iohn Cornellison Rijp</hi> was Master and Committee.</p>
               <p>On the 16 of May 1596, they went from the Vlie, but by a North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>East wind were with great danger enforced to put in againe: And on the 18 of the sayd moneth they pursued their journey, and say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led so farre to the Northward, as on the 19 of Iune they came to the height of eightie degrees and eleuen minutes, where they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried a new countrie, whether they bent their course, and entred certaine leagues vp into a Bay: they supposed this countrie to be Groenland, which stands vnder the height of 80 degrees, where they found greene grasse, cattel feeding vpon it, and farre lesse cold and yce than when they were vnder the height of 76 degrees.</p>
               <p>From thence they returned to an Island, which they had before named the land of Beares, in regard of the great number of white beares they found there, nere to this Island the two ships departed from one another: <hi>Iohn Cornellis</hi> sayled backe againe towardes eightie degrees, thinking there to find a passage on the East-side of the sayd countrie; but that ship did no great matter, but returned home into Holland.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:14840:92"/>The other, wherein <hi>William Barentsoon</hi> and <hi>Heemskerke</hi> were, sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towards Noua Zemla, where they rounded the coasts to the Northward, till they came to an Island called the Isle of Orange, in the height of 77 degrees: from whence they went South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, where they found much yce, so as they could discouer the land no farther: and on the last of August went with their ship to land, where it was soone frozen, so as they were enforced to remain there, where they resolued to build an house with timber which they found on the Sea shore, into which they carried their victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and merchandize, and there continued all winter, where they were extreamely tormented with cold and snow: the like whereof was neuer heard. The inner walls of this house where these thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or foureteene men lay, was frozen an handfull thicke onely with their breaths, notwithstanding they kept a continuall fire day and night.</p>
               <p>They were likewise much molested with white beares, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured some of their men: there were store of white foxes, which they tooke and did eat.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Perpetual night in Noua Zemla all winter till the</hi> 27 <hi>of Ianuarie.</hi>
                  </note> All winter long they saw no day nor sunne till the foure and twentieth of Ianuarie 1596, when it appeared a little, but on the seuen and twentieth of the said moneth, they saw the sunne in his full circumference.</p>
               <p>The 22 of Iune, these men departed thence with two great boats which they had prouided, and left their ship sticking still in the yce. They left a written scrowle in the house, put vp into the bandelier of a musket, which they hung vp in the chimney, wherein was written, how they came thither with an intent to goe from Noua Zemla to China, &amp; how necessitie had enforced them to returne home in two boats. In this manner, with much trauell, miserie and cold, they arriued on the second of October 1597, at Cola in Lapland, where they found their other ship with <hi>Iohn Cornellis,</hi> who had alreadie made one voyage into Holland, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethether with him returned home on the 26 of October, but <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Barrentsoon</hi> dyed by the way.</p>
               <p>Hauing briefely spoken of the voyages to Noua Zemla, we will now proceed to those of the Easterne Indies. The reasons mouing my lords the States, and the inhabitants of these countries to begin and vndertake these voyages, are these.</p>
               <p>They perceiued that their trade with Spaine grew euerie day more daungeros, for their ships were stayed, goods confiscat, their
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:14840:93"/>
masters and merchants imprisoned vnder colour that they came from the Low-countries, and were questioned by those of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition concerning their religion, or else enforced for poore wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to serue the king against their countrie and conscience.</p>
               <p>These considerations moued some to establish a companie, and to seeke meanes to trade to the Eastern Indies: so as in the yeare 1594, nine merchants of Amsterdam entred into an association together, <hi>viz. Henrick Hudde, Reynier Pau, Peter Dirrickson Hasse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laer, Iohn Ianson Carrel, Iohn Poppe, Henrick Buyck, Dirrick de Osse, Siuert Peter,</hi> and <hi>Aert</hi> of Grootenhuys: these were the first that traded to the Eastern Indies, and were termed <hi>The farre companie.</hi> They built foure new ships, <hi>viz.</hi> two great ones of the burthen of foure hundred and sixtie tunne, the one was called Mauritius in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> and carried sixe brasen pieces, and foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene of yron, being well stored with small shot, and manned with eightie foure men, hauing for Master <hi>Iohn Ianson Molender,</hi> and <hi>Cornellis Houtman</hi> for committee. The other was called Hollandia, manned with eightie fiue men, and carried seuen pieces of brasse, twelue of yron, with store of small shot: hir master was <hi>Iohn Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> and the committee <hi>Gerard de Boninge.</hi> The third was termed Amsterdam, wherein were nine and fiftie men, six brasen pieces, tenne of yron, the master was <hi>Iohn Iacob Schillinger,</hi> &amp; the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee <hi>Reynier de Hel</hi>; it was of the burthen of two hundred tunne. The fourth was a pinnace called the Doue, of fiftie tunne, manned with twentie men, and carried two pieces of brasse, and six of yron, the masters name was <hi>Simon Lambrecht.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These ships being rigd and set forth by the States of Holland were bound for the East Indies, to begin the nauigation and trade of spice with the Indians, especially there where the Portugals had no commaund, thereby to auoyd Spanish impositions.</p>
               <p>These foure new ships being well stored with all necessaries for a long voyage, and manned with two hundred and fiftie men, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Texell the second of Aprill 1595, and held on their course towards the Cape of Good hope, where by the way they met with a Portugal Carrack, carrying the Archbishop of Goa to the Indies, which they might haue taken, yet according to their commission they medled not with it, but onely went aboord her as louing friends.</p>
               <p>The second of August, they descried the sayd Cape, where their

               <p>The Indians after that, had like to haue surprised them vnder colour of friendship; diuers of the Hollanders committees, and the chiefe Pilot were slayne, so as they could not prosecute their trade any longer there: whereupon, perceiuing themselues to want men, they vnloded one of their ships called Amsterdam, and burnt it, the better to man the rest.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth of Ianuarie 1597, they resolued to returne home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and came to the Islle of Balie, scituat to the Eastward of the great Island Iaua, where they were kindly vsed and welcomed by the king, so that two Hollanders did voluntarily remaine in that countrie.</p>
               <p>From thence, being well stored with rice, water, and such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions as they could get, they set saile on the one and twentieth of March 1597, to return homeward, and on the seuenth of May, dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the cape of Good hope, and on the fiue and twentieth of the said moneth, came to S.

In the Castle was a weake garrison, 24 or thirtie of our men were hid in a little house vnder the castle which stands high vpon a rock, ouer this little house was one of the Castles windowes: these thirtie men with a ladder made of ropes got vp to the window, which they brake and entred: some among them knew euerie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the castle, so as in the Morning when the chiefe of the castle went forth of their houses thinking to goe to Masse, they were on a sodaine taken by the throat, bound, and layd in a dungeon; which done, they tooke the castle and gate, and some moued the towne to yeeld. The Burghers ran to armes, thinking to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but perceiuing <hi>Herauguier</hi> to come forwards with his troops, they compounded, and suffered him to enter with three ensignes of foot, and two cornets of horse, on the 8 of Februarie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herauguiere</hi> fortified the towne and castle, reducing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies countries neere adjoyning, vnder contribution. The Towne was verie well seated for our men to make an offensiue warre, it beeing a passage into the countries of Namur and Brabant, neere to the confines of Luxembourg, where they supposed to obtayne great victories, vnder the conduct of the duke of Bouillon, &amp; count <hi>Philip</hi> of Nassau.</p>

               <p>But the Bishop complained to the States of the wrongs done vnto him, and of the breach of the neutrallitie, crauing to haue his town redeliuered, and therein imployed al his friends: but because small regard was had of his complaints, hee implored the ayd and assistance of the Archduke <hi>Ernestus,</hi> who presently sent forces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to free the countries of Namur and Brabant from incursion, with commaundement to ayd the Bishop; these troopes notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Ernestus</hi> death, besieged the towne of Huy, because they perceiued it could not easily be relieued. <hi>Herauguieres,</hi> with Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Balfort, le Vos,</hi> and others, did shut themselues into the towne, and yet the waters were risen ouer the whole countrie by reason of the great snow which was melted by a continuall raine,<note place="margin">

Beside these, there were three great Fregats of two hundred tunne a piece, which came from Porto Ricco with the money. Besides these ships of warre and gallies, there was another fleet of fiue and thirtie ships verie richly loden, which were bound for the West Indies, readie to set saile; in which vessels were aboue sixe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pipes of Spanish wines, two thousand pipes of oyle, fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand weight of wax, and all manner of pretious merchandize, as cloth, silke, cloth of gold, lace, quick-siluer, &amp;c.

               <p>The Vice-Admerrall the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> and sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> being sent for by the Councell of warre, <hi>Raleigh</hi> was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to goe before with certaine ships to set vpon some great vessels, which (as they heard) were readie to set saile forth of the

But night preuented them, the sun being alreadie set, so as it was then too late to assaile the Spanish fleet that lay aboue a mile and halfe within the riuer, as also, for that it was a dangerous matter to fight by night in a strait: On this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, they came to an ankor, where the canon presently salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them from the towne and castle.</p>
               <p>The English went to Councel, to consult after what maner it were best to assaile the Spaniards the next Morning: euerie commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der striued to haue the vantgard, yet they resolued not to hazard the Queenes great ships but vpon vrgent necessitie, so as it was thought fit, that sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> with eight of the Queenes les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesser
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:14840:97"/>
ships, six Hollanders, and twelue English Merchants ships, should haue the vantguard; this resolution was oppugned by the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> who said, that honour belonged vnto him: whereupon it was concluded, that both of them should goe together.</p>
               <p>So soone as it was day, <hi>Raleigh</hi> would not loose time in weighing ankor, but did let them slip, and thereby had the aduauntage to let saile first; the Spanish gallies discharged all their ordnance vpon him, but he made not one shot, leauing it to those that followed him, and so went directly towards the gallions, which lay in the deepest part of the riuer, <hi>viz.</hi> the S. Philip, S. Mathew, S. Andrew, and S. Thomas, with two other verie great ships, which together tooke vp all the bredth of the riuer.</p>
               <p>Behind these gallions lay 6 others, and behind them, the gallies, nerer the shore where the water was shal lowest, and vpon the land stood the castle Puntall which flanked the riuer: the lesser English ships assailed the gallies, who thundred one vpon another. In the mean time, the Vice-Admeral the L. <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> came vp to sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> with 6 of the Queens ships, as nere to the gallions as they could possible, discharging all their ordnance, and fighting from six of the clocke in the Morning till none, with as many ships as the channel could beare. During the fight, an vnfortunat euent happened in a ship of Rotterdam, called the Dolphin, where <hi>Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laum Henrick</hi> was captaine; the powder was by mischaunce set on fire, whereby the Captaine and his two sonnes were burnt and blowne vp.</p>
               <p>Expecting the tide, the two Admerals sent for six great vessels, each of them manned with foure hundred musketiers, to boord the Spanish gallions, being not willing to hazard the Queenes ships: Six ships of Lubeck and Dansk were sent from the fleet, but they fell foule of the others, and peraduenture willingly, so as the earle of Essex about noone did set saile, the like did the Lord Admerall; but the Earles ship drawing too much water, he went aboord sir <hi>Robert Dudleis,</hi> who was base sonne to the earle of Leycester: All the commaunders being aboord the generall, they resolued to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile the gallions, commaunding the Lord <hi>Howard</hi> and sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to begin, and they would follow.

               <p>The S. Mathew and S. Andrew were saued from running on ground, and were carried away, each of them were of one thousand tunne. The two Easterlings ran on shore and were burnt.

               <p>These, with 600 foot drawne from Cales, did presently offer skirmish.

               <p>The English being thus within the town, two companies of sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that lay there in garrison, with many of the townesmen, fled to the castle; others with stones, defended themselues in their houses.

               <p>The towne taken, and night being come, the two Generals en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> to returne to the fleet to his ship (fearing least the Galleis should the same night at a low water set fire on the ships) promising to keepe his share of the bootie, and to giue him a good quarter in the towne. He craued leaue to goe and take the Indian fleet, desiring no more than his owneship and twelue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men of London, but the Generals entreated him to giue them time to consider of it till the next morning: at which time sir <hi>Walter</hi> sent his brother in law <hi>Throgmorton, Henrie Leonard,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> knights, to know their resolution; but the Generals sent him word to come a shore to the towne.</p>

                  </note> the Spaniards day and night vnloded all the richest wares, because that the Duke of <hi>Medina</hi> gouernour of S Lucars and those parts for the king, had commaunded to burn the ships, which was done vpon the third day before the ransome could be agreed vpon: the men saued themselues and escaped, so as the contractors that were onward on their way to negociat for the ransome, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the ships to be all on fire: this was a sharpe and rigorous resolution, for which the Duke was greatly contemned by those that had a share in this losse; but he knew the king his Masters mind.</p>
               <p>Three and thirtie great ships laden for the Indies were burnt, beside fiue ships which came from S. Lucars, three of which ran on ground: it was the greatest and welthiest fleet that euer went to the Indies. The most losse fell to the Merchants, the king had some wealth in it, as quicke siluer, warlike munition, his Imposts and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caualles, which, together with all his ordnance he lost. The English and Dutch mariners saued certaine goods, and canons, which they tooke forth of the ships bottoms.</p>
               <p>The earle of Essex had appointed the colonels sir <hi>Coniers Clifford,</hi> Sir <hi>Christopher Blunt,</hi> and sir <hi>Thomas Gerard,</hi> with their regiments, to march towards the East side of the Island, where was a bridge (called <hi>Ponte del Suazzo</hi>) ouer which men passed forth of the Isle into the firme Land, to guard that passage, and to keepe out those of the <hi>terra firma</hi> from entring that way, not farre from whence the people were assembled in great troopes: but when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the English to be there, and knew the town was already lost, they fled.</p>
               <p>These English regiments perceiuing none to be on the other side, and knowing that Cales was taken, returned to the town without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny order or commaundement so to doe, leauing no guard at the bridge, leauing the castle neere to the bridge vntaken (which the Hollanders call Herods house:) For want of a guard at the said bridge, the gallies, in that place passed on to Seaward. The Dutch

               <p>The Spaniards perceiuing what the English intended by spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the towne, which was, not to keepe the towne long, began to take courage, &amp; to shake off the feare which had seazed the prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neere adjoyning, especially the great citie of Ciuill, which was in an vproare, so as if an armie well conducted had marched thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to other townes and places likewise, as S.

But they saw that the bootie and spoile of Cales was to the English as a great and sauorie morcell to glut their hunger; who continuing tenne or twelue dayes in the towne, and hauing carried the bootie to their ships, did hourely expect when the Generals would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund them to hoist sailes and depart homewards.</p>
               <p>A Councell was held whether it were conuenient still to keepe the towne and Island: the earle of Essex, the Marshall <hi>Veer,</hi> and most of the gentlemen were of opinion to tarrie there with three thousand men, and thought that the Island might be easily kept, which would proue a sharpe thorne, not onely in the foot of so great a Monarke, but euen in his side, and thereby diuert all the

But thereupon, various opinions were vttered, for the Sea Captaines and the lord Admerals Councell oppugned it, shewing their want of victuals, and if they should remaine there, they must be enforced to fetch prouision from England and the Low-countries, which is too farre off, or else from Barbarie, where the king dwelt an hundred leagues vp in the countrie: Hereunto, the Admerall added, that he would not aduenture and engage his Princes honour and reputation so sleightly: Sir <hi>Frauncis Veer</hi> said, That by tarrying there they should doe a pleasing and acceptable seruice to the Queene, and that victuals would soone be brought from Holland: that the towne and Island were strong, and might easily be made stronger: that the towne stood well to receiue sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from Barbarie, and to that end, they would make vse of and employ D. <hi>Christophero</hi> of Portugal, &amp;c. but all this was to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Thereupon, a generall search was made through the whole fleet to see what store of victuals was left, wherewith to furnish the garrison, till more could be brought; but they found a small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, for euerie ship had imbezeled &amp; hid as much as it could, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring want; and in the towne, through bad husbanding of victuals, they were verie skarce; for the souldiers spoiled all, and knockt out the heads of wine vessels, which they found in cellers and ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses, making like wast of other prouision.

                     <hi>The English doe againe loose the oportunitie of meeting with the India<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fleet, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that the Hollanders of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered their seruice.</hi>
                  </note> offering to send home those ships that had taken leakes, and wanted victuals, with the hurt and sicke men. But the Lord Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> contradicted it, both by writing &amp; word of mouth: and when they came to view what ships were willing &amp; fit, there were none that would vndertake the matter, but that of the Earle of Essex, and the Lord <hi>Thomas Howard,</hi> together with sir <hi>Frauncis Veer,</hi> and the Low-countrie fleet, which offered it selfe, and had beene by the earle of Essex accepted, if the Lord Admeral wold haue giuen leaue to those two ships and some eight or tenne Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish vessels more; but his Lordship thought it not fit so sleightly
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:14840:100"/>
to aduenture the Queenes ships. These various opinions set downe in writing, the Noble earle propounded them in England for his owne excuse; and in this maner was the third gallant occasion lost: for if they had gone to the said Islands, and made some small stay, they had met with a most rich Indian fleet, which arriued there 12 or 14 daies after.</p>
               <p>Passing along the coast of Portugal they would not meddle with the citie of Lisbone, hauing no such commission, but onely to visit the hauens and Sea Ports: whereupon, they went to Cornua and Ferol, where they found few ships and small prouision. After that, they held their last Councell, namely, Whether they should like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise visit the hauens of S. Andrew and S. Sebastian, with others neere adjoyning, where certaine Spanish men of warre were repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to lye: but the Admerall and Sea Captaines flatly gaine-said it, complaining of want of victuals, saying, That the Queenes ships might be in daunger to runne on ground in those places: so as the earle of Essex could not herein preuaile, who would willingly haue assaulted the towne of Cornua, but euerie man cried out to returne home, taking vpon them to excuse the said earle: and so sailed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards England, leauing the earle and the two gallions behind, which were scattered by tempest, together with the Low-countrie fleet which stayed with him to the end. Beeing thus arriued in England, about mid-August, they gaue vp an account of their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: and being taxed for letting slip those faire occasions, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused themselues by the forementioned reasons: and it was found by experience, That two Generals hauing equall power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund doe commonly hinder many gallant and noble enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>The Admerall of the Low-countries returned home with his fleet, and brought backe the English souldiers that had beene chosen forth of euerie companie; together with some bootie, and threescore pieces of ordnance, hauing lost the Fliboat of Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam called the Dolphin, with all her ordnance. The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this fleet stood the vnited Prouinces in more than fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand florins.</p>
               <p>The Queene of England in signe of acknowledgement, did, on the 14 of August, in anno 1598, send a letter to the Admerall of Holland, in forme following.</p>

               </head>
               <p>AFter the departure of the illustrious, high, and mightie lord, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of Nassau, &amp;c. from the Hague on the one and twentieth of Ianuarie 1597, he arriued on the two and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the same at Geertrudenberg, &amp; there finding his armie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, consisting of 6000 both horse and foot, with all things necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for his enterprise, he went speedily and without rumour the next day, to a village called Rauels, some league distant from the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of Turnholt; where his Excellencie caused his souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to rest a while. Count <hi>Varax</hi> and the lord of Bolanson, with 4 regiments of foot, and 5 companies of horse, had intrenched them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in Turnholt: he hauing intelligence that his Excellencie was so neere, did, by the aduice of his Councell, cause the baggage to be laden by night, and sent it away before, intending by breake of day to follow with his whole armie, and to retire safely to Herentals His Excellencie in like manner, on the 24 of the said moneth, early in the Morning did set forward, marching still in his order when the waies would permit him.</p>
               <p>The cauallerie bearing long Pistols, made the vaunt-gard, and was diuided into sixe troopes. The two first in each of which were foure cornets, were somewhat seperated, and yet still flanked one another: that on the right hand was conducted by the Earles <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and <hi>Solms.</hi> After them, followed two other troopes, each of them consisting of three Cornets, marching likewise somewhat diuided from the rest, to bee the better able vpon any occasion to receiue the former into their rankes, or else they to bee by them receyued in like manner. His Excellencie followed the Caual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, with two other troopes, marching as the rest did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diuided.</p>
               <p>The footmen were diuided into eight troops, <hi>viz.</hi> presently after the horsemen followed two squadrons verie neere to one another, after them, three, and then two, all of them marching in like manner as the former. After them followed two demie canon, with other
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:14840:102"/>
field pieces, placed betwixt the munition wagons, and drawne by those that ordinarily had charge thereof, together with certaine mariners. Next them followed the rest of the foot troops enclosing the battel, still marching in this order when the ground would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them; otherwise, they troopt closely together, fitting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to the waies, waters &amp; bridges that lay betwixt Rauels &amp; Turnholt.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie being come before Turnhoult, which was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, thought good by the aduice of the sayd earles &amp; other cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, to set forward speedily towards the enemie onely with the horse, and to let the foot troopes follow, &amp; to leaue the canon nere to the mill of Turnhoult guarded by part of the footmen. This did his Excellencie presently put in execution, but meeting with a little narrow way full of water, beneath Turnhoult, where the enemie had left forces to defend the passage, he forthwith sent certain mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers thither vnder the conduct of sir <hi>Francis Veer,</hi> and the lord <hi>Vander Aa,</hi> Lieutenant of his guard. These, enforced the enemie to quit the passage: whereupon, his Excellencie went forward, and presently came to a plain champaine, where he descried &amp; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enemie that fled in this manner.</p>

                  </note>Their baggage went before towards Herentals, garded by certain souldiers, next followed the battell. The caualerie for the most part was gone before, <hi>viz. Nicholo Basta,</hi> D. <hi>Iuan de Cordoua, Alonzo Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Guzman,</hi> and <hi>Grobbendonck.</hi> After them followed foure regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diuided one from another: the first was the regiment of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans vnder Count <hi>Sultz</hi>: the second, <hi>La Mott</hi> his old regiment, commaunded at that time by the lord of Achicourt: the third was the regiment of <hi>La Barlotte</hi>: the fourth of Neapolitans vnder the Marquesse of Treuick. On the right hand, sometime two cornets of horse marched, and sometime on the left: on the left hand were trees, neere which was a small riuer running from Turnhoult. It was not long ere they were ouertaken, but by reason of the bad wayes and a valley ful of water which lay betweene the enemie and the States forces, our men had no fit opportunitie as yet to assaile them.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Francis Veer</hi> with a few horse &amp; certain musketiers entertained the enemies rereward with skirmish, therby hindring him from his intended flight, till they came to the farther end of that valley of water: then the earles <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and <hi>Solms</hi> as first at the battaile, perceiuing a certaine place of aduantage betwixt them and Count
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:14840:102"/>
                  <hi>Varax,</hi> fearing likewise least the enemie would entangle a narrow passage wherein his baggage was alreadie entred, told his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, That it was more than time to assaile the enemie: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a signal being giuen, they charged him. The earles <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and <hi>Solms,</hi> with 4 cornets of Breda, gaue in on the enemies right side, those of Berghen-op-Zoom, vpon the enemies hindmost regime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, so, as the Neapolitans being last, were the first that were assailed by <hi>Marcelis Bacx</hi> and his brother, accompanied by <hi>Du Bois,</hi> &amp; <hi>Done,</hi> two captaines. Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and <hi>Solms,</hi> with the 4 cornets of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da (charging directly the enemies first regiment, to which their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallerie was alreadie turned backe, meaning to charge those of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen in flanke) did verie opportunely preuent them, and putting them to rout, went on and fell vpon Count <hi>Sults</hi> regiment, with such furie, as the enemies were onely content to make slight triall of their valour; and betaking themselues to flight, left <hi>Alonzo Dragon</hi> his cornet behind them.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie perceiuing that the charge was alreadie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, sent sir <hi>Robert Sidney,</hi> and sir <hi>Frauncis Veer</hi> (who till then had entertayned the enemie with continuall skirmish) with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine horse to cut off the enemies rereward. The rest of the caualle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie stayed neere to his Excellencie to succour and releeue the first, if need should be, till at last, perceiuing a manifest aduantage, all of them in a manner fell into the battell.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Count <hi>Varax</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the enemies armie was slaine vpon the place, and all his men (beeing on euerie side fiercely assailed) fell to open flight; which was to no purpose, as beeing on the one side incompassed by our cauallerie on a plaine ground, and on the other with a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and trees: so as few of them could escape to the narrow way, and aboue two thousand of them lay dead vpon the playne, and foure hundred were taken prisoners; all this was done in so short a space, as the States footmen, notwithstanding all their hast, could not come in in time, but before their ariual, the horsemen had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the victorie.</p>
               <p>The enemies cauallerie perceiuing they could not well escape, some of the brauest and most resolute among them to the number of 40, caused a trumpet to sound a charge, and fel vpon those whom in disorder they saw busied in pillage, making shew as if they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to giue a fresh charge vpon our men: whereupon, some of our timerous cowards, fled towards the footmen who were comming

forward. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> lookt after his troopes of horse which he had reserued for succours, but in vayne: whereupon, he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the prisoners to alight from their horses, who earnestly beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for mercie, saying, That there was alreadie sufficient bloud spilt to finish the victorie: yet diuers of them were slaine, and then we perceiued the want of our troopes of succours; but euerie man making hast towards his Excellencie (especially <hi>Marcelis Bacx</hi> and <hi>Edmunds</hi>) the enemie was so amazed as he againe betooke himselfe to flight.</p>
               <p>Eight and thirtie ensignes were taken there, together with D. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonzo de Mondragons</hi> cornet. Most of the baggage was pillaged; and the dead bodies stript. More than two thousand were slaine vpon the place; for the countrie people reported that they buried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 2250.</p>
               <p>The Lieutenant general <hi>La Bourlotte,</hi> with most of his captaines and officers were slaine there; and not aboue eight of the victors, among whom was captaine <hi>Donck,</hi> who died of his hurt, together with captaine <hi>Cabilleau</hi> of Flanders.</p>
               <p>This gallant victorie was gotten by eight hundred horse, but not without great daunger, if the enemie had beene discreet and wel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised. There was one thing worthie of note.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A Roman, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Septimius Fabius was found wounded and halfe dead among the dead bodies, and yet by carefull loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to, recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his life.</hi>
                  </note> A certaine Roman gentleman (whose name was <hi>Septimius Fabius,</hi> who deriued him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from the noble and auntient familie of the <hi>Fabij</hi> in Rome) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing some commaund among the Italians, was deadly wounded, and lay among the dead; those that stript him perceiuing some life in him, and that he seemed some man of note, notwithstanding that he was much disfigured with his owne bloud and that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, did in compassion take him thence, and halfe dead as he was, laid him on a horse, and carried him to Turnhout, where visited by skilfull and carefull Chirurgians, he recouered his health, and was afterward for ransome set at libertie.</p>
               <p>There were foure or fiue hundred prisoners taken, among whom was a young Count <hi>Mansfelt, Hieronimo Deutico</hi> one of Count <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racx</hi> his Councel, the Marquesse of Treuico his Lieutenant colonel and Serjeant Major. Aboue one hundred prisoners died of their wounds. And thus his Excellencie returned towards Turnholt, and the runnawayes held on their course toward Herentals, where some three hundred of them arriued. The Generals dead bodie, was by his Excellencie giuen to his seruants, who carried it to Malines
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:14840:103"/>
where his wife and children remained, and with them sent a letter to Cardinall <hi>Albertus,</hi> where he offered to deliuer the prisoners, if he would keepe good quarter. But the Cardinall being too long in sending backe an aunswer, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> threatened to hang or drowne the prisoners, if he did not ransome them within twentie daies: whereupon, he constrained the villages of Brabant to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards it.</p>
               <p>The boores of this countrie called Tielsche-Heyde, did after the defeat gather vp all the armor and weapons which they found, and laid them vp in a Church: those of the towne of Diest, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded them to bring them thither, and as six carts were loden with them, some of the garrison of Breda hauing notice thereof, tooke them away by force, and brought them into the towne on the three and twentieth of Februarie, for a greater testimonie or tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phee of their victorie.</p>
               <p>The earles <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and <hi>Solms,</hi> sir <hi>Robert Sidney,</hi> and sir <hi>Frauncis Veer</hi> (whose horse was slaine that day vnder him) were highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured for their wisedome and valour, as also other captaines and commaunders that had valiantly behaued themselues, especially <hi>Bacx</hi> and <hi>Edmonds</hi> with all their officers and souldiers.</p>
               <p>That night the campe rested at Turnholt where the canon was left: the next day, the castle was battered, and after some eight or tenne shot, those of the garrison, commaunded by captaine <hi>Vander Delft,</hi> yeelded it on condition to haue their liues and goods saued. The castle being strongly manned, euerie one returned to his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison. His Excellencie passed through Geertrudenberg, and the 8 day after his departure from the Hague, he returned thither againe, whether he brought 38 of the enemies ensigns, and one of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, which were hung vp in the great hall; and in all places caused thankes to be giuen to God, for this victorie.</p>

               <p>The towne of Rhynberck both by nature and art is exceeding strong, and not easily to be taken, and was at that time beside the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie garrison, mand with fiue hundred men, which came from Alpen, Graue, and other townes nere adjoyning. His Excellencie hauing exactly viewed the towne, thought it necessarie to make two principall campes, one aboue the towne, before the gates cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Rhynport, and Casselport on the one side of the Rhyne, where on the tenth of August hee lodged fifteene ensignes of the Frizons regiment vnder the commaund of Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassau, with thirteene English ensigns vnder sir <hi>Horacio Veer,</hi> brother to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral sir <hi>Francis,</hi> and the regiment of West-Frizeland conducted by the Lord <hi>Aert</hi> of Duyvenvoord, Lieutenant Colonel to prince <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Frederick</hi> of Nassau, together with his Excellencies gard, &amp; fiue cornets of horse, quartered a little farther off towards Botberg. Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> Generall of the other quarter, together with Count <hi>Solms</hi> were quartered on S. Annes hill before the Sautenport, with eight ensignes of Count <hi>Solms</hi> regiment, twelue companies of Scots vnder colonel <hi>Murray,</hi> Count <hi>Hohenlos</hi> gard, and twelue cornets of horse: hard by them lay the Lord of Cloeting with eight ensigns of his owne regiment: a little beneath the hill betwixt the two quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> was lodged.</p>
               <p>At their first arriuall before the towne, Count <hi>Lodwick</hi> of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau was shot in the legge. The eleuenth of August was spent in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and entrenching the two campes, which were conjoyned; together with forts of retreat, of which, three were built to stop the enemies passage, so as thereby the towne was enuironed from the one banke of the Rhyne to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:14840:105"/>The same night they began to draw trenches from his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies campe to the towne, and the next day the quarters of counts <hi>Hohenlo</hi> and <hi>Solms</hi> were entrenched. His Excellencie likewise cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a bridge to be made whereon to passe ouer from his own camp into a little Island, and so from thence vnto the other side of the Rhyne, the better to get forrage and prouision.</p>
               <p>Three canon being afterward planted, a great tower (from whence the townesmen continually shot into the campe and trenches) was fiercely battered, as also another called the Toll-tower, and the Rhyne Port, that our men might worke safely in the trenches. Two other pieces were likewise planted against the Bulwarke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Castle Port, which played so fiercely on the fifteenth and sixteenth of August, as those of the towne were enforced the same day to abandon the great Tower, from whence they had done much mischiefe, and shot through his Excellencies Tent.</p>
               <p>The sixteenth of August at night, twentie foure canon were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in sundrie places to batter the towne on all sides; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the trenches were not so neere the towne as it was expected; his Excellencie would not as then suffer the batterie to bee made, but caused a gallerie from the East side of the bulwarke before the castle-port to bee made for the summe of one thousand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred florins, which was promised to bee finished in foure dayes. The nineteenth of August, as the trenches began to approach the one side of the halfe moone, which lay without the Bulwarke of the Toll-tower before the Rhyne Port, they did let forth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a small riuer called the Niep, which was kept in before the halfe moone by a sluce. And because the gallerie stood farre in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dike, which was not verie broad nor deepe, his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie and the chiefest commaunders of the armie determined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the batterie,<note place="margin">

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the 3 volley, his Excellencie (according to the vsual maner) sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maned the town to yeeld; the Burghers hauing parolyed with our men, stood vpon 3 daies respit, which they earnestly craued.</p>

                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:14840:105"/>Some houre after the parley, the batterie was renewed; it was verie furious and lasted till fiue of the clocke in the euening, hauing in all, made aboue two thousand shot, in which meane space, Count <hi>Williams</hi> men by fauour of the canon gained the halfe Moone, and his Excellencie the better to win time (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that some thought it fit to tarrie the townesmens leisure) did againe summon the towne, which now began to be somewhat ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, for the souldiers on euerie side approached it, and stood in order of battaile. Whereupon, they within it, sent 4 commissioners <hi>viz.</hi> captaine <hi>Benting,</hi> old captaine <hi>Dulken,</hi> the Admerall <hi>Pasman,</hi> and the Quarter-Master of Count <hi>Hermen</hi> of Berguens regiment, and in counterchange of them, the captaines <hi>Schaef, Ingelhauen,</hi> &amp; <hi>Waddell</hi> were sent into the towne.</p>
               <p>After long contestation and earnest entreaties,<note place="margin">

                  </note> his Excellencie was content to let them depart with their ensignes, armes and bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, leauing out the article of not seruing on this side the Mase for the space of three moneths, promising that the Burghers shold en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their priuiledges, and vpon the 21 of August they departed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conduct of the Gouernour captaine <hi>Snatere,</hi> with 5 ensigns, being in all, some nine hundred men, vnto whom his Excellencie lent seuentie or eightie wagons, for which, Captaine <hi>Bentings</hi> sonne remayned hostage.

               <p>But on the two and twentieth of August, because those within it would not furnish them with victuals, or else, for selling them at too hight rate, they thereupon quarrelled with them that had the gard of the gates,<note place="margin">

The garrison of the towne tooke their part, and expulsed Count <hi>Henrie</hi> and all the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. The Lords of Gileyn, Vtenham, &amp; Grammay offered them 2 moneths pay, which satisfied them not, but they kept <hi>Vtenham</hi> &amp; <hi>Grammay</hi> as prisoners. After that, Count <hi>Herman</hi> came to appease them, but in vaine: whereupon, he departed with his forces to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, where he assembled some 3000 men.</p>
               <p>In this manner did the towne of Rhynberck yeeld to Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> being besieged tenne dayes, and hauing receiued 2870 shot. Great store of ordnance was found in it, <hi>viz.</hi> 44 cast pieces,

among which were seuen for batterie, together with a great quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of course cloth brought thither to cloath the garrison, which was thought to be worth 170000 florins: there were fiue ships of war sunke, and two great Ferrie-boats which were made at Coloigne, with which they hoped to haue done some notable exploit, besides other prouisions.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie did forthwith repaire the ruined places, and caused the trenches to be leuelled; and because Captain <hi>Schaef</hi> had valiantly behaued himselfe in that siege, he made him gouernor of the towne, and gaue him six ensignes of foot, well furnished with munition and victuals.</p>

               <p>HIs Excellencie like a victorious Prince pursuing his victories, did, on the 1 of October, set forward with his armie, &amp; came before the town &amp; stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g castle of Brevoort, where hauing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence the next day, by one that came forth of the town, that the lord of <hi>Aenholts</hi> company conducted by lieutenant <hi>Broekhuysen,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to take the Burghers partie against captain <hi>Gardots</hi> companie, he sent a trumpet on the second of October to summon the town to yeeld: but the Serjeant Major made aunswer, That they kept the towne for God and the king of Spaine, and in his quarrell would liue and die. Whereupon, his Excellencie gaue order to assaile it,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:14840:109"/>
and to that end caused trenches and three platformes to be made before the two gates, and on the West-side to plant the canon on; It was effected with incredible speed,<note place="margin">

               <head>¶ The taking of the towne and castle of Lingen in Anno <hi>1597.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>PRince <hi>Maurice</hi> on the six and twentieth of October, led his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie from Odenzeel, and comming with the vantgard to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoorn, he went to Benthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Castle with the Princesse of Orange accompanied with <hi>Brabantina</hi> of Orange, who with other Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was come to take her leaue, where they were verie honourably &amp; kindly entertained by the earle of Benthem &amp; the Countesse Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine the dowager, who remained there, from whence the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse departed the next day, and his Excellencie went neere to Ems<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buere where his armie lay, which, on the 28 of October, crossed the riuer Amisa, and went before the towne and castle of Lingen.</p>
               <p>Lingen is a frontier towne seated in the farthest part of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries, it is a Seignorie, wherein is a towne, castle, and 4 villages, which the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth vsurped by confiscation, in the yeare 1546, together with the Countie of Teckelenbourg and the Seigniorie of Reyden, which he took from count <hi>Conrade</hi> of Tecke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenbourg, who had an hand in the league of Smalcald, making war vpon him, and was therefore condemned as a rebell. Whereupon, the emperour gaue the said countie and Seignorie to <hi>Maximilian</hi> of Egmond, Count of Buren, in recompence of his good seruice. Afterward, the earle was reconciled to the Emperour, on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that Lingen should remaine to Count <hi>Buren.</hi> But within a while after, as Count <hi>Nicholas</hi> of Teckelenbourg, vncle to <hi>Conrade</hi> that was deceased, called the matter in question, as a fee belonging to the Duchie of Guelders, the Emperour againe tooke it into his owne hand, and disposed of it afterward according to his owne pleasure.</p>
               <p>This towne was well fortified with Bulwarkes, Dikes and a strong garrison; for beside foure strong bulwarkes in the Castle,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:14840:111"/>
the towne had double rampiers and dikes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A description of the towne of Lingen.</hi>
                  </note> with foure bulwarkes and three rauelins, and six hundred souldiers in garrison, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in three foot companies, and one Cornet of horse, vnder the conduct of Count <hi>Frederick</hi> of Berguen, the Drossart <hi>Indevelt, Laukema, Verdugos</hi> Lieutenant, with all other necessaries belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a siege.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Frederick</hi> had caused certaine houses that stood nere the towne, to be burnt, because the enemie should not seaze on them. The next day the besieged made a salley, burnt a mill which stood without the towne, and skirmished with the Scots, who did beat them in againe. In the night, as our men began to make their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, those in the towne and castle did nothing all that night and most part of the next day, but discharge their ordnance, so as the whole towne seemed to be on fire.</p>
               <p>The thirtieth of October, sixe ensignes of Frizons came to the campe, and the besieged about eight of the clocke the same eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, did, with one thousand fiue hundred men, assaile the gard of Frizons, where captaine <hi>Peter Leenwaerd,</hi> his Serjeant, and two or three souldiers were slaine, after which, the townesmen with some losse retired.</p>
               <p>The one and thirtieth of October, and first of Nouember, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine canons were planted, and our men began to batter the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, the better thereby to make their approach. The night following, we made a batterie with sixe canon, and the souldiers marched the same day euen to the dike of the rauelin before the gate called Molen-port.</p>
               <p>The second of Nouember, nineteene boats came to Embden, loden with ordnance and munition, and passed along by a place called Oort, notwithstanding the opposition of the castle which belonged to the Earle.</p>
               <p>The third and fourth of Nouember, the approches on euerie side were aduaunced, so as the souldiers before Molen-port came so farre into the rauelin, as they found a Myne which the townes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had made, and some of them tooke their hats and filled them with gun powder, which beeing perceiued by the besieged, they flung forth wild-fire vpon our souldiers, which burnt diuers of them, together with certaine Myners: this happened on the 5 of Nouember.</p>
               <p>The same day, the Embassadors of Denmarke arriued, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:14840:111"/>
Chanceller <hi>Witfelt,</hi> and the Lord Barnekou, with a great traine and strong Conuoy, they came from the Hague and passed by Swoll, to come and see the campe, visiting the trenches, but not without admiration wondering at and commending our skill in martiall matters. The next day, they departed thence, and were strongly conuoyed towards Dulmenhorst.</p>
               <p>The same day, the workes were well aduaunced, and the 6 of Nouember, three galleries were made, which were bargained to be done, the one for one thousand six hundred, the other for one thousand fiue hundred, and the third for one thousand foure hundred florins; this money was more bountifully bestowed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the States of Holland had sent 10000 florins to the campe for payment of the workes: so as before Molen-port and Leuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port our men were gotten into the rauelins, to leuell the causies which kept the water in the dikes.</p>
               <p>The seuenth and eighth of Nouember, the besiegers began to seaze vpon the rauelins before the gates, and to let forth the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The ninth of Nouember, artillerie and munition came to the campe: whereupon, three dayes after, his Excellencie made another batterie, with foure and twentie pieces of ordnance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the castle; and after that, vpon the twelfth day, he had battered the fortifications for eight houres space, and vnder fauour of the canon, began to vndermyne two bulwarkes, he summoned the towne: thereupon, the townesmen craued an houres respit for consultation, and a cessation of the ordnance and Myne, but his Excellencie would giue them no time; so as they demanded two hostages for two of their men whom they would send vnto him,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Count Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Berguen yeeldeth vp Lingen on the</hi> 12 <hi>of Nomem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                  </note> the one was <hi>Verdugos</hi> Lieutenant, and the other <hi>Euert de Ens,</hi> and late in the Euening, a composition was made, That they should depart the next day, with their horse, armes, Cornet, ensignes and baggage, and should crosse the Rhyne and Mase according to the agreement of those of Oldenzeel, deliuering vp all their papers and writings concerning the demaines of the Countrie to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, crauing fiftie wagons for their first dayes journey: and that all the officers and Burghers might remaine six weekes in the towne to end their businesse, and afterwards with passeport, to goe whither they should please.</p>
               <p>This capitulation was made in the presence of the Earles of Lunenbourg, Lippe, Swartzenbourg, and Benthem, who were
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:14840:112"/>
come to the campe to salute Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi> The same night count <hi>Solms,</hi> Count <hi>Lodwick,</hi> and Count <hi>Ernestus</hi> went to sup in the castle with Count <hi>Frederick</hi> of Berguen and his brother <hi>Adolph,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned at night to the Campe, where gards were euerie where placed.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth of Nouember, Count <hi>Frederick</hi> requested that he might remaine there that day, which was graunted on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that his men should leaue the Castle, and Captaine <hi>Martin Cobbe</hi> with his companie was sent into the Castle, and Captaine <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linghen</hi> with his companies into the Towne, where they found one canon, two demie canons, one Coluering, three demie Culue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, one Falconet, and two<note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The foureteenth of Nouember, the garrison went away, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of 500 foot, and one Cornet of 50 horse, and the first, night they lodged at Salsbergue in the land of Munster. The same day his Excellencies troopes began likewise to march, the horsemen, through Munster towards Berck, and the Fanterie to Swoll, there to be imbarked for Holland.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth of Nouember, his Excellencie, Count <hi>William,</hi> and the rest of the armie departed from Lingen, and went that night to Vlsen, where the next day they separated themselues, each one going to his garrison.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> in all his exploits is highly to be commended, for his great and continuall speed, wisedome, and skill in martiall matters, hauing in three moneths space obtained such great and notable victories; for in these actions (beside the Danish Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, and the commissioner of the townes and Countries of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne, Munster, and Osnabrugge) there were two Dukes, nine Earles, with many other Lords and Noble men, which came in person to his campe to salute and congratulat him, and to be eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witnesses of his victories and valour. In these actions he did in a short space vanquish two thousand men on the farther side of the Rhyne, in the townes of Berck, Alpen, and Meurs, and on the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side thereof, sixe and twentie foot companies, and foure Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of horse, all old souldiers vnder the conduct of two Earles, sundrie old Colonels, Captaines and other officers, which lay in strong walled Townes and Castles.</p>
               <p>So as in these exploits, he did not onely win nine Townes, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:14840:112"/>
fiue castles manned with strong garrisons, but three Counties, and three Seignories, crossing seuen riuers, foure with bridges, &amp; three without, and thereby secured the passages on the Rhyne, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Zutphen, Ouer-Yssel, Twent, Drent, Frizeland, and the Ommelands, which is in a manner the fourth part of the seuenteen Prouinces of the Netherlands as they are reckoned; at that time when Cardinall <hi>Albertus</hi> had threescore thousand men in pay, and himselfe in person in the field, comming from <hi>Amiens</hi> in Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardie in Nouember, before Ostend, with which he durst not then meddle.</p>

               <head>¶ A recitall and description of the siege of Bommell, and how it was raised in Anno <hi>1599.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFter the conquest of so many sundrie Townes, we are next to speake of the siege of Bommell, and of the enemies entrance into the Island called Bommels-weert vnder the conduct of the Admerall of Arragon: and for better recitall thereof, we will make some briefe description of the towne.</p>
               <p>Bommell is a frontier Towne vpon the confines of Guelderland towards the South, and stands vpon the riuer Waell on the North side of the Isle of Bommell: it is of a reasonable bignesse, and excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding strong by nature: it was first walled by Duke <hi>Otho,</hi> vnder whose gouernement the Countrie of Guelderland and the number of townes in it were much augmented.</p>
               <p>The riuer Waell doth not onely make Bommell commodious for traffike, but impregnable on the North side and free from all inuasion. The Countrie about it is verie low, and not alone vnfit for Mynes, but for continuance of any long siege, for in winter, by reason of great waters and ouerflowing of riuers, it inforceth the enemie to leaue the field. Beside her naturall strength, it hath beene euer well fortified with bulwarkes and Towers, and is enuironed with a double rampier and dike, as the Reader may perceiue by the Map.</p>
               <p>From the beginning of the Low-Countrie warres till this day, each partie hath laboured to become Master of this towne in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of her situation; especially the vnited Prouinces, because it
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:14840:113"/>
serues as a rampier against the incursions and inuasion of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and is a strong and sure key to their confines, which they likewise fortunatly obtayned by meanes of those of Gorcum, who tooke it in anno 1572, and haue kept it till this present, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the enemies many attempts, and daily diligence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish commaunders, who haue often gone about to become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters thereof, and to take it from them: As in Anno 1599, when they brought their whole strength into the Isle of Bommell, vnder the conduct of D. <hi>Francisco de Mendoza</hi> high Admeral of Arragon, and besieged the towne with the bulwarks and forts round about it. And because this siege of Bommell, together with the raising thereof, is one of the notablest exploits of warre done in the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countries, we will briefely set downe, the most remarkable matters which were there acted, intreating the Reader to take it in good part.</p>
               <p>The Admerall of Arragon, hauing assembled all his forces ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Empires territories and neutrall countries, did, on the sixteenth of Aprill, take a generall muster of them, and on the sixe and twentieth of the said moneth, brought them before the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable fort of the Island called S'Graven-weert; whose garrison was so strong and well prouided of all necessaries, as it was to be presumed, that the Spaniards would not haue dared to hope for the winning of it, especially in view of the States armie, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them from enclosing it. Their weake attempts likewise, and the euent thereof shewed that they aimed at some other place, and that this was but a counterfeit siege, onely to draw the States armie thither, that they might be able on a sodaine to surprize the Towne of Bommell, and forts adjacent.</p>
               <p>My Lords the States of the vnited Prouinces, hauing intelligence certaine moneths before, that the enemie would inuade the Isle of Bommell, to be able from thence to make his entrance into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, had giuen order to fortifie and circle the said town with new bulwarkes and flankers, and to inlarge the forts of Voorn and Creueccoeur, which by reason of their smalnesse were not able to hold out long: these workes were alreadie begun in the towne of Bommell and fort of Voorn, but not ended, by reason the ground was too soft, and the waters too high; so that the west-side of the towne lay all open, the old wals being beaten downe and the new not yet erected, as likewise in Voorn fort, where the new worke
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:14840:113"/>
was scarce defensible, and would not haue beene able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the enemies furie.</p>
               <p>These things drew the Spaniards into the Isle of Bommell, that they might become Masters thereof ere these places were fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And to this end they came before the fort of S'Grauen-weert, to draw (as it fell out) the States campe thither.</p>
               <p>By which occasion, the Towne of Bommel, and forts neere ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, were not so well prouided of men as was requisit. The Admerall of Arragon lying before S'Grauen-weert, and amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the States campe, had sent certaine troopes, vnder the conduct of <hi>Zapena,</hi> towards Gennip vpon the Mase, vnder colour of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy; vnto whom he sent a great part of his armie on May day, conducted by <hi>La Bourlotte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The enemie, for execution of his enterprise, had prouided certaine boats vpon the Mase, in which, they meant to fall downe towards the Isle of Voorn, and on the 3 day of May, in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, they all embarked themselues and came to the sayd Island. But Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> according to his vsuall care and diligence, had aduertised the Garrison of their intent, commaunding them to arme and stand vpon their gard, who by this meanes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented the enemies purpose, and kept him from making any attempt: Whereupon hee was enforced to goe backe with his boats to a place called Litt, where he remained that day and the next.</p>
               <p>The fourth of may, at night, they did with canon shot inforce the man of warre (which the States kept vpon the Mase, to gard the riuer, and to stop the enemies passage) to retire thence, and to fall downe the streame, and caused certaine boats to be brought by land towards Keffell, whether they sent their owne fanterie, which was imbarked by night, and passed on betwixt Rossen and Herwaerde.</p>
               <p>And the fifth of May, before day breake, they entred the Isle of Bommell, where they fortified themselues on both sides the water. This sodaine arriuall of theirs, did so affright those of Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell, as diuers Burghers fled confusedly forth of the Towne, carrying away with them what they could conueniently: And to speake truely, had the enemie, presently after his arriuall in the Island, shewed himselfe before the Towne, he would haue mightily endaungered it, the walls lying open and the Burghers
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:14840:114"/>
being terrified. But by his negligence, and staying for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall, who was hourely expected with his whole armie, he lost that gallant opportunitie.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie, in the meane time, hauing intelligence of the enemies arriuall in the Isle of Bommell, made hast thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with his Cauallerie and certaine foot companies, where he arriued on the sixth of May, and gaue order for all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie in the towne, commaunding the Burghers still to abide there, who by his comming were so encouraged, as they alone thought themselues strong enough to withstand the enemie.</p>
               <p>The seuenth of May, the Spaniards forsooke the town of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick, and joyned with the Admerall, who was then mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching towards the Isle of Bommell. It was supposed that the Admerall had an intent to haue seazed on Heusden, a verie strong Towne, and seated within an houres journey of Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell.</p>
               <p>But his Excellencie, like a prouident prince, went thither on the 11 of May, with tenne foot companies, and caused the Isle of Hemert to be fortified and intrenched round about.</p>
               <p>The Admerall perceiuing that Heusden was too well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, did, with all his force, assault the Fort of Creuecoeur, which by reason of the smalnesse was not able to hold out against him: Whereupon, the garrison yeelded it vp, and departed thence with their ensignes and armes.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie hauing intelligence tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Creuecoeur was yeelded, returned speedily to Bommell, and caused it to be enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with many trenches, halfe Moones, and such like workes.</p>
               <p>By these fortifications, the Towne of Bommel (in mans iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) was made impregnable, and as many as saw the height and bredth of those workes, were amazed, for it is almost incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to see what they wrought in view of the king of Spaines mightie armie.</p>
               <p>Beside these fortifications a farre off, the bulwarkes of the Towne which had bin begun, were finished, and the walls clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vp, the Towne being well furnished with ordnance and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouision in places of most necessitie. The Admeral, in the meane time, lay with his campe at Creuecoeur, where he was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied in making a bridge ouer the Mase, and a halfe Moone on Heels side, thereby to secure the riuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:14840:114"/>The 13 of May, the enemie made shew as if he would haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Heusden: whereupon, his Excellencie sent 31 ensignes mo thither. But he marched towards Rossem, hoping to enter into the Isle of Tiell, called Tielche-weert, to enclose the Isle of Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell on all sides: but Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> sent ordnance thither, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed batteries to be made, thereby hindering the enemies pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
               <p>The 14 of May, Count <hi>Frederick</hi> brought the most part of the armie before Bommell, hauing first run vp and downe the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and done nothing, but warned those of Bommell and Voorn to fortifie themselues, and giuen them time to doe it. He came and sat downe on the West-side, where the Towne had beene most open, there beginning his skirmishes, hoping to enter it, but those within it, did brauely repulse him. During this skirmish the enemie thought to haue entred the Isle of Rossem, but all things being there well ordered, his attempt had no good successe. Then he began to besiege the towne, seating his campe at a place called Oensell, aboue the Towne, and made his trenches at the causey called Oensen-Dijke, that he might lie safe from the Towne shot. Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> perceiuing that the enemie meant to set vpon him with his whole power, did likewise breake vp his campe which lay in the Betuwe, and brought it to Bommell, making all prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for defence, sending for all sorts of munition, and making sundrie batteries.</p>
               <p>His whole campe being assembled, he diuided it verie skilfully, and fortified all necessarie places. He manned Bommel with eight ensignes belonging to the Lord <hi>Peter de Dorp,</hi> eight ensignes of the Lord <hi>Vander-Noot,</hi> foure ensignes of <hi>Suesse,</hi> and the Lord <hi>de la Noiie,</hi> with seuen French companies; and himselfe with his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest brother, Count <hi>William,</hi> and Count <hi>Lodwick,</hi> retired thence. He quartered the English at Haesten, the Gards at Tuyll, the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of the French at Wardenbourg, at Opinen the rest of the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons, at Hessell Count <hi>Ernestus</hi> with the Almans, the Scots with <hi>Edmonds</hi> regiment at Voorn, and all the horse in the Isle of Tyell, and so from thence as farre as Gorcum, to keepe continuall watch along the Riuer. The Admerall <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenvoord</hi> likewise went vp the Riuer Waell, with fifteene men of warre, which lay from Opinen as farre as beneath Haeften.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:14840:115"/>On the sixteenth of May, all things being thus ordered by the States armie, the Admeral of Arragon came at last to his campe, so as al the power on both sides was assembled nere to Bommel. The Spaniards were in number 26000 foot, and 4000 horse; the States forces consisted of 16000 foot, and three thousand horse, most of them old souldiers, and had a long time bin trayned vp in war, and purchased great experience.</p>
               <p>The same night that the Admeral came to his campe, he made a furious assault vpon the townes furthest fortifications, towards the gate called Oensche port, which were scarce finished; but he was brauely beaten backe, with great losse of his men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, <hi>La Motte</hi> was taken prisoner, who died at Bommell of his hurt, together with <hi>Alfonso D'Aualos,</hi> who was grieuously wounded, yet within a while after, recouered his health.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> caused the causey called Oenschen-Dijke to be vndermined, that he might blow vp the enemie, if he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to assaile the fortifications. This was his last assault vpon Bommell; for afterward he kept himselfe verie quiet, standing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on defence than offence.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie on the contrarie, was not satisfied in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the towne of Bommell, but did likewise with all his might assaile the enemie, shooting on euerie side into his campe, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siting him often in his trenches. The workes and fortifications did daily encrease round about Bommell, and a bridge of boats was likewise made ouer the Waell before the Towne, fiue pace in bredth, and foure hundred and fiftie in length. There were ten great boats, and eight and twentie lesser ones, &amp; a verie great Ferrie-boat seruing for an opening to the bridge when need was.</p>
               <p>By his Excellencies commaund, all mariners that were in the States fleet, came into the towne of Bommell to ayd the souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to make a furious assault vpon the enemie, who was aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thereof by two French-men that fled from our side: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the mariners were sent backe to their ships.</p>
               <p>The 18 of May, Count <hi>Lodwick,</hi> with 8 cornets of horse, was sent on Brabants side, to surprise the enemies gards, but returned without any effect.</p>
               <p>On the one and twentieth, at night, our souldiers being for the most part English and French, did fiercely assaile the enemie in
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:14840:115"/>
his trenches, and slew aboue six hundred men, and would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture haue troubled the whole armie, had not a quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose betwixt the two Nations: whereupon, they returned to the Towne, bringing Captaine <hi>Aldeno</hi> prisoner with them, with some other souldiers. And on their side lost two Captaines, and some others, who for the most pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t were slayne by themselues.</p>
               <p>The enemie at that time was verie busie in his fortifications, making platformes and sundrie batteries, from which he shot into the Towne and ouer the bridge, but did no great hurt, spoyling the houses more than men; daily approching towards the waters side, that he might be able to reach our bridge with his ordnance; and our men to defend it, did much eleuat the wings of their tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Our trenches, bulwarks, &amp; batteries were daily encreased, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing stored with diuers cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, culuerins, &amp; other yron pieces, which continually played vpon the enemie, doing great hurt among his men, so as they drew backe their cabins and Tents to be free from the canon. Diuers of the enemies dead &amp; wounded men were daily carryed to Sertoghenbuske and other places neere adjoyning, which filled the Hospitalls, among whom were many Captaines and commaunders, beside those that were dayly buried in the fields.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth of May, the enemie departed from the Isle of Bommell, with fiue thousand foot, and one thousand horse, to fetch in victuals, munition, and other necessaries: and on the six and twentieth, he sent foure thousand foot men, and certaine horse towards Antuerpe, to conuoy the pay for the armie to the Campe, and the better to couer his intent, he discharged many vollies of shot, seeking thereby to carrie away certayne ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, his Excellencie, with all the gards, went downe lower, being followed by six cornets of horse, and out of euerie English companie, he tooke fiftie men, which in all amounted to one thousand three hundred foot, and with them embarked him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe from Worcum, and marched far into Brabant: but the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie hauing descried our men, retired with all the treasure into Herentalls, beeing vnwilling to leaue his aduauntage: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> returned to his Campe, leauing certayne straglers behind him.</p>
               <p>On the seuen and twentieth of May, the enemie receiued his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:14840:116"/>
pay in the Isle of Bommell, which was thought in value to bee worth sixe tun of gold:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>I hardly in this beeleue my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour.</hi>
                  </note> all the garrisons dispersed here and there ouer Brabant, were commanded to come to the campe to receiue their pay. The same day, our men of warre vpon the riuer, drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vp certaine engins that went vnder water, which were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away by the currant, wherewith the enemie thought to haue blowne vp either our ships or bridge; they were fiue foot long, and one foot broad: there were in them sixe Chambers charged with powder, verie artificially made with fire-lockes, and did beare out a point before, which comming to strike against any thing, the spring vnbended it selfe, and gaue fire to the powder, which brake all things neere it in pieces: the enemie had made many of these, yet they did in no sort hurt either our bridge or ships. The thirtieth of May, the bodie of the enemies Campe was much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged by great numbers of Tents and Cabins: for he had newly receiued twelue great canons called the twelue Apostles, each of them carrying a bullet of threescore pound weight; with which came foure thousand Spaniards and Italians, and certain cornets of horse.</p>
               <p>The same day, the enemie attempted to crosse the Waell neere to Dreule, two leagues beyond Tyell, but his Excellencie forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sent sixteene foot companies and fiue cornets of horse to stop their passage. The same day, our double canon, and other ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance plaied fiercely vpon the enemie, who did the like vpon the Towne, and especially towards the bridge; but the bullets, for the most part, fell in a place called Haeftensche-weert, doing no great hurt either to the bridge or men.</p>
               <p>Dail<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e skirmishes were made betwixt the sentinels &amp; souldiers which deserue no long discourse, onely, our men were commonly victorious. Beside those of Bommell, the inhabitants of Voorn, Heusden, Gorcum, and other neighbour Townes, made incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions vpon the enemie, and tooke daily store of prisoners, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gallant horse, and in Bommell alone during the siege, more than foure hundred were sold.</p>
               <p>Newes came from Sertoghenbusk, that on the eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth and nine and twentieth of May, aboue fourescore wagons of dead and hurt men were brought thither, beside those that were carried to Heel and other Townes. His Excellencie caused the place where the old Cloister stood to be fortified, from whence
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:14840:116"/>
the enemie might haue greatly annoyed the Towne, if hee had come on that side. He did likewise fortifie a place called Litsenha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, began an halfe Moone there, that he might from thence make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions vpon the enemie.</p>
               <p>The third of Iune, his Excellencie caused all the ordnance of the Towne, Bulwarkes, and batteries, to be discharged vpon the enemies campe for an houre together, which enforced them to retire from before the towne, and by night to burne their cabins, and by to dislodge.</p>
               <p>In this maner did the canon raise the siege of Bommell, which the enemie had begirt for the space of twentie dayes.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards from the beginning had no great hope of this siege, but had rather to haue gone before Breda or some other Towne in the champaine countrie, accusing <hi>La Bourlotte</hi> to be a traytor to the king, whose negligence had held backe their first intended enterprises.</p>
               <p>Those of Bommel, perceiuing the enemies retreat, did in troops run to their forsaken campe, where they found much baggage, armour, and other engins, many dead men vnburied, many hurt men and yong children left behind, whom his Excellencie sent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, causing the dead bodies to be buried, and the wounded to be brought into the towne to be healed.</p>
               <p>The fifth of Iune, the enemies trenches, batteries, and other workes, were made playne and leuell by the Burghers and soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with their owne tooles which they had left behind. The enemie was so afraid to tarrie in Bommelers-weert, as diuers Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines which were not hurt, withdrew themselues to Sertoghen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busk, wearing their armes in Scarfes, the better to absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; the number of them was so great, as proclamations were made by sound of drum and Trumpet, That all commanders and officers, being in the kings pay, should returne to their quarter and ensignes; and a generall search was made, to enforce such to the campe as were vnwilling.</p>
               <p>The enemie hauing abandoned Bommell, retired toward Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sem, where the Country lay somewhat high, and there encamped, causing his bridge to be taken away from Creuecoeur, and to be carried higher betwixt Alem, and Marem.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie, to keepe the enemie forth of the Isle of Tiell, fortified all the passages, and sent 7 French ensignes to Nerines, 8
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:14840:117"/>
companies belonging to the Lord <hi>Vander-Noot,</hi> and foure of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esses</hi> to Varick. He began to plant sundrie batteries, and to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Island called Rossensche-middel-weert, and other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he likewise strongly entrenched the Isle of Voorn.</p>
               <p>Both the campes were quiet all Iune, because the enemie was afraid to passe on his way, and Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> attended him in vaine; each side being busied in making batteries and other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and annoying one another with the ordnance.</p>
               <p>The enemie began a verie great and strong Fort at Rossem, vpon a Dike called Lorre-graft, in a streight and narrow place of the Isle of Bommel, with Curtaines, the better to shadow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and to cause the sayd dike to run into the Waell.</p>
               <p>It is reported that fifteene thousand of the enemies diuided themselues into three troopes, and cast lots which of the three should first crosse the water, hauing many boats for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, so as their whole number might easily haue passed ouer at thrice: this should haue beene put in practise vpon the foure and twentieth of Iune in the Morning before day breake, being Mid-Summer day; but it was not effected. Those of Midel-weert, Varick, Heesselt, and Opinen, stood all night in good order, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the enemie who stirred not. His Excellencie did often send certain horse, musketiers, and armed pikes to prouoke him, but he would not come forth of his hold.</p>
               <p>The Admerall of Arragon, sent D. <hi>Ambrosio Landriano</hi> with most of the horse, and the regiment of D. <hi>Lewis de Villar,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent the frequent incursions of those of Litsenhall.</p>
               <p>The first of Iulie, the enemie made aboue fiue hundred great shot, but did not hurt a man of ours. The second of Iulie, the Englishmen that lay at Haeften, the French, that were at Weer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denbourg and Nerines, and sixe ensignes of the garrison of the Isle of Hemert, called Hemertschen-weert, marched vp higher.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie hauing in vayne long expected the enemies comming, did, on the fourth of Iulie, by day breake, send three thousand men towards Herwaerden, there to make an half moon in the enemies view.</p>
               <p>Herwaerden is seated on a plaine or leuel ground, higher than all the trenches in the Isle of Voorn: there did our men present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortifie themselues, making an halfe Moon, which they fenced with pallizadoes. This worke beeing in some sort defensible,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:14840:117"/>
his Exc. sent more men before &amp; at last, followed them himselfe.</p>
               <p>Our men laboured verie hard from foure of the clock in the morning till six at night, without any let of the enemy, but when the halfe moone was almost finished, he then shewed himselfe with certaine troups of horse and foot, thinking thereby to draw our souldiers into an ambuscado; who vpon intelligence that a great troupe of horse lay behind a banke, would not go forth.</p>
               <p>The enemy within a while after, returned with 2500 Spanyards and Italians, who vnder the conduct of <hi>Zapena</hi> gaue a furious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault to our halfe moone, and with them a great number of monks and Clergie men, who came with crosses and banners to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them: but our men did valiantly defend the halfe moone and repulsed the enemie, notwithstanding his fierce assault, in which many of them had gotten ouer the palizadoes, fighting hand to hand with our men, and killing one another with push of pike.</p>
               <p>Those of Voorn, Varijck, and Heesselschen-weert, did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with their canon and small shot, play vpon the enemies, so as in the end they were to their great disgrace enforced to retire, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing moe then 700 dead men behind them, (among whom were diuers Captaines and Commanders) beside those that were hurt, of whom 150 died in Sertoghenbusk. This assault continued two houres long, and yet there were but 8 of our men slaine, and some 20 hurt. The enemy had brought two field peeces to batter the halfe moone, but did not hurt one man of ours, and in his retreat lost 96 men, among whom one of the aboue mentioned monks was found, being armed with many holy reliques which did him no good, he died with his armes full of palizadoes which he had valiantly pluckt vp.</p>
               <p>The same day, the enemies with 2 demy canon which were sent them, sanke one of our boats neere to Herwaerden, but the men were saued, some six or seauen excepted, that were slaine and hurt.</p>
               <p>The 5 of Iuly, <hi>la Bourlotte</hi> with a troupe of horse &amp; 400 musque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, lay in ambush, thinking to draw our Cauallery thither, which were vpon the gard before the towne of Bommell: But our men mistrusting the matter, because the enemy came on with so few, gaue back, till they were safe from the ambuscado, and then fell vpon them, putting them to rout, and tooke the Baron of Rosne prisoner, and an Italian Captaine that presently died of his hurts, whose bodie was afterwards redeemed. His Excellencie likewise
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:14840:118"/>

               <p>The seuenth of Iulie, a second halfe Moone was begun vpon the Litsenham, and was conjoyned to the first by wings, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to secure the bridge, which was afterward placed betwixt Voorn and Herwaerden.

               <p>The 8 of Iulie, his Excellencie and his whole Court remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Bommel and went to Voorn, quartering himself at the head of the Island, whither his owne gard, and those of Count <hi>William</hi> and Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> presently followed him.</p>
               <p>The armie of the States were busied in making two sundrie bridges of boats: The first, on the third of Iulie, vpon the Waell from the Isle of Tiell to the Isle of Voorn: The second, on the 8 of Iulie, from Voorn to Herwaerden, on which, tenne ensignes of Scots, and the Lord of Gistels, with twelue other ensignes of his regiment, passed ouer the same day towards Herwaerden. The enemie being fearefull and jealous of his bridge, transported it on the ninth of Iulie to the old place betwixt Heel, and Creuecoeur. His Excellencie, on the 12 of Iulie, sent three thousand fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foot, and 1000 horse towards Litsenham to assaile the enemy, who not appearing, our men returned, bringing hack with them 40 horse and foure prisoners.</p>
               <p>The Spanish horsemen, so soone as ours were gone from Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senham, shewed themselues on the bank, but were soone beaten thence by our canon.</p>
               <p>The same day, a French lord, sonne to a great man of France, was shot into the head before Herwaerden, and dyed of his hurt; he was much lamented both of his Excellencie and his whole Court.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:14840:118"/>The enemie was in those Villages on Litsenham and Herwaer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens side, strongly entrenched, but on the other side verie slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, so as our men were to fetch a compasse about, to assaile the enemie behind. But the French that were in the Vant-gard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient of delay, and desiring a speedie victorie, assailed the enemie in front, where he was strongly fortified. At the first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall of our men, the enemie stood before his trenches, offering skirmish, but was soone beaten in againe, and one of his captains taken prisoner and carried away into the Isle of Voorn.</p>
               <p>These thus defeated, our men did valiantly assaile the enemies trenches, but by reason of the hight of their fortifications, and great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of their men, we did no great matter, but were faine to retire, bringing away some 60 dead &amp; hurt men, most of whom were French-men, and to speake truely of them, had with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible valour, marched euen into the enemies trenches.</p>
               <p>The enemie planted a batterie at Kessell, from whence he plaid vpon Herwaerde and Voorn, but did no great harme. The 26 of Iulie, he tooke one of our men of warre that lay in gard on the higher side of Amelroye, and slew most of the mariners. These were the notablest exploits done in the Isle of Bommell and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neere adjoyning, from May till the 26 of Iulie.</p>
               <p>All August and September, both Campes lay verie still, being strongly entrenched, keeping good gard, euer seeking some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntage one of another.</p>
               <p>There were continuall mutinies in the enemies campe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of bad pay &amp; other quarrels. The regiments which lay at Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and other villages, did most of them retire to Rossem for feare of being beaten. There were continuall skirmishes betwixt our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualerie and the enemies, who went about to surprise one another, and to driue away the sentinels.</p>
               <p>Our men still made incursions vpon the enemie, and, on the 10 of August, tooke more than 200 horse, and much baggage from him, who was busied in fortifying his new Fort of Rossem, with high and broad rampiers, thinking thereby to stop the passage of the riuer Waell, to conquer the Isle of Bommel, and to open him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a way into Holland, Vtrecht, and the heart of Guelderland. Many wondred whie the enemie was so long idle in the Isle of Bommell: some thought that he would not retire till the fort of Rossem was fully finished.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:14840:119"/>But because the Archduke <hi>Albert</hi> had promised the States of the subiected prouinces, That hee would not burthen the townes and countrie with Garrisons, it is likely that hee busied his Armie in the Isle of Bommell, the better to keep his promise: As also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was necessarie to keepe the Army neere the enemy, for his souldiers beeing seditious and wanting pay, it was to bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if they departed forth of the Isle of Bommell, and should bee farre from their enemies, that the countrie of Brabant would be in daunger of spoile and ruine, as it hath often happened du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring these Low-countrie warres.</p>
               <p>These are the most likelie reasons that moued the enemie to keepe his armie so long a time in the Isle of Bommel, without any other exploits; to these, an other may bee added, which is, that they thought good to tarrie there, in regard of the fitnesse of the place, from whence they might make attempts on the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour townes of the vnited Prouinces, as they had alreadie done vpon Worcum, Breda, and Nimmeguen; but by Gods assistance and the carefulnesse of our commaunders it tooke none effect.</p>

               <head>¶ A true description and recitall of the enterprises and voyages of the mightie fleet of the vnited Netherland Prouinces against the realmes of Spaine and Islands of Canaries, vnder con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Admerall Peter Vander-Does, set forth in anno <hi>1599.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe States of the vnited Netherland Prouinces, did, in the beginning of the yeare 1599, lay a general imposition on their wealthiest subjects, crauing the two hundreth penie of their goods, which they voluntarily graunted. Whereupon, they concluded, beside their other enterprises, to set forth a mightie fleet, to inuade the King of Spaines dominions, as the Englishmen had often done with good successe.</p>
               <p>And to this end, diuers ships were rigd forth the same yeare in the hauens and Merchant Townes of Holland and Zeland, and many mariners were taken into pay ouer all the vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces. Some of these ships were double mand and victualled for a long voyage, the rest, onely to continue in ordinarie places.</p>
               <p>Those which were double mand were chiefely bound for the West-Indies; others onely for the Canaries to conuoy them, and to assist them by the way. All these vessels were strong, tall, well built, and swift of saile. The greatest of them was a ship of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam, strongly built, and well furnished for warre.</p>
               <p>The chiefe commaund of these ships was giuen to the Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Peter Vander Does,</hi> a discreet and valiant gentleman, well expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced in martiall matters, both by sea and land, as it appeared in anno 1588, in the defeat of the Spanish fleet, and more especially in this present action. All the Captaines, officers, souldiers and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners were valiant and skilfull men. Their ships being readie, did set saile on the foure and twentieth and fiue &amp; twentieth of May, forth of sundrie Hauens, and on the fiue and twentieth, at night, came before Flushing, which was the Rendezvous, the whole Fleet consisting of 72 saile, all of them wel prouided of ordnance, munition, and other necessaries.</p>
               <p>The Admeral was called Orange, the great ship of Amsterdam was Vize-Admerall, but being as then scarce finished, it remained
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:14840:120"/>
for a time at Texell, and the 30 of May it followed the fleet and ouertooke it on the coast of Spaine before the Sea Towne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Groine.</p>
               <p>The 26 and 27 of May, the fleet stayed before Flushing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue directions from the Admerall, and on the 28 weighing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kor, they set saile from Flushing with a Northerlie wind, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting their course East-South-East. The whole fleet was diuided into three squadrons, the first vnder the Admerall <hi>Vander-Does,</hi> who carryed an Orange colour flag; the second, vnder <hi>Iohn Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brantsen</hi> with a white flag; and the third, vnder <hi>Cornellis Geleyn</hi> of Flushing, bearing a blew flag, as rere-Admerall.</p>
               <p>In this order the fleet departed, and on the nine and twentieth came in view of Calice, where the foremost ships stayed for those that were behind. In this place, the Admerall did twice send for all the Captaines to come aboord his ship, first, to hold a martiall Councell, after which, two Brigantines were sent from the fleet; and the second time to acquaint them with his intent, and other necessarie affaires, giuing to each of them a sealed letter, which was to direct them how to order themselues in any difficulties that should happen.</p>
               <p>This sending for the Captaines was signified from the Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall by shooting off a piece of ordnance, and by displaying in the sterne two of the Princes ensignes. The same night, the fleet did againe set saile, &amp; doubled the point of Zartenes, there comming to an anchor, expecting the Vice-Admeral of Amsterdam.</p>
               <p>But all that night they could not descrie her; so as in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, on the thirtieth of May, they went forward with a North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>west wind, shaping their course East-North-East, and about Noone they came neere to Beuersier, with a faire wind which did blow from West-North-West, but towards night they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed. In the euening, the formost ships tooke off some of their sailes tarrying for those that were hindmost.</p>
               <p>The last of May, by day breake, they came in ken of the Isle of Wight, directing their course Eastward with a Westerlie wind. About Noone the ayre was cloudie, so as the Fleet durst not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the shoare, but lessened their sailes, putting to Sea.</p>
               <p>The first of Iune, in the Morning, they descried Gausteert, directing their course towards Plimmouth, and there stayed, tarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the two Brigantines they had sent abroad, who whithin a
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:14840:120"/>
while after came to the Admerall: whereupon, another martiall Councell was held; after which the fleet with full saile shaped their course South-South-East, but towards Euening the ayre began againe to be cloudie, and the night was verie calme.</p>
               <p>The ninth, by day breake, the whole fleet came vpon the coast of Galicia, neere to Viuero, and holding their course North-East to the Northward, and North-North-East, towards Euening they came right ouer against the Cape Ortegall, which lyeth some 11 German leagues from the Groyne. In the night the wind <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urnd North-East and by North; and being come to the height of 44 degrees &amp; 24 minutes, the said Cape stood off from them 5 leagues South-East to the Southward.</p>
               <p>The tenth of Iune, they set saile with a South-West wind to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards East-South-East, along the shoare towards the Groyne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A description of the Groyne.</hi>
                  </note> which they descried about Noone, making all things readie to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile it. It is a Sea towne in Galicia, standing in the height of 43 degrees and twelue minutes on the North-side of the line, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit to England and Ireland, one hundred and fifteene German leagues from Plimmouth, being seated on a triangular Cape in a deepe and spacious Bay, where not onely the sayd Towne hath a goodlie Hauen, but Ferol, Ponta de Mas, Pitança, and Fontuna, haue the goodliest and most commodious Ports of Christendome: In which regard the king of Spaine had lately fortified it with many Castles, and there and at Ferol, he rigd his fleet for England, Ireland and the Netherlands, together with that of this present yeare.</p>
               <p>In some sort to hinder the preparation of that Spanish Fleet, and there to destroy the King of Spaines ships and meanes, the Admerall <hi>Vander-Does</hi> was commaunded to assaile the Groyne with his fleet.</p>
               <p>To this end, on the eleuenth of Iune, the wind being North-West to the Westward, the six aboue mentioned ships went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore towards the Groyne to see how things were there ordered, directing their course South-South-East towards the Cape de Prior, where they stayed to the Southward of the Towne. Those of Ferol descrying these ships, sent forth two shalops to know what they were, because the day before, they had seene the fleet at Sea. These ships went before the wind to attend these shalops, which suspecting somewhat, kept aloofe off and would not come
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:14840:121"/>
neere, but our men cried out aloud saying that they came from Hambourg, and that they were loaden with marchants goods, and onely wanted a pilot to carrie them into the Groyne.</p>
               <p>By this means our men got one of the shalops to come aboord, and tooke a Spaniard, but those that were in it made all the hast they could to escape. The Spaniard whome they had taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, was one of the Kings seruants, and was come the same day from the Groyne: He being brought to the Admerall, told him that some 4000 foot, &amp; certain horse, with 36 carts of siluer readie coyned, &amp; 300 pipes of wine, were come to the Groyn to furnish the future Spanish fleet.</p>
               <p>After dinner, the whole fleet came before the Groyne, where they met with the Vice-Admerall of Amsterdam. The Groyne and the aboue mentioned Castles, were well prouided of strong garisons, ordinance, munition, and other necessaries, hauing a long time before had intelligence of the comming of this fleet by Hispaniolized French and Dutch.</p>
               <p>The Admerall <hi>Vander-Does</hi> at his first ariual did presently with all his ships fall beneath the towne, casting anker at 13, 12, and 21 fathom.</p>
               <p>Those in the towne and Castles plaid furiously with their ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance vpon our men, so as in a short space they made more than 200 shot. Beneath the towne 12 great Gallions lay with certaine other French ships, which likewise discharged their ordnance vpon vs: yet their shot did no hurt to our fleet, onely one vessell was spoiled.</p>
               <p>The Admerall perceiuing such resistance, sent for all the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Officers to come aboord his ship to consult together how they might best assaile the enemie: yet in regard the Citie was so well prouided, they thought it not fit to hazard the whole fleet, or for one town to lose their good fortune, in atchiuement of other enterprises.</p>
               <p>And therefore the fleet went thence, not medling with the towne, and because it was verie calme weather, they caused their boats to towe their ships, lying still open to the shot, both from the towne and castle, which did them no harme.</p>
               <p>Toward euening the wind rose, so as the whole fleet was vnder saile, holding their course South-South-east towards Cape Saint Vincent, that they might on a sodaine surprise Saint Lucas.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:14840:121"/>Saint Lucas is a towne in Andaluzia on the Southern coasts of Spaine at the mouth of the Riuer of Seuill, in the height of 39 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees &amp; 40 minutes: but the Admerall <hi>Vander-Does</hi> being already gon beyond S. Lucas, left off that enterprise, because the time was to far spent, &amp; the wind stood faire for the Canaries, making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to inuade those Islands, which are in number 7, viz. the graund Canarie, Palma, Tenerifa, Forteuentura, Fero, Gomera, and Lancerotta. They are not far one from another, and are seated betwixt 27 and 30 degrees from the line, they are all called Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after the name of the fertilest of them, heretofore called Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, and now the Grand Canarie.</p>
               <p>These Islands by ancient writers were in former times termed the fortunate Islands,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Description of the Canaries.</hi>
                  </note> in regard of the aboundance of all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and fruitfulnesse of the soile, producing all things fit for the sustenance of mans life, but especially the grand Canarie, Palma, and Tenerifa, which do not onely produce all necessaries in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, but likewise sugars, wine, and oile, and such like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, wherewith they store Europe and other Countries.</p>
               <p>These Islands haue been a long time subiect to the Spaniards, who now remaine there, and are not inhabited by their auncient inhabitants, who now are all rooted out. But by whom and how they were subdued and by what meanes they fell to the Crowne of Spaine is not certainly knowne; this only cannot be denied that Forteuentura, Fero, Lancerotta, and Gomera, were the first that were taken, and the Grand Canarie, Palma &amp; Tenerifa were long after that Pagans.</p>
               <p>The valour and crueltie of these Islanders, their discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hauens, and dangerous sea coasts, caused them so long to hold out against the Christians, whom they haue often repulsed with great losse. The Fleet directed it course towards the Canaries forcibly to inuade the Grand Canarie and Gomera, according to the appointment of my Lords the States. The Admerall sent for al the Captains &amp; Commanders &amp; Pilots to consult with them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the commodities of the said Islands. He likewise distributed the Marriners vnder new Captains, 130 men vnder euery En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, &amp; gaue order for all things, instructing the captains how to behaue themselues on shoare.</p>
               <p>And because the fleet did daily approach the line, comming to the hottest part of the world, where too much eating and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:14840:122"/>
is very dangerous causing sundry diseases, and commonly death, the Admerall did verie descreetly moderate his souldiers diet commanding euerie man strictly to obserue it: He likewise sent for all the land and sea Captaines to aduise him in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to assaile the enemie and towne.</p>
               <p>The 24 of Iune the wind was still North-North-West, &amp; they went South-South-East, so as toward euening they descried Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerotta, and bending their course thither-ward they went East to the South-ward. The 25 of Iune in the morning they came neere to Lancerotta, and Forteuentura, which they might descrie, and after noone, they doubled it, going towards the South-East a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Westerne coasts, and about Euening descried the grand Canarie; whereupon, they struck saile, and tarried till the second watch, &amp; then did againe set forward, directing their course East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward the grand Canaries, which stands in the height of 28 degrees on the hither side of the line, and 155 German leagues to the South East towards the South of Saint Vincents Cape in Portugal, being in compasse 260000 paces, amounting in all to 26 German leagues. On the East side of this Island stands a small town called Allagona, wherein are aboue foure hundred houses: It is the chiefe Towne of all the Canaries, and there the Iudges Courts both Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill, with the Inquisitor of Spaine, and the gouernor of the Islands for the King, doe reside.</p>
               <p>Through the Town runnes a small shallow riuulet which des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends from the neighbour mountaines, and emptieth it selfe into the sea, &amp; is in no sort capable of shipping. The hauen of the grand Canarie lies foure hundred paces towards the North-North-East of Allagona, and is of an indifferent breadth and depth: For defence of this Hauen, the King of Spaine had caused a strong Castle to be built, called Gratiosa: All the forts of the grand Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie were prouided of strong Garrisons, munition, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries.</p>
               <p>The 26 of Iune, the fleet with a North-East wind entred the Hauen of the grand Canarie, and all of them together came to an anker beneath the Castle Gratiosa.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, the Spanish Gouernor came with seuen Spanish Companies to the Sea side, placing gards vpon the hauen, planting three small peeces of ordnance behind certaine bankes to hinder his enemies landing.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:14840:122"/>
vpon the fleets arriuall the Gastle Gratiosa playd furiously vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, but the Admerall, vice-Admerall and those ships which carried the biggest ordnance drew neere the Castle and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with the like.</p>
               <p>Two Spanish ships rode neere the Castle, one of which was sunke, and the other together with a small barke, was brought to the fleet. By this meanes the Castle was much weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and those within it began to be discouraged, leauing off their furious shooting, notwithstanding that they had alreadie torne some ships and slaine certaine mariners.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, the Admerall did presently man his boats and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his men, &amp; those ships that could not reach the Castle, bent their ordnance vpon the shoar driuing the enemie thence. These boats rowed altogether to land-ward, where for a while they fought with the enemie. The Admerall perceiuing that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would not remoue, and that the water was shallow, leaped vp to the middle in the Sea, and with his men marched brauely against them.</p>
               <p>By this means the Spanish troupes after some slight fight were beaten from the shoar, flying towards Allagona together with the Kings Gouernor, who lost his leg: many were hurt, and some 36 of them slaine. Of our men, the Admerall at his first landing was hurt in the legge with a pike, and was in great danger, but he was rescued by one of his souldiers who brauely slew the Spaniard that had hurt him. The Admeralls Lieutenant Generall was shot into the throat, and another Captaine in the head, and beside these some 20 souldiers were slaine and wounded. The Admerall hauing woon the shoar, sent all the boats back againe to the ships to fetch more men, to the number of 24 Ensignes, which were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into seuen troups, and marched in order of battaile 21 in front. Those in the Castle kept themselues quiet, discharging no one shot after our men were landed, making signes as if they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to yeeld, which the Admerall vnderstanding, went thither with certain Captains and souldiers, and at his arriuall, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny capitulation at all they yeelded on discretion. There were 138 men in the Castle, many had bin slaine and some fled thence; there were likewise 9 cast peeces in it and 6 of yron, with all sorts of munition. These 138 men were brought prisoners into the ship which was taken, 3 captains except, whom the admeral kept nere
<pb facs="tcp:14840:123"/>
him to be by them instructed concerning the affairs of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. In this manner, Graciosa, the strongest Castle not onely of Grand Canarie, but of al the other Islands, was easily taken, which was presently manned with 80 souldiers, who threw downe the King of Spaines ensignes, and displaied that of Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two Moores were at the same time brought to the Admerall which were taken in the mountaines, who because they were found sleeping could giue no certaine aduertisement.</p>
               <p>In the night, 24 ensignes went towards Allagona, where they diuided themselues into foure troups, the first placed themselues beneath the towne, the second vnder the neighbour mountaines, the third vpon the shoare, and the fourth made the rereward: These foure troupes stood all night imbattailed, and the 27 of Iune by day breake, they came all together before Allagona: But the townesmen defended themselues, and shot fiercely from the Castle which stands on the North side, not without some losse on our part. Thereupon, our men retired behind the neighbour hills, where they began to intrench themselues, and by that means secured themselues from the Canon.</p>
               <p>Those of Allagona, perceiuing our men to be intrenched, brought six small Falconets vpon the hills, which they charged with woodden bullets, and did vs much harme, because they had so well planted their peeces: Tenne or twelue of our men went vp the hill, but returned without any exploit, one excepted which fell into the Spaniards hands, who did cruelly cut him into foure quarters. This inhuman crueltie incensed our men and caused them the same night, to doe the like to a Spaniard.</p>
               <p>The Admerall perceiuing the enemies great resistance, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed fiue peeces of ordnance to be brought from the Castle, which he had woone, therewith to make a batterie and by Canon shot to enforce the Towne to yeeld.</p>
               <p>Those of Allagona made a counter batterie, attempting by their shot to driue their enemy thence and to enforce, him to giue ouer his worke.</p>
               <p>But our men did valiantly perseuer, and in a short space plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the batterie notwithstanding that diuers of them were slaine by the townesmen, and that night planted three Canon, and shot fiue or six vollies into the Towne.</p>
               <p>The 28 of Iune at night, the 24 ensignes were embattailed, 15
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:14840:123"/>
in front, and by day break euery man went to his appointed place, making preparation to assault the towne the same day: The two other peeces were likewise planted on the batterie, foure to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the North Castle, and the fifth to play vpon the Falconets, and presently began a furious batterie on all sides. Foure did continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally batter the Castle, so as those of Allagona were much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed and were enforced to place wooll sacks and barrells full of stones vpon the Castle, by that meanes to shadow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: But this, in steed of profiting, did most annoy them, for when the bullets touched the barrells of stones, they scattered them abroad and slew as many as stood neere them: So as by this means the Castle before noone was wholly ruyned, and the enemies pride abated, wherupon, the Admerall presently sent foure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies vp to the hils to driue the enemy from those Falconets, and to set fire on the Citie gates:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Those of Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gona forsake the town which is taken by the Admerall Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Does.</hi>
                  </note> But they within it perceiuing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame danger, and their enemies furious assault, abandoned the Towne and Castle, and with their wiues, children, money, iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells, and whatsoeuer they could carrie with them, fled into the mountaines.</p>
               <p>The Admerall perceiuing that the enemie fled from thence, caused two ladders to be forthwith brought from a Church that stood without the towne, the first was too short; yet on the other, himselfe was the first man that mounted the walles, and was cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageously followed by his souldiers: some ranne presently to the Castle, where they found fiue brasse peeces, and tooke downe the King of Spaines ensigne, displaying that of his Excellencie.</p>
               <p>The enemy had made a mine in the towne gate, which as our men came before the walles, was blowne vp of it selfe, and did hurt to no man: they had likewise scattered great store of gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder heere and there, but our men did sier it. And in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Allagona, the chiefe of all the Canaries, was by Gods fauour forcibly taken on the 28 of Iune about noone, by foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Dutch ensignes, after it had beene beseeged two dayes, batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Spanish ordnance, and scaled with her owne ladders. The Admerall hauing most of his men in the towne, did againe embattaile them in a void place, fifteen in front, whither the foure Companies which he had sent along by the hill side to enter the towne, came vnto him, bringing with them a man of Flushing, whom they had freed from prison. The Admerall, together with
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:14840:124"/>
him, and other Captaines, went to the prison of Allagona, where they found thirtie six prisoners, whom they presently released.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards, had carried one English man and a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man away with them into the mountaines, who had already been committed to the holy house (as they terme it) and were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be burnt. Toward euening, all the souldiers and mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the fleet came to the towne and sackt it, certaine houses and goods excepted, which the Admerall had seized on for his owne vse.</p>
               <p>That night all the Captaines with their companies were lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in houses apart, and kept good gard euerie where, for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie did often shew himselfe vpon the hills.</p>
               <p>The 29 of Iune in the morning certaine mariners did rashely ascend the hills, whom the enemie (which was skilfull in the waies and passages) surprized and for the most part slew.</p>
               <p>Toward Euening 300 men marched toward the Castle on the South side of Allagona, but so soone as the Spanish Garrison saw our men, they presently fled to the mountaines.</p>
               <p>In this Castle, our men found three canon, with other munition, and it was manned with some few of our men. In the night the Spaniards came secretly downe the hill, surprized our centinell and slew him.</p>
               <p>The last of Iune by day breake our men begun to ship the wines and other goods. About noone fiue Spanish Captaines came to our centinells with a little flagge in signe of peace, and were brought to the Admerall, and after they had conferd with him, were againe sent back to the mountaines. The enemie often times sent in this manner, onely to spie what we did, whereupon the Admerall would no more speake with any that came, but on the second of Iuly proclaimed by sound of Drum that euery cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinell shold send back all such as came from the mountaines with flags of truce.</p>
               <p>The first of Iuly a Sermon of thanksgiuing was made in the great Church of Allagona by a minister of the Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by whom thankes was giuen to God for their victory obtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, earnestly beseeching him daily to increase it for the glorie of his holie name and benefit of his Church. The same day, the Admerall sent foure ships to Sea, as well for other respects, as to trie their good fortune, and to lie in waite for certaine Spanish
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:14840:124"/>
chants. The second of Iuly the Admerall commanded that no man without leaue should attempt to goe vp into the mountaines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the souldiers rash and vnaduised incursions had caused diuers of them to fall into the enemies hands. After dinner, one of our Brigantines tooke a small Spanish Fisher boat neere to the Island Forteuentura, wherein were 7 men which were presently brought to the Admerall, who imprisoned them. The same night, the rest of the goods were shipt, and the third of Iuly by day breake our men carried away the Bells, ordnance, and munition which the enemie had left in the towne, aboord their ships, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all things in a readinesse for their speedy departure from the grand Canarie, that they might put their other enterprises in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
               <p>The Admerall, notwithstanding the great danger in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines whether the enemie was fled, had determined to assaile them and to take away those goods which they had carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: To this end, on the fourth of Iuly in the morning 2000 men marched vp towards the enemie, and gaue him a furious charge, but after some slight encounter, the enemie retired farther vp into the hills, into Caues and obscure places, by rough and vnknowne waies, and our men returned without any exploit, and with losse of some 70 men. The same day, the Admerall did fire the Town of Allagona, with all the Cloisters, Churches, and houses round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, rasing all the Castles, and so in good order, himselfe and men left the Towne and returned to their ships. We were no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner gon, but the enemies entred it, and labored to quench the fire, and often times shewed themselues in small troupes, whilest our men embarkeed themselues, but durst neuer come neere our boats.</p>
               <p>The fift, sixt, and seuenth of Iuly the fleet remained in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and Road of the graund Canarie, as well in regard of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie winds and other impediments, as also to tarrie for the foure ships, which had beene sent to Sea.</p>
               <p>The Admerall in the meane time did carefully visit the fleet, and in the places of those commanders that were dead, he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted others. He likewise called all the Captaines aboord his ship and conferred with them concerning the commodities of the other Islands of the Canaries.</p>
               <p>Our men burnt one of their owne ships which at the fleets first
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:14840:125"/>
arriuall, had beene battered from the Castle Graciosa, the Captaine hauing transported his men and goods into the barke which they tooke in the Road. In this meane time certaine Spaniards came at sundry times to the water side with flags of truce, who in a boat were brought to the Admerall, and afterwards sent back againe, after they had redeemed some prisoners.</p>
               <p>The eight of Iuly in the morning, the fleet sailed along the Coast of the Grand Canarie, and at the North point met with the foure ships which had beene at Sea: So soone as they descried the fleet, they weighed anker, and did put to Sea with the rest. Toward Euening the wind blew hard, so as the fleets course was stopt, which returned to the South-East point of the Grand Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, where they all came to an anchor in the view of Tenerif. The ninth of Iuly all the boats went on shoar to fetch in fresh water, vnseene of the Spaniards. The tenth, the fleet did againe set saile with a North-West wind and were presently becalmed.</p>
               <p>The 11 of Iuly in the morning, the wind againe was faire, but comming neere to Tenerif, the weather grew calme and verie changeable, so as the fleet was dispersed, being not able to hold on their course, but were enforced to come to an anchor twelue times in one day.</p>
               <p>The twelueth of Iuly, the wind was more constant, so as the fleet directed it course towards Gomera. Gomera is the least Island of all the Canaries, and hath a small towne on the South-west part thereof, with a strong Castle vpon the shoare.</p>
               <p>Towards euening the greatest part of the fleet came vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; among others, the Rere-Admerall, <hi>Ian Geerbrantson</hi> with his white flagge, who in the night with two other ships rode neere the towne: But those of Gomera began presently to shoot at them, so as the said Admerall did speedily fal off, and with as many ships as were neere him, came to an anchor, waiting for the rest of the fleet, which was farre off betwixt Tenerifa and Gomera.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth of Iuly before noone the whole Fleet came together and sayled towards Gomera, and doubling a poynt to the North-west of the Towne, they came to an anchor.</p>
               <p>The Admerall presently sent for all the Captaines and held a Martiall councell, acquainting them with what they were to do.</p>
               <p>Thereupon foure Ensignes of souldiers were presently landed in the valley, to assault the backside of the towne, and to hinder
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:14840:125"/>
the enemies flight into the mountaines.</p>
               <p>After that, the fleet went forward before the towne, on which it forthwith bestowed some shot and found no resistance at all. Then the Admerall landed 6 Ensignes moe, who without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance entred the town and Castle: For so soone as the enemies descried the fleet, they fled away like those of Allagona with their wiues, children, and goods into the mountaines, hauing buried their bells, ordnance, wines, and other commodities heere and there in the fields.</p>
               <p>The foure aboue mentioned Ensignes perceiuing the enemies flight, sent a troup of souldiers before to intercept them, &amp; to take those goods which they caried with them: But the Spaniards ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing notice thereof, hid themselues in Caues and darke places, &amp; in a valley incompassed our men.</p>
               <p>Our men thus inclosed on euery side, made braue resistance and slue many of the enemie, and in the end after a cruell fight, made way thorough them, and retired to the towne, hauing lost some 70 or 80 men, among whom were two Lieutenants, which had behaued themselues very valiantly, one of whom had receiued fiftie wounds in his body.</p>
               <p>After dinner, the Admeral placed strong gards euerie where, &amp; commaunded the souldiers to search the fields, where the same night they found diuers pipes of wine. In the night our men took a Spaniard who by the Admerals command was committed to the Prouost Marshal, to cause him the next day to discouer such goods as were hid: but about midnight, by negligence of his keepers, he escaped, &amp; so fled into the mountains. The 14 of Iuly in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning our men shipt all the enemies goods, and after dinner, found three bells more which were buried in the fields.</p>
               <p>The 15 of Iuly in the morning, 10 or 12 of our men running rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vp the hils, were enuironed &amp; slaine by the enemy. The same day, the Admerall made a Generall muster, and those ships which were not double mand and victualled, began to deliuer vp the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of their munition &amp; souldiers to the other ships, &amp; in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, the sick and hurt men were stowed in them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made to send them home into the Low-Countries, to carie newes of their victories and purchase, gotten from the enemie euen in his owne Countrey. After dinner, our men found two great peeces of ordnance, the one sixteene foot
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:14840:126"/>
and a halfe long, and the other 14 foot.</p>
               <p>The 16 of Iuly after dinner, the enemie shewed himselfe sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry times, scoffing at the defeat of our men in the valley, and in derision, bad them to come fetch their muskets which they had left behind them. Thereupon, the Admerall would haue landed certain souldiers &amp; mariners, to assaile the enemie the next day in the coole of the morning: but in the night a great tempest arose so as the fleet in regard the ships lay neere together, had like to haue suffered shipwrack, had not some of them fallen off farther to sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and there anchored, so as by this meanes the former deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination was hindred, and peraduenture the mischiefe preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted which might haue befallen our men, if they had gon vp into the mountaines to the enemie.</p>
               <p>The 17 of Iuly 300 men were sent to the said valley to visit the enemie, who keeping himselfe hid, our men returned, bringing with them two small brasse peeces, and two barrells of pouder which they found buried in the ground.</p>
               <p>The 18 of Iuly they shipt all the enemies goods, &amp; those ships which were appointed for execution of such enterprises as were to be made in the King of Spaines remotest dominions, were sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with such proportion of Canarie wines as befitted the length of their voyage.</p>
               <p>The 19 the Admerall fired the townes, cloisters, and houses neere adioyning, abandoned the Island, and shipt his men, whereupon, the Spaniards presently came forth of their starting holes to the towne and quenched the fire, as those of the Grand Canarie had done.</p>
               <p>The 20 the fleet remayned in the Road of Gomera, receiuing instructions from the Admerall what course they should hold; he sent for all the Captaines, highly thanked them for their good and faithfull seruice, and earnestly intreated them to proceed from good to better.</p>
               <p>The 21 of Iuly, he sent againe for the Captaines and Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and courteously tooke leaue of those which were to returne home, making <hi>Iean Gerbrantzon</hi> their Admerall, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding them to follow him, and to obey his commandements. Then the fleet was seperated, and failed with a Northerlie wind. The Admerall <hi>Vander-Does</hi> with 36 ships, held on his course South-South-East towards the kingdoms of the Western Indies, &amp; <hi>Iean Gerbrantzon</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:14840:126"/>
with 35 ships, and an Easterly wind sayled home-ward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iean Gerbrantzon</hi> till the 24 of Iuly kept his whole fleet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they were afterward dispersed by continuall tempests, and contrarie winds, taking sundry courses vnder sundry Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merals, euery man striuing who should first get home.</p>
               <p>Sixteene of these ships vnder their Admerall <hi>Frederick Arentz</hi> did on the eight and twentieth of August, in the height of thirtie six degrees and twelue minutes to the Northward of the line, meet with two small Spanish ships, going from Capo Blanco, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Wolvis: In those ships were seuen and fortie men, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong those a Spanish marchant, fortie seuen Muskets, foure peeces of ordnance, and were loden with sundry commodities amounting to the value of 60000 ducats, and had in them beside foure tun of trayne Oyle, and Arabian Gums, and two thousand one hundred and fortie Rialls of siluer plate.</p>
               <p>These thirtie fiue ships came altogether about the eight, ninth, and tenth of September into sundery Hauens of the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and were with great ioy welcomed home.</p>
               <p>But Generall <hi>Vander-Does</hi> with his thirtie six ships went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Coasts of Affrick and Guiney, along by the Islands of Cape Vert, and so to S. Thomas, which is an Island vnder the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall line, where they forcibly landed, but the inhabitants with their goods fled into the mountaines: our men by entren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and approaches which they had learned in the Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries tooke the Castles. The inhabitants did afterward come downe from the mountaines being seuen thousand in number, and assailed our men, but the Generall repulsed and slew many of them. In the end, the Island and Towne of Pauoasan with the Castles were sackt, and the booty carried to the ships. They found an hundred brazen peeces there, nine thousand chests of browne Saint Thomas sugar, one thousand foure hundred Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants teeth, much Cloth, Cotton, and other marchandize, with a very great sum of money.</p>
               <p>But hauing beene long at Sea, and the ayre very vnwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some and pestilentiall for our men, who could not temper and moderat their dyet in that hot Countrey, nor absteine from fruits, a disease or burning feauer, in those parts termed <hi>la Madorca,</hi> which commonly fals on those that come from Europe, seazed on them, some of them had their grease melted in their bodies as if it

                  </note> and among others, the Generall <hi>Vander-Does,</hi> which was a great losse to the fleet and vnited Prouinces, for he was a valiant Gentleman, and skilfull in the art militarie both by land and sea. His men buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in an house in the Island deepe in the ground, and then burnt that house with others, to the end his bodie might not be found. There died likewise his Nephew, <hi>George Vander-Does,</hi> sonne to that learned Gentleman <hi>Iean Vander-Does</hi> Lord of Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wijck, with diuers other land and sea Captaines to the number of fifteen and some 1200 Souldiers and Mariners. After their death Captaine <hi>Cornelius Leynsen</hi> tooke vpon him the Commaund of the fleet, and hauing embarked all the goods together with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor <hi>D. Francisco de Meneces</hi> he failed homeward, sending seuen of his best ships with one Brigantine vnder the conduct of the Captaines Hartman, Broer, and others to the coast of Bresill, with instructions what to doe.</p>
               <p>Himselfe being likwise sick did in Februarie 1600 bring home his ships, with the bootie and many prisoners: His men were so sick and weake, as certaine of his ships through want of men stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in France others in England, and one in Ireland. Among the rest, one ship that was weakly manned &amp; wanted a Pilot, the ayre being mistie came to Sluce, where it was taken, there was in it some money, and some foure or fiue hundred chests of sugar.</p>
               <p>The aboue mentioned seuen ships vnder the conduct of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Hartman went to Bresiill, where they likewise met with good booty doing great hurt to the enemie, and returned home n anno 1601. There was hope that this fleet would haue done great mattsrs, but they could not meet with the Spanish fleet which went from Cales to the West Indies: and then, things fell not out according to their expectation for they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with sicknesse by being enforced by contrarie winds to stay long in those hot Countries. Their owne profit was not so much to them as the losse was to their enemies: They haue put the King of Spaine to great expence, they haue purchased honour, and made Spaine iealous of other such like inuasions, and putting it in feare of losing his Indian fleet.</p>
               <p>These are the principall matters done by this fleet: wherein if we consider, the experience of the pilots, discreet conduct of the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:14840:127"/>
Captains, and valour of the souldiers, we cannot but admire: espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if wee looke vpon the great victories obtained by them whose fame hath qualified the Spaniards crueltie against our sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and themselues braued the enemy in his owne land, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Groyne declared the admirable strength of the vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, and haue sought out the King of Spains future fleet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he thought not only to haue caused the Low-countries, but all Europe to tremble, hauing challenged and dared it to fight, euen in so many townes and castles of Spaine: and hath beside so easily woon the Grand Canarie, the mightiest of al the Islands, the taking whereof cost the last King of Spaine many tun of gold &amp; many braue &amp; experienced souldiers; which Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> could not effect, notwithstanding that he in a maner tooke all the sea townes and castles of the Westerne Indies, and terrified the whole Spanish world. Who would euer haue thought that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagona the chiefest Citie of all the Canaries wold haue been so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily taken, that Gomera would haue been woon without any resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and his Garrison slaine? Is it not a great matter that the whole Island of the Grand Canarie and Gomera haue been rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the townes, castles, and houses burnt, the ordnance an muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and other commodities brought thence, that such great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poore &amp; wretched captiues haue bin freed from the hands the bloudie Spaniards? Let the King of Spaine stay our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, let him kill and burne our Mariners, and suppose that he hath weakenedour countries: yet he shall find that wee haue braued him in his owne Realmes, and made his Cnaries so wast and desart, as of along time he will reape no profit by them: and we on the contrary encreased our countries meanes, by wealth, gotten from him and reuenged our intollerable wrongs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by Gods assistance we will still valiantly persist.</p>

noone begin to march, and went the same night to Niekercke neere to Watchtendonck; after some repose they went towards the towne, where some ouer the yee, and others by the dikes gat vp vpon the Townes Rampiers: there were not aboue 80 souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers both in the towne and Castle, for the horse Garison was gon a boothaling toward Cologn, where they sackt the Castle of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-stuyt, where they were beaten by certain souldiers of the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Bonne &amp; Bruiler. His Excellencies souldiers being gotten into the town, the alarme was presently giuen, but they found no great resistance, but with ease became masters thereof. That done, they placed certaine musketiers vpon the rampiers, causing them to shoot continually vpon the Castle, and on such as made de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, whereby the Gouernor the Lord of Geleyn was hurt in the throat, and some other slaine. The Gouernor had but 30 souldiers with him, and presently sent to the Earle of Bergue that lay at Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remond, for aide, who forthwith sent thither all the Garisons neere adioyning; but they came too late, for Count <hi>Lodwick</hi> of Nassau was by this time ariued with his troups of horse.

The 14 of Februarie his Excellencie sent thither againe, vnder conduct of Count <hi>Lodwick,</hi> assembling seuenteene cornets of horse, and two thousand foot, either to send a greater Conuoy to Wachtendonck, or else vnder that colour, to make an attempt vpon some other towne. But in their march, intelligence was giuen that Colonell <hi>la Bourlotte</hi> was vpon a march in Brabant with his owne regiment and that of <hi>Achicourt,</hi> about a certaine exploit. The Lord of Sidenisky being at Bommel, countermand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Count <hi>Lodwick</hi> and his forces back to the Isle of Tiell, there to stop &amp; preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Bourlottes</hi> attempts. <hi>Bourlotte</hi> thought to haue made vse of some of the mutineers of Hamont, but they hauing some bad suspition of him would not march notwithstanding all his faire promises; he thought likewise to haue taken away with him part of the Garison of Saint Andrews fort, and thereupon on the fifteenth of Februarie, he tooke muster of them: But those of that Garison hauing receiued no pay of a long time began to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin the verie same day, and though, at first, they were pacified by faire words, yet the same night, they fell into a greater mutiny, discharging the ordnance, and tooke their Captaines prisoners, ransacking the Gouernors lodging and other houses. The six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth they sent their officers whom they had imprisoned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with diuers women and children to Sertoghenbusk.

               <p>AFter that his Excellencie and my Lords the States had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued intelligence, that the Archdukes souldiers in sundrie places mutinied through want of pay, and among others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, those of Saint Andrews fort, vnto each of whom at a muster on the 15 of Februarie the Archduke, somewhat to satisfie them, gaue a Doller, cloth worth a moneths pay, and two pound of bread a day, which did in no sort content them, who demaunded their whole pay for 30 moneths, and proceeded so far in their mutinie, as they threw one of their Captaines from the bridge into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, shot one of their Sergeants and enforced the other Captaines to keepe their houses as prisoners: yet afterwards they sent them to Sertoghenbusk, to see if they could procure them any content from thence. Those of the Garrison were Walons, and Almans, who fell at variance among themselues which of the two nations should chuse an Electo or Protector to gouerne and defend them in all difficulties which might arise, and ended their strife by cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lots, which fell on the Walons, who elected on of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimen. Those of Creuecoeur on the 17 of Februarie did the like.</p>
               <p>Hereupon, the States of the vnited prouinces &amp; his Excellencie resolued not to lose this occasion, but commanded 80 foot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to be in a readinesse before Dort on the 19 &amp; 20 of March, with whom he went vp the Mase towards Creuecoeur fort. The report was that his Excellencie would goe into Flanders, but he went that night to Hemert, and on the 21 of March to Creuecoeur. And though it were a verie cold season, yet he beseeged the said fort, making trenches, and preparation to plant his ordnance.</p>

                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:14840:130"/>Those of Saint Andrews fort suspecting some attempt would be made on Creuecoeur, did the very same day send two Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thither, consisting of one hundred and thirtie men. But those of Creuecoeur thought it neither profitable nor possible to keepe the place, and fearing to be contemned and casseered in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their mutinie, and dispairing euer to receiue their pay, they yeelded on composition vpon the 24 of March, viz that those which came from Saint Andrews Fort, might againe returne thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and an hundred men of the other two Ensignes that were in Creuecoeur, entred into the Sates pay: They were souldiers vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Regiment of Count <hi>Christopher</hi> of Emden.</p>

                  </note>The same day, being the 24 of March, 500 Burguignons of <hi>Varrabons</hi> Regiment went forth of Helmont and Eindhouen to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sertoghenbusk meaning to enter into Creuecoeur: but vnderstanding that the fort was yeelded vp, and that his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Cauallerie lay in the Countrey round about, they craued entrance into Sertoghenbusk; but the Burghers iealous of their owne libertie would not permit it, whereupon, they were beaten by the horsemen of Berghen, their Sergeant major and two other Captains taken prisoners, with other officers &amp; many souldiers, &amp; 290 of them were slaine: the rest of the prisoners were ransomed and set at libertie vpon their Captaines words, who promised to answere for them. And within fiue dayes after, two Cornets of horse, one of which was <hi>Grobbendoncks</hi> Cornet, were defeated as they caried a Conuoy towards Antwerp, by the Garrison of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen.</p>
               <p>The Admeral of Arragon had enlarged the fort of Creuecoeur with three great Bulwarkes, and his Excellencie remained there on the 25 of March to hasten the fortifications, and to prouide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the enemies assaults and incursions.</p>
               <p>The six and twentieth of March his Excellencie went to Dalem to the same place where the Admerall &amp; his Campe had lodged, there to fortifie himselfe, and thereby to intrench Saint Andrews great fort, where the Garison through want of pay were still in a mutinie. Before his ariuall there, he caused the fluces at a place called great Lit to be opened, thereby to drowne the Champaine Countrey of Brabant, towards Osse, Geffen, Merland, and as far as Sertoghenbusk: So soone as he had brought his Campe to Alem, he sent Colonell Gystells with twelue foot Companies
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:14840:130"/>
to Littoyen, and opened the sluce there, the better to ouerflow the Countrey: He planted 12 peece of ordnance at Maren vpon the frontiers of Brabant opposite to Saint Andrewes fort, with which he daiely battered it.</p>
               <p>He repaired the fort at Keffell made by the Spaniards which was wholly ruinate. He likewise fortified the Church of Maren round about, the higher Countrey of Alem, a place called Saint Annes-berg, and the Church of Empel, to the end that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie (the Countrie being wholy drowned) should haue no meanes to releeue Saint Andrewes fort, vnlesse along the causey, or from Sertoghenbusk by the way of Empell, or from Graue, by Littoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Lit, Keffell, and Maren, where on all sides he should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to enforce the trenches and fortifications. By this meanes Saint Andrewes fort was altogether shut vp and inuironed with water, which with great labour and trauaile they were enforced to keepe out with their counterscarpes; it was so high at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Aprill, as none could goe in nor out of the fort but by boat.</p>
               <p>The besiegers lay in their forts vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the causey &amp; in boats. The waters being high, they could not at first entrench themselues, but at last they began to fall. The fort was battered on euerie side especially from Maren, and that so fiercely, as they were enforced to vncouer their houses, and manie were beaten downe: our men likewise went about to take the mill from them, thereby to reduce them to all want and extremity.</p>
               <p>The beseeged did brauely defend themselues, shot much, yet did no great harme to vs, who were too far off &amp; well fortified; the bullets which they shot weighed fortie, and 45 pound weight.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie sommoned them many times, but they would not harken to it, notwithstanding they saw the whole Countrie from whence they might hope for any releefe, to be ouerflowed like a sea: and yet they wanted many necessaries, as money, the sinewes of warre, clothes and other things, but espetially wood to brew and bake with: they likewise wanted medicines and drugs for sick and hurt men: they had corne enough but wanted beere, hauing no meanes to brew. They were moe than 2000 mutinous souldiers, and had no Commaunders and Captains, but their Electo and necessarie officers.</p>
               <p>Those of Sertoghenbusk were very carefull for them, and did

               <p>On the twelueth of Aprill at night they attempted to send certaine flat bottomed boates ouer the drowned Country, which came behind Maren, where they were discouered, and driuen thence: in the boates were certaine commanders, with some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisions and money.</p>
               <p>The Archdukes forces begun likewise to be assembled neere to Diest, from whence they came to a place called Os, vnder the conduct of <hi>Don Lewis de Valasco,</hi> hoping to relieue the fort: but finding the aboue named Villages vpon the Causey to be strongly fortified, the whole Country drowned, and no meanes to passe, they returned back againe.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie, the better to put the beseeged in dispaire, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Castle of Batenbourg seated betwixt Lit and the towne of Graue, in the Countrie of Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Towards the end of Aprill, as the waters of the Mase and Waell began to fall, his Excellencie brought his ordnance on euery side, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There was likewise a bridge made from Alem to the causey of Rossem 360 paces in length, in a word his Excellencie at last came so neere their counterscarpes, as it was impossible they should be releuied, whereupon the beseeged were enforced to crie out to the pioners, telling them that they desired to capitulate: diuers Wallons were persuaded by their Priests to hold out to the last man, assuring them to win Heauen thereby: but manie Almans being among them who on that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise were vnwilling to hazard their liues, they sent two men from the fort to the Campe; and his Excellencie likewise for his part sent two, viz. the Lord <hi>Vander Aa,</hi> Captaine of his gard, and the Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of Huchtenbroeck Colonell of the regiment of V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trecht: These men made a conclusion, that the beseeged, in lieu of the arerages of their whole pay due vnto them for many moneths, should receiue the sum of 125000 florins.</p>
               <p>The states of the vnited Prouinces thought it more profitable for

               <p>The 17 of Iune, after that 2000 great and small vessells were rigd forth of diuers places and Hauens of Holland and Zeeland to transport the Armie, with victualls, warlike munition, wagons, Horse for draught and all other necessaries: His Excellencie went from the Hague to Rotterdam, &amp; so to Dort, from whence he caused all the fleet to saile to Rammekins in Zeeland, which was the Rendezvous.</p>

All these with their traine, departed from the Hague about fiue of the clock in the morning and came to Rotterdam, where they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked themselues, and sailed the same day to Saint Annes-Lant, where they came to an anchor, tarrying for the tide.</p>
               <p>The 19 day because the wind was contrarie, they could that night but reach to Armuyde, and because the tide was spent they were therefore enforced to cast anchor there likewise.</p>
               <p>The twentieth about fiue of the clocke in the morning the said Lords landed at Armuyde, and from thence went to Flissingue to visit his Excellencie, who lay at anchor before Rammekins, where so great an armie and such numbers of boats lay, as no man liuing euer saw the like together at one time.</p>
               <p>The same day a consultation was had before Rammekin how to transport the army safely into Flanders for execution of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined proiect: and all things being well &amp; maturely conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, after that sundry matters were propounded, in regard the wind was contrarie, and for other difficulties which might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise at sea, they at last resolued, (because they would not long bee idle nor put the countrie to vnnecessarie expence, nor yet giue the enemie time to fortifie himselfe in those quarters) to land the whole armie at Philippine; and from thence to march thorough the Countrie betwixt Gaunt and Bruges, towards Ostend.</p>
               <p>According to which resolution, his Excellencie on the 21 day, departed with the armie towards Philippine a fort which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie yeelded vpon the first summons to Count <hi>Ernestus</hi> of Nassau, who commanded the fleets vantgard.</p>
               <p>The two and twentieth of Iune about noone his Excellencie ariued with his Armie at Philippine, the vantgard hauing alreadie taken the fort, from whence the garrison to the number of thirty or
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:14840:134"/>
fortie were departed without other armes than their swords.</p>
               <p>The same day, his Excellencie in fiue houres space landed all his forces; which done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he dismissed the boats, willing them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be gon, for feare least after the armies departure, the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie by fire or otherwise should endanger the vessells: Then he mustered his Armie, and found it to consist of twentie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand strong and able men: His Excellencie likewise rode throw the Armie, and demaunded of the souldiers, if any among them could complaine for wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The same day, the States departed from Flushing towards Philippine, and arriued there at the same time as the armie was landed: Then they began to dispose the Regiments, and to place them euerie one vnder his commaunder; and the souldiers were furnished with six daies victualls, which they were to carie along with them.</p>
               <p>The three and twentieth day the Armie marched from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippine towards Assenede, a village not far from the t'Sasse of Gant, where the vantgard before the arriuall of the whole Armie did by composition take a certaine Castle, wherein were some fortie men. Those of t'Sasse, hauing laid an ambus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado tooke thirtie or fortie of our men prisoners; our soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers likewise towards the euening, brought Priests, Bailies, and other prisoners to the army, most of whom they had taken from before Gant.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth in the morning the armie departed from Assenede towards Eeckeloo, scituate on the passage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Gant and Bruges, where seuen hundred souldiers had gone ouer the same morning that we arriued there at night: those soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were drawne forth of the forts before Ostend to man the t'Sasse, because the enemie feared wee would haue besieged the same place.</p>
               <p>The 25 we went from Eeckeloo to Male neere Bruges, where our men brought away much cattel and many prisoners from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the towne.</p>
               <p>The 26 we came within Canon shot of the Citie of Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:14840:134"/>
and marched towards Iabbeke: Those of Bruges with their ordnance plaied vpon our Armie all that day, yet did no great harme but onely slew one of his Excellencies Muleters. They shewed themselues likewise with certaine troups of horse, but durst not come forward, so as if our men had bin willing to haue fought with them, they could not haue done it with any aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>On the way betwixt Bruges and Iabbeke his Excellencie had intelligence that the Garrison was fled from Oudenbourg, so as on the 27 day, the armie marched from Iabbeke thither, whither he sent two Companies of souldiers, because the fort stood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the passage towards Ostend. Those which liue in the forts of Plassendale &amp; Bredene were likewise fled, those of Bredene left 4 peece of ordnance behind them, &amp; burnt the houses, cabbins, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition and other necessaries, hauing not once seene the enemie.</p>
               <p>My Lords the Generall States with their traine, accompanied by Count Solmes with 8 Cornets of horse, and the Regiments of French, Walons, and Swisses, together with the Colonells <hi>Gistels</hi> and <hi>Huchtenbroeck,</hi> who that day marched in the vantgard, went on and arriued the same afternoone at Ostend, and his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the meane time remayned with his armie at Oudenbourg.</p>
               <p>In all our march we found the villages naked and forsaken, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers goodly houses ruyned, &amp; not one boore to be seene, but only the Sexten of Eeckeloo and his wife, with two aged and sick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vnapt for flight.</p>
               <p>The Boores that were hidden in the woods, shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues very cruell to some of our souldiers that were scattered here and there vpon the wayes and were fallen into their hands: so as our men displayed the bloudie Ensigne, which did in no fort hinder their crueltie to vs ward.</p>
               <p>Our souldiers tooke great store of cattell, so as flesh was better cheap and more plentiful in the armie than either wine or beere. The first night we lay at Assenede, a pot of beere was worth six pence, the second night at Eeckeloo twelue pence, and the next night at Male and Iabbeke, eighteene, twentie, and twentie six. In this iourney three Cowes were offered for one pot of beere, and yet it could not be gotten. At Male a Cowe was sold for three groats, and after she was milked, he that sold it would haue giuen seuen pence for the milke.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:14840:135"/>Whilest we made this iourney by land, it hapened on the 24 of Iune that some fortie boats laden with victualls and other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision, conuoyed onely by Captaine <hi>Adrian Banckerts</hi> man of war, sayling from Flushing towards Ostend were set vpon by the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of Sluce, who on the fiue and twentieth day, tooke aboue twentie of the said boats, which being vnladed, they burnt. The said Captaine did what he could to free them from the enemie, but himselfe and one and twentie of his men were slaine in the fight, and his ship though much brused arriued at Ostend with some of the hurt men.</p>
               <p>The six and twentieth day the Admeral the Lord of Warmont ariued safely in the Hauen of Ostend with the cheefe fleet, wherein, were victualls, ordnance, munition and other necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: yet by taking of the aboue mentioned boats, the Country re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a great losse, which fell for the most part vpon some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons, who procured it to themselues by being so hastie and not tarrying for the cheefe fleet, the which consisted of many braue ships of war.</p>
               <p>To returne to that which was done on land, Count <hi>Solmes</hi> on the eight and twentieth of Iune with eight Cornets of horse and fiue foot Regiments, with which troups the day before, he had led the vantgard, went to beseege the fort called Albertus, which stands vpon the Downes, some houres iourney from Ostend, on the passage towards Niewport, it was not very great, but well built, and strong.</p>
               <p>The nine and twentieth day, hauing battered it with foure demy Canon and made a passable breach, Captaine <hi>Neron</hi> that lay there in Garrison, did beat his Drum and craued parley, in which it was granted, that the Garrison should depart thence with their armes and as much baggage as they could carrie away with them, but on condition to leaue their Ensigne behind them, promising not to serue in Flanders for six moneths.</p>

But his iourney being stopt by reason of water he returned by an other way ouer the Downes towards Albertus fort, and the next

               <p>The first of Iuly early in the morning his Excellencie mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched thence with his Camp towards Niewport, and presently gaue directions, as well as the situation of the place would giue him leaue, for inclosing and beseeging the towne.</p>
               <p>After dinner, my Lords the Generall states receiued news how that Archduke <hi>Albert</hi> had leuied tenne thousand foot and one thousand fiue hundred horse, &amp; was come to Oudenbourg: Hereupon, foure of our Companies that lay in the forts of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dene and Plessendale, withdrew themselues not tarying his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the Garrison that was in Oudenbourg, which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of six foot Companies, and two Cornets of horse (left there by his Excellencie) were enforced to yeeld it vp on composition. The like did two Companies that lay in a fort at Snaeskerck: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which Garrison though the enemie had promised good quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that they should depart with their armes and baggage, onely leauing their Ensignes behind, and the capitulation signed by the Archdukes selfe; yet they brake their promise, for first, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers horse and foot of the Garrison of Oudenbourg breaking their rancks, slew many of them, hurt others, and disarmed the rest; and for a testimonie of their treacherous and bloudie nature, did most villanously murder the two Companies that lay in Sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eskercke, contrarie to their word and promise.</p>
               <p>Some few souldiers that escaped, hauing brought these newes to Ostend, my Lords the States did in post aduertise his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie thereof, that he might be in readinesse, and presently sent more men to Albertus fort, which they furnished with victualls, munition, and other necessaries.</p>
               <p>The second of Iuly, the bloudie battaile neere to Niewport was fought, whereof we will speake in the next description.</p>
               <p>The third of Iuly, about nine of the clock in the morning his Excellencie came in person to Ostend, bringing <hi>Don Francisco de Mendoza</hi> Admeral of Arragon with him as his prisoner. And after that my Lords the states had congratulated his Excellencies victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, he requested that generall thankes might be giuen to God; which done, himselfe with the Admerall, dined with the states, the armie remayning on the Downes beyond Albertus fort.</p>
               <p>The same day, and the day before, diuers prisoners men of note, brought from the Armie to Ostend, were slaine both within and

The fourth, and fift day, whilest the armie refresht it selfe his Excellencie remained in Ostend in consultation with my Lords the states: The same day we were busied in burying our dead, looking to the hurt and sick souldiers, sending them to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they might be healed, &amp; in deliuering prisoners. Many horse, armes, and much bootie taken in the battaile, were sold: many Spanish cloakes, cassocks, with store of apparell were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise taken, which were not vnwelcome to our men.</p>

Towards Euening the Admerall <hi>Iustine</hi> of Nassau came to the States with letters of credence from his Excellencie, contayning certaine propositions wherein he craued their resolution: but the said Lords thinking it necessarie to confer with his Excellencie, sent for a conuoy. About the seuenth day we tooke from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie a certaine halfe moone standing before the towne on the North side of the hauen, which was taken with losse of six or eight men on either side.</p>

               <p>In the euening, 25 souldiers with Lopestaues and halfe pikes, were sent to leape the dikes, carrying with them two Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, each of them loden with one boat, and other prouision, to

               <p>The 11 day at night the foot Regiment of the Marquis <hi>Varra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon</hi> entred the town, and the next day they made three fires vpon the tower.</p>

               <p>The Marquis his Regiment hauing entred the Towne, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers likelie euerie day to enter, in regard we could not inclose the towne on one side, by reason of the broken lands and other inconueniences, his Excellencie found many difficulties in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing the seege; and therefore on the 13 of the said moneth, he went earlie in the morning to Ostend, to propound these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:14840:137"/>
to the States, and to craue their aduise.</p>
               <p>After some conference, it was thought fit, (seeing that Generall <hi>Wijngaerdens</hi> Regiment was newly arriued, with fiue new Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of horse (wherewith our Campe was strengthned) to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the siege, and thereupon, after that his Excellencie and my Lord his brother had dined, they returned to the Campe. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Excellencie abode in Ostend, the enemie had made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sallie on Count <hi>Ernestus</hi> of Nassau his Quarter, (but not so fierce an one as that of the day before) and was presently repulsed with losse of Commanders and souldiers.</p>
               <p>The 14 and 15 wee were busied in making three small forts, there where our batterie was to be made, thereby to assure the Canon, and in the meane time, the ordnance that was landed, was againe sent to the ships.</p>
               <p>My Lords the States perceiuing their presence at Ostend and in those parts to be to no great purpose made all things readie for their departure the next day, and to this end, the Aduocate <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenelt</hi> went to his Excellencies Campe after dinner, to confer with him once more, returning the same night to Ostend.</p>
               <p>The sixteenth of Iuly in the morning the Admerall of Nassau came to Ostend from his Excellencie, propounding new difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the States for continuance of the seege, whereon hauing consulted, they wrot back to his Excellencie that they wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd it to his owne discretion, to proceed therein as he should find it most profitable for the Countries seruice, and if he did breake vp his Campe, to giue carefull directions for the timelie imbarking of the munition, ordnance, and other necessaries, for preuenting of greater mischiefe: with this answere, they dismissed the Admerall.</p>
               <p>About fiue of the clock in the Euening my Lords the States being embarked in the hauen of Ostend, and word brought them that his Excellencie was come thither in person accompanied by my Lord his brother; <hi>Barneuelt,</hi> the Lord of Santen, and others were set on shore and had some conference with his Excellencie, which done, they tooke their leaues and returned to the ships.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie had shewed them sundry reasons, why he thought it not fit to continue the Armie any longer before Niew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and therefore resolued to depart thence, and to lead it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the forts about Ostend, and first, to assault Isabelles fort, and

 then the rest.

               <p>The eighteenth and nineteenth of Iulie, the States tarried at Middelbourg, taking order for whatsoeuer was necessarie for the Common-wealths seruice. Letters likewise were brought from Ostend, certifying them that his Excellencie had, on the 17 of the same moneth begun to breake vp his campe, &amp; had brought his armie neere to Ostend to besiege the fort of Isabella.</p>
               <p>The 20 of Iulie, early in the Morning, the generall States de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from Middelbourg to Berghen-op-Zoom, where they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued the same Euening, whither the commissioners of the other side likewise came, the same night, within an houre after their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall, being in number 23, who supped that night in the companie of the said Lords, at the gouernours house.</p>
               <p>The 21 day they deliuered their letters of credence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and after dinner, an answer was prepared for them. At night, the commissioners supt with the said Lords, whither the gouernour and some of the Magistrats were inuited: and hauing receiued their answer in an enclosed letter whereof a coppie was giuen to each of them, they departed thence on the 22 day verie early in the Morning. The Magistrats of Berghen did that day at dinner feast my Lords the States, who in the afternoone embarked themselues, and sayled till they came before Saint Annes-land, where they came to an ankor, tarrying for the Aduocat <hi>Barnevelt,</hi> and the Burgomaster <hi>Vander Dussen,</hi> who were goneto a place called Saint Martins Dike to visit Count <hi>Hohenlo</hi> who was sicke, meaning to returne the next day to the States.

The said ensignes, cornets, and some Trumpets, were, on the eight and twentieth of Iulie, hung vp in the great hall of the court, for a perpetuall remembrance of so famous and notable a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie graunted by God to these countries.</p>

               <head>¶ A true description of the bloudie battaile, betwixt. Prince Maurice of Nassau, and the Archduke Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert of Austria, woon neere Niew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in Flanders, the <hi>2</hi> of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, Anno <hi>1600.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe Archduke, vpon intelligence that his Excellencie lay before Niewport, did speedily march with his armie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Downes, the verie same way that his Excellencie had gone, intending to passe on directly to Niewport. His Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, vsing all meanes possible to hinder his comming, and to win time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did, on the 2 of Iulie, by day break, send his cousen count <hi>Ernest</hi> of Nassau forth of the armie, with 2 foot regiments Scots &amp; Zelanders, &amp; 4 cornets of horse, vnto whom the States (according to his Excellencies direction) added certaine companies of the garrison of Ostend, to stop the enemies passage ouer the bridges lying vpon a water on the high way towards the Downes neere to Alberts fort. But the enemie before their arriuall had alreadie taken the bridge, &amp; passed ouer his chief force, our men being too few to hinder his passage to the Downes, and our regiments being engaged by the enemie, &amp; too weake to make resistance against their whole armie; yet after a braue fight like valiant soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, they were at last put to rout, the whole losse falling on the Scots, who lost all their Captaines and commaunders, and 800 of themselues were slaine vpon the place, among whom were
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:14840:138"/>
eleuen Captaines, many Lieutenants, and other officers: vpon this victorie the Archduke wrot to Bruges, that he had defeated Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his vantgard, and so engaged the rest of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, as he could not escape, whereupon, Bells were the same day rung at Bruges, and afterwards in other townes, as though they had already wonne all, but, to their great losse, they soone perceiued the contrarie.</p>
               <p>This ouerthrow did greatly perplex the States and others that were in Ostend, considering the great danger the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth might haue sustained if any mishap had befallen our Campe, which lay on both sides the Hauen, diuided one from an other. And because in such extremities, when human helpe seemeth to faile, there is no better remedie than to haue recourse to the Lord of hosts: Therefore my Lords the States with their followers, and many others there present, together with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister prayed vnto God for preseruation of his Excellencies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and those of the other Lords and Captaines and the whole Armie, recommending the rest to God, hoping for fortunate successe.</p>
               <p>The Archduke being puft vp with his good fortune went in all post hast to Niewport, verily supposing that he should find his Excellencie and whole Armie daunted with this losse, and so be able easily to disorder them. But God would not haue it so, but in his mercie prouided for the preseruation of the State of these Countries, and by consqeuent for defence of his Church, giuing his Excellencie such fore-sight, as he had caused all the ships and boats to withdraw themselues from before Niew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to Ostend, and had moreouer caused his troups which lay on the one side of the Hauen of Niewport, to passe ouer at a low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel to the other shore, intending with a couragious resolution to fight with the enemie; whereupon, his Excellencie rode thorow all the troupes animating and exhorting them; That seeing they were on euerie side encompassed with the Sea and enemie, there was no meanes in the world to escape but by giuing battaile: And for that his Excellencies reputation and all their owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, liues, and wealth of the Countrie depended thereon, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated them to fight valiantly, assuring them that God wold giue them good and happie successe Count <hi>Henrie Frederick</hi> of Nassau did likewise encourage the Walons or new Gueux, of his owne

Regiment, the like did other Captaines and Commanders.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie caused his Armie before Niewport to crosse the hauen after this manner.</p>
               <p>Cont <hi>Lodwick</hi> passed ouer first with fiue Cornets of horse, two of which being Carabines, passed on towards the enemie, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten of the clock skirmished with two companies of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies horse, and then the rest followed, who were scarce come on shore, when they perceiued the enemie comming on from Ostend ward, who if he had then come forward, might haue preuented his Excellencie, ere his fanterie could haue past the Hauen: but the enemie being ignorant how many passed it, stayed a long time vpon the shore and gaue his Excellencie time to send ouer his English and Frison Regiments, which were in the vant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard together with the gards of his Excellencie and Count <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henlo,</hi> commaunded by Sir <hi>Francis Vere,</hi> and also the Regiments of French, Walons, and Suisses, that made vp the bataile com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Count <hi>George Euerat</hi> of Solmes, and in a manner all the rest of the Cauallerie, the two Regiments of Count <hi>Ernest, Gistels,</hi> &amp; <hi>Huchtenbroeck,</hi> were left to shut in the town of Niewport and commanded to stand still in good order, and to passe a bridge vpon his Excellencies first command, which was made on boats ouerthwart the hauen of Niewport.

                  <p>His Excellencie perceiuing that he must needs fight, and that he could not auoyd it, did valiantly resolue thereon, trusting to the equitie of his cause, and to God, and thereupon commaunded Count <hi>Lodwick</hi> to charge the enemie with 6 cornets of horse, <hi>viz.</hi> that of his Excellencie, Count <hi>Henrie,</hi> and his owne, appointing <hi>Marcelis Bacx, Paule Bacx,</hi> and Captaine <hi>la Sale</hi> to second them, who brake the enemies horse, and put them to rout: this done, the battaile began on euerie side with a furious batterie, which was terrible to behold: on the Downes they fought continually from the beginning to the end, but in the plaine beyond the Downes, by sundrie charges, his Excellencie hauing diuided his men into diuers troupes, vnwilling to haue them fight all at once. The General <hi>Veer</hi> fought with a battaillon of pikes of two Spanish regiments, after that he had repulsed the enemies shot. The sayd battaillon was conducted by D. <hi>Lewis de Villar,</hi> and D. <hi>Hieronimo de Monroy</hi>; on the right side, the enemie had a wing of horse, with which he did much anoy our Vantgard: Generall <hi>Veer</hi> being sore wounded, did notwithstanding fight along time, leading the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and the 2 Gards, but at last retired, being seconded by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sir <hi>Horatio Veer,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Quirin de Blau.</hi> The enemie charging furiously vpon vs, certaine of our souldiers began to flie, but it was soone redrest. Presently after the first charge, these Captaines of horse, <hi>viz.

                  <p>Count <hi>George Euerart</hi> of Solms, with the French, did, by his Excellencies command, charge, marching formost in the battaile, and diuided into two troupes, of which, that on the right hand was conducted by Monsr. <hi>Dommervile,</hi> lieutenant Colonell of the French, and the other on the left hand, by Captaine <hi>du Sau.</hi> This was the second charge of the French, fighting with a battaillon of pikes of two regiments, the one Spaniards, and the other Italians, conducted by D. <hi>Alonzo d'Aualos,</hi> and <hi>Sapena</hi> the Campe Master.</p>

Then his Excellencie commaunded Monsr. <hi>de Gystelles,</hi> who conducted the rereward, to charge with his owne regiment, and that of <hi>Huchtenbroeke.</hi> And the regiment of Count <hi>Ernest,</hi> vnder the conduct of <hi>Heusman</hi> his Lieutenant Colonell, did likewise charge.</p>
                  <p>The fight continued doubtfull for three houres space,<note place="margin">

                     </note> for now one side preuailed, and anon another, and yet his Excellencies Cauallerie had still the aduauntage of the enemies, which gaue backe by little and little, and some of them fled towards Niewport, and were pursued by our men.</p>
                  <p>The enemies Fanterie fought with better vantage on the Downes, where they tooke one hill after another, from his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies footmen; and did mightily endaunger the ordnance. Behind the Downes, Sir <hi>Horatio Veer</hi> charged, with sixe English ensignes, with Captaine <hi>Henrie Sutton</hi> his Lieutenant Colonell, Captaine <hi>Louell,</hi> Captaine <hi>Ogle,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Farfax.</hi> Count <hi>Lodwick,</hi> with tenne horse, was engaged by the enemie: cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Cloet</hi> knowing the Earle by his Orange coloured plume, charged vpon a companie of Lanciers, that were comming to charge the Earle, who by this meanes escaped: our cauallerie reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to his Excellencie, who encouraged the souldiers, re-enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them with two companies that were with him, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained the enemie to giue backe.</p>
                  <p>His Excellencie sent two cornets of horse to the shore, <hi>viz.</hi> his owne, commaunded by Captaine <hi>Bael,</hi> and Generall <hi>Veers</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie commaunded by Captaine <hi>Pembrooke.</hi>

                  <p>The Archduke, who hardly escaped, did in this battaile (both of such as were slayne and taken prisoners) lose the greatest part of all his commaunders, chiefe Lords, Noblemen, and household seruants, together with most of the captaines and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of his armie, <hi>videlicet,</hi> D. <hi>Francesco de Mendoza,</hi> Admerall of Arragon, Count <hi>Salines,</hi> D. <hi>Lewis de Villar,</hi> Campe-Master, D. <hi>Lewis d'Avila,</hi> D. <hi>Pedro de Mendoza,</hi> Doctour <hi>Andrew N.</hi> one of his highnesse phisitians, Count <hi>Charles Rezin,</hi> one of his Pages, D. <hi>Gaspar Moragon,</hi> fiue and thirtie Captaines both of horse and foot, two hundred and three Lieutenants, ensignes, Sergeants, Dons, Caualiers, and others of name, to the number of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
                  <p>And beside these, we got 8 pieces of ordnance, all the muniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, much baggage, and the verie furniture of the Archdukes own Chamber and Cabinet, and among other things his Signet, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 100 ensignes, with certaine cornets and Trumpets. The number of the dead on the Archdukes side was 7000, beside those that were afterwards slaine and died of their hurts: and his Excellencie lost betwixt two or three thousand, accounting those which had beene defeated in the Morning.</p>
                  <p>Among other ensignes, there was presented to my Lords the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall States, a Standerd belonging to 1600 Spanish mutineers, made of blew Damaske, hauing on the one side in middest of a field, the figure of our Ladie in a Sun, before whom a Moncke kneeled, &amp; ouer his head, these words in golden letters, <hi>Aue gratia plena,</hi> ouer the virgins head was a great golden star, and neere to it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:14840:142"/>
in golden letters, <hi>Stella Maris</hi>; in the middest, on her right hand, was the figure of a Sun, and neere it, these letters, <hi>Electa vt Sol</hi>; on the left hand the Moone, with this inscription, <hi>Pulchra vt Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>; at her feet stood a Turret, with these words, <hi>Turris Dauidis,</hi> and beneath vpon the hem of the Standard, <hi>Benedicta tu in mulie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</hi> On the other side, was the represention of our Lord Iesus Christ vpon the Crosse, ouer his head were these words in golden letters, <hi>Adoramus te Christe, &amp; benedicimus tibi</hi>; in the middest, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordare nouissimatua, &amp; in aeternum non peccabis</hi>; and beneath, <hi>Quia per crucem tuam redemisti mundum.</hi> All these figures were cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrought euen to the life.</p>
                  <p>In this battaile, the greatest losse fell to the Spaniards and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, who were the chiefe strength and glorie of the Spaniards armie, who in the Morning did assure themselues of the victorie, and that with such confidence, as they made no doubt of it, but marched on before, hoping alone to gain the honour of the day.</p>
                  <p>It was a magnificent and gallant victorie for my Lords the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall States, his Excellencie, and for all the vnited Prouinces, but obtayned with much labour and bloud: for on his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies side, 1000 men were slaine, among whom, were three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of horse, thirteene of foot, <hi>viz.</hi> six English Captaines, two Frizons, three French, one Walon, and one Alman, with many Lieutenants, ensignes, and other officers, beside some 700 hurt men, among whom was the noble sir <hi>Frauncis Veer,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captaines and officers both of horse and foot.</p>
                  <p>As the enemie fleed, the Cauallerie came forth of Ostend and slew many of them. But his Excellencie (who in the battaile had shewed himself valiant &amp; discreet, &amp; for better encouragement to his souldiers, had himselfe, together with his brother and other Lords there present, charged the enemie) did in the end reasse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble certaine cornets of horse, and some foot regiments, setting them in order in the place of battaile, keeping them for reseruation and seconds if any disorder should arise.</p>
                  <p>The enemie being wholly put to rout, and night drawing on, his Ex. marched to the Church of Westend, where with his whole armie he remained that night vpon the plain where the battail was fought, and in his Tent supt with the Admerall of Arragon and others, who were requested to deliuer their opinions, what they thought of these exploits, &amp; of these new vnexperienced soldiers
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:14840:143"/>
(whom they had so tearmed) who could doe nothing but win townes and skonces, not daring to shew themselues in open field; and whether they thought that they would one day proue tal soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with such other like discourses. But the Admerall grauely and discreetly knew verie well how to answer: and among other discourses, at Table, concerning the battaile, he complained of their owne cauallerie, taxing them for not doing their duetie; for had not they retreated, there was some likelihood that their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would haue become Masters of the ordnance, with which they might haue obtayned the victorie. He complained likewise of their charging all at once, and for that they had not reserued some to second the squadrons here and there, who should haue put them in order againe when they retreated, and with them haue giuen a fresh charge, as Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had done, husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his horse and foot, not hazarding all his forces at once. He highly commended his Excellencie likewise for planting his ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: but he chiefely praised him, for that he had so brauely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented his forces to his enemie, sending away all his boats, and thereby enforced all his souldiers to fight, if they meant to saue their liues, and for that himselfe and other commaunders, had no more aduauntage than the meanest souldier.</p>
                  <p>His Excellencie perceiuing, the next day, that his souldiers were much burthened with the enemies prisoners and wounded men, that all the victuals were lost in the battaile, and that they could get none, by reason that the boats were gone; marched with his whole armie towards Ostend to refresh it, sending the wounded to places where they might be cured, discharging his souldiers of the enemies prisoners.</p>
                  <p>He brought his armie to S. Maries Church neere to Alberts fort, and himselfe went into Ostend, where he presently caused publike thankes to be giuen to God for this notable victorie, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and whole Court being present at it.</p>
                  <p>He remayned certaine daies at Ostend to order matters, and to prouide for the better execution of his enterprises. He caused all the prisoners to be brought together, <hi>viz.</hi> the Admerall of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, D. <hi>Lewis de Villars,</hi> with many other Captaines and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, whom for the most part he shipt for Holland: he kept some one hundred and fiftie prisoners still in Ostend, and among them diuers hurt men, to exchange them for his owne souldiers whom
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:14840:143"/>
the enemie had taken. The glorie of this victorie belongs to God alone, who hath not onely beene pleased thereby to maintaine (as he hath wonderfully hitherunto done) the just and lawfull cause of the vnited Prouinces for the conseruation of his Church, but hath likewise pleased to abase the hautie and insolent courage of the Spaniards, learning them to feele his mightie arme, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them know how daungerous it is to kicke against the pricke.</p>
                  <p>To this onely God, the Lord of hosts, who in the battaile hath taught his Excellencies hands to fight, and so admirably exalted his countenance that day, be honour, praise, and glorie for euer.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, we must of necessitie hereunto add that which certaine Historians mention; how that justly vpon the same day the second of Iulie 1600, some three hundred and two yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>viz.</hi> in anno 1298, one of the Archduke <hi>Alberts</hi> predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours (called <hi>Albert</hi> of Austria like him) had with his power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, one of Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> of Nassaus predecessours, called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolfe</hi> of Nassau, Emperour of the Romans: whereby we may see, how that by this meanes the house of Nassau hath reuenged the wrong done to it by that of Austria.</p>
                  <p>This is a matter worthie of note, and we may be well assured, that though God deferre for a time, yet he can and will aid and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist those that put their trust in him.</p>

               <p>WHilest Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> his armie marched in Flaunders, there were some fortie or fiftie flat bottomed boats and and other vessels loden with munition and victuals, which, on the fiue and twentieth of Iune, did set saile from Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land toward Ostend: these, had a man of warre for their conuoy, whose Captaine was called <hi>Adrian Baucker</hi>: he, being come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Blauckenbourg, was becalmed: the gallies of Sluce percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it, foure of them came forth and assailed the fleet, and tooke twentie of the boats, but most of the men escaped: some of these
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:14840:144"/>
vessels they burnt, and carried the rest away with them. The man of warre made what resistance he could, but the calme made him like an vnplumed bird.

The ship, hauing at last, lost three and twentie men, among whom was Captaine <hi>Baucker,</hi> and most of the rest wounded, the men cried out desperatly, saying, That rather than they would yeeld to the enemie, they would blow themselues vp and set the ship on fire: Hereupon, the gallies left her, and with great harme and losse of men returned to Sluce, with a good bootie, and the ship went backe to Flushing.</p>
               <p>The next day, being the sixe and twentieth of Iune, the Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of Duyvenvoord, Admerall of Holland, with sixe ships of warre, called, Cromstevens, or Smackseylen, all well prouided, sailed from Zeland towards Flaunders, to conuoy one hundred and fiftie vessels laden with ordnance and warlike munition for the armie. This fleet being come before Sluce, and the wind ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie calme, foure gallies came forth; and presently the wind rising, the men of warre came so neere them, as they did not onely anoy them with their ordnance, but with their small shot: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were constrayned by force of oares to returne backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine against the wind: one of the gallies was shot vnder water, and did for a long time lye vpon one side, till the leake was stopt.</p>
               <p>A certaine Turke of Constantinople, a verie valiant and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man, being a slaue in one of the gallies, had his chaine where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was fastened, broken a sunder by a canon shot, himselfe not hurt, and perceiuing that he was loosse, leapt into the Sea with a piece of his chaine, and with great daunger of his life (for they shot terribly at him) swam to the Zelanders ships, and in swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming shewed his chaine: whereupon, the ships tooke him in: being aboord, he acquainted them with the gallies intent and losse.

               <p>MY Lords the States and his Excellencie, perceiuing the great losse they sustained by the gallies of <hi>Frederick Spinola,</hi> which lay at Sluce; resolued likewise to build and set forth certain gallies, and with them to anoy their enemies. Whilest they were making readie, the gallies of Sluce came not abroad, wanting slaues to row; for the Zeland ships had slaine most of them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them likewise were dead in winter with extremitie of cold, and those prisoners of the vnited prouinces, whom they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and made slaues, could not suddenly be brought to handle the oare.</p>
               <p>They likewise sent into Hungarie to buy Turkish prisoners, but they knew not by what meanes to transport them into the Low-Countries.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, the foure Estates of Flaunders were about to buy the sayd Gallies and slaues of <hi>Spinola,</hi> and to build others, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to moue the Archduke to goe and besiege Ostend, to free Flaunders from daily contributions and expence it was at for entertainement of so many garrisons and forts vpon passages, and to that end offered the Archduke a great summe of money.</p>
               <p>The States of Holland, did with all possible speed build a great gallie at Dort, to make head against those of Sluce, in length eight and fortie paces; so soone as it was readie, it was in September
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:14840:145"/>
sent into Zeland, it carried fifteene brasse pieces, many Bases, it was mand with rowers and souldiers: the rowers sat vpon ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and were shrowded with a defence which was musket proofe: it was called the blacke gallie of Dort, the Captains name was <hi>Iacob Michielz</hi>; it was presently sent to Sluce, and there reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered a ship taken by the enemie.</p>
               <p>On the 29 of September, the Admerall of Zeland, and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Legier</hi> with this gallie well prouided, and certaine shalops, went towards Antuerpe, and in the night passed by Ordam Fort: the garrison supposed they were boats which went to victuall Hulst: About midnight, comming before Antuerpe, they there found the Admerals ship, a goodlie great vessell, called a Smack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seil, or Cromsteven, so big and strong, as the Hollanders had none such, it was of the burthen of one thousand eight hundred tunne or more, it carried sixteene or seuenteene brasse pieces, beside those of Iron and the Bases: it had three tier of ordnance one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue another. Captaine <hi>Maes,</hi> the Admerall, was then absent; this vessell lay opposit to the new Towne, towards Flanders point. The blacke gallie stemd this ship with her yron beak so forcibly, as they could hardly get it out againe, but with great danger were faine to saw it off: the souldiers, in the meane time, became Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the ship, some of them that were in it were slaine, others leapt into the water, and escaped by swimming. The ship being taken, our souldiers enforced the two ship Boyes, whose liues they saued, to tell them where the sailes and other tacklings were, which done, they fell downe the riuer with the Tide. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise took two new vessels which daily carried prouision to Brux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els and Malines, each of them carrying foure brasen pieces, and others of yron, with fiue other vessels called Smackes, which by chaunce they tooke the same night, and with these eight vessels, fell downe the riuer towards Lillo, hauing gotten aboue fiftie pieces of ordnance, &amp; a bootie more worth than the gallie. Those of Antuerpe hearing the shot, th'alarme was presently ouer the Citie, and the sooner, because our Trumpets vpon the Key soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the song of <hi>William</hi> of Nassau, so well knowne, wherein they recorded the commendation of the late vertuous Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range.</p>

The said Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, according to his Excellencies commaund, came to Niew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerke, nere to Wachtendonck, on the eighth of Februarie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the gouernour of Stralen hauing intelligence, followed him with fortie horse, and 500 foot, who, in the Morning by day breake, did so fiercely assaile <hi>Cloets</hi> souldiers, as 40 of them were surprised ere their fellowes knew it: who at last turned backe, and perceiued that those of Stralen retired through a certaine narrow way, verie aduantagious for footmen against horse; the enemy hauing by this time taken 30 of <hi>Cloets</hi> horsemen prisoners, most of whom being of his Excellencies companie, were soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased: for <hi>Cloet</hi> thereby incensed, took another way, by which, he intercepted their passage, and incountring them at their comming forth of that way vpon a plaine, he assailed the Gouernor of Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len in front &amp; behind, and ouerthrew many of his horse and foot; the rest escaped into a house, which he presently encompassed, &amp;
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:14840:146"/>
enforced them to yeeld on composition, and on condition to pay ransome.</p>
               <p>He freely sent away three hundred and seuentie souldiers, and onely detayned the Generall <hi>Dulchen</hi> gouernour of Straelen pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, with Captaine <hi>Golstein</hi> and seuen officers as caution for the rest. <hi>Cloet</hi> lost sixe or seuen men, and many of his men and horse were hurt.</p>
               <p>After that, the foot companies of <hi>Wachtendonck</hi> came to <hi>Cloet,</hi> and went forwards towards Cracow, and arriued there on the ninth of Februarie at night: the horse men alighted, and went ouer the yee into the first Court of the Castle: thereupon, those within it began to shoot, but Captaine <hi>Cloet</hi> shot so terribly vpon the Gate, as those within it durst not abide there, and then he caused his men to crosse the dike, to let downe the draw-bridge, and to plant the Perard at the Gate, which presently brake it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: Whereupon, those within, yeelded themselues and Castle by day breake. Captaine <hi>Cloet</hi> left his Lieutenant there, with fortie men &amp; 20 horse, til his Excellencies further pleasure were known, and returned againe to his garrison, hauing performed that which was enjoyned him: and by this meanes his Excellencie became Master of this Castle and Lordship.</p>

               </head>
               <p>RHynberg is a towne belonging to the Bishopricke of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lein, seated on the Southward of the Rhyne, eight miles from Collein, it is rather small than bigge, and fortified with double rampiers, well seated both for warre and traffique, taking great toll of all goods and Merchandise which come downe the riuer.</p>
               <p>During these warres, both parties haue sundrie times fortified it: and first in the warre of Collein betwixt the two Bishops, it fell into the hands of the vnited Prouinces, which a long time held &amp; defended it against the atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pts of the Spaniards, freeing the riuer, both from the prince of Parma, who after the taking of Nuis

                  <hi>Ouerstein</hi> and sir <hi>Francis Veer.</hi> Whereupon, Count <hi>Charles</hi> of Mansfelt came presently thither from Brabant with seuentie ensignes, who in the end, on the 30 of Ianuarie 1590, woon the towne for the Bishop of Bauier (as it was reported) but in effect for the king of Spaine, as experience did afterwards manifest, that he might thereby become Master of the Rhyne, and diuide Germanie from the vnited Netherland Prouinces, and likewise to open a way for him to enter into these Countries, and to burthen the towne of Zutphen and Ouer-Yssel with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall contributions.</p>
               <p>In this regard, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> did againe besiege it on the 10 of August, in anno 1597, and after tenne dayes siege tooke it, as heretofore hath beene largely mentioned in the description of the first siege: whereupon, the Bishop crauing to haue the Towne restored to him (which was graunted) it was left vnfortified, and enforced to fall into the Admerall of Arragons hands, who easily tooke it with his mightie armie on the fifteenth of October 1598: and with so much the more ease, because the Gouernour <hi>Shaef,</hi> and the whole garrison, in a manner died of the plague, and likewise, for that treacherie the by powder, to the quantitie of 150 barrels, was set on fire: this did not onely much diminish the remainder of the garrison, but ouerthrew the greatest part of the Towne rampiers neere to Rhyn-port, and made a great breach.</p>
               <p>The town was afterward kept by a strong garrison: yet prince <hi>Maurice</hi> did besiege it on the twelfth of Iune, in anno 1601, with one hundreth and fiftie foote ensignes, and three and thirtie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of horse, it being a verie important place for these Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>The enemie reported, that there were in the towne 900 Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans vnder <hi>Iohn Baptista Pecchio,</hi> Serjeant Major, 4 Spanish ensigns, 700 Burgonians, 1300 Almans, 200 sailers, fiftie horse, amounting
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:14840:147"/>
in all to three thousand fiue hundred &amp; fiftie men, among whom were many reuolted traitors.</p>
               <p>They were well stored with ordnance and all other warlike prouision, hauing two and thirtie great piece of ordnaunce, whereof twentie were brasse, three canon, and twelue yron pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. There was likewise store of victuals and other necessaries (salt and medecines for sicke persons excepted) which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely wanted, being most necessarie in a towne besieged.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Hieronimo Lopes de la villa,</hi> borne in Barbarie of Spanish pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents was gouernour there; he was renowned for a good souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, well experienced, and much esteemed of his Countrimen. He, at the enemies first arriuall, incamped round about the towne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching himselfe with forts and counter-points: He likewise tooke in certaine pastures to feed horse and cattaile, which they durst not kill for their owne prouision, because they wanted salt to powder them: He likewise sanke his owne ship of warre, and other vessels, cutting the masts a sunder, for that the enemie shold not make vse of them.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie presently sent his ships of warre vp the Riuer, one of which the enemie sanke: These vessels kept good gard e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie where on the riuer Rhyne as far as Cullein, and by the way, met with certaine of the enemies boats which were sent abroad for prouision.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth of Iune, he tooke the Fort that stands in the Island, which being weake, the enemie soone abandoned.</p>
               <p>The campe was likewise speedily intrenched with dikes, Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadoes, gates, and draw-bridges, and the waies euerie where forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, both abroad and within against those of the towne, who in great troopes made continuall sallies, namely, on the twentieth of Iune, they fell vpon the French with 1500 men diuided into three troopes, who charged one after another, and after they had fought an howers space, were beaten backe and enforced to re-enter, not without losse on both sides.</p>
               <p>In this sallie, the French Generall the Lord of Chastillon was hurt in the legge, and the gouernour of Berck in the face, as hee stood vpon a bulwarke to behold the skirmish, so as for a time he could not speake, but was constrayned to referre the gouernement of the Towne, and authoritie of commanding to Captaine <hi>Botberg,</hi> and to an Italian called <hi>Francisco Nello.</hi>

               <p>His Excellencie, on the contrarie, did daily approach the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies trenches: he also made foure batteries, and on the first and second of Iulie, planted thirtie piece of ordnaunce: He planted 2 can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The besieged, on the seuenth of Iulie, tooke order for their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, distributing to euerie man a pound of bread a day, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fortifie the Market and Church, making it a place of retreat vpon extremitie.</p>
               <p>They had likewise sent many letters and messengers which for the most part were intercepted: so as on the 5 of Iulie they made diuers signes by fires, &amp; were continually answered with the like by those of Guelders, who gaue them hope of ayd; wherunto the Archduke seemed to encline, raising many men neere to Mae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stricht and Ruremond, who notwithstanding, were sent away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Flanders, as were the Italian troopes newly arriued, of whom, first eight hundred were sent towards Ostend, then afterwards 2500 more, and twentie forth of euerie companie of those that remained behind.</p>
               <p>And yet al these troops seemed to be appointed, for raising the siege of Berk, vnder conduct of the Earles <hi>Barlaimont</hi> and <hi>Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoy,</hi> who had alreadie made great prouisions for it at Couloigne, and hired sundry wagons, which they were enforced to send back, the enemies intent being onely to encourage those of Berck by a vaine apparance, and to cause them hold out to the last, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in the meane time to assaile Ostend on the sodaine, and thereby to draw away our armie from that siege into Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding, of all our armie no man was imbarked for Ostend, but the Admerall <hi>Duyvenvoord,</hi> with eight English com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies vnder the conduct of sir <hi>Frauncis Veer,</hi> vnto which, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards twelue other ensignes were added, in whose stead other ensignes from elsewhere arriued at the campe on the 22 and 27 dayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:14840:148"/>His Excellencie, in the meane time, came vnder the enemie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> trenches: he likewise vndermined the Counter-scarpe on the East-side of the Towne, and, on the seuenteenth of Iulie, hauing drawne great numbers of the enemies thither by a false alarme, he fired the Myne, which hauing prosperous successe, our men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently assailed it on euerie side, and tooke the Counterscarpe with losse of one hundred men, notwithstanding all the enemies resistance. This counterscarpe taken, his Excellencie made three Galleries, which were brought on as farre as the Towne Dikes, and from thence to the Bulwarke on the East-side, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to vndermine in three seuerall places.</p>
               <p>The dayes following, he likewise woon, with the time, the rest of the intrenchments which were without the towne, partly by force and Mynes, and partly because the enemie quitted them: And on the two and twentieth of Iulie his Excellencie came altogether before the Towne, hauing beene kept from it by his workes without.</p>
               <p>The next day, he sent his Trumpet to Rhynberk, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued this aunswer, That they thanked his Excellencie for his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, but that they could not as then intend to yeeld, seeing the Towne had beene besieged but one day: whereupon, his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, the day following, summoned the Towne the second time, because all his Mynes were readie to play.</p>
               <p>There the Townesman began to hearken vnto it, crauing that they might first send some speedie messengers to Guelders to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest ayd, which was denyed them.

                  </note> where they were woont to be bought and sold, and from thence sent abroad ouer all Europe: so as the sayd citie and republike flourished, and was euerie where famous in regard of the said traffique. These Spices, drugs, and other strange things, were transported by Sea from Alexandria to Venice, but they were first brought by land to Alexandria, with great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible cost and danger, as well by reason of the long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way, as the great Conuoys, which the Carauans vsually had to secure them from the incursions of the Arabians, who lay in wait vpon the waies. All these merchandises were burthened with these great costs and expence, to the profit and aduantage of those who transported them from the Indies to Alexandria, from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to Venice, and from Venice to other parts of Europe, where these things were much desired, and could be brought hither by no neerer way, nor by any other meanes, but by land, and by these Cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>uans. But, within these few yeares, by the resolution of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bold and valiant Sea men, who contemned all the fearefull and tempestious dangers of the winds and seas, and endured infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit miseries, torments and aduersities, a new way hath bin disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, altogether vnknowne to our predecessours, by which we may goe to the said Indies by Sea, <hi>viz.</hi> in sailing round about A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike, in view of the Cape of good hope, and passing from thence to the other side of Afrike, betwixt it &amp; the Isle of Madugascar, in coasting sundrie Islands, the red Sea, Arabia foelix, and the Persian
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:14840:150"/>
Sea, as farre as Calicut or Goa, or else from the said Cape, dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly towards the strait of Sunda, leauing the Isle of Maduga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scar with many moe on the left hand. By this means the said spices, druges, and other costly merchandize, haue beene brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Europe with farre lesse charge and difficultie, so as in Venice, the trade hath begunne to decay, and doth now flourish in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugall in the Citie of Lisbone,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>From thence the trade is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued to Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone.</hi>
                  </note> so as wee may say, it is remoued from one towne to an other, and that it is at this present wholy and alone in the said Citie; for all other places must rate their wares according to the price made in Lisbone. And because the Realme of Portugal, and namely the citie of Lisbone hath for certaine yeares had the said traffique, as it were proper to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, both because they were the first which discouered and found out the said way, as also for that their king gaue a certaine summe of mony to the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> to buy this priuiledge, that the Spaniards should in no sort goe that way; by this meanes the said citie of Lisbone, with the inhabitants of the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are become so rich, as perceiuing the great profit which their kingdome and people obtained by this trade, haue sought all meanes to appropriat to themselues alone this traffique, by sailing into those parts: And to this end, haue not onely subdued diuers townes, prouinces, and entier kingdomes in the Eastern Indies, subiecting them by force of armes, and continually brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them on euerie side by forts and castles, but haue likewise made leagues and alliance with other Kings, Princes, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the Eastern Indies, whom they could not subdue; as it seemed, (according to the report which came from thence hither) none should trade thither but themselues. This not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, some fewe yeares since, certaine ships of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherland Prouinces tracing the Portugals, did likewise passe the Cape of good hope, and arriued in the East Indies, where by experience they found the contrarie of that report which the Portugals had caused to bee bruted, how that none but themselues might trade into those Countries: for diuers kings and Islands where the said spices and other costly merchandizes grew, were either mortall enemies to the Portugals, or else so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined as they would not (to satisfie them) prohibit others from trading into those parts:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Portugals by force seeke to keepe the Hollanders from comming to the East In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                  </note> which the Portugals considering, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incensed with the Hollanders arriual, did with great expence
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:14840:151"/>
set forth the aboue mentioned mightie fleet to enforce the Kings of those Countries and free Islands where these spices growe, not to giue them comfort to trade with any but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: and on the other side, to keepe the Hollanders from landing or taking in fresh water, and in a word, to assaile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them in such sort, as no newes might be caried home of them into Europe. Now because this famous incounter and sea battaile happened but in the yeare 1601, and the said fleet was readie in anno 1599, wee will briefely set downe how this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada was imploied in the interim of the two yeares, because for the noueltie thereof it deserues it. The king of Calicut beeing a mortall enemy to the Vice-Roy and Portugals of Goa, and other places of the Eastern Indies, they armed against each other both by land and sea: The King had a certaine Indian in his seruice called <hi>Cunall,</hi> a man so fortunat in all his enterprises and pira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as in a short space hee became so famous and wealthie (by his continuall booties gotten from the Portugals) as those who followed his partie, seeing these happie beginnings, made him King: He had a castle and place of retreate, on the coasts of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lauar called by his owne name <hi>Cunall,</hi> or <hi>Cuchall</hi>: where after hee had forsaken the king of Calicuts partie, he did so continew his thefts and robberies for the space of 50 yeres with good successe, as in all incounters with the Portugals, hee still caried away the honor,<note place="margin">

                  </note> til at last the Vice-Roy of Goa did rigge forth the said fleet, and made peace with the king of Calicut.</p>
               <p>The King was moued to graunt this peace in hatred to <hi>Cunall,</hi> who had shaken off all obedience: &amp; so soon as he had confirmed it with the Portugals, hee did presently proclaime warre against him: The Vice-roy was loath to lose this faire occasion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might plucke this thorne forth of his owne foot, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his fleet ready, sent 1500 men vnder the conduct of <hi>D. Lewis de Gamma</hi> his lieutenant generall, to <hi>Cunals</hi> fort. This lieutenant landed all his men in a countrie called Ariori, where he fastned his ferrie boates together vpon the riuer aboue Cunal in manner of a bridge, and of these, made 31 bridges, on which hee placed gards. That done, he appointed a captain called <hi>Lewis de Silua,</hi> to passe ouer the said bridges with 300 Portugal souldiers who began the fight, and opened a way to the fort, himselfe in the meane time remaining in the Campe with the rest of his troops,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:14840:151"/>
to send succours to those that should stand in need. This done, the souldiers on the 22 of March 1599 by night passed ouer the bridges, and incountered with <hi>Cunals</hi> men on the further side of the riuer, who after a short fight, draue them thence: Towards noone 300 Portugal souldiers moe, &amp; 5000 Najos or Indian soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers which had alreadie passed ouer in an other place, marched towards the said Castle: the fight was fierce, resistance great, the ordnance and small shot plaid furioursly from both sides, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others,<note place="margin">

                  </note> captain <hi>Silua</hi> was slain with a musket shot: hee was a braue souldier, &amp; his valor caused the Portugals to make head, but so soon as he was dead, the rest fled towards the bridges, which being abondoned by the gards, floted in the middest of the riuer, so as the runnawaies could not make vse of them.</p>
               <p>This first attempt of this fleet in anno 1599 had bad successe, their owne pride &amp; ouerweining procuring their losse and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, for had they followed the King of Calicuts counsell who was present in the battaile, this had not happened, as appeared the yere following: for hauing then learned to their cost, they renewed the enterprise vnder conduct of their generall <hi>Andrea de Furtado de Mendoça</hi> on the 20 of March anno 1600. They were not now so greedy of getting all the honor to themselues, as before, but beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing themselues discreetly &amp; auoiding the former inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,<note place="margin">

                  </note> with little labour they tooke <hi>Cunals</hi> fort, &amp; himselfe prisoner, who with his souldiers were put into the Gallies. By this meanes <hi>Cunall,</hi> who from a meane fellowe became a king, was at last made a slaue. This exploit performed in anno 1600 towards the end of the yere, they began to strengthen the fleet with men &amp; two new Galions. In August 1601 they determined to goe before Bantam, but winds and tempests did so beat them back, as it was the 24 of December ere they arriued there, euen on the same day, as by a singular prouidence of God, three ships of Holland and two Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines were come thither: these fought the sea fight.</p>
               <p>The Hollanders so soone as they are past the Cape of good hope, doe commonly stow their ordnance in hold, because they haue no vse for it till they come to the strait of Sunda, and by this meanes they had like to haue fallen into the Portugals hands, had not almightie God (a matter worthie of note) sent an vnlookt for messenger to aduertize them what would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue. It was a man of China, who in his boate came to them
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14840:152"/>
and gaue them notice of the aproach of the mightie fleet of those of Goa, Cochin and Malacca, assembled before Bantam, in number thirtie saile, amongst which, were eight Gallions, twelue Foists and Gallies well prouided, the least of the Galli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons was of the burthen of 400 tunne.</p>
               <p>The Chinois told them, that the Portugals meant to besiege Bantam by land and sea, that none might trade thither but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
               <p>These ships of Holland were called, the one, Guelderland, of two hundred and fiftie tunne, the other Zeland, of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred tunne, the third Vtrecht, of one hundred and thirtie tun, the two Brigantines, the one called the Pigeon, was twentie eight tunne, and the other la Gard, threescore and ten: these ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells came from the Tussell and had set saile on the 23 of Aprill 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>01 in companie of seuen other ships, making vp the number of twelue vessels, both ships and Brigantines. Being at sea they were dispersed, so as but fiue of them arriued at the streight of Sunda, where the Chinois brought them that newes, who thought hee had done them a great curtesie, in aduising them to shun the incounter of so mightie a fleet.</p>
               <p>But God strengthned them, so as they resolued otherwise: for the Admirall of the fleet, whose name was <hi>Wolfart Harmans,</hi> so soone as the Chinois had told him these newes, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to cast ankor, and calling the captaines aboard his ship, after praier, they consulted together what was best to bee done for the present good of the fleet, and for the future trade to the East Indies, and what was most expedient for the honor of the Netherlands: whereupon they mutually resolued, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the importance of the businesse, whereon the preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or ruine of Bantam depended,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Hollanders resolue to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile the fleet and to relieue Bantam.</hi>
                  </note> valiantly to assaile the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugals fleet, and by Gods assistance to driue them thence, and thereby to free the Citie of Bantam. Thereupon, the deckes were cleered, and all impediments remoued, to the end, the ordnance might bee well managed, and euerie man haue roome enough to vse his armes against the assault.</p>
               <p>This done, as soone as time and place would permit, the next morning two howers before day, after a signe giuen, they al weighed ankor.</p>
               <p>The 25 of December about sunne rising, they descried the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:14840:152"/>
Portugal fleet, which had placed two gallions in Gard directly beneth the West point of the Isla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Pulo Penzano, &amp; little dreamt of our men, who came on their backs before they could hoisse sale or be rescewed by the rest; so as they would haue been enforced to yeeld, had not a certaine mishap befalne our Admerall, who shooting off one of his pieces, it brake, which fel out well for the enemie. The two gallions fearing to be assailed againe, went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with their Foists.</p>
               <p>Our Vice-Admerall <hi>Hans Brower,</hi> ignorant hereof, plaid with his ordnance so furiously on the ship of Malacca, as we might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceiue a certaine amazement in the Portugal fleet, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired, and came to an ankor beneath the Island Pulo Penzano. Our men hauing notice of the mishap which befell the Admeral, did likewise cast ankor vnder certaine high Islands, where they repaired the hurt done by their canon.</p>
               <p>The 26 of the same moneth was verie foule, so as neither side could vse their sailes or ordnance, God thereby fighting for vs, giuing our Admerall sufficient leasure to repaire his losse.</p>
               <p>The 27 day, they set saile, and made towards the Portugal fleet, shooting fiercely one at another. On the East side of Bantam, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the farthest Island, lay two great gallies, who seeing the Hollanders, betooke themselues to flight, thinking to escape, but two of our ships, the one called Vtrecht, and the other la Garde, assailed them. Diuers Portugals got vp into the Vtrecht, thinking to saue themselues, but our men being in feare of their multitude, called the Brigantine, to their aid, at whose arriuall, most of them leapt into the sea.</p>
               <p>The Captaine of the one gallie, was called <hi>Francesco de Sousa,</hi> sonne to <hi>Iohn de Teues,</hi> Contador Major of Lisbone: In this gallie were 23 Portugals, and 60 Indians, among whom the said captain, with certaine Portugals, were saued, the rest were for the most part slaine.</p>
               <p>In the other gallie, which our Brigantine la Garde assailed and tooke, was an old Captaine, who had faithfully serued the king of Spaine, in those parts, for the space of 32 yeares, his name was <hi>Andrea Rodrigues Palhota</hi>: he, refusing to yeeld, was strucken throgh the bodie with a pike. They tooke foure brasse pieces out of the said gallie, &amp; afterwards burnt them both, notwithstanding that they were laden with Rice and other victuals.</p>

               <p>There was moreouer, one Gallion and eighteen foists, which departed likewise from Malacca, came to Seylao, and went on no farther (one of them excepted) which our men tooke, whose Captaine was <hi>Francisco de Zuza Toues.</hi> From Nimar and Seylao came two foists, and as many gallies, whose Captaines were, <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drea Rodrigues Palhota,</hi> slaine by our men, <hi>Andrea Guiedes de Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, Diego de Melo,</hi> and <hi>Manuel Dias.</hi> From Malacca came two gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions, commanded by these Captains, <hi>Gonçalo Vus de Castel-Bianco,</hi> &amp; <hi>Andrea Pessoa.</hi> And beside these, two other vessels, called Ionc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques, commanded by Captaine <hi>Francesco de Maris,</hi> and seuen Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantines with oares.</p>
               <p>It was likewise reported that there were aboue eight hundred Portugals in the fleet, beside the sailers which were all Indians: That foure other ships<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and one Brigantine, lay at Achea, and that the fleet expected none other supplies, but onely those which in Aprill were to come from Goa.</p>
               <p>The eight and twentieth day, the wind blew hard, so as they could beare no saile, each side being enforced to lye still. The nine and twentieth and thirtieth daies, they remained quiet on the West of Iaua, a little beyond the point of Bantam: The Portugal fleet, had gotten the wind of the Hollanders, but durst not come vp to assaile them, which our men would haue done, if the time and wind would haue permitted them: yet because they would not be idle, they did set fire on 2 of their gallies, meaning there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to inforce the Hollanders to retire, but they were burnt ere they could come neere them: they did likewise sinke two of their Foists neere to the shoare.</p>
               <p>The one and thirtieth day, the Hollanders weighed ankor, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

forward with an intent to charge their enemies, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing they had a faire wind, who perceiuing their meaning, hoisted saile, and the wind beginning to slacken, the Hollanders strooke saile and tarried for them, &amp; because the Portugals should not thinke that they meant to runne away, they let fall their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kors, which they seeing, did the like, not daring to assaile them.</p>
               <p>The first of Ianuarie 1602, in the Morning, the Admerall of Holland, <hi>Wolfart Harmanz,</hi> weighed ankor, clapt on all his sailes, and directed his course towards the Portugall fleet, who with full sailes came likewise towards them, so as at first, euerie man imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned they would haue fought; but when they came nere one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Portugals turned backe, being afraid of our ordnance: Their Admerall in vain displaied the banner for the fight, his men hauing no deuotion to it.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, on the third day, the Hollanders returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Bantam, where they were most kindly entertained. Their losse was small, &amp; they were greatly honoured ouer all the whole Countrie.

               <p>And, notwithstanding there was freight enough at Bantam, yet they were desirous to pursue their voyage to the Molucques, where, on the 17 of Febr. the Admeral arriued at Terrenata, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our men that had bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Not long after, our other ships arriued likewise at Bantam, and there tooke in their burthen, all of them retiring into the Low-Countries richly loden.</p>

               <head>¶ A description of the horrible, bloudie, and vnheard of siege, of the towne of Ostend besieged by the Archduke Albert of Austria, in the yeares <hi>1601, 1602, 1603,</hi> and <hi>1604.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SOme will peraduenture thinke it strange, that among the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories of the vnited Netherland Prouinces, wee set downe the famous siege of Ostend, seeing it was not Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> but the Archduke of Austria that besieged and tooke it, with great losse of humane bloud, incredible expence, and to the smal profit and aduantage of his countries. Yet, if any man will well consider this siege, and the sequence of the Historie, reading it to the end, hee will find and confesse, that this siege hath giuen to the state of these countries, not one, but many victories, both in that this towne was so well defended, and thereby much hurt done to the enemie, forces, as also because during this siege, they haue wonne from the Archduke, the townes of Rhynberck, Graue, and Sluce, each of which is as much worth, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious for these countries, as Ostend euer was or could haue beene. On the other side, seeing this siege was so notable, as wee neuer read of the like, and that the honour of our gallant Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and souldiers in defending it together with their braue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits do manifestly therein appeare, we should do them wrong, to paste them ouer in silence.</p>
               <p>Before we come to the description thereof, we will first briefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly speake of the situation of the towne, and the duke of Parmas sundrie attemps vpon it, and lastly what moued the Archduke to besiege it, for it would be ouer tedious, to set downe euerie daies actions there: we will only touch the principall occurrences, and whosoeuer is desirous to know more, wee refer him to a Iournall
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:14840:154"/>
that hath beene Printed thereof.</p>
               <p>Ostend, not long since, was a small contemptible towne, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified at first against the enemies incursions with woodden gates and Pallisadoes: sixe yeares after, <hi>videlicet,</hi> in an. 1572, the States of the vnited Prouinces hauing wel considered the scituation and commodiousnesse thereof, caused it to be so strongly fortified, as the duke of Parma, by reason of alteration in the gouernement, hauing woon the townes of Dunkerke and Niewport, comming before Ostend, could not take it; for considering with himselfe that he should lose much and winne little by tarrying there, after some 5 dayes lying before it, he departed thence in anno 1583.</p>
               <p>Since that time, Ostend continuing vnder the States gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they haue omitted nothing necessarie for the fortifying and assurance thereof, and in anno 1600, it was so well fenced, not onely within by renewing and heighthening the bulwarkes and rampiers, but likewise without, by new dikes and counterscarpes, as we may rightly number it among the most impregnable places of Europe; for the rampiers within were verie high, and diuided by a deepe ditch from the counterscarpes without, which tooke all hope from the enemie of being able to force or hold them.</p>
               <p>Beside, it seemeth that Nature, by this Towne, was willing to shew the world some raritie, for within these few yeares, the Sea hath made it more impregnable than before, by a new rupture on the East-side of the towne, which they terme the gullet: it is in breadth aboue one hundred foot, and within the land, the depth of two pikes, euen at low water, and in the Sea where it takes it originall it is not halfe fathom deepe. It cannot be denied but it hath euer had a Hauen, but the old is not comparable to the new, for the old Hauen euerie six houres at an ebbe, leaues to that which encloseth the Towne, a free accesse, and meanes to fill it vp; so as no boats can that way enter without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>The generall States, for the better defence of the towne, hauing caused the sand hils on the East-side, which are neere the Gullet, &amp; whose height command it, to be leuelled, the sea at euery Tide doth so fill the leuelled place, as the seemeth vnto mans judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that no meanes can be found to take that Hauen from the towne, for commonly at euerie Tide the Sea riseth so high, as it extendes it selfe 1200 paces beyond the Towne, and at
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:14840:155"/>
full sea, a league into the countrie, so as the whole land round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, is filled with water, together with many dikes and ruptures, so that without great daunger a man can hardly passe. In a word, whatsoeuer might serue for the strengthning and assurance of a towne, hath not beene omitted or spared for any cost whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: for Ostend stands so, as it can keepe a great part of Flaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, euerie way, vnder contribution, whereupon the Flemings haue still gone about to make it theirs: and since that the Prince of Parma was enforced to giue ouer his seige before it, they haue by all meanes sought to surprise it on the sodaine, or otherwise: and among others, <hi>La Motte</hi> gouernour of Flaunders in anno 1585, hauing along the sea shore surprised the old towne, which was onely fortified with a Raueling and Pallisadoes, attempted to fortifie and intrench himsefe there, but hee was driuen thence with great losse of men, among whom, fortie of his Captaines were slaine.</p>
               <p>Againe in anno 1596, after Archduke <hi>Albert</hi> had taken Calais, the States of Flaunders did earnestly solicite him to imploy his forces in besieging Ostend, and to that end, promised to giue him beside the ordinarie allowance of three moneths, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand florins: to which motion his Highnesse in part see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to encline, taking certaine summes of mony before hand, yet hee onely shewed himselfe before the towne, and hauing viewed it, presently went thence. This attempt beeing vaine, and perceiuing that stratagems, and sodaine surprisals, made the souldiers of Ostend more vigilant, they watched a time, till the Archdukes armie enuaded the fontiers of Holland, amusing the States of the vnited Prouinces, thereby to diuert their forces from Flaunders and Brabant, and then they built seuenteene or eighteene forts about the towne, therein following the direction of a reuolted corporall, who had a long time serued in Ostend, &amp; knew what would most annoy them: this they did to stop the incursions of those of Ostend, and to cut off the contributions which they raised in the countrie.</p>
               <p>But time and experience taught them, that the intertainment of the Garrisons which they were to keepe in the said forts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to more than the contribution which the townesmen raised vpon the countrie, and besides, that the roades of them which lay in Gartison in the forts were more hurtfull than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:14840:155"/>
so as at last they were so earnest with the Archduke, shewing him the necessitie of the matter, and how hee ought to lay hold on that occasion, (his Excellencie lying then before Berck) with diuers other reasons which they alledged, as his highnesse was moued to enterprise and beginne this siege: and to this end, on the fift of Iuly 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>01, hee sent Count <hi>Frederick Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Bergh</hi> thither as marshall of the Camp, with foure regiments of souldiers, who encamped on the downes Eastward from the towne, and the next day plaied with foure canon vpon it, to giue them notice of his arriuall: and the same day, after noone, <hi>D. Augustino de Mexia</hi> gouernour of the castle of Antuerpe came thither with 5 regiments making vp the number of 8000 men, and foure Cornets of horse, who encamped on the West side of the town, that hee might lie betwixt the forts of Isabella and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert: but those of the towne shot so at him, as with losse he was enforced to retire to the downes, from whence by little and little hee made his approches with entrenchments, and so planted his canon.</p>
               <p>In the towne were one and twentie camps of souldiers of sundry regiments, and one companie of Burgers, it was well stored with ordnance, munition, victuals, and all necessaries: the Lord <hi>Charles Vander Noot</hi> was gouernor there.</p>
               <p>The Generall States of the vnited Prouinces hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the siege of Ostend, sent <hi>Colonell Huchtenbrock</hi> thither with ten companies, and entreated generall <hi>Vere</hi> to go thither with three thousand men which were expected from England, but hee made some difficultie therein, beeing laoth to goe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his owne regiment, and that of his brother: whereupon on the eight of Iulie, eight companies were sent vnto him, and on the fourteenth of the same, twelue other companies which had been at the campe before Berck, making vp in all one and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie companies,<note place="margin">

Two daies before Generall <hi>Veer</hi> his arriuall, the besieged had made a furious sallie vpon the enemies in their trenches, killing many of them, to the number of fiue or sixe hundred, who were not well intrenched; D. <hi>Augustino de Mexia</hi> was hurt there, and D. <hi>Hieronimo de Monroy</hi> the Campe-Master, was slaine in his Tent; the besieged lost some 30 men: At the same time, or thereabout, D. <hi>Diego d'Idiaques,</hi> and D. <hi>Iuan Bracamonte,</hi> Nephew to Count <hi>Fuentes,</hi> D. <hi>Pedro de Lojas,</hi> sonne to the Marquesse <hi>de Lojas,</hi> who brought newes of the Kings daughters birth, with diuers others, were likewise slaine. Sir <hi>Frauncis Veer,</hi> being in the towne as chiefe commaunder, gaue direction for all matters, diuiding the Dutch companies into two regiments, vnder the conduct of the gouernour <hi>Vander-Noot,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Huchtenbroecke,</hi> who commaunded in the old towne.</p>
               <p>The seuenteenth and twentieth of Iulie, Generall <hi>Veer</hi> hauing store of men, seazed on a piece of land that lay Southward, which he fortified and entrenched, placing strong gards in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarpes and forts neere adjoyning.</p>
               <p>The two and twentieth of Iulie, the enemies canon did so commaund the Hauen as no boats durst enter; but, the fiue and twentieth of Iulie, the gouernour, and the Ingeneer Master <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> of Orleans, with other old and experimented mariners, found that the gullet would serue to bring in boats, by opening a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey or rampier of the counterscarpe, &amp; that the sayd boats might lye safe in the towne dikes: But the Archduke caused boats to be laden with stones at Niewport and elsewhere, which he sanke within and neere the gullet to choake it vp; but all the labor was to no purpose.</p>
               <p>Those of Ostend made many curtains to secure their men from the canon, they likewise filled the fortifications which were made in the Sea, with stakes and crosse beames, full of stones, the better to diuert the Sea waues from the Towne. By this meanes the workes and counterscarpes abroad were fortified, like the rampiers of other strong townes, being garded with rauelins, halfe Moons and forts, so as the enemie could not bring his ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance neere the towne to make a batterie or come to the assault; they did moreouer secure the going out and in of the boats; so as the vnited Prouinces were encouraged to defend the towne, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  </note> and especially the Sand hill. This Sand hill was a Bulwarke of double works one vpon an other, hauing round about it sundrie rankes of Pallisadoes from the bottome to the verrie toppe, all made of fagotts laide one vpon an other, with other Bulwarks neere adioyning, for it was made to defend the West side, which was the weakest part of the towne, together with the hauen on that side. This Sand hill was so battered with the canon, as it seemed like an yron hill, for they shot bullet vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bullet, which strake vpon one an other, and sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded backe againe.</p>
               <p>Neere to the Sand hill was a causey opposite to the sea, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it selfe as farre as the downes where the enemy lay. This causey was defended by a halfe moone, and by pallizadoes, and the Porcuspine by a verie strong fort, which the Archduke caused to bee vndermined, the better thereby to approach the towne: In that regard, the besieged on the fifteenth of Iuly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the said causey, behinde their halfe moone, and armed the point of it with planks and fagots against the force of the Sea waues: and yet they feared that the same opening would haue done more hurt to the Bulwarkes and other workes than it did: this onely enforced the enemy, by reason of the water, to quit sundrie forts. By this meanes the towne became like vnto an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland, wholy enuironed with the Ocean Sea, beeing diuided the breadth of one hundred foot from the firme land, and from the enemy, who was in great hope that the Sea (the causey being perced) would doe more hurt to the towne in winter.</p>
               <p>The vnited Prouinces on the contrarie were assured that God by that meanes would preserue and keepe the towne, so as they for their parts vsed all diligence to secure it, and at Generall <hi>Veres</hi> entreatie, sent three and twentie foot ensignes more thither after the taking of Rhynberck vnder conduct of Earle <hi>Chastillon,</hi> notwithstanding that there were alreadie nine and fiftie ensignes in the towne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Many men and much prouision are sent to Ost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end.</hi>
                  </note> beside those who were daily sent from England, whose number amounted to 2000 men.</p>
               <p>The enemy shot continually into the towne, more than euer
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:14840:157"/>
into any that was besieged, so as many men were dayly slaine. The vnited Prouinces in September, sent thither in lesse than fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene daies (vnder conduct of the Lord of Warmont Admerall of Holland, who with his men of warre garded the Seas,) one hundred threescore and ten boats laden with all sorts of victuals, wine, beere, bread, turfe, and fire wood for winter (not recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fiue hundred and fiftie barrells of powder which were there before the siege:) the said one hundred threescore and ten boats did likewise bring three hundred seuentie three thousand pound weight of fine and course biscuit, seuentie seuen thousand weight of match, ninetie eight thousand poundes of musket and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quebuse shot, with fifteene thousand yron bullets, and all maner of prouision necessarie for defence of the towne, so as victuals were so plentifull and cheape there, as a pot of wine was solde for a groat, and the best for six pence, and a tunne of Delfts beere for fiue florins.</p>
               <p>By this meanes the siege of Ostend grew so famous, as people came from all parts to behold the besiegers and besieged.</p>
               <p>The Inhabitants of Zealand, did for curiositie sake goe bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thither with their wiues and children. All manner of victuals were better cheape there than in Holland or Zealand, in regard they paid no imposition.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Holst brother to the King of Denmarke, with Count <hi>Iohn</hi> of Nassau, Count <hi>Hohenlo,</hi> and the Earle of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland came from England thither, to view the manner of the fortifications, Count Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Gouernour of Picardie, was likewise onward on his way thither, but by a contrarie wind was caried into Zealand: yea <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth the great French king came in August to Calais to vnderstand the particularities of that siege, from whence hee sent one of his Lords to visite the Archduke, who likewise sent Count <hi>Solre</hi> to the king.</p>

of <hi>Huchtenbroeck,</hi> Captaine <hi>Brog</hi> and others. Within a while after, namely on the last of September, the said Colonell <hi>Huchtenbroeck</hi> was likewise slaine, and was much lamented, as also a French Captaine named <hi>Pomarend</hi>: It would bee an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibilitie to set downe the names of all the Captaines which dyed both within and without the towne together with the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie accidents which daily happened there, with so small ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and amazement as is almost incredible, custome wholy banishing feare. Among others, a souldier bought a loafe of bread, which hee held vp in his hand shewing it to one of his fellowes, and in the meane time a bullet tooke away the one halfe of it, whereupon, the souldier merrily sayd that there was some good fellowship in him that made that shot, because hee left him some bread and tooke not all away.</p>
               <p>An English gentleman of the age of twentie yeares had in a sallie his right arme shot off with a Canon bullet; hee tooke it vp and carried it along with him to the Surgeons, who drest him, which done, hee tooke his arme with him to his lodging, where without beeing sicke or distempered, he held it in his left hand, saying, this is the arme which to day at dinner serued the whole bodie.</p>
               <p>An other souldier hauing his arme shot off, and beeing verie weake was led away by two of his fellowes, as hee went along an other bullet tooke away one of his legs, of which hurt he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently dyed, those two which led him being in no sort hurt.</p>
               <p>A Grocer standing in his shop was slaine with a great shot, and beeing laid in a coffing, the bodie was caried away with a Canon bullet.</p>
               <p>A yong man beeing on horse backe, his horse was slaine vnder him with a bullet which entred at his hinder parts, and came forth at his brest, and yet himselfe had no harme, onely his breeches were torne a sunder betwixt his legs with the wind of the bullet.</p>
               <p>A Sea Captaine beeing in conference with one, who layd his arme vpon the Captaines shoulder, it was taken away by a great shot, the Captain hauing no hurt but only astonied with the wind of the canon.</p>
               <p>It fell out likewise oftentimes that the enemie discharging his ordnance, the bullet flew into the mouth of our canon which was
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:14840:158"/>
charged, and setting it on fire, two bullets were sent backe in steed of one.</p>
               <p>Diuers other strange accidents happened there among so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie millions of shot: for the first ten weeks both from the town and enemies campe more than threescore thousand Canon shot were spent, beside fire-works to burn downe the town building, which tooke no great effect in regard the houses were low. Now this is not strange, for the meaning of the Spaniards was to win the towne with their ordnance, and to make it a heape of stones and ashes, but the besieged shot as much as the enemies, dismounting their canon, and tearing downe their forts. For there was neuer any place among Turks, Heathen, or Christians, where so manie shot haue beene bestowed on either side: the canons beeing so worne, and the holes made so wide, as the like hath not bin seene.</p>
               <p>The foureteenth of August, Generall <hi>Vere</hi> beeing on the Sand hill, was hurt in the head with a wodden splinter, and because his wound was daungerous, the surgeons told him that he must withdrawe himselfe to some quiet place free from the noice of ordnance, whereupon, hee went from Ostend, and remained for a time in Zealand.</p>
               <p>The besieged made braue sallies, wherein the enemies were still put to the worst: the foure and twentieth of August, our men made two sallies, the first by the English alone, the second by Dutch and English, of whom some nine or ten were slaine, and thirtie hurt, but of the enemies many moe were slaine who still repulsed our men, and when their foot men were too weake, they made vse of their horsemen, among whom, the ordnance made great slaughter, so as this siege was verie bloudie and long, as it shall appeare by the sequell of the Historie.</p>
               <p>The enemies were often at variance among themselues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many of their attemps had no good successe.</p>
               <p>They were intrenched in the West downes in seuen or eight trenches, the one higher than the other according to the nature of the ground, their trenches beeing conioyned with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and sand: further off from these, they had made an other trench, with platformes for their ordnance, which extended as far as their fort in the ruined churchyard, betwixt the forts of Grooten-dorst aud Isabella, standing on the riuer Yperlee, where
<pb facs="tcp:14840:158"/>
likewise Saint <hi>Clares</hi> fort stood, and part of the camp of the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern quarter, from whence they had made a way with fagots as farre as the Eastern campe.</p>
               <p>Count <hi>Frederick Vandenbergh</hi> had made a trench to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, opposite to the Englishmens trenches on the Polder, well fortified with ordnance and batteries.</p>
               <p>D. <hi>Augustino de Mexia</hi> with some eight thousand men comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that quarter: on the East side of the town neere to the bridge, was another campe likewise, wherein lay two thousand men, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Count <hi>Frederick</hi>: Beside, they had a companie of reuolted English, commaunded by Captaine <hi>Floud,</hi> and foure cornets of horse: Three thousand men did euerie night gard the camp: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Catrice</hi> had chiefe commaund of the trenches with one <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Antonio: Matheo Serrano</hi> was lieutenant generall of the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>D. Lewis d' Auila, Balthazar Lopes, &amp; D. Iuan Panrache</hi> were Sergeant Majors of the Army. The Regiments of the Earles <hi>Solre, Bucquoy, Frisin, Achicourt,</hi> and others where there, who agreed but badly with the Spaniards whose intollerable pride they could not endure.</p>
               <p>The mutinie in certaine forts was not wholy quieted, but the mutiners were sent to Saint Winocks Bergue till they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their full pay, which came too late, so as they reduced the whole countrie vnder contribution.</p>
               <p>Archduke <hi>Albert</hi> was in person in the Armie, and lay in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts</hi> fort, where the Campe was fortified and prouided for winter, as if it had been a towne, and it was called West end. The <hi>Infanta Isabella</hi> lay at Niewport, and on the second of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust shee came with eighteene Coaches to the campe, beeing seene by those of the towne. It is reported that whilest the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance plaied fircely on both sides, herselfe gaue fire to certaine canons, which was reputed for a singular honor.</p>
               <p>They fastened wodden platformes to the shoare on the East side, which they fenced with Gabions tied with Cables from thence to play vpon the boats which entred the old Hauen: They attempted likewise to stop the sluce of the Causey, with wood &amp; sacks filled with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and, but those filled sacks sank down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, &amp; were caried away with the tide, so as all that labor was vain.</p>
               <p>After that, by the aduice of Captain <hi>Catrice</hi> who had bin lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant to <hi>la Bourlotte,</hi> and had now his place, they resolued
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:14840:159"/>
to giue a generall assault to euerie corner of the towne, contrarie to the opinion of the whole Councell of war, thinking at a low water to win the West Rampier of the old Towne, and there to fortifie themselues: but the besieged had prouided for it, and the assault being begun, Captaine <hi>Catrice</hi> was shot in the head, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was deferred, and yet his wound was not mortall, for he was healed for that time.</p>
               <p>From August to September, the Archdukes Camp spared for no trauel nor expence to win the towne, which they continually battered day and night, ouerthrowing certaine fortifications, killing diuers, and laming others: They likewise came at sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times into the trenches, halfe moones, and other workes, from whence by the courage and magnanimitie of our souldiers, they were beaten with great losse of men. They went about by all meanes to choake the Gullet, therein vsing all the cunning that man could inuent to keepe victuals from the town, but they could not doe it, nor yet by all their attemps cause the besieged to yeeld. For Generall <hi>Vere</hi> and all the Captaines were resolued to defend it by all meanes possible, and by their sallies did much annoy the enemie both in his Campe and forts.</p>
               <p>At the same time, certaine men went about to betraie and deliuer vp the towne to the enemie, but they were bewrayed and executed.</p>
               <p>After Haruest, the souldiers on both sides were so badly clad, as they were much tormented with cold, especially the besieged, who kept gard without the town in the counterscarps and forts, where the waies were verie dirtie, which caused diuers English men to runne away, others grew sicke and died, the Garrison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so weakned, as of seuen or eight thousand, there were in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember but two or three thousand left; whereupon, Generall <hi>Vere</hi> wrot to the States for more men.</p>
               <p>The Archduke lying in <hi>Alberts</hi> fort, and the nights waxing long, was desirous to make some attempt, sending foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his souldiers on the one and twentieth of December a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight at a lowe water ouer the Hauen on the West side, along the shoare, who passing by the Sand hill gaue an alarme to the East side, and from thence, at a place called Schottenbergh, mounted the rampiers, killing a sentinell of <hi>Gystels</hi> companie, and by helpe of a great winde, fired a curtein or great heape of
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:14840:159"/>
fagotts which were layed to breake off the Sea waues and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the Bulwarks foot made on the North side at the end of the falce-bray or out-wal beneath the Sand hils point, where the foot of it, made with fagots, burnt three daies and three nights and could not be quenched, by reason the enemie shot so fiercely.</p>
               <p>The same night, an Italian souldier that had lost his way, was taken betwixt the rampiers and pallisadoes. This Italian beeing secretly examined by Generall <hi>Vere,</hi> told him, that the Archduke hauing intelligence of the Garrisons weaknesse, and how the towne had not of a long time beene supplied with men and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, had speedily sent for all the Garrisons of Brabant, Arto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, and other places, and with these, was come before the towne, with a firme resolution to assault it in sundrie places, namely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South and West Quadrant, and the halfe moones, and that Count <hi>Bucquoy</hi> should assault the Northwest rauelin of the old towne at a low water, which hee might easily doe in the night.</p>
               <p>Certaine other Captaines should assaile the Sand hill, and two places of the old towne, namely the Porcuspine, which was a smal rauelin in the counterscarpe, which garded a certaine place called the Biere: they retained the water of the dikes, which is a matter of great importance.</p>
               <p>The other assaults should bee giuen to the works without the towne to the South-South-East ward, called the South Quadrant, the Polder, and East Quadrant, to which some three weekes past, the enemies had giuen a fierce assault, from whence they were driuen with great losse.</p>
               <p>Generall <hi>Vere,</hi> knowing this in particular, did on the three and twentieth of December at two of the clocke in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, send foure Captaines to view the Porcuspine, and to bring him word whither it might bee defended against the enemies as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults: and as the said Captaines were visiting this place, Captaine <hi>Lewis Couture</hi> came thither about three a clocke with commission from the Generall to craue a parley of the enemie, and to send ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stage from either side: This was done vnknown to the Captains, but Captaine <hi>Couture,</hi> found the Archduke verie willing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p>The Generall to excuse this parley, alleadged sundrie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, viz. that he feared the assault, because he was weake in men,
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:14840:160"/>
and they of sundrie nations, that hee was loath to come to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall assault, and therefore thought good to beguile and amuse the enemie and winne time, till cernaine fortifications in the old towne were finished.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, hostages were presently sent from the towne, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the enemies word, namely Captaine <hi>Ogle</hi> lieutenant Colonell, and Captaine <hi>Farfax</hi> to procure that some others might bee like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sent from the Archduke to treat: And the same Euening, the Generall sent the Sergeant Major <hi>Carpenter,</hi> commaunding him to let in on the East side of the towne, the gouernour of the Sluce <hi>Matho Serrano,</hi> master of the ordnance and Councellor to the Archduke, together with Captaine <hi>Ottaigno,</hi> Sergeant Major of a regiment, both of them discreet and well experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced persons, with promise, that in the meane time there should bee a cessation of armes by land on both sides, and not otherwise. These two Commissioners from the Spaniards were brought by the falce-braye ouer the Sand hill, and so caried towards the new towne: But a great tumult rising on a sodaine among the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and souldiers, especially because this was done vnknowne to them: they were by the Generals commaundement sent backe againe the same way without audience: and in the meane time, the tide was risen so high, as they could not passe on the East side, but went through the towne towards the West part, where they passed ouer in a boat to Count <hi>Bucquoys</hi> quarter with some excuse, promising to send back our hostages, who returned not to the towne the same night. Generall <hi>Vere,</hi> the next day at one of the clocke after midnight, in regard of the tumult among the Captaines and souldiers, sent for all the Captaines, French, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, and Dutch, and after long debating on the Garrisons weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and great want of men to defend the old and newe towns with all the counter scarps, rauelins, South and East Quadrants, together with the halfe moone beyond the Gullet standing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Southwest, hee craued their aduice, by what meanes all these places might bee defended from the enemies assaults, demaunding whither the Captaines thought it not fit, to race and abandon those workes, which were alreadie forsaken vnknown to the Captaines, together with the falce-bray, or lesser Sand hill, where they had alreadie planted one canon and a demy, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried fiue barrels of powder thither the same day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:14840:160"/>All of them thought it fit to race the South Quadrant which was least hurtfull to the towne, and to send the men to more needfull places; and yet this was not effected, because fiue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies came from Zealand on the fiue and twentieth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>The falce-bray which should haue beene abandoned, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse by consent of certaine Captaines, and in presence of Captaine <hi>Saint Clare</hi> the Scot vnknowne to the Generall mand with sixe musket<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ers of <hi>Saint Clares</hi> companie, two other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies beeing appointed to second them, if the enemie should giue an assault.</p>
               <p>The next day at nine of the clocke in the morning the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sent againe for the French, Scottish, and Dutch Captaines to his lodging, where in presence of Colonell <hi>Loone</hi> hee made his Apologie in French, declaring to what intent, hee entred into communication with the enemie: the Reader may see the excuses hee alledged, in a letter hereafter ensuing which hee wrot to the States. The same day, and in the same assemblie, it was concluded to demaund hostages and commissioners from the enemie for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance of those which had beene sent from the towne, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, two Captaines, <hi>Iohn le Rijck,</hi> and <hi>Charls Cassart</hi> with Captaine <hi>Saint Clare</hi> the Scot, were sent to receiue the two aboue mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned hostages and Commissioners, viz. <hi>Serrano,</hi> Gouernor of the Sluce, and captaine <hi>Ottaigno</hi> the Sergeant Major, who craued to hasten the businesse, being sent into Ostend for none other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. They were answered, that in regard it was verie late, and diuers Captaines alreadie vpon the gard, they must haue patience till the next day.</p>
               <p>The same night the fiue aboue mentioned companies from Zeland arriued, and because it was Christmas day, the Archduke sent a Spanish Captaine with a trumpet and a letter to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners, wherein hee willed them to hasten the matter by all possible meanes. Captaine <hi>Rijcks</hi> fetcht the letter and gaue it to <hi>Serrano,</hi> who thereupon was verie earnest for dispatch: hee was entreated to stay till eleuen of the clocke, and then hee should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue all content: this answere he presently sent to the Archduke. In the meane time the fiue companies which came from Zelland entred the towne, viz. that of Captaine <hi>Iohn Pottey,</hi> the companie of the Lord <hi>Iustine</hi> of Nassau, those of the Lord <hi>Vandernoot,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:14840:161"/>
                  <hi>Iohn Piron</hi> the younger, and Captaine <hi>la Corde.</hi> These fiue companies beeing come into the towne, Generall <hi>Vere</hi> about noone, gaue this aunswere to <hi>Serrano</hi> and <hi>Ottaigno:</hi> how he could not denie, but that being ouertaken by want of wind, faire wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and other accidents, hee had beene enforced to inuent meanes to helpe himselfe and men, and through want enforced to come to some agreement. But perceiuing that the States of the vnited Prouinces, had so well reliued and furnished him with all necessarie prouisions, hee could not as then proceed any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this treatie with his Highnesse, and therefore had no more to say, vnlesse some new necessitie should vnluckily surprize him, and enforce him againe to craue parley, hoping that his Highnesse as a vertuous Prince, would not take this deniall to proceed any farther in the treat, in bad part, for beeing a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, hee could doe no otherwise for maintenance of his owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and that this sleight was commonly vsed among souldiers: Thereupon, the Spanish commissiioners went their way.</p>
               <p>The Archduke was much displeased with this warlike policie, and grew exceeding angrie with some of his owne seruants, who had counselled him thereunto. By this sleight, a rumor was bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted abroad, how that Ostend capitulated, and it was so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beliued, as in the Courts of France, England, that of the States of Holland and Zealand, nothing was knowne to the contrarie, till such times as they receiued letters from Generall <hi>Vere.</hi> The Burgers of Gant, Bruges, Dunkerke, and Newport came with their wiues and children to the campe, thinking that the towne would yeeld, but they were all deceiued. This did so incense the enemies, as they resolued more by passion than rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to giue a generall assault.</p>
               <p>The States of the vnited Prouinces were amased at this treatie, and neuer thought that the English souldiers would haue so slipt away through the carelesenesse of their Captaines who gaue them passeport, so as fortie, fiftie, sixtie, and more at a time returned into England, who were lustie and in health; whereupon men, and other necessarie prouisions were sent thither, which did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the besieged.</p>
               <p>The Archduke tired with lying so long before Ostend, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in his vaine hope, was persuaded by his Councell to giue a generall assault, ere greater forces entred the towne: and to this
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:14840:161"/>
end, hee did satisfie and pay manie of his mutiners and vnwilling souldiers, making great preparation for an assault hoping to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise the Sand hill, there to entrench himselfe and become ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the old towne, appointing the seuenth of Ianuarie 1602 in the afternoone at a low water the time for execution.</p>
               <p>Colonell <hi>Gambiotta</hi> the Campe master was to assault the new towne, and Count <hi>Ferneste</hi> with Captaine <hi>Ottaigno,</hi> the Sand hill and falce-bray: The gouernour of Dixmuide, the Porcuspine, an other, the West and South Quadrants, and the North Raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin: and Count <hi>Bucquoy</hi> with two thousand men was to assault on euerie side, Count <hi>Triuulcio, Alonzo d'Avalos,</hi> and other troops were readie to helpe and second those that should stand in need, the cauallier likewise hauing an eye euerie where.</p>
               <p>The Archdukes felfe stood behinde the batterie of the key, and the Infanta was in Isabellas fort.</p>
               <p>This thus appointed, a certaine Italian whose lot was to bee one of the first that should giue the assault, fearing the daunger, swam ouer the hauen by night with his sword in his mouth, and declared to generall <hi>Vere</hi> the enemies resolution concerning the assault, whereunto he gaue the more credit, because the precedent day and night their ordnance had without intermission plaid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the towne: so as he gaue order for defence, fortifying all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, transporting the ordnance, and planting seuen great morters at the entrance of the hauen, charged with stones and musket shot, commaunding his men carefully to doe their duties, and not bee too hastie in shooting, but to do it opportunely.</p>

               <head>¶ A Description of the fierce and bloudie assault made vpon the old towne of Ostend and other forts on the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth of Ianuarie <hi>1602.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFter that the Archduke on the seuenth of Ianuarie, had with his ordnance all the day long, plaied vpon the Sand hill, and places neere to Helmont, the Porcuspine, and others, from his two batteries, namely, that beneath the downes vpon the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uallier,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:14840:162"/>
and the other to the Southward with eighteene great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, carying bullets of fortie and fiftie pound weight, beside his battery on the East side: about 6 of the clock in the euening when it was low water, hee enforced his foot men to giue a furious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, causing his cauallery to push them forward.</p>
               <p>First with great noyce they assailed the old towne whereinto they came, along by the Western hauen, beginning at the Sand hill, and so going on with many light ladders and bridges for assault, which they carried with them to skale the towne; for the pallizadoes which were wont to bee there, were all burnt.</p>
               <p>This assault was so fierce, and made by so many troops in sundrie places at once, as it seemed they would haue taken the towne, and made passage through a wall of steele: But Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Vere</hi> who had an eye to euerie place, together with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Horatio,</hi> who was neere him with a gallant troope of choice souldiers to second and relieue where need should bee, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ouer the mines to the falce-bray, where with great cries he assailed the Archdukes troopes, whom hee thrice repulsed, for as often as they came on with fresh men, so often did hee beat them off, their shot and pikes doing them small good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the English, who at euery time made hauock among them with their short swords.</p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but that the Archdukes souldiers did verie valiantly behaue themselues, assailing their enemies on euerie side without feare, but their comming beeing knowne and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they receiued such entertainment, as they had soone their bellies full; for they in the towne had their cates readie, which so soone as the enemies tasted, many of them could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer digest: all places were so well fortified, as their condition here would haue resembled that of their fellowes in the halfe moon on the further side of the Gullet, if they had become masters of the place. The assault on the East side was giuen very neere 2 houres too late, so as the tide began to rise, which did not a little terrifie them, perceiuing that if they staid there any longer they could not be relieued, whereupon, they retired, &amp; in their retreat a great slaughter was made, for our men with great and small shot which could not misse, thundred among them. The Archduks sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers gaue the like assault to the Bulwarks of Helmont, the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuspine and all other trenches belonging to the English wherein
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:14840:162"/>
few men were, which the Generall had done of purpose so as they were easily taken: but within a while after, forces beeing sent from the towne, namely from the Polder and Southren bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks with their Rauelins, and the enemie perceiuing they could not that way gaine any accesse into the towne, forsooke those forts againe, setting fire on the corps de gard. Generall <hi>Vere</hi> had caused two double canon to bee planted on the flanquers of the West gate, beside the seuen which were there alreadie, the which with others, scoured the Sand hill and West Rauelin where the assault was giuen, being charged with chaine shot, nailes, and bags full of musket bullets, which could not misse the enemie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; on whom they fell as thicke as haile, and made a terrible slaughter, the crie beeing so great among those that were hurt, as the liuing and dead fell in heapes one vpon an other. In the hottest of the assault as the tide was risen, Generall <hi>Vere</hi> vnstopt the Sluces, the more to terrifie the enemies, who saw pale death on euerie side before their eyes, which hee considering, would not omit that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but with his troops so furiously assailed them, as hee did wholy put them to rout taking all the enemies ladders, brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of assault, and other warlike engines, leauing all places neere to the Sand hill, as farre as the old Church, and round about the Porcuspine, the Westren Rauelin, and the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish trenches, filled with dead bodies: the number of those that were slaine by the Canon and smal shot was very great, and no lesse was that of those that were drowned in the Sea, for many of them were taken vp beyond Callais in France, and in Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where they were stript: the booty was verie great, both in monie, garments, and faire armor, and among other a Spanish woman was found in mans apparrell who had been at the assault, as appeared by hir wounds; shee lay at the foot of the Sand hill, vnder hir garments shee had a chaine of gold, inriched with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious stones, beside other iewels and monie.</p>
               <p>The Archduke during the assault was in person behind his batteries vpon the Caualliers. Those which assaulted the towne had brought victuals with them for two or three daies, (though in vaine) and made all manner of prouisions for intrenchment, if their attempt had prospered, they had likewise brought sixe bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder to the Rauelin of the Porcuspine, to vndermine the towne, but they were soone enforced to abandon all, for the

besieged had of set purpose dismounted the ordnance on the falce-bray, and porcuspine, because the enemie should not vse them to the townes detriment.</p>
               <p>The assault beginning on euerie side, the Archdukes men were gotten on the West side beyond the Gullet, hauing many bridges on which to passe ouer at their pleasure, and to assault the old towne likewise on that side.

               <p>The said halfe moone being taken, and many men placed in it, they presently began to intrench themselues with spades and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks which they had brought with them for that purpose, but all their labour and diligence was in vaine. For the ordnance and small shot from the South side, and Spanish bulwarke, fel so thick vpon them, as heads, armes, and leggs, flew euerie where, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that the Sea might inclose them, they grew fearefull, which the Generall considering, sent Captaine <hi>Day</hi> thither, who with great cries fiercely assailed them and with much effusion of bloud draue them thence, so as the next day, aboue three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dead bodies were found in the said halfe moone, beside those that were hurt and drowned. In this generall assault which continued two houres; the Archduke lost in all aboue two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, for in the fury no man was spared, notwithstanding hee cried out, take me prisoner, I am an Ensigne, Lieutenant, or Captaine, one promising an hundred, an other, two, three, foure, fiue, yea sixe hundred crownes to haue their liues saued, but it was to no purpose, for none were spared during the fight, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the heat beeing past, many were taken prisoners, and great numbers of them brought into Ostend. Verie few of our

There died of the enemies commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Count <hi>Imbec</hi> an Italian who was verie rich, and had three hundred pistolets to spend euery day, hee promised to giue as much gold for his ransome as his bodie weighed, but a common souldier slew him with a poniard, <hi>Don Durago</hi> campe master, the Sergeant Major generall who had been hostage at Ostend, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor of Antuerps lieutenant, Colonell <hi>Lewis Gambaliotta, D.

His Highnes sent a Drum, crauing leaue to suruey the dead, who had foure hours granted him.</p>
               <p>The commaunders which conducted the souldiers to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault on the seuenth of Ianuarie 1602, were Count <hi>Ferneste</hi> an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian, commaunding 2000 of his countrie men who were to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the Sand hill; Count <hi>Bucquoy</hi> on the West side of the Gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let with two thousand men, assailing the Eastern Rauelin, but the tide being risen verie high, hee assaulted the halfe moone beyond the Gullet, from whence he was brauely repulsed.</p>
               <p>The Gouernor of Dixmuide, at the Porcuspine with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand men, from whence hee was likewise repulsed, besides an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Captaine with fiue hundred men on the West Rauelin, who was also beaten thence.

               <p>After this, because the prisoners said that the enemie would the next day giue an other assault, Generall <hi>Vere</hi> did euerie where fortifie and fence the weakest places.

But the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke presently caused part of these mutineers to be imprisoned, and hanged vp fortie or fiftie of them, of whom, three were men of note and respect among the souldiers, one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an old souldier, said aloud at his execution, that there were foure thousand who would reuenge their death; an hundred and fiftie of them were likewise condemned to the Gallies. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers of Isabellas fort were sent to Winocxbergue, without paye, who reduced the whole countrie vnder contribution, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselues.</p>
               <p>Within a while after, the States of the vnited prouinces, sent more men to Ostend, and furnished the towne with all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, notwithstanding the enemies continuall shooting, so as wee can reckon, that from the first day of the siege, which was the fift of Iuly, till Christmasse, one hundred sixtie one thousand and fiue hundred shot had beene made vpon the towne, and halfe as manie from thence. The harme done by the enemies Canon was not onely repaired, but the town thereby made more strong. The Sand hill was so full of bullets as the workemen could not enter the pallizadoes which had iron points, meeting many times with seuen or eight bullets in one hole. It was a verie hard taske to vndermine the towne, by reason that there were so manie tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and fortifications abroade hindring the enemies approches, the Sea did likewise keep them from any long worke: To famish the towne, was likewas impossible; for though the enemie shot on euerie side, yet in one day, twentie, thirtie, yea' fortie boats entred the towne, and they had moreouer an other hauen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, by which they might at all times enter with lesse daunger, and though all the hauens should faile them, yet they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually bring prouision into the old towne by shallops.

of sundrie nations. These men so fortified the places of the Corps du gards, as the enemie could no more doe such harme as hee was wont, and in that regard, shot not so often into the towne. As these entred, the old Garrison departed thence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh themselues. Generall <hi>Vere</hi> went away likewise, and made a journey into England.</p>
               <p>The going out and in of these souldiers was seldome done without daunger, and yet sometimes it was not daungerous: as on the seuenteenth of March, when fiue boats entred by night without any harme, notwithstanding, all the enemies shot. The next morning at cleere day light, nineteene boats richly loaden entred: the enemie made one hundred twentie and two shot after them, and those of the towne discharged aboue sixtie shot vpon the enemies Canon and Gabions. Of these nineteene boats, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene were touched, but no great hurt done, onely two men were slaine, and seuen hurt. In a word, they entred sometime with daunger, and sometimes without.</p>
               <p>In lesse than sixe weekes, one hundred thirtie and sixe boats loaden with all manner of prouision and munition entred the towne. A Sea Captaine called <hi>Iohn Adrian Caut,</hi> did on the tenth of Februarie bring 60000 pound weight of match, and thirtie bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of powder thither, the like did diuers others, so as the town was prouided for a long time. Great quantitie of fagots and other stuffe was likewise sent thither to defend the towne from the Sea waues.</p>
               <p>Souldiers were commonly brought in, in great shallops and by that meanes the old Garrison of English and other nations were caried thence in March.</p>
               <p>The Archduke likewise sent for moe men to his Campe, with a firme resolution, according to his directions from Spaine, to continue the siege to the end, because it stood him so much vpon, as the onely meanes to shut vp the hauens of Zealand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to hinder their fishing and trade, yea, their passage to and fro into England. To effect this, he sent for many Gallies from Spain and Italie conducted by <hi>Frederico Spinola</hi> and hired mariners from Embden and the East parts, thereby to take the dominion of the Sea from the Hollanders, for it was that which made them able to resist the power of so mightie a Prince: This was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great importance, not only for the king of Spaines repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:14840:165"/>
but likewise for the Archdukes. Whereupon, he sent for more money from Spaine, and raised certaine sums in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. He likewise sent abroad for skilfull Ingeneers, who were entertained and set on work, not sparing for any cost, &amp; to some of them 100000 crownes were promised. These men made sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie new inuentions to choake the Gullets hauen, and to keepe boats from entring, as by making plat-formes and Caualliers whereon to plant the Canon; by filling boats full of stones, and sinking them in the hauen, filling baskets full of sand, and row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them into it, they likewise made engins of wood and wicker like to Gabions, which they tearmed Sawsiges, some of them fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie foot in length, and eighteene in height, filled with stones and grauell tied together, the which they thought, by helpe of men, to roule into the gullet, and with many of these to build a fort. They likewise tied diuers woodden beames together, and began to make Bulwarkes vpon them, which at a full Sea they intended to haue thrust into the Gullet, and from those bulwarkes to sinke all ships that passed along, with such like other inuentions, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by skilfull and ingenious men: and in this manner, did euerie day make some new worke or other.</p>
               <p>But so soone as the enemie finished such inuentions, those of the town presently deuised remedies against them, either to beat them downe with the canon, to set them on fire, or to keep their work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from their labour; and when they descried any of these workes, they knew well enough how to plucke them into the Sea, which at an high water carried them cleane away.</p>
               <p>The siege continuing, diuers houses and cabins were built in the campe, so as it resembled a new towne, by which meanes the enemie was well lodged: and the campe towards the West, was called the West-eynd.</p>
               <p>In continuance of time, the towne was fortified both against the enemies ordnance, waues and tempests of the Sea, yet the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie approched by little and little, the souldiers cabins were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired &amp; renewed, the better to preserue them from the plague and other contagious diseases: especially the second yeare of the siege, at what time the plague was verie rife both in the Campe and towne.</p>
               <p>The vnited Prouinces, notwithstanding this continuall siege, which did put them to such infinite charge, as our children will

hardly beleeue, what masse of treasure hath beene spent there, viz. in extraordinarie expences one hundred thousand florins a moneth, beside the souldiers pay, and how these small and weak Prouinces, haue beene able without extraordinarie meanes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish such expence, resolued to keepe and defend the towne so long as they could, yea though the siege should continue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares.</p>
               <p>The Archduke for continuance of the siege, vsed all possible meanes to get money, and to that end went to Bruxels in winter, and there assembled the States of the Countrie, but those of Brabant would giue no money, vnlesse his Highnesse did first fulfill his promise to satisfie the mutiners of Artois, Hainault, and Luxembourg, saying that they expected the French, so as they of Flaunders onely contributed.

               <head>¶ An Assault giuen by the Archduke on the thirteenth of April <hi>1603,</hi> on the Polder, East, and South Quadrants.</head>
               <p>AFter that the Archduke had continually battered the towne all anno 1602, and by his infinite number of shot done great hurt both to it and the forts, slaine many men, and yet neuer the neerer to his purpose, in regard the besieged made such braue resistance.</p>
               <p>Hee did againe on the thirteenth of Aprill 1603 giue a furious assault on the Quadrants of the East, South, and Polder, so as he tooke them, in this manner following. The thirteenth of Aprill, the wind was so high, as it caried away the tops of houses, threw down whole buildings, and namely the tower where many were slaine. The enemy laying hold on this occasion, made an assault both on the East and West side with great numbers of men: on the East side, they pluckt vp about 100 stakes forth of the halfe moone, but they were enforced to quit it, for they were beaten backe euen to their Quarter: they came on the West side as far as
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:14840:166"/>
the Porcuspine whether they brought two barrells of pitch, but they were likewise driuen thence with losse of men.</p>
               <p>They did also with great fury full on the Rauelin of the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and were likewise enforced to retreat, but they renewed the assault with freshmen, and became masters of all these three places, videlicet, the Quadrants of the East, South, and Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, notwithstanding that a demy Canon and other iron pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces lay vpon the Polder Quadrant: in taking these places they inhumanely slew all they met with, the fight lasted some two howers.</p>
               <p>The next day about nine of the clocke at night the besieged gaue a fierce assault to the East Quadrant, but were driuen thence with losse of some foure hundred men, among whom were many braue souldiers. But the enemie in these assaults lost aboue one thousand.</p>
               <p>Continuall trauell, and resistance made this truce so famous, as it was termed a martiall academie, both for Gouernours, Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, Captaines, and priuate souldiers, as also for mariners, Pilots, Ingeneers, Phisitians, Surgeons, &amp;c. so as those who had but continued certaine moneths in this schole became masters in in their arts, both for defence and offence.</p>
               <p>Skilfull Ingeneers, notwithstanding they had studied a long time in bookes, did confesse that in comparison of practize here, they were but nouices: Phisitians and Surgeons learned more here in a weeke, than elsewhere in a yere.</p>
               <p>Pilots and mariners learned here how to guide their vessels to auoid the enemies canon.</p>
               <p>Canoneers were taught here how to plant their ordnance to sink ships vnder saile, how to make counter batteries to dismount the enemies Canon, which on both sides consumed infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of men.</p>
               <p>The sixe first moneths the enemie made aboue two hundred and fiftie thousand shot, shooting bullets of thirtie or fortie pound weight: for all the time the Infanta lay at Newport, if she heard not the repot of the Canon, shee was male-content, and commaunded her Gunners to shoot continually.</p>
               <p>The besieged were not much indebted to the enemy, but in the first 20 moneths, discharged 100000 shot, 18000 of the enemies were slaine the first twentie moneths, as well by the ordnance,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:14840:166"/>
and extreame cold which they endured the first two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> winters, as by sallies, sicknesse and miserie. And in the towne sixe or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thousand died, though the number was not well knowne, for sicke and wounded men were sent away: the like did the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, who sent his to the next townes and hospitals.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding all these batteries, and that many in the town died of the plague, and through want, yet the besieged were vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited by their freinds, kinsfolks, wiues and children which came forth of Holland and Zealand and went thither as to a festiuall. Some Captaines brought their wiues and children thither: Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and great Lords came thither from Fraunce and England to see the fortifications,</p>
               <p>All the three yeares that the siege continued, the besieged kept the fift of Iuly holieday, beating their caudrons in steed of bels, discharging all their ordnance: and that day a solemne sermon was made, wherein thankes was giuen to God for preseruing them so long a time from their enemies, entreating him still to do the like.</p>
               <p>Sundrie sallies and assaults were made, store of fire-works were throwne into the enemies Campe and plat-formes which were made of sagots. Among others a certaine Ingeneer called <hi>Pompey</hi> the Romain, inuented sundrie meanes to choake the gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, but all his labour was to no purpose.</p>
               <p>The besieged had made an halfe moone on the farther side of the Gullet to defend the going in and out of the boats, and to keepe them safe in the towne dikes: and the better to skale the said stalfe moone, this <hi>Pompey</hi> had framed a bridge for assault, mounted on foure great brasen wheels like to a Chariot, on which this bridge was to bee drawne: it bended in the middest and rested on a great mast one hundred and fiftie foot long, whereon this bridge might bee drawne vp and let downe: It was made of Cables and small cords twined together on small masts. The fore part was drawne vp along the mast like a drawe bridge, which being brought neere to the town, they would haue let fall ouerthwart the dikes, vpon the Rampires: this bridge was drawne by forty horses. With this bridge which they termed the luy-wagon, or idle wagon, they thought to haue assaulted the halfe moon beyond the gullet. The besieged perceiuing it to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, did with their Canon shot break one of the wheels, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:14840:167"/>
it could be mended, had erected masts vpon the counterscarp of the halfe moone, that when their bridge should bee let fall, it might rest vpon the said masts: this being perceiued by the enemy, he gaue ouer his inuention.</p>
               <p>In Iune 1603, D. <hi>Rodrigo Lasso</hi> came from Spaine and brought newes that Marquis <hi>Ambrose Spinola</hi> (brother to <hi>Ieronimo Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> that was slaine in the Gallies before Sluce) had after his brothers death couenanted with the king of Spaine to take vp great sums of money for his Majesties seruice, on certain assurance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, viz. to haue the chiefe authoritie and soueraigne com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund at the siege of Ostend, with ample power from the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, and not to bee enuied of the other commaunders in the armie, of-what nation soeuer.</p>
               <p>The said Marquis beeing come into the low Countries with this commission, vndertooke the charge, and presenly reformed many matters, deposing sundrie officers, placing others in their steds, carefully prouiding monie, and setting diuers skilful Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers on work, by whose help he hoped to take the towne: for the besieged had long since lost all their fortifications and workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. The Marquis presently caused mynes to bee made, and assaults to be giuen.</p>
               <p>The Sea and high tides caused by a North-east wind which blew on the first day of March, did great harme, spoiling and carying away the mines, trenches, and conterscarps.</p>
               <p>The besieged, though they dayly receiued supplies of men and other necessaries, yet the sixe last moneths they were mightily annoyed by the continuall batteries, and sustained great losse: for after Collonell <hi>Huchtenbroeck,</hi> the Lord of Gystels, the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, beeing slaine in March, who was a braue and valiant gentleman, and much lamented, Colonell <hi>Loon</hi> succeeded him, who within a while after was likewise slaine, and after him many other Captaines which had the chiefe commaund, next, Colonel <hi>Berendrecht,</hi> whom Colonell <hi>Vtenhove</hi> succeeded, and left the towne beeing hurt. At last when the towne had been a long time without Gouernour, the Lord of Marquet was sent thither on the tenth of Iune 1604, hee was the last Gouernour there. <hi>Dauid</hi> of Orleance the Ingeneer was shot in the towne, and went his way into Holland to bee healed. But master <hi>Rafe Dexter</hi> the Englisman, a valiant and skilfull person taried there still. This
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:14840:167"/>
change of gouernours hindred the prosperous successe of many matters: their good Decrees being not well obserued: some of which, we will here set downe. It was decreed, for preuenting controuersies betwixt victuallers, That no wares or victuals should be sold till they had first continued foure and twentie houres in the Market place. All souldiers were likewise forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to play at Dice or Cardes, on paine of eight daies imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fasting with bread and water. No officer might come vpon the gard being drunke, on payne of loosing his place and armes: because that many souldiers went to the enemie, the townesmen offered fiftie crownes to him that could bring in such an one either aliue or dead. The enemies, in regard diuers of their men came to our side, caused their horsemen to keepe continuall gard, yet it was to no purpose at all. In Aprill, May, and Iune, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis <hi>Spinola</hi> vsed all speedie meanes to take the Towne, that he might goe and relieue Sluce, sparing neither men nor money. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, Captaine <hi>Catrice</hi> was slaine, he was a man of great experience in martiall affaires: diuers other commaunders, Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels and Captaines, were likewise slayne: they also tooke the Porcuspine, and approached daily by assaults and Mynes.</p>
               <p>The twelfth of Iune, <hi>Spinola</hi> blew vp a Myne neere to the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Bulwarke, which buried many of his men aliue: thereupon, he gaue an assault, wherein certaine hundreds of his men were slayne, and some fortie or fiftie of the besieged. The sixteenth of Iune, the besieged made a fierce sallie vpon the Pioners, &amp; draue them away. Diuers other assaults, Mynes, and sallies were made that Summer, by meanes whereof, they came at last euen to the Dikes; they likewise stopt vp the old hauen with Fagots. In Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, they vndermyned the Sand hill, and approached the other Bulwarkes, by means of their platformes, from whence they shot fiercely. In the end, <hi>Spinola</hi> resolued, in September, to assault the chiefe Bulwarke the Sand hill, and finding the Spaniards and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talians vnwilling to march, in regard of the daunger they had before beene in, he resolued to make vse of the Almans, promising them great rewards: and though Mynes were made on both sides, yet he was desirous to get the Sand hill: whereupon, he gaue an assault by part of the Almans of the regiments of <hi>Biglia</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laymont,</hi> and as those that went formost were blowne vp into the ayre by the Townes Mynes, and they that followed retiring,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:14840:168"/>
thereupon, hee enforced them to march againe to the charge, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there were no more mines, which they found to be true, and so without any resistance took the Sand hill, and highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced the Almains: hee vsed like meanes against the other forts, for all the besiegeds defence consisted in sallies wherby they often draue the enemies forth of those places they had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p>The besieged, by meanes of their Ingeneers, and by <hi>Rafe Dexter</hi> the English man who had a long time serued in these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, had behind the bulwarks of the Sand hill and Helmont, made a new Sand hill and Helmont: which done, they diuided the towne in the middest, with bulwarks and flankeers a thwart the towne; and behind it, they likewise intrenched more than a quarter of it, towards the Gullet and new hauen, with bulwarks and flankeers, for their latest retreat, naming that place new Troy, hoping still to hold out for a time.</p>
               <p>But all these new works being not stedfast and firme, could not long resist the Canon: for the enemie had alreadie brought his ordnance vpon the Rampiers and battered the new town.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, the besieged perceiuing that the Sand hill was lost, and that the enemie vndermined the towne neere to the old Church, and that it was likely that high tides with an North-east wind would do much hurt, because the old towne was their best defence against the Sea, they aduertized the Generall States, and Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> (who were assembled at Sluce) of their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Their Lordships and his Excellencie, considering that by the conquest of Sluce and other places, they had now gotten footing in Flaunders, and thereby were able to inuade the enemie in his owne Countrie, which they had a long time desired, and that now Ostend would stand them in no great steed, it beeing enuironed and blockt vp with so many of the enemies forts, and also a place from whence the Archduke could not annoy them, and might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily bee by them recouered, so long as they were Lords at Sea: These and such like reasons beeing well weighed: The States gaue authoritie and leaue to the Lord of Marquet Gouernour of Ostend, to capitulate with the enemie for his most aduantage, seing themselues were out of feare of the Archdukes forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sluce that winter.</p>
               <p>Thereupon, the Lord of Marquet with his Councell of war,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:14840:168"/>
fearing least winter would impaire his composition, began to ship away his ordnance, munition, remainder of victuals; and all those whom he supposed might haue hindred the treatie, as, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, Ingeneers, Gunners, &amp;c. Then hee sent two Captaines forth of the town to treat with the Marquis about surrendring it, the enemie likewise sending two hostages into the towne.</p>
               <p>At last on the twentieth of September 1604, after much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation about the ensuing articles, the accord was made betwixt Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> in name of their highnesses on the one side, and the Lord Gouernour, Colonels, and Captaines in Ostend, on the other.</p>

               <p>In this manner did the famous siege of Ostend, breake vp, which continued three yeres and fourescore daies; a siege which will be spoken of so long as the world lasteth, and will seeme in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible to after ages.</p>
               <p>The accord thus made, the enemie entred the old towne, and our men into their intrenched workes called New Troy, till the two and twentieth of September, and then they went away by land, according to the capitulation, crossing the gullets, in sloops and Ferrie-boats. Gouernour <hi>Marquette,</hi> the Colonels, Captaines, and others, were by Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> inuited to a banquet, whilest the troops were putting themselues in order to march. They went along the Sea side, after this manner, the French led the Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, the Dutch, the battaile, and the English and Scots, the rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, they were in number three thousand, all lustie, &amp; able men;
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:14840:169"/>
they caried foure peece of ordnance with them towards Blanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenberg and the next morning arriued at the camp, where Prince Maurice and all the Lords did courteously welcome them, taking them by the hand, saluting them all as they rode through the troops, thanking them for their faithfull seruice done to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: Then, their Quarter was appointed where they should rest, the captaines, officers, and braue souldiers being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to good places, and largely recompenced.</p>
               <p>Most of the Burghers likewise went their way to Sluce: The Baylie of Ostend, was made Baylie of Sluce, and none taried in Ostend, but a few old people.</p>
               <p>Diuers notes were found of the number of those that died at this siege: one of <hi>Spinolas</hi> souldiers that was slaine before Sluce, had a note about him, of all the colonels, captaines, officers, and souldiers which died before Ostend. An Alman gentleman that was at Ostend, saith, that during the siege, there died 15 Colonels, seuen Marshals of the camp, 19 Sergeant Majors, 560 Captaines, 322 Enseignes, 4911 Sergeants, 1166 Lieutenants, 9166 Corporals, 56366 souldiers, six thousand and eleuen Mariners, one thousand one hundred nintie sixe women and children, amounting in all to 76961. All these died, from the beginning of the siege, to the last of Iuly, 1604, not accounting those that died since. This num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is great and incredible: vnto which, the sick and wounded, which were sent abroad to the Hospitals may be added.</p>
               <p>Some haue likewise set downe the number of the besieged which was verie great, but I think it impossible, truely to number them, for those that were sicke or hurt were presently sent away; but the number of the enemies was far greater, yet the besieged had more plentie of all things, &amp; endured lesse miserie than the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes souldiers, who lay 3 whole winters, in so cold and moist a place, and therefore it is likely that very many of all nations died there. Ostend was afterwards visited by diuers men of all sorts, who found it an heap of stonss &amp; sand, there were few houses, but many cabins, much munition, and some 11 peece of ordnance which were vnseruiceable, with certain morters and other engins, and an infinite number of bullets.</p>
               <p>The Archdukes went thither to see the town, which they won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully admired, &amp; perceiued, that they had spent &amp; consumed, huge sums of money, time, and men, onely to wyn an heape of
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:14840:170"/>
sand, and finding it ruinous and inhabitable, they gaue order to haue it repayred.</p>
               <p>From thence their Highnesses went in pilgrimage to our Ladies neere Dunkerke, to whom many attributed the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: they gaue order that the houses and Church should bee reedified, and the towne fenced against the waues of the Sea: and the better to drawe people to dwell there, they gaue great priuiledges and immunities to it, but the first yeare fewe came thither: and at this day, they haue neither fishing nor naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>

his armie at Moock, from whence without any stop, hee passed his forces ouer the Mase, and lodged at little Linden, brauely determining to go and seeke the enemy, and to offer him battaile, who had alreadie receiued his Italian forces; and if God should grant him the victorie, hee then hoped to bee able to relieue O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stend, which had beene besieged eleuen moneths, or at least, if hee could not sitly meet with him, yet to dare him, who seemed to desire nothing more than to meet with his Excellencie vpon his owne territories, to reuenge his losse at the battaile of Niew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in Flaunders.</p>

                     <p>MY Lords, wee doubt not but that your Excellencies do still remember, the louing remonstrances and exhortations which we haue often made vnto you, wherein we intreated you maturely to consider, and well weigh the determination and end of the Spaniards and their adherents, enemies to the State, lawes, priuiledges, goods, and persons of the Netherlands, viz. their originall, and rooted determination, which is so base and hurtfull, as it wholy tends to the entire ruine of the Inhabitants of these Countries. We know very well (notwithstanding that the said determination is likewise among you held indubitable) that some of your Excellencies, haue beene drawne thereunto, partly by your owne good natures, and partly by persuasions, that matters might bee redressed and amended, by meanes of the Archdukes and presence of their Highnesses. But because we are well assured of the Spaniards and their adherents continuance in their determination for ruine of the Netherlands, and subiecting them for euer to the Spanish yoake, that they might beare rule ouer the consciences, bodies, lawes, and goods of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thereof, and that the Archduke can no way helpe it; this is the reason why wee cannot bee of your opinion. And not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate your Excellencies nor our selues, into a certaine, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and irreparable ruine, we haue found out this to be the best remedie, still to continue, with a constant courage in the lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble resolution taken from the beginning by the chiefe persons and members of the whole Netherlands, of all estates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions: and beeing assured of the aide and assistance of God, and that of Kings, Princes, and Republiks with whom wee are

Your Excellencies doe perceiue, vnderstand, and effectually feele what is past, and may easily iudge of that which is still likely to ensue, so as wee think it needlesse to writ more amply vnto you of it: onely we louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intreat, exhort, and earnestly request your Excellencies to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the laudable reputation purchased by your predecessors certaine hundreds of yeares past, which they haue left vnto vs as a rule, which is, to bee Protectors and defendors of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and lawes of the Netherlands in common, and of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, townes, and inhabitants thereof in particular; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider whether the contents of the said idle and vnworthie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance, and of the treatie which ensued it, doth agree with the duetie, wherewith your Excellencies are tied, to your houses, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, posteritie, and especially to your Countrie. Yf so, (which wee by no meanes think) wee will pray vnto God to enlighten your Excellencies, and to giue you a better and cleerer iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But if your Excellencies perceiue that the said pretended conueyance (made for necessitie, and to auoide a greater mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe) bee deceitfull and dishonorable, and as an infamous blot to the Netherlands: if likewise yee vnderstand that the Spaniards and their adherents proceedings which haue ensued thereupon, and are till now growne from bad to worse, both in affaires of state and war (as wee know that the most of your Excellencies do) are preiudicious and intollerable; and so by consequence your
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:14840:172"/>
Excellencies are not bound and tied to them, as repugnant to the common good, the lawes and priuiledges of the Netherlands. If your Excellencies doe likewise consider, that all forcible extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, all prohibitions of trade and commerce, all deuises and practises to entangle the Majestie of England and the vnited pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, doe more and more come to light, and are not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to this resolution, but bring forth cleane contrarie ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: That the treacherous attempts on the Townes and Castles of the French king, giue great occasion to take speedie reuenge: That libels and rimes (wherewith they seeke to make the French King and his affaires odious to the common people; and call in question the rightfull successions of the Crownes of France and England) are but vain propositions, only tending to incense their Majesties; and that they goe about in vain to raise tumult &amp; sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion amongst the people of the Low-countries, considering that whilest they are at quiet, and liue vnder obedience, their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (thanks be to God) is an hundred times better and more safe than that of the common people vnder the king of Spaine, and Archdukes; and that they haue no occasion to distrust their lawfull superiors or their actions: but on the contrarie, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and Archdukes subjects (perceiuing that all their affaires doe daily impaire) that the authoritie of the States, Prelats, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Lords, Gentlemen, and townes of the Prouinces both in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and particular are without any respect trodden vnder-foot: that they defend themselues onely with strangers in contempt of all good Patriots: and that, not onely in the chiefe garrisons, townes and forts, but generally in all matters (some few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) they seeme to proceed formally and in apparence, the which without all question they will soone leaue off, if they were once absolute Lords; so that the Prouinces and people should not be onely without trade, wealth, and nauigation, but euen the third part of the Inhabitants would bee depriued of necessarie meanes to liue, the chiefe cities made Doue-coats, the Countrie villages ruined, and the people eaten and consumed to the verie bones by souldiers, who are so badly payed, as mutinie in one place is no sooner quieted, but two worse than it breakes forth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so as it is to be feared, that in the end all will become des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. In which regard, we intreat your Excellencies, effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to embrace the necessarie remedies, and so to handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:14840:172"/>
as their Highnesses may be persuaded to depart from the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands, and to procure themselues a more quiet and certaine portion: for then it will be no hard matter for your Excellencies and vs, to cause the Spaniards, and other straungers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, and to enforce the greatest parts of their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to become true Patriots and Countriemen.

               <p>So soone as all things which were thought necessarie for this armie were speedily prepared, and that certaine Lords of the Generall States, and councell of State, were appointed to bee present with his Excellencie, to assist him in all matters which might happen in the armie, videlicet, from Holland the Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of Alcmaer whose name was <hi>Gerard Coorn</hi>: from Zealand, <hi>Albertus Ioachimi,</hi> counsellor and pentioner of Tergoes: from Vtrecht, <hi>Gerard de Renesse</hi> Lord of Vander Aa: from Frizeland, <hi>Iulius Essinga,</hi> and from Ouer-yssell <hi>Otto Roeck.</hi> The armie was diuided into three troops: The first was that of his Excellencie, conducted by Count <hi>Ernest</hi> of Nassau, which commonly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in the left wing: the second, by Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassau gouernour of Frizeland and Groeningue with whom was Count <hi>Henry</hi> of Nassau his Excellencies brother, who vsually marched in the middle or battaile: The third by Sir <hi>Francis Vere</hi> Generall of the English Regiments, who led the right wing. The horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were conducted by Count <hi>Lodwick</hi> of Nassau Generall of the cauallery, and with him the Lord <hi>Gray,</hi> who were likewise diuided into three troops, each of which neere to one of the foot troops. The wagons and carts were also diuided into three parts, (the ordnance excepted) being twelue demy canons and three field peeces.</p>
               <p>The three and twentieth of Iune the Campe departed from a place called Little Linden, and marched in the foresaid order not one behind an other, but close together, being sometime sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted halfe an houres iourney from one an other, and sometimes lesse, and was quartered the same day at Sambeer, Mullem, and Oploo.</p>
               <p>The foure and twentieth at Bleyterwick, Meerle, and Venroy: the fiue and twentieth, at Baecken neere to Venlo, Brey and Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenum: the sixe and twentieth, at Bingenum neere to Remunde, Baxen and Heilhuyse: the seuen and twentieth, at Aldeneyck

neere to Masieres, Gestinghen, and Ophouen. The Reader may consider that by the first mentioned places, are meant the quarters of his Excellencies troop, the second of Count <hi>William,</hi> and the third of Generall <hi>Vere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The eight and twentieth, nine and twentieth, and thirtieth of Iune, and first of Iuly, the whole campe remained in the said places, setting vp mills to grind, and ouens to bake, and making other prouision in the towne of Masieres. The second of Iuly, the armie marched in the same order, and quartred at Lent and thereabout. The 3 day, (leauing Mastricht on the left hand) at Gellick, Moperdingen, and Eygenbilsen.</p>
               <p>The fourth at S. Heeren-Elderen, Heins, and neere to Ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren, where it staied.</p>
               <p>The fift and sixt at Gelmen, Hopperdingen and Rijckel, neere S. Torns: the seuenth, all the troops lodged together at Halmael neere S. Trons.</p>
               <p>The Archduke hauing assembled his armie beyond the towne of Thyenen, vnder conduct of the Admerall of Arragon, at a place called Hackelduyuel, entrenched and fortified his campe with Rampiers and Bulwarks well fenced with ordnance.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie on the eight of Iuly, with a great part of his horse and foot (leauing the rest in armes together with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons and baggage at Halmael) crossed a small riuer called Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maele, and a village in Brabant called Nerelant, leauing Louayn on the right hand, and went euen in sight of the enemies campe, sending some of his horsemen to a little riuer called the Gete, not far from the enemies Campe, to view and to trie whether there were any likelyhood to draw him from his place of aduantage to battaile. But perceiuing that hee did not stir, his Excellencie and men after some stay on an high place, hauing shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the enemie, returned to his Campe at Halmaell, where hee continued the ninth day, the enemie not once comming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: and want of victualls enforcing his Excel. to abide there no longer, and perceiuing that the enemie was strongly intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, hauing with them certaine Italian troops newly arriued, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in all to the number of 20 thousand men, together with 18 peece of ordnance, he resolued to do that which should be most commodious for himselfe; the difficulties of the passages and bad waies were propounded, the number of wagons beeing verie
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:14840:174"/>
great, and the labour to iourney greater with such a cariage.</p>
               <p>They found the townes and villages of the countrie of Liege verie vnwilling to giue them bread for money, and there were so many men and horse in the armie as sufficient forrage could not bee found for them; corne could not bee ripe in a fortnight or three weeks: they came likewise too late to hinder the Italians from ioining with the Admerall: whereupon they resolued to besiege some towne of importance: some propounded An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerpe, but their necessarie prouisions were not readie for such an attempt. In the end they resolued to turne backe and besiege the towne of Graue, and there to attend the Admeralls armie. Thereupon, his Excellencie departed the next day beeing the tenth of the said moneth, in the selfe same order as before, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Aix, and places neere adioining. The heate of that day was so intollerable, as many souldiers (though the iournies were not long) died of faintnesse by the way, and others were so weake as they were enforced to tarrie behind, yet in the coole of the euening they came to the camp, the enemie in all the march gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no alarmes to our men either by day or night.</p>
               <p>The 11 day, the heate continued, so as his Excellencie stirred not that day, but refreshed his armie.</p>
               <p>The 12, the armie lodged vpon the heath before the towne of Hasselt.</p>
               <p>The thirteenth, at Helchteren, the fourteenth, at Lille, the fifteenth, at Hees, where his Excellencie sent a trumpet to the enemies souldiers at Eyndhouen, commaunding them to depart thence, which was done.</p>
               <p>The 16, the armie lodged before Helmont &amp; Stiphent, and vpon refusall to depart which the enemies garrison in Helmont Castle made, his Excellencie commaunded a volley of six canon to play vpon it, whereupon, they presently capitulated and went thence.</p>
               <p>The 17, the armie rested at Vden, the 18, at Cassell, Esteren, Reken, and Welp, and at last before the towne of Graue, which his Excellencie besieged and tooke, as shall appeare in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing description.</p>

               <head>¶ The siege and taking of the towne of Graue in the land of Cuyck, in anno <hi>1602.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>HIs Excellencie according to the resolution of the Generall States, brought his armie before the towne of Graue, the chiefe Citie of the land of Cuyck, seated in Brabant vpon the Mase: in former time it belonged to Guelderland, but was afterward reduced vnder the gouernment of Brabant, beeing ingaged to <hi>Maximilian</hi> of Egmont Count of Buren. The Prince of Orange of happie memorie mariying his daughter, bought it together with all that depended thereon, and enioyed it a long time: but after the pacification of Gand, certain Almain troopes lying in garrison there for the Spaniards, were driuen thence by the Princes forces together with the helpe of the Burgers.</p>
               <p>The Prince of Parma did afterwards besiege it in anno 1586, vnto whom, the Lord of Hemert deliuered it vp. Since then, the towne beeing strong by nature, was better fortified with Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, Rauelins, and Counterscarps, and is now one of the stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest places of the Netherlands. <hi>Antonio Gozales</hi> the Spaniard was Gouernour there, who fearing and expecting a siege, D. <hi>Inigo d'Otaiola</hi> a verie skilfull Captain, brought forces thither, most of them beeing Italians and Spaniards with some German Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, vnder commaund of <hi>Pangus Gallais</hi> of Tiroll, Lieutenant to Colonell <hi>Tyssing,</hi> amounting to the number of one thousand and fiue hundred men, beside the Burghers: the towne was well stored with ordnance, munition, and victuals.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie beeing come before the towne, disposed his quarters after this maner: himselfe encamped on the West side of the towne on the banks of the Mase, on which a bridge was made of two hundred and thirtie paces in lenght: Count <hi>William</hi> lay on the South side of the towne, and the English vnder Generall <hi>Vere</hi> on the West side, where another bridge was likewise made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the riuer, whither diuers boats came presently forth of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land loden with victualls and all other necessaries for a siege.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:14840:175"/>
In the meane time newes was brought that the Admerall of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, had broken vp his campe at Thynen, and was comming with 20000 horse and foot into the Countrie of Liege, and from thence to Ruremond and Venlo, with an intent, by one means or other, to releeue the Graue. Whereupon, his Excellencie spent some time in fortifying his campe abroad, especially on that side where it was most likely the enemie would come.</p>
               <p>And the whole circuit of the campe round about the Towne on both sides the Mase (partly by reason of the Marshes, and partly to enclose certaine high and eminent places which were not fit to be left abroad least the enemie should seaze on them and thereby giue some aduantage) was wholly intrenched, and fortified with Skonces and Pallisadoes. Batteries were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise made vpon the principall wayes, where ordnance was planted.</p>
               <p>Certaine engins were likewise directed to giue signals by fire, that the quarters might in the night aduertise one another, if any alarme should be giuen.</p>
               <p>All the time, from the sixe and twentieth of Iulie, till the 3 of August, was spent in these fortifications and works, which were verie great and many. But then, in the Euening, the musters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, and certaine wagons and horse for draught sent away, they began to make their approches.</p>
               <p>The Admerall, in the meane time, tarried neere Venlo, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king shew as if he meant to crosse the Mase, to goe to besiege Rhynberck, thereby to draw his Excellencie from the Graue, who in time preuented him, sending his cousen Count <hi>Ernest</hi> of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau with sixteene foot companies thither. The Admerall hauing notice hereof, departed from Venlo, and by easie journeys came on slowly, putting men into the towne of Gennep, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Duke of Cleues.</p>
               <p>The tenth of Iulie, he lodged at great Lynden, within halfe an houres journey of his Excellencies quarter and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped, drawing his Campe forth in length as farre as the Mase (where he made a bridge) and Heumen Castle, which he tooke and fortified, intrenching his campe before, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting diuers canons.</p>
               <p>The Garrison of Graue had at times made sallies vpon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, but verie slowly at first; yet after they perceiued
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:14840:175"/>
succours, they came forth with greater furie, as on the thirteenth day in the morning by day breake, hauing first made some signall by fire, so as it was thought that the enemie would haue assailed the campe, but nothing was done: whereupon, the enemie was beaten back into the towne with great los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, and with little or none at all on our side.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth day, the enemie did againe make shew to assaile our campe, whereupon, the towne garrison made a furious sallie vpon the English Quarter, and was againe beaten back: in this skirmish wee lost an English Captain.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the enemies souldiers (namely the Italians) did in great troopes come and yeeld themselues to his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in regard of the great want and misery they endured, and told him that the Admerall approched with his ordnance neere to his Excellencies Quarter, on which he meant continually to shoot, and thereby enforce him to dislodge: vpon this aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment diuers fortifications were made, whereby this mischiefe was preuented.</p>
               <p>The twentieth day at night the enemie made some shot from a far off, both vpon the bridge ouer the Mase, and into his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies Quarter, hurting two or three men, and within a while after he began to dislodge his troopes, who caried ladders, spades, mattocks, and other preparations with them, comming downe to our trenches betwixt two skonces which stood in the middest betwixt his Excellencies and Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassaus quarters, intending as it seemed there to breake in, and attempt to put for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into the towne. But considering that his Excellencie stood on his gard and that all his men were in armes, hee presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in great feare, and attempted nothing leauing certain ladders and tooles behind him, which our men tooke and brought to their quarter.</p>
               <p>This attempt beeing vayne, the Admerall without sound of trumpet or drum departed thence in the night, and marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Cuyck, which his Excellencie perceiuing, the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, would presently haue followed him, but was staied by a thick mist which arose, whereby the enemie had sufficient time to get far enough.</p>
               <p>After his departure a rumour was spred, how that hee was gone to Rhynberck, whereupon Count <hi>Ernest</hi> was sent thither
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:14840:176"/>
againe the second time, and yet nothing ensued: for the enemie remained neere Venlo, attempting to put a garrison into it, which the townse men for a time refused, in regard of the disorder which souldiers vsually doe commit where they once are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.</p>
               <p>The ninth of September, the Generall States whose names here follow, departed from the Hague, and on the eleuenth day, arriued at his Excellencies Campe before Graue: The Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of Renesse Lord of Wulp: the Lord <hi>Iohn</hi> of Oldenbarneuelt Lord Temple: <hi>Cornelis Frans Wittes</hi> Burgomaster of Dort: <hi>Arent Meynertsz</hi> Burgomaster of Harlem: <hi>Iacob Vander Dussen</hi> Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master of Delft: <hi>Gerart Keg eling</hi> Burgomaster of Ter Goude: <hi>Bartholt de Vloswijck</hi> Burgomaster of Rotterdam: <hi>Nicolas Iacob Simons</hi> Burgomaster of Horn: <hi>Albertus Ioachimi</hi> of Zealand: the Lord <hi>Hottinga</hi> of Frizeland: Doctor <hi>Scherf</hi> of Ouer-yssell. <hi>Iohn Reingers ten post</hi> of Gronningue and the Ommelands: <hi>Corneillis Aerssens</hi> the Register: And of the Councell of State, <hi>Iacob Boelejz</hi> of Amsterdam: <hi>Ferdinand Alleman</hi> of Zealand, <hi>Ecko Everts Boners</hi> of Frizeland, <hi>Lauwijck</hi> of Ouer-yssell, <hi>George de Bie</hi> Tresorer, and <hi>Christiern Huygens</hi> Secretarie.</p>
               <p>After the enemies departure our men on euerie side approched the towne, the counterscarp being euen with his Excellencies quarter, so as our men partly by galleries made ouerthwart the dikes, and partly by vndermining, mounted the chiefe bulwark in Equall height with the towne Rampiers.</p>
               <p>From Count <hi>Williams</hi> quarter the galleries stretched to the middest of the chiefe towne dike: and the English were come as far as the enemies fortification on that side, beeing readie to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile it and make themselues masters of the chiefe dikes. Those in the towne perceiuing this, and considering that succours fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, did on the eighteenth day send a drum to craue a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, whereupon, hostages were sent from both sides, and on the 19 day an accord was made in forme following.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Seuenthly, in regard this is a frontire town confining the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Cleues &amp; Rauesteyn, where the imposts of Holland haue no force, such taxations not being to be layd on this towne without manifest ruyne thereof, especially now when the Burghers haue

               <p>WIthin a while after his Excellencie had taken the towne of Graue, the Captaines, <hi>du Bois</hi> and <hi>Bacx,</hi> did on the first of October depart with their Cauallery forth of the Garrisons of Breda, Berghen, and Gertrudenbergh, beeing in all fourteene Cornets, intending to make an attempt in Haynault, watching a time when the mutineers were gone into Brabant, and the Archduke returned from his campe at Venlo and Thoren.</p>
               <p>Being come to Bilsen within three miles neere to Mastricht, they vnderstood that eight troopes of horse which had beene to conuey the Archduke, were not far from thence: the said troops were bands of institution belonging to the Earles, Mansfelt, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, Bucquoy, Beaurie, and others, with three Cornets of Walons and three of Italians.</p>
               <p>These were in the nightenuironed in two villages where they lay; the gards were set vpon, and part of them slaine, the rest sled, and others were taken prisoners: the Captaines were not there, fiue Cornets were taken, and one was burnt in a Church: they found a good bootie there, videlicet, fiue hundred horse saddles and two hundred prisoners. The Cornets were brought to the Hague, and hung vp in the Hall for a perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance. <hi>Chalon,</hi> bastard to <hi>Renatus</hi> of Chalon of the house of Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau, escaped: This beeing done, our Captaines with their horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men returned to their Garrisons.</p>
               <p>In Nouember following, the vnited Netherland Prouinces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to make a iourney into Luxembourg, vnder conduct of Count <hi>Lodwick Gunther</hi> of Nassau, with 33 Cornets of horse and 1000 foot, vnder the Colonels <hi>Edmonds, Ghistelles, Dommer ville, &amp; Marquette,</hi> there were 200 French, 200 English, 200 Scots, 200 Almans, and 200 Dutch, making vp in all the number of 1000 foot, with three field peices, and 50 wagons, for the munition

foure, one for euerie Colonel, and the rest for the horsemen.</p>
               <p>These, on the third of Nouember, departed from Nieume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen, and went to Keppelen and Bedbourg: the fourth day, they lodged at Niewkerke and Oldkerke neere Wachtendonck: the fift, at Grevenraet in the Duchie of Iuliers: the sixt, at Iuggen, from whence certain troopes went to take in S. Vit: the seuenth, they lodged at Renghen: the eighth, at Zeverwijck: the ninth of Nouember at Blommendaell, where they had intelligence that their men had failed in their attempt vpon S. Vit: the tenth, all the troopes came before S. Vit, and lodged at Meve-dorpe, and the same night approached the Towne, Colonel <hi>Marquet</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding the troopes.</p>
               <p>The eleuenth day, those of S.

               <p>The twelfth, they marched forward, and lodged at Iulligh: the thirteenth, they came before Bastoigne: the 14, they still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there, and Captaine <hi>Marcelis Bacx</hi> was sent to S. Huberts, burning the Countrie all along: the fifteenth, they went from Bastoigne, and lodged at Housnegen or Hardengue: the 16, at Pedro-dorf neere Dechery, where <hi>Dommer vile,</hi> the same night, began his approaches, and the next day, the Burghers compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a reasonable ransome: from whence certaine horse were sent to demaund contributions as far as Luxembourg, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Captaine <hi>Cloet</hi>: The 18, 19, and 20 of Nouember, they remayned at Vitterdorf, Wolset or Walset, and on the one and twentieth marched towards Dopwiell: the 22, at Andanach in Iuliers, the 23, at Gheldorp, &amp; there rested the foure &amp; twentieth day, whither the troopes which had been at S. Vit, viz. 50 horse, and 200 foot came to them.</p>

The Archduke sent forces to stop their iourney, but wanting money they staid by the way, consuming and wasting the countrie as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.

               <head>¶ A description of a fight at Sea betwixt seuen of the States men of war, and six Spanish Gallies, the third and fourth of October Anno <hi>1602.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe States of the vnited Netherland Prouinces did vnder command of the Admerall <hi>Opdam,</hi> send forth certaine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like vessels to serue the Queene of England: foure of them were commaunded to wait for six Gallies which D. <hi>Frederico Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> brought from Spaine to ioyne with the rest that lay at Sluce in Flaunders.</p>
               <p>These were the names of the Gallies vnder <hi>Spinola,</hi> the first the Admerall S. Lewis whose Captaines name was <hi>Cardinalin,</hi> and in her an other Captaine called <hi>Castalis d' Avila</hi> with a companie of souldiers: The second, S. Iohn, in which <hi>Vergas</hi> was Vice-Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and in her two Captaines with companies of souldiers: The third, Padilla, the Captaines name was <hi>Hasso,</hi> and in her an other Captaine with a companie of Portugal souldiers: The fourth, la Lucera, and the Captaines name <hi>Calliado,</hi> with other companies of Portugal souldiers and Captaines: The fift, S. Philip, and in her D. <hi>Rodrigo de Naroys</hi> Captaine of a companie: The sixt, S Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cento, and in her <hi>Lewis de Camours</hi> with an other companie of souldiers, so as there were in all nine ensignes, videlicet, two of Spaniards, and seuen of Portugals, to the number of nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, beside one thousand and fiue hundred slaues, euery Galley caried three brasse peeces and no more. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that the Hollanders were aduertified of the comming of these Gallies, yet the Lord of Opdam was vpon necessity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:14840:180"/>
to goe for victuals into Holland, leauing the vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall <hi>Iohn Adrian Cant</hi> for General in his ship called the moone, accompaned with <hi>Gerbrant Iansz Saell</hi> of Horne in a ship of 4 hundred run called Bansome together with Captaine <hi>Henry Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in the Lionesse of Rotterdam, and <hi>Gerbant Iansz</hi> in the hope of Enchuysen. These were appointed by the Queene to goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West parts, but were staied to meete with these Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; one of the Queenes ships called the Hope vnder the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of Sir <hi>Robert Mansell,</hi> with her Pinnace called the Aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage vnder Captaine <hi>Ionas,</hi> were likewise commaunded to waite for these Gallies. These concluded that the vice-Admerall <hi>Cant</hi> and Captaine <hi>Gerbrant Adriansz Sael</hi> should lie at anchor in the downes, where an other of the Queenes ships lay called the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, vnder Captaine <hi>Breadgate</hi>: Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> and his Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace lay at Sea betwixt Douer and Calaice, and not far from them the other two Hollanders.</p>
               <p>Lying thus in wait, Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> on the third of October about noone, descried the Gallies, and they him; but the ayre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing misty, they sought to creepe along the coast of England, or if the worst should come to passe, perceiuing that the two Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers lay neere them, they entended to boord and take them, for the prisoners confessed afterward, that they did not respect two or three men of war: Yet it seemed that they were afraid of the Queenes ships, for they turned backe hoping in the night to passe on along the coast of Dunkirke or Niewport. Sir <hi>Robert</hi> perceiuing this, sent his Pinnace towards Calaice and the coast of Flaunders, to warne the Hollanders to stand vpon their gard, and to stop the Gallies passage: Hee likewise did his best skill to keep them in sight, the like did the two Hollanders, who were nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer betwixt him and the Gallies; and thus they gaue them chase till sun set: Then did the Gallies set saile againe, so as the two Hollanders were behinde them. Sir <hi>Robert Mansell</hi> obseruing their course, and assured that they would fall into the hands of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two Hollanders, and the Queenes ships, which lay in the downes, hee shaped his course towards the coasts of France, that hee might get before them ere they should recouer Flaunders, still bending his course towards the Sands called Goeyingen to meet with them there. The Queens ship, and the two Hollanders <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Sael</hi> hauing discried the Gallies, made vp towards them, and
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:14840:180"/>
fiercely began to shoot: but the weather being calme, the gallies out-stript the ships; but within a while after, a strong gale blew from the North-East, and then the Hollanders with full saile gaue them chace two or three houres long. The gallies were come so neere Douer rockes, as diuers Turkish slaues found meanes to breake their chaines, and leaping into the Sea, escaped by swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and so freed themselues from their bondage. Sir <hi>Robert Mansel,</hi> being neere to Goeyingen, espied a gallie making away a pace, and comming within musket shot of her, he discharged thirtie piece of ordnance vpon it, whose Masts he brake in pieces, and heard a lamentable crie in her: This done, he saw the other fiue gallies comming vp towards him, on whom he made many shot, and suffered them to passe on, thinking it rashnesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion to suffer himselfe to be boorded with so many gallies at once. The foure Hollanders followed them faire and softly, and being come neere Graveling about tenne of the clocke at night, <hi>Gerbrant Iansz-Sael</hi> of Horne, with his ship of foure hundred tunne, encountred one of the gallies called la Lucera which with full faile he boorded on the larboord side, so as the poore slaues were in water vp to the middle, crying out for mercie, not making any resistance: then the said <hi>Sael</hi> discharged two demie canon, carrying bullets of foureteen pound weight, with which he flew and hurt many. A French Pilot being in the gallie, whose name was <hi>Iohn Evout,</hi> borne at Niew-Hauen, did, vnseene, get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boord the Hollander, and so saued his owne life. In this incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the gallie lost her sailes and oares, and had her Helme broken in pieces, whereby she became vnseruiceable. Captaine <hi>Sael</hi> vsed all meanes to cleere himselfe from her, fearing to be ouer prest with the multitudes that were in her, and in the end came cleerely off, hauing lost some of his saile. Then did Captaine <hi>Hartmans</hi> ship boord the said gallie the second time, thinking that he was the first, and saued some fortie of the men, and then fell off. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, Captaine <hi>Sael</hi> boorded her againe, sending fiue of his men aboord, but perceiuing, by the lamentable cries of those that were in her, that she sanke, he tooke in his owne men, and for feare of farther daunger would saue no more of them, this was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout midnight, and they continued neere the gallie, till they could no longer see her mast aboue water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn Adriansz Cant</hi> the Vice-Admeral, did likewise encounter
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:14840:181"/>
the Gallie called Padilla, which he ouerran and drowned, and did great hurt to an other.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Gertsz Everts,</hi> and <hi>Iacob Peters Niele,</hi> with other ships that kept gard, hearing the report of the Canon, made vp towards them likewise, and boorded this Gallie and the rest: but fearing to bee endangered by them, they onely saued some few, to the number of two hundred and no more. The rest of the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies beeing neere the shoare, made no resistance but sought all meanes to escape. The Admerall ran on ground neere to the land of Schouwe, beeing pursued by a ship beyond West Cappell, which gaue her ouer thinking it would perrish by foule weather. But Generall <hi>Spinola</hi> that was in her, behaued himselfe so coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geously, flinging many things ouerboord, and promising free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the slaues, as at last hee arriued with his Gallie at Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerke, an other came safely to Calice, whose men ran away: two others that were fore brused by the canon ran on ground on the coasts of Flaunders and there perished: Those two which were encountred by the Admerall <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Sael</hi> perished. <hi>Cant</hi> made relation of what hee had done in Holland: <hi>Gerbrant Sael</hi> of Enchuysen and <hi>Hartman</hi> did theirs in Zeland to Lord <hi>Iaques Maldre</hi> who examined the French Pilot and others, sending them into Holland, where honour was alreadie done to the Captaine that first brought the newes. The English Captaines likewise were much discontented, for that they had no share in the honor, saying they were the first that had discouered, and endaungered the Gallies, chasing and bringing them vp to the Hollanders. Of these eight gallies belonging to <hi>Spinola,</hi> wherewith hee thought to haue tormented these Countries, two of them were burnt in Portugall, two were drowned, and foure ran on ground: Herein wee may consider Gods iudgements, for these Gallies were the selfe same, to which diuers mariners of the low Countries had beene condemned. There is one thing among others worthie to be noted, how that in Captaine <hi>Saels</hi> ship who first boorded the Gallie called Lucera, the French Pilot saued himselfe, who was a verie honest man, and had beene three yeares a slaue in that Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and others, in great miserie and wretchednesse, comming with his ship into Spaine, which together with his goods were confiscate, and himselfe and men put into the Gallies, and shauen like Turkish slaues. This Pilot had here experience of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:14840:181"/>
for all the miserie he had endured, seeing the gallie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee had beene a slaue, to sinke, and Captaine <hi>Callido</hi> who had tirannized ouer him, to haue both his leggs shot off, of which hurt hee died in Captaine <hi>Hartmans</hi> ship. This Pilot was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per man, tall, and strong, and could not bee set at libertie for any ransome, till the accord made with the Admerall of Arragon, to exchange prisoners on each side, at which time hee was freed in companie of others. D. <hi>Frederico Spinola</hi> saued the greatest part of his treasure, which was thought to amount to two hundred thousand Ducats, which hee presently caused to bee coined at Antuerp with the Archdukes stamp, and with it, paid the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his souldiers.</p>

               </head>
               <p>Don <hi>Frederick Spinola,</hi> Generall of the gallies hauing vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to chase away the States men of war which garded the mouth of the Sluce, came forth with eight gallies, on the sixt and twentieth of May in the morning by day breake, anno 1603, the wind beeing West, and sailed Eastward betwixt the sand shelues, called Pol Francis and the firme land, and from thence Westward of the said mouth. Certaine of the States men of war did vsually keepe gard thereabouts, viz. the vice-Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of Zeland <hi>Ioost le More,</hi> who commaunded vnder the Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall the Lord of Holtain, with his ship called the golden Lion, and Captaine <hi>Logier Pieterzs,</hi> with his his ship named the Sea Dogge; there was likewise the black gallie of Holland commaunded by <hi>Iacob Machielz,</hi> together with the gallie of Zeland, called the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, commaunded by <hi>Cornellis Ians</hi> of Gordum. A little further off vnder the wind, lay an other ship, whose master was <hi>Crijn Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> of Ziriczee called the old Sea Dogge, commaunding as Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine. In the vice-Admeralls ship, and Gallie of Zeland, and in either of them were 18 English musketeers of Flushing, but in the 2 other ships &amp; black gallie of Holland were no musketeers, but only their ordinary men. <hi>Spinola</hi> in his 8 gallies and other Fregats,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:14840:182"/>
besides his ordinarie men, had great numbers of musketeers, sent from the camp before Ostend.</p>
               <p>These ships of Zeland with the two Gallies, perceiuing that <hi>Spinola</hi> came forth, did presently set saile, bearing vp against the wind towards the West: <hi>Spinolas</hi> men had a Westerlie wind, and the sun for aduantage, and passed on to the Northward athwart the Zelanders, comming to Wieling, where by fiue a clocke in the morning both sides diuide themselues, and so the Gallies in good order, and with great cries approached the Zealanders: two Gallies, in one of which <hi>Spinola</hi> was, boorded the vice-Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Ioost le More</hi>; foure other Gallies did the like to Captaine <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier Peters,</hi> and the Gallie of Holland was set vpon by the rest of the Gallies: Hauing thus for a while fought with their ordnance, two of the foure Gallies which had boorded Captaine <hi>Logier</hi> did likewise set vpon the Gallie of Zeland; then the other two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooke <hi>Legiers</hi> ship, and fought with the Gallie of Holland: one of these two last forsooke the black Gallie, and came to the res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kew of the two others, which boorded the vice-Admerall <hi>Ioost le More,</hi> percing one an other with canon shot.</p>
               <p>The other ship wherein was <hi>Crijn Henrick</hi> could not come vp to fight through want of wind, but did her best in shoting at the Gallies, which boorded the Vice-Admerall and the blacke gallie. This fight of gallies continued a long time against ships not accustomed to such fight; there beeing eight gallies and foure fregats of the enemies, against two ships and two gallies of ours. Yet <hi>Spinolas</hi> gallies fearing that the Zelanders might bee secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and themselues hauing receiued much losse in their men, slaues, and oares, disparing of the victorie, did in great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der retreat to the Sluce mouth: Among their slaine men was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Spinola</hi> hauing receiued many wounds: hee was of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie of <hi>Spinola</hi> in Genoa, a man of great reach and meanes: There were slain in this fight eight hundred musketeers, souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, mariners, and slaues, and manie were wounded: yet the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine number could not be knowne.</p>
               <p>Of the Zelanders thirtie six were slain, and 60 hurt, their ships and gallies beeing of better proofe than the enemies. Among the dead, was Captaine <hi>Iacob Michiels</hi> of the black Gallie and his Lieutenaunt: of the thirtie and sixe English musketeers, eight were slaine and sixeteene hurt: among the wounded was the
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:14840:182"/>
Vice-Admerall <hi>Ioost le More</hi> hauing receiued three daungerous wounds, the like besell Captaine <hi>Legier Peters,</hi> but both of them were afterwards healed.</p>
               <p>During the fight, the report of the Canon was heard to Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing: the Admerall of Zeland, the Lord of Haultain, presently mand foure men of war and a Fregat, making all possible hast to the Sluce mouth, but the Spanish Gallies, ere they could arriue, were gotten in: Whereupon, our men gaue publike thanks to God, attributing all praise to him: For without all question, this was a valiant act, with so few vessels and men to beat eight Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and foure Fregats so well manned and prouided: The Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers in memorie hereof, stamped siluer and brasse coine, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on the one side two ships and two Gallies, with this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spription: <hi>Laedunt triremes nauibus</hi> 1603: and on the other side, the Spanish Gallies, with this circumscription, <hi>victae perempto Spinola</hi> 16 Maij.

               <head>¶ The taking of Cadsand and Ysendike, with the siege and yeelding vp of Sluce, in anno <hi>1604.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AT the beginning of the yeare 1604, the States of the vnited Prouinces resolued to seeke out the enemie in his owne Countrie, and to enter Flaunders, hoping to raise the siege of Ostend: Hereupon, they commanded all Captaines to make their companies compleat, giuing forth new commissions to leuy 1500 Suisses, and 2000 other footmen.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie of Nassau, espying a fit time and occasion, sent commaundment to all his forces to meet him at Willem-Stat, on the twentieth of Aprill with such number of boats as should bee needfull for such an attempt: Thither came Count <hi>William,</hi> Count <hi>Ernest Cazimir,</hi> and Count <hi>Lodwick Gunther,</hi> brethren, of the house of Nassau, together with Count <hi>Henry Frederick,</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the horse.</p>
               <p>The troopes beeing shipt, departed on the day appointed
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:14840:183"/>
from Willem-State towards Zeland, whither, on the foure and twentieth of Aprill, his Excellencie likewise went, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Prince of Anhalt, Count <hi>Adolph</hi> of Nassau, together with the Commissioner of the generall States, and Councell of State, who were there present to farther the enterprise.</p>
               <p>The fiue and twentieth of Aprill, in the Morning, the whole fleet, consisting of infinit numbers of boats, sailed from Zeland to Flaunders, where at the passage or entrie called Het Swarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, they landed in Cadsand, where, in two daies, they tooke all the Forts. And if at their first arriuall they had entred the Sluce mouth, they might with little labour haue taken the Towne, and peraduenture by such speed, raised the siege of Ostend; for at their landing, those of Bruges had no forces in their Towne, but whilest his Excellencie landed his men, and was busied in taking in the small forts of Cadsand, those of Bruges made such hast, as <hi>Spinola,</hi> from the campe before Ostend, sent one thousand foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to a place called Swint, and from Watervliet sent <hi>Triuulcio</hi> with fiue hundred horse, to stop the passage at the Sluce mouth, notwithstanding that on the sixe and twentieth and seuen and twentieth dayes, we vsed a meanes to passe on, chasing the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies towards Sluce. So as his Excellencie beeing out of hope to passe, and determining onely to assure the Countrie of Cadsand, a Boore told him, that by fetching a compasse towards the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of the Sluce, he might enter Flaunders, and shewed him, the same night, a fit place to goe to Oostburch, but there he met with the enemies horse and foot troopes, which made him thinke that there was some passage: whereupon, on the 29 day, he sent cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bands thither, which skirmished with the enemies, putting them to rout, who in the flight shewed our men the way to passe; and on the thirtieth day, in the Morning, his Excellencie went thither, and crossing the water, took a piece of the causie neere to Coxie, where certaine men of Sluce, who meant to haue made a fort there, were beaten, &amp; some 30 of them taken prisoners, &amp; the rest put to flight: those of the fort of Coxie did likewise yeeld on co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>position, opening by this means, contrarie to our expectation, away to enter into Flaunders, putting vs in hope of good successe, notwithstanding that the Countrie round about was much bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Prince <hi>Maurice,</hi> on May day, marched with a great part of his armie to Saint Catherins Fort, and sent for ordnaunce to
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:14840:183"/>
batter it: but because there was a spring tide that day, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were verie high, it was afternoon ere the Canon was brought, so as all that day hee remained in battaile neere the fort. In Saint Catherines fort, beside certaine souldiers commaunded by Count <hi>Trivulcio,</hi> were many burghers and boores surnamed Keurlingen; these are voluntarie mercenaries leuyed about Gaunt: who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no quarter nor promise to be ransomed, if they were taken, his Excellencie (to terrifie them) commanded that none of them should bee taken prisoners, but all slaine, and though this did daunt many of them, yet they held out that day: and one of their Ensigne bearers did passe too and fro on the Rampiers, erecting his Ensigne on the breach, to the great encouragement of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes: who were likewise hartened for that Count <hi>Trivulcio</hi> who had been at Watervliet with certaine troopes of horse, came and encamped with them below the fort, where he entrenched him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and planted two field peeces to play vpon his Excellencies troops. But his Excellencie hauing the same after noone receiued nine peece of ordnance, hee plaied six houres long vpon the said fort, and on <hi>Trivulcio</hi> his troops, more to shew he had ordnance, than for any hope hee had to winne the fort, because the enemie grew wilfull and obstinate, making shew of defence: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dispairing to doe any good there, hee comaunded his Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to shoot till the euening, and then to remoue the ordnance, and carie it backe againe to Cad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>By the way, one of the canons by chaunce sanke into a bogge: whereupon the mariners and those that had charge of it, did, with great noice and stir, their best to recouer it, vnwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue such a disgrace as to loose a piece of ordnance. Those of S. Catherines fort were amazed, thinking that they went about to plant their ordnance some where else; and likewise the horse finding no fitter way to returne, than vnder the forts trenches, made those within it to beleeue that his Excellencie had receiued more men, with them to intercept their way to Philips skonce: whereupon, <hi>Trivulcio</hi> with his troopes and those Keurlingen or Boores, who were many, did all of them in amazement retire to Philips skonce, and from thence to Isendike, abandoning S. Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines fort, and by the way left some sixtie souldiers in Philips fort, who the next day perceiuing the approach of his Excellencies troopes, yeelded it vp on the second of May.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="362" facs="tcp:14840:184"/>From thence his Excellencie went to Isendike, which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently inclosed, whereinto, the enemie on the fourth of May thought to haue put forces, but certaine troopes of horse and foot beeing sent to stop their passage, they fled to the s' Tas, whereby the said place was the better fortified.</p>
               <p>The 6 of May, those of Sluce came with forces from the camp before Ostend, and made a sallie with two thousand men, with certain shallops and Gallies, where with to enter into the Countrie of Cadsand, where they landed six hundred men, ere those that garded the Island perceiued it, who presently gaue an alarme, and with two Scottish companies that lay in gard there, fel vpon them, and draue them in disorder to their boats, some of which, being ouer-loden, sunke, diuers of them were slaine, and fortie were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken prisoners, and eight shallops were taken from them: If this enterprise of theirs had prospered, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> had in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant lost all his boats and munition, and his attempt would haue beene to no purpose.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie in the meane time caused the fort of Isendike to bee summoned, which is a verie commodious place and well seated, but they within it answered that they would not yeeld, because they expected supplies: whereupon, his Excellencie cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it to bee battered, knowing well enough that they wanted all prouisions, especially, drinke and fresh water.</p>
               <p>The ninth of May, Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> sent his Trumpet to sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them the second time, who was shot into the head by some in the fort: this did so incense his Excellencie, as hee did his best to reuenge himselfe on those that had shewed so bad an example: whereupon, they were so daunted, as they presently craued par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, which his Excellencie would not grant, till an Italian souldier that had slaine his Trumpet was deliuered vnto him: which done, those of the fort capitulated; that the Gouernour and souldiers should depart with their armes, but without found of Drum or displaied Ensignes, to the s'Tas, with boats to carrie their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, on condition not to serue in Flaunders against his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie for the space of foure moneths: and so on the tenth of May sixe hundred of them went thence, most of whom were Italians. The Gouernour was afterwards called in question for deliuering it vp, but did with honour acquit himselfe; and Captaine <hi>Rolle,</hi> was made Gouernour of the fort. After the taking of Isendike
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:14840:184"/>
they resolued to passe on towards Ardenbourg, and on the 12 of May, his Excellencie went thither by land and water. In the towne were sixe companies of Almans, who might easily haue defended it, if they could haue made neuer so little resistance; but being amazed, they fled thence, so as his Excellencie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any stroke at all tooke it: this towne was verie desolate, but excellently well seated to bridle the Sluce. Of the goodly Church that was in it in former time, nothing was to bee seene, but the walls, certaine Marble Pillars, and two Towers. His Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie did forthwith put Count <hi>Ernest</hi> and his men into the towne, and commaunded one rauelin to be made before euerie gate, and then caused the armie to march to another open &amp; ruinous town, called Middelbourg in Flaunders, where there is a Castle from whence those that keepe it fled, because it was not tenable. His Excellencie, on the foureteenth, sent his Cauallerie to make a road towards Eclo, to defeat a foot regiment which was going from Gaunt to Bruges, but they came a little too late.</p>
               <p>The sixteenth of May, his Excellencie sent certaine horse and foot from Ardenbourg towards the Soute and Soete, which are two channels, the one of salt water, the other of fresh, comming from Dam and Bruges, and meet together neere Sluce, they are both nauiga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The seuenteenth of May, his Excellencies souldiers went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Soute, where the Spaniards lay with thirteene or foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene ensignes betwixt that place and the Soete, where they were intr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:14840:185"/>
ouer his horse and foot at a low water, and tooke some of their trenches: whereupon, the Spaniards forsaking their aduantage, fled towards Dam, fearing to bee inclosed: so as Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> made an other bridge ouer the Soete, and sent his horse on the West side of the hauen of Sluce, where the Spaniards forsooke all their forts (that of S. <hi>George</hi> except) seated at the mouth of the Hauen, commaunded by a Captaine called <hi>Cordua</hi> of Burges, his Excellencie presently enuironed it, and so soone as they within it saw the canon, they yeelded, and went thence on the three and twentieth of May beeing in all one hundred and thirtie men. The fort was well prouided, and had in it nine peece of ordnance, and ten barrels of powder, to which they had tied a burning match, which, after their departure would haue fired it, but this beeing discouered, no harme ensued thereof.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Cordua</hi> was accused for yeelding vp the fort so slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; but hee had fauour shewen him: Captaine <hi>Ioost de Brucxsaulx</hi> was made gouernor there, but within a while after, the fort being found to be vnnecessarie, was raced.</p>
               <p>All these townes and forts thus surrendred, his Excellencie encamped before Sluce: hee caused the hauen to bee taken in, and fortified, and enclosed his campe with trenches and bridges, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the quarters to one an other.

               <p>Those of Sluce did twice receiue certain numbers of men, first, some seuen hundred, next eight hundred: they likewise tooke in certaine wagons laden with meale, ere the towne could be who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enclosed.

               <p>His Excellencie, on the one and twentieth of May, caused a proclamation to bee made by sound of drum that wednesday, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole campe, should be kept as a day of fasting and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is a rare matter in an armie, prohibiting all victualers on paine of forfeiting their goods, and banishment from the campe, from selling any victuals that day that they might bee the apter to pray vnto God to giue them good successe.</p>
               <p>The thirtieth of May, those of Sluce attempted againe to take victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als

and powder into the towne, and in the night sent forth one thousand gallie slaues ouer the drowned land, whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to this peece of seruice, in regard they could not vse their gallies, and with these slaues a conuoy of fiue hundred souldiers, to expect that which was to come from Dam: for Count <hi>Barlaymont</hi> with 4 thousand foot, and manie wagons laden with meale was come for this purpose as far as the drowned lands. His Excellencie hauing intelligence hereof, went with two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foot, and store of horse to Stampers point, where hee found foure hundred men which <hi>Barlaymont</hi> had left to gard that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssage: these did the Prince defeate and put to rout, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by them that <hi>Barlaymont</hi> was alreadie past, hee caused him to bee pursued, but hee hauing notice thereof, went an other way, by which most of them escaped, leauing certaine wagons laden with corne behind them, which his Excellencie tooke. Those of the towne perceiuing that the Conuoy came not, returned home, many slaues excepted, who hid themselues, and came and yeelded to Prince <hi>Maurice.</hi> His Excellencies troopes in pursuing <hi>Barlaymont,</hi> did in the night by mischance take a contrarie way, and the next day returned to the Campe with many prisoners, and among them two Captaines, the one an Italian, and the other a German. By these his Excellencie vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the towne was well manned, but badly victualed, and therefore sought to enclose it on euery side, causing his Campe to bee strongly fenced and entrenched both by land and water, sending his Cauallerie farre vp into the Countrie to bring in contribution. The Campe being thus enclosed, the deputies of the Generall States, and Councell of State, tooke their leaue on the 29 of May, and returned to the Hague.</p>
               <p>This siege continuing for a time, Prince Maurice in the meane space made ready boats and preparatiues to assault the towne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart the Hauen, and to this end caused a strange bridge to bee made, couered ouer in the middest, and of musket proofe: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding daily by those that came to our side, that the Towne was mightily opprest with hunger, he wholy resolued to famish it, and thereby gaue the Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> an occasion to quite O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stend, and come to releeue Sluce, and his Gallies Famin did day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so encrease in the towne, as they could no longer feed the slaues, but enforced them to run vp &amp; down the broken country,

to seeke an herbe called Soutenell, which growes there in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, wherewith for a long time they nourished themselues: so as many of them a long while ere the towne was yeelded, knew not what bread meant.</p>
               <p>Famine encreasing, and Ostend still holding out, those of Sluce manifested their want by fires in the night, which beeing known to the Archduke, hee commaunded Generall <hi>Spinola</hi> to releeue Sluce: who to this purpose, toward the later end of Iulie, leuied forces from all parts, and now perceiued their error in suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Excellencie to passe ouer so easily. Generall <hi>Spinola</hi> together with Count <hi>Trivulcio</hi> departed from before Ostend with a sufficient Armie, leauing the Campe well prouided of all things: yet hee went verie vnwillingly, and with small hope to doe any good, as appeared by his letters which were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And so came and encamped neere to Lapschuer on a cawsey, meaning with his ordnance to enforce his Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to dislodge, who caused counterbatteries to bee made, so as in one night the canon slew many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> on the sixt of August, with three thousand men, and certaine horse assailed Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassaus quarter, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to surprise it in the night, carying with him diuers necessary preparations for that purpose, but all was in vaine, for he was so roughly entertained, as with great losse he was enforced to retire, leauing his preparations behind him, carying certaine wagoners horse away with him, which were feeding in the pastures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> doing no good there, departed speedily on the six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of August in view of Ardenbourgh to the forts of S. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therin, and S. Philip, which hee easily tooke by force, because they were weakely manned. From thence hee went on a cawsey, to Captaine <hi>Imbyse</hi> his quarter, where hee made a false alarme, that hee might in the meane time passe his troopes ouer the riuer of Oostbourgh: But his Excellencie had kept store of men in Cadsand, vnder conduct of Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassau, who did presently set forward to make head against the enemie, hee likewise sent the Lord of Simton thither with store of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like munition, and himselfe remained at the passage of Cadsand, till the troopes of Frizland, the English, French, and others were arriued, with which he marched on to encounter the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="367" facs="tcp:14840:186"/>The Marquis making hast with his forces, had caused his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies men to quit the halfe moone neere the water, betwixt Cadsand and Oostbourg, and made them giue backe as far as the cawsey neere to the two skonces, where hee was fiercely repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, first by the gard, and next by Count <hi>William</hi> who was come thither; but at a low water, hee striued most of all to passe ouer, so as Count <hi>William</hi> could hardly stop him, till such time as Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell <hi>Dorth</hi> came to second him, who brauely defended himselfe with a two-hand sword, beating backe the enemie for a pretie while, till himselfe was wounded in two places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> in the meane time spared not his men, and was readie to haue entred Cadsand, had not Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> come to his res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kew with certaine Frizland companies, vnder conduct of <hi>Iulius D' Essinga</hi> their Lieutenaunt generall, and with him the Lord of Termes, and some fortie French gentlemen, with diuers English and French companies vnder <hi>Castillions</hi> commaund, who made such resistance, as <hi>Spinolas</hi> men were enforced to retire, some two hundred of them beeing slaine, and of them, many men of note: among others, were, Count <hi>Feltri,</hi> the Marquis of Renty, sonne to Count <hi>Solre</hi> his wife, of the house of <hi>Lalayn,</hi> sonne to that renowned Lord, the Lord of Montigni, and the Marquis of Renty newly come from Italy, D. <hi>Alonso Borgia,</hi> young <hi>Mantenon</hi> a French man, beside a Colonell, and many others slaine and wounded, whom they carried away in carts: this was done on the seuenteenth of August, the enemie beeing reenforced with the squadron of the mutineers, who were newly reconciled to the Archduke, and did helpe to encrease the number of the dead.</p>
               <p>The eighteenth of August, those of Sluce hauing intelligence of the defeate of their supplies, began to talke of an accord, and sent to craue cessation of armes, till they might know the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes pleasure, which was not graunted: then they craued leaue to carrie away the gallies, ordnance, and slaues: but they receiued this answer, that they should haue three daies respite, the first day, to depart with their armes and baggage, the second day, only with heir swords, and if they tarried till the third day they were then to expect all rigor: whereupon, the next day, they were content to depart on these conditions following.</p>

               <p>The twentieth of August, the Spaniards left Sluce, beeing in number three or foure thousand men well armed, and one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand foure hundred slaues, most of them Turkes, who were all set at libertie: some of them tarried with the Spaniards, many went into Fraunce and England, but such as returned from thence into Holland, were for the most part sent home in a Ship of Barbarie; many of them had eaten no bread in Sluce of a

long time, but fed on old shooes, boots, parchment, and on an herbe called Soutenell, whereof wee haue heretofore spoken; dogs, cats, mise, and rats were good meat.</p>
               <p>There were found in the towne threescore and ten great peece of ordnance both of brasse and iron, beside those in the forts: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so ten or eleuen gallies, and all their furniture, which was no smal victorie.</p>
               <p>The Generall States and his Excellencie made Count <hi>Henry</hi> of Nassau youngest sonne to the Prince of Orange of happie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie, Gouernour of all their conquests in Flaunders, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Lord <hi>Vander Noot</hi> for his Lieutenant, who went and remained in Sluce.</p>
               <p>The said States did presently giue order, for the fortifying of their new conquests, as well at Sluce, as at other places neere adioyning, some were rased, and other fortified: they resolued to make nine forts neere to Coxie, S.

At I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sendike they likewise caused fiue great bulwarks to be made, and there enclosed a great quantitie of ground, which they meant to make impregnable, and as big as a towne, or an other Ostend.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HIs Excellencie on the three and twentieth of May 1605, went with great numbers of horse and foot to Berghen-op-Zoom, and appointed Count <hi>Ernest</hi> of Nassau to come from Zeland by boat, with fourescore foot companies, and to saile vp the Scheld, that both of them together might make an attempt vpon Antuerp; but the Earle hauing a continuall contrarie wind could not land there where his Excellencie had appointed him. If the Earle could haue landed his men at Clapperdijke, he might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily haue obtained his desire, but the wind was so contrarie as it was impossible for him to doe so: but hee was enforced to land them neere to Oosterweel, and so went forward towards his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie by land, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This enterprise hauing no good successe, his Excellencie resolued to goe with his armie and besiege the Castle of Woud, and thereupon departed on the eight and twentieth of May from Eeckeren. Woud Castle is strongly fortified with Bulwarks and seated within a mile of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen-op-Zoom in a fenny place, and therefore naturally strong. It is one of the chiefest Castles belonging to the Marquis of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen; but at that time a nest of theeues: for the garrison did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually molest boats that went from Holland and Zeland, being alwaies vpon the water to espie if any vessell were wind-bound or be-calmed: They had their shallops hidden in diuers places on the waters side, with which they assailed such vessels, taking the merchants and mariners prisoners, enforcing them to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some themselues and boats, thereby doing great damage to the Countrie. His Excellencie on the eighteenth of May, did with wonderful celeritie plant his canon, and battered the Castle; those within it slew certaine of our gunners, but fearing to be surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and doubting that the Archduke would not send forth an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to releeue them, they yeelded the Castle vp to his Excellencie
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:14840:188"/>
on the three and twentieth of May, wherein were eightie fiue men, among whom were certaine raskals of the number of those that sold the towne of Gertrudenberg to the enemie, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proscription were all condemned to be hanged, but the Marquis of Brudenbourg interceded for them: <hi>Spinola</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise did execute some of those that had deliuered vp the Castle: and by this meanes those of Holland &amp; Zeland were freed from this mischiefe.</p>
               <p>Marquis <hi>Spinola,</hi> in the mean time, had assembled all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces neere Antuerpe, and was quartered at Mercxen and Dam, his horsemen lay at Berchen and Wilrijcke, by which meanes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerpe was well garded: Hee likewise made a bridge ouer the Scheld, euen from the Key of Antuerpe into Flanders, on which he might passe ouer his forces from Brabant and Flanders at one time if need were.</p>
               <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> hauing woon Woud Castle, did, on the second of Iulie, imbarke his armie, and crossed the Scheld to goe to Isen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dike in Flanders, leauing the forts vpon the riuer well prouided, especially Lillo: it seemed that he meant to besiege the s'Tas, or else the towne of Bruges, and maintaine war in the enemie coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but his Excellencie could not attempt any siege, being stil fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by Generall <hi>Spinola,</hi> by meanes of his bridge before An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerpe. This did the Prince before then foresee would come to passe, being of a contrarie opinion to the generall States; for it was thought more profitable for them to haue gone towards Rhyne: whereupon, his Excellencie, the better to secure the Towne of Sluce, Isendike, Ardenbourg, and other forts, encam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at Watervliet, because it was reported that the Archduke, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Spinola,</hi> would besiege Sluce, and with a second ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie which they expected, the towne of Bercke, and would haue besides, a running campe, to bring victuals from all parts, yet all this was but words.</p>
               <p>His Excellencie strongly fortified himselfe at Watervliet: <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi> with his forces encamped in a wooddie place, so that the two armies could not well come at one another by reason of bankes, but fortified against each other still seeking some aduantage, and yet did no great matter.</p>

               <p>THe king of Spaine hauing set forth a mightie fleet, of sundry great gallions and other warlike ships, wel manned and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, thereby, as much as in them lay, to annoy the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the vnited Prouinces, my Lords the generall States, the better to daunt the Spannish pride, and especially to free their subjects from their cruell tyrannie, did likewise set forth a fleet of 31 ships, viz. seuen and twentie men of war, and foure victua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Then they entreated Master <hi>Iacob Heemskerck</hi> of Amsterdam, (a man whose experience, wisdome, courage, loue, and loyaltie to his Countrie, was well knowne to the world) to be Admerall of the said fleet. In anno 1604, hee had been the second time Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall of the East Indie fleet, where hee had made proofe what he was able to do; for meeting with a great Portugall Carack which came from China neere to the streit of Syncapura, richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and well prouided, hauing eight hundred men in her, though in comparison of her, hee was but weake, hauing in all but two small ships, and in them no more but two hundred men. Yet by his wise conduct and inuincible courage, hee did in a short time take her, and brought her home to Amsterdam with all her trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Moreouer, that voiage is worthie of perpetuall remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which was made in anno 1596, and 97. when the ships of Amsterdam went so far to the Northward, and Noua Semla, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any till then had done, seeking a passage through the ice, to the rich kingdomes of Cathay and China; where he likewise was as Committee generall, and shewed no smal desire to do good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to his countrie.</p>
               <p>The Lords States hauing motioned this matter vnto him, his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere was, That if hee might doe any profitable seruice to his countrie, he was verie readie and willing to doe it, and so, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

the charge, not for any hire, but for loue and affection to his countrie.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth of March in anno 1607, he departed from Tas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell with sixteene men of war, verie well prouided and rigd, of which, ten were of Amsterdam, videlicet, the Admerall called Eolus with her captaine <hi>William Verhoof</hi> of Amsterdam: the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the black Beare, and her captaine <hi>Adrian Roest</hi> of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: the third, the white Beare, whose captaine was <hi>Cornellis Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Madder,</hi> otherwise called <hi>Den Noyen Boore,</hi> or the faire contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: the next the golden Lyon with her captain <hi>Pan</hi> of Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam: the Griffon and her captaine <hi>Cleynsorgh</hi> of Tergou: the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Star commaunded by captaine <hi>Iacob Iansz</hi> of Edam: <hi>Henry Iansz,</hi> otherwise called long <hi>Henry,</hi> was captaine of the seuenth: of the eight, <hi>Simon Iansz</hi> of Edam: the ninth, by captaine <hi>Copdray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>: the tenth, by captaine <hi>Herman</hi>: Beside these, there were foure others, which carried victuals for the fleet, together with some souldiers.</p>
               <p>From Euchuysen there were three: from Hoorn as many: and from Harling came the Pinnace of Frizland commanded by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Theunes Wouters,</hi> making vp in all three and twentie ships. The seuen and twentieth day, they came to Wight an Island on the coasts of England, where they found three ships more of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and 5 of Rotterdam, with captaine <hi>Cleuter</hi> on an other Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine of Amsterdam.</p>
               <p>From Zeland came captaine <hi>Lawrence Iacobs Alteras</hi> the vice-Admerall, in a ship called the red Lion, of Zeland: captaine <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus Hellart</hi> of Flushing in a ship called the Sea Dog, and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Cornellis Faes</hi> in an other.

               <p>From Rotterdam came captain <hi>Lambert Henry</hi> the rere Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, or night Scowte in a ship called the Tigre. <hi>Harpart Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy</hi> was captaine of the Leopard: and in the other two cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Sieuert,</hi> and captaine <hi>Schreuell</hi> commaunded: so as in the whole fleet were twentie and seuen men of warre, and foure victualers.</p>

               <p>At floud the Admerall began to float and come off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed by the other ships, and two dayes after arriued in the Hauen of Plimmouth, where he would not stay, but shot off a warning piece to cause the rest to follow him, which was done. The whole fleet being together, they went with a Westerlie wind towards the coasts of Portugal and Spaine, so as on the tenth of Aprill, they came to the height of nine and thirtie degrees, neere to the riuer of Lisbone. The Admerall assembled his Councell of warre, nad concluded to carrie the whole fleet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Riuer, to take and destroy all the Caracks and gallions that lay there.</p>
               <p>But the Admerall hauing true intelligence by certaine spies whom he had sent before, with a small English ship towards Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, that most of the Caracks were alreadie gone from thence, and those that were there, to the number of eight or nine, not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and all their ordnance on shore: vnderstanding likewise, by certaine French and English which came from S. Lucars &amp; Cales, that 16 gallions were alreadie gone thence for the West-Indies, and that ten of them were yet in the streit of Gybraltar with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other men of war, waiting for the low-countrieships which were to comeforth of the streit (for they knew that many of them were readie to come:) therupon, the Admerall changed his former determination, meaning to seeke out the said fleet in the streit, and to that end bent his course to Seaward, to get the height of Cape S. Vincent; whither beeing come, hee met with a ship of Flushing, which, on the 22 day, came forth of the streit: the master, told the Admeral, that in the night he had bin among the Spanish fleet, but was cleared from it in the Morning, which (as he thought) directed it course towards Cales, for by a Wester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wind, they were constrained to come forth of the streit.</p>
               <p>The Admerall receiuing this intelligence, held on his course, and on the 24 of Aprill, sayled neere the riuer of S.
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:14840:190"/>
Lucars and bay of Cales, but they could haere no newes of any ships: for the Admerall was resolued to fight with them, though they had beene in the riuer of S. Lucars or bay of Cales: The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening of the same day, he receiued certaine newes of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish fleet by a French man, who the same day came from the roade of Gibraltar, who certified the Admerall of the fleets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, and of their number and order.</p>
               <p>The same Euening, because the wind was Easterly, hee bent his course to the the Southward towards the coasts of Barbarie, and from thence hee turned towards the coasts of Spaine. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Streit, the Admerall called his Captains aboord, and acquainted the Councel of war with that which the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had told him, giuing order for all things necessarie, and at last, couragiously resolued to assaile and destroy the Spanish fleet, and thereupon, gaue this direction, that himselfe with Captaine <hi>Moye Lambert</hi> would boord the Spanish Admerall: the vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall <hi>Alteras</hi> and Captaine <hi>Bras</hi> were appointed to boord the vice-Admerall, and so the other ships, two together, should set vpon the other gallions.</p>
               <p>The two Brigantines with the Barke, were commaunded to passe vp and downe thorow the fleet, that if any gallions or ships would attempt to escape, they should stop their passage and fight with them, but the victuallers were to keepe a loofe off, and not to come neere the fight.</p>
               <p>This done, hee exhorted all the Captaines to beare themselues valiantly, &amp; to purchase honor, telling them that himselfe would be the first should lead them the way: whereupon, they all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and swore to follow him, though it should cost them their liues, and then euery man returned to his ship.</p>
               <p>About noone, they descried the enemie in the bay before the towne of Gibraltar, lying in the roade vnder couert of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle and townes ordnance, to the number of two and twentie ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, videlicet, nine great and mightie gallions, and foure men of warre, beside a great ship of Lubeck of foure hundred tunne, called the spotted Cow that lay in the roade tarrying for a wind, to go to Cales: there were moreouer 4 French ships, and three which they had taken, viz. 2 of Enchuysen, and one of Rotterdam, whose Mr. called <hi>Gouert English,</hi> was prisoner aboord the Spanish Admeral. They had manned all these ships with souldiers against

the comming of our fleet: For the Duke of Lucars hauing intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of our arriuall and passage before S. Lucars and Cales, did presently dispatch a post to Gibraltar, to warne the Spaniards of our approach, the like he did to those of Calsi: whereupon, they had strengthened their fleet with three hundred souldiers, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were one hundred Cauallieros that came vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to doe seruice to the Admerall, who had seuen hundred men in his ship, and the Vice-Admerall foure hundred and fiftie. The other gallions were well stored with ordnance, and in each of them two hundred and fiftie men at least, beside the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: the first great gallion, was called S. Augustin, and in her was the Admerall of the whole fleet, called D. <hi>Iuan Alvares d'Avilas,</hi> borne at Est<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The second gallion wherein the Vice-Admerall commaunded, was called our Ladie de la vega. The third, being the Rere-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall, was termed The mother of God. The fourth, S. Anne. The fifth, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Our Admerall hauing descried the Spanish fleet, giuen or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for all matters, and prayed vnto God for his ayd and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, made directly towards them.</p>
               <p>He displayed and made fast his ensigne with nailes, because no man should take it downe, and promised an hundred Reals to him that would bring him the ensigne of the Spanish Admerall, exhorting his souldiers to doe their best, protesting, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they could take from the enemie, should bee their owne: this did greatly animate them, but especially the couragious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of their Admerall, so as they desired nothing more than to fight.</p>
               <p>The Spanish Admerall, descrying our fleet called for the Master of Rotterdam, whom hee kept prisoner, shewing him our ships, asking whether he thought they durst bee so bold as to set vpon him.</p>
               <p>The Master crauing his pardon, answered that he thought they
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:14840:191"/>
durst. But the Spanish Admerall would not beleeue him, because hee had the aduantage of vs, lying vnder defence of the towne and castle, as also because hee thought himselfe alone sufficient in his ship the S. Augustine to resist the whole fleet of Hollanders; but the successe shewed the contrarie. Yet perceiuing that our Admerall made directly towards him, hee cut his cable, (for he was formost before all the ships) and fell downe farther into the bay towards the towne; so as then, the vice-Admerall, and three other gallions were before him.</p>
               <p>Admerall <hi>Heemskerck</hi> perceiuing this, did not for all that alter his course, but passed on directly before the vice-Admerall and the other gallions, which hee left on his left hand; hee prepared his ankor and gaue commaundement it should not bee let slip, till hee were aboord the Admerall and had stemd him.</p>
               <p>So soone as hee came neere him, the Spaniard first of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged one of his peeces, which flue directly thorow one of our Admerals port holes, and did no hurt, but only tooke away one of the vpper crosse beames: whereupon, Admerall <hi>Heemskerck</hi> presently answered him with two peeces, and then forthwith boorded him, and let slip his ankor. But the Spaniard making a second shot, the bullet caried away a young man that was readie to discharge his musket, and with all, that cursed shot tooke off Admerall <hi>Heemskercks</hi> left leg and thigh, whereupon, that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent souldier fell downe beeing armed from top to toe, and the same bullet, likewise caried away an other mans right hand, who was giuing fire to a peece of ordnance.</p>
               <p>Admerall <hi>Heemskerck</hi> perceiuing his death grew nigh, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and exhorted those that were neere him, valiantly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue that which they had begun, and to elect another in his place, recommending his soule to God, which were the last words hee spake, and so like a gallant Captaine died in his armor.</p>
               <p>In the meane time all the ordnance on our Admerals broad side, plaid at once vpon the Spanish Admerall, who presently made a volley of small shot vpon our men, and was by them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered with the like: the noice, fire, and smoake was so great as wee could neither heare nor see, so as the losse of our Admerall was not knowne in our fleet till we had obtained the victorie.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Lambert</hi> according to the directions which were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him, followed his Admerall, saluting the Spaniard with two
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:14840:192"/>
peeces from his fore Castle, which bullets passed cleane thorow the Spanish Admerall, and made great slaughter among the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his men, and with the rest of his ordnance made such hauock amongst them, as it is impossible to set downe with what furie they fought on both sides: for though our men were not halfe so many in number as the enemie, yet were they as couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as Lions, and vsed all meanes to bee reuenged on the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards for their tyrannie towards diuers of them: this did so animate vs, as wee made no doubt of the victorie. At what time Admerall <hi>Heemskerck</hi> made toward the Spanish admerall, he was followed by the whole fleet: but Captaine <hi>Adrian Roest,</hi> who came behind the Admerall and Captaine <hi>Lambert,</hi> perceiuing that hee was one of the formost, and that the vice-Admerall <hi>Lawrence Iacobs Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> (who was appointed to boord the vice-Admerall) was ten or twelue ships behinde him, himselfe alone with a manly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage boorded the vice-Admerall of Spaine.</p>

               <p>Whilest our men fought wtih the vice-Admerall, Captaine <hi>Pan</hi> likewise came vp to them, one of whose men went aboord the vice-Admerall, and brought away her Flag that hung in her fore-mast, and in recompence thereof had fiftie Rials giuen him after the fight.</p>
               <p>The Spanish vice-Apmerall beeing on fire, our men did their best to cleere themselues from her, but not without daunger, for fire had alreadie taken hold on our ships, and in a manner burnt all Captaine <hi>Roest, Simon Iansz,</hi> and <hi>Cornellis Madders</hi> sailes, but at last with much to doe, they quenched the fire.</p>
               <p>This could not bee done in the Spanish vice-Admerall; where euerie man sought meanes to saue himselfe, so as shee was burnt downe even with the water, her souldiers and mariners beeing some of them burnt, and others leaping into the Sea, many were drowned, and others slain with musket shot, and with the stroaks of pikes and swords.</p>
               <p>Captaine <hi>Long Henry,</hi> peceiuing that these trhee Captaines <hi>Roest, Madder,</hi> and <hi>Simon Iansz</hi> fought so brauely with the vice-Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:14840:192"/>
assailed the next gallion which lay on the vice-Admerals right hand, and with his ordnance plaid furiously vpon her: Captaine <hi>Iacob Iansz</hi> of Edam, and Captaine <hi>Gerart Euerts</hi> secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, and boorded the said gallion.</p>
               <p>After some fight, Captaine <hi>Long Henry</hi> beeing oppressed with heate, did put off his helmet to coole himselfe, and was presently shot into the head whereof hee died. Those that were in this gallion perceiuing the vice-Admerall to bee on fire, and her flag to bee taken downe, did presently hang forth an other on the top of their mast as vice-Admerall, but it staid not long there, for some of our men tooke it downe: within a while after, this gallion was likewise fired, and burnt downe euen with the water.</p>
               <p>The third gallion was boorded by Captaine <hi>Copdrayer,</hi> and the pinnace of Frizland, who in a short space sanke her.</p>
               <p>Whilest wee were thus busied with the gallions, the vice-Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merall <hi>Alteras</hi> came vp likewise, and though hee boorded none, yet hee plaid fiercely vpon them with his ordnance, which was not done without some losse to our men.</p>
               <p>The other Spanish ships which lay farther vp in the bay than did the Admerall, shot furiously at our men, and they at them: at last, one of those Spanish ships with often shooting, did fire her powder, and falling foule of one of her fellowes, burnt it likewise, which the other perceiuing, did presently cut their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and fell downe to land ward where they ran on ground, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all meanes to escape. Often shooting did likewise fire the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ships, and with them, that of Lubeck.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter William Verhoofe,</hi> Captaine of our Admerall, together with Captain <hi>Lambert</hi> were still fighting with the Spanish Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who at last gaue ouer shooting, and hung forth a flag of truce, but our men shot still.</p>
               <p>In the meane time, that gallion which Captaine <hi>Cleynsorgh</hi> fought with, was likewise set on fire. The Captaines Trumpeter did presently clime vp to the top and fetch downe the flag, which had hung out longer than any of the rest, for which, according to the promise which Admerall <hi>Heemskerck</hi> had made, he receiued 100 rials in recompence.</p>
               <p>The Spanish Admerall beeing thus ouercome with losse of many of her men, those which remained perceiuing that our men
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:14840:193"/>
made towards them, did ten, and twentie at a time leape into the Sea, thinking to escape by swimming, but our men in their furie slew most of them, so as the whole bay was full of dead carkasses.</p>
               <p>The fight began about three of the clocke in the afternoone, and in lesse than foure howers, all was ended, and the victorie by Gods goodnesse fell to vs. This braue exploit was chiefely begun by Admerall <hi>Heemskerck,</hi> and was for the most part continued, and ended by ten or twelue ships onely.</p>
               <p>The next day in the morning, the Spanish Admerall was run on ground, but those of the town went and cut down her masts, and then fired her, thereby sauing our men a labour, who meant to haue done it. It was a fearefull thing to behold the flame and burning of the gallions, especially when fire tooke the powder, for it made such a noice as though it had thundred from heauen, couering the land and sea with a thick smoake, which made an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall darknesse for a time.</p>
               <p>Beside the Admerals gallion, fiue more were burnt, together with a great ship of war, an other ship which the Spaniards had taken, and the aboue mentioned vessell of Lubeck. An other of the gallions was sunke, the other two ran on ground, and were made vnseruiceable.</p>
               <p>A French man likewise ran on ground with two ships, the one of Rotterdam, and the other of Enchuysen: all the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Spanish men of war did the like, vp and downe the coast, and by Gods assistance were destroyed. The prisoners confessed that there were foure thousand men in the fleet, and that halfe of them had not escaped, among whom (as letters into Spaine doe testifie) was the Admerall with manie other gentlemen and captaines. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the prisoners, was D. <hi>Iohn Aluares</hi> the Admerals sonne, who was brought into Holland. Wee onely lost the noble Admerall <hi>Heemskerck</hi> who was lamented of all men, together with some hundred men, and threescore that were hurt.</p>
               <p>On the six and twentieth day, our fleet came to an ankor in the roade of Gibraltar, the ordnance of the towne and castle playing vpon them, but did little or no hurt at all: there did they looke to their sicke and hurt men, as well as the time would giue them leaue; and during their aboade there, they saw great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of horse and foot, vpon the shoare, going to the towne of Gibraltar, for the Spaniard thought verily that our men would
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:14840:193"/>
haue assailed it, and there was such amazement and confusion in the town, as euerie man packt vp all he had, intending to be gone: the like feare possest those of Cales, who thought that our fleete would come and visite them.</p>
               <p>The seuen and twentieth day our ships departed forth of the road of Gibraltar, those of the castle shooting after them, and because the shot did no hurt, our men reputed those peales of ordnance to bee done in their honour, and so directed their course towards Barbarie, going so neere Senta which belongs to the Spaniards, as those of the towne and other places of the Countrie shot at them: but our men passed on thorough the Streit towards the coast of Barbarie, &amp; came into the road of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan, which is a strong towne within 5 miles of Senta to the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, belonging to the Turks and Moors, &amp; there trimmed their ships which had bin spoiled by fire and the enemies canon.</p>
               <p>When they came before Tetuan, they were kindly welcomed. The Gouernours selfe, with many Turkish gallants came aboord our fleet, offering vs all friendship and assistance both for our ships and men, bringing vs all manner of refreshments, as oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and other restoratiue fruits, seeming verie ioyfull for the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorie which God had giuen vs ouer the proud Spaniards: our men likewise went ashoare, and had great honor done vnto them euerie where.</p>
               <p>The Gouernour made an offer vnto our men, that if they would make any attempt on the towne of Senta, hee would aid them both with horse and foot; but wee intending other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes, gaue him manie thanks for his courteous offer. All things beeing repaired, the vice-Admerall <hi>Alteras</hi> was made Admerall, and <hi>Peter William Verhoof</hi> vice-Admerall: there they consulted what was best to be done, and what course to take, for better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noying the enemie: at last they resolued to send some towards the Islands of Flaunders to remaine there, namely the vice-Adme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, Captaine <hi>Iacob Iansz</hi> of Edam, Captaine <hi>Harman,</hi> the pinace of Frizland, and Captaine <hi>Cleuter,</hi> to trie if they could meet with any good aduenture there.</p>

For as much as in the treatie of truce, made the 9 of April 1609 in the citie of Antuerp, betwixt the commissioners of my Lords the Archdukes of Austria &amp;c. and them of the generall States of the vnited Netherland Prouinces, certaine difficulties and ambiguities haue beene propounded on either side, by their officers and subiects; for the more exact looking to of the encrease and more ample declaration of the said articles, it was in the end thought fit, that the commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on either side, should consider of these difficulties and reconcile them. After that the said commissioners did often meet to confer together according to their procurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and commission on both sides, they did at last agree vpon these points and articles following.
