            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Light. The selfe same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
am I forced to make tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
this little Manuell of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
Meditations, which
I humbly put into your hands. It
was written with respect onely to
mine owne private use many yeares
since, when I was a young Student
in the Vniversity, as my first Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
Essay. And now lately, by
meanes of a private Copy long agoe
communicated unto a Friend, it had
without my knowledge received a
Licence for the Presse, my earnest
care was upon the first notice thereof
wholly to have suppressed the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication:
but the Copy which had
beene licenced, being, by I know not
what miscarriage lost, I have found
<pb facs="tcp:12557:3"/>
it necessary, for feare of the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
againe to review a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Copy which I had by mee, and
have rather chosen to let it passe
forth with some briefe and sudden
Castigations of mine owne, than
once more runne the hazard of a
surreptitious Edition. Mine Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
shall bee no other than that of
the good father, <hi>Infanseram, nec
dum scribere noveram. Nunc,
ut nihil aliud profecerim, saltem
Socraticum illud habeo, scio
quod nescio.</hi> And now since I
finde that the Oblation of the first
fruits, though haply they were not
alwayes the best and ripest, did yet
finde favourable acceptance with
God himself, I have bin embolden'd
to present this small Enchiridion,
<pb facs="tcp:12557:4"/>
(the very first fruits of my Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall
studies) unto the hands and
patronage of so greatly learned, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquent,

that upon this assurance; That as

the Food of Life,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 5. 2, 3.</note> are subjects worthy

               <head type="sub">Mans Being to bee imployed in working: that
working directed unto some Good, which is
God; that Good, a free and voluntary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which wee here enjoy onely in the
right of a Promise, the seale of which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
is a Sacrament.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Almighty power and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God hath given unto
his creatures, a triple degree of
perfection, their <hi>Being,</hi> their
<hi>Working,</hi> and their <hi>Good;</hi> which
three are so subordinate to each other, that
<hi>Working</hi> is the end and scope of <hi>Being,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:12557:6"/>
                  <hi>Good</hi> is the end and scope of <hi>Working.</hi> But no
<hi>Being,</hi> can produce any <hi>Work,</hi> no <hi>Work</hi> reach
unto any <hi>Good,</hi> without something that may
be a rule of working, and a way to Good; and
therefore Almightie God in the work of the
Creation imprinted in each creature a secret
principle, which should move, governe, and
uniformly direct it to its proper work and
end, and that principle we call a <hi>Law,</hi> which
by assigneing unto each thing the kinde, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and extent of its working, doth lead
it on by a strait and in fallible line unto
that <hi>Good,</hi> for which it worketh. All other
Creatures below the spheare of reason, being
not only in the quality of their nature of a
narrow and strait perfection, but in their
duration finite and perishable, the good
unto which this Law of their creation directs
them, is a finite Good likewise. But men and
Angels being both in nature more excellent
than all others, and in continuance infinite
and immortall, cannot possibly receive from
anything, which is a meere creature, and
lesse perfect than themselves, any compleat
satisfaction of their desires, and therefore
must by a circle turne back unto God, who
is aswell the <hi>Omega,</hi> the end and object of
their working, as the <hi>Alpha,</hi> the cause and
authour of their being. Now God being
most free, not only in himselfe, but in the
diffusion and communication of himselfe, unto
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:12557:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
any thing created (which therefore he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be naturally or necessarily bound unto)
and being also a God infinitely beyond the
largest compasse of the creatures merit or
working, it followes that neither Men nor An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
can lay any necessary claime unto God,
by a debt of <hi>Nature,</hi> (as a stone may unto
the Center by that naturall impresse which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
it thither;) but all our claime is by a
right of <hi>Promise</hi> and <hi>voluntary Donation,</hi>
so that that which in other meere naturall
creatures is cald the Terme or Scope, is in
reasonable creatures the <hi>Promise</hi> or <hi>Reward</hi>
of their working. <hi>Feare not Abraham, I am
thy exceeding great reward;</hi> So then we have
here our <hi>Good</hi> which is <hi>God,</hi> to bee commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
unto us, not in the manner of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
and naurall debt, but of a voluntary,
and supernaturall <hi>Reward:</hi> Secondly we have
our <hi>working</hi> required as the meanes to lead us
in a strait line unto the fruition of that <hi>Good:</hi>
and in as much as mans will, being mutable,
may carry him unto severall operations of
different kinds, wee have thirdly a <hi>Rule</hi> or
Law, to moderate the kind and manner of
our working, whereby we reach unto our
desired <hi>Good;</hi> which <hi>Rule</hi> when it altereth
(as in the new Covenant of grace it doth) the
quality of that work, whereby we reach unto
our desired <hi>Good</hi> doth alter likewise. Now
fourthly wee must farther observe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:12557:7"/>
our <hi>working,</hi> which is the <hi>motion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our <hi>Good,</hi> and our <hi>fruition,</hi> or resting
in it, there is a distance or succession of time:
so that while we are in our estate of <hi>working,</hi>
we doe not <hi>enjoy</hi> God by any full, reall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
or possession, but only by a right of a
<hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Promise,</hi> which makes the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
say, that in this life we live by faith and
not by sight. Now <hi>Promises</hi> or <hi>Covenants</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
to have annexed unto them <hi>Evidence</hi>
and certaintie, so farre as may secure the party
that relyes upon them: which in humane
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ontracts is done, by giving our words, and
setting to our seales for confirmation. And
now lastly in as much as that Dutie, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof God maketh this <hi>Promise</hi> of
himselfe unto us, is the work of the <hi>whole
man,</hi> the Evidence and Confirmation of the
Promise is by God, made unto the whole man
likewise, and to each facultie of man, which
it pleaseth him in mercy the rather to doe,
because of that dependance of our soules on
the inferiour and subordinate powers, and of
that necessary connexion which there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
the inward reason, and the outward
senses. God then (presupposing ever the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance

discharge of his <hi>covenant</hi> and <hi>promise,</hi> first to
the <hi>soule</hi> alone by the testimony of his <hi>Spirit</hi>
(which is both the seale and the witnesse of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:12557:7"/>
Gods Covenant:) and secondly both to the
soule and to the <hi>senses</hi> by that double bond,
his word written or preached, and his seale
visibly exhibited to the eye, and taste, but
especially unto the taste, in which objects are
more really and with lesse fallibilitie uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the faculty, in which there appeareth a
more exquisite fruition of delight, in these
good things which are pleasing; and lastly in
which the mysticall union of the Church to
its head, unto the making up of one body is
more naturally exprest. And these <hi>seales</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
unto the word or patent of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
have been ever proposd unto the
Church in all its estates, and are nothing else

as the testimony of the Spirit is an invisible

God requireth.</p>

so many sealed Deeds to make over
unto all successions of the Church,
so long as they continue legitimate children
and observe the Lawes on their part required,
an infallible claime and title unto that Good
which is not yet revealed, unto that inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which is as yet laid up unto that life
which is hid with God, and was never yet
fully opened or let shine upon the earth.
Even in Paradise there was a <hi>Sacrament;</hi> a
tree of life inded it was, but there was but
one; whereas <hi>Adam</hi> was to eat of all the
fruits in the Garden: He was there but to
taste sometimes of life, it was not to bee his
perpetuall and only food. We read of a Tree
of life in the beginning of the Bible, and of
a tree of life in the end too; that was in
<hi>Adams</hi> Paradise on earth, this in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi>
Paradise in heaven: But that did beare but
the first fruits of life, the earnest of an after
fulnesse. This bare life in abundance, for it
bare twelve manner of fruits, and that every
moneth, which shewes both the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12557:8"/>
and eternity of that glory which wee
expect. And as the Tree of Paradise was but
a Sacrament of life in heaven, so Paradise it
selfe was but a Sacrament of heaven. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Adam</hi> was placed amongst the dark and
shady trees of the Garden, that he might in an
Embleme acknowledge, that he was as yet but
in the shadow of life, the substance whereof
he was elsewhere to receive. Even when the
Church was <hi>pure,</hi> it was not <hi>perfect;</hi> it had an
age of <hi>infancy,</hi> when it had a state of <hi>innocence:</hi>
Glory was not communicated unto <hi>Adam</hi>
himselfe without the vaile of a <hi>Sacrament:</hi>
the light of God did not shine on Paradise
with a spreading and immediate ray; even
there it was mixed with shadowes, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
only in a Sacramentall reflex, not in
its owne direct and proper brightnesse. The
Israelites in the wildernesse had light indeed
but it was in a cloud, and they had the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God in the Ark,<note place="margin">Exod: 13. 21.</note> but it was under se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
coverings;<note place="margin">Exod: 26.</note> and they had the light of
God shining on the face of <hi>Moses,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 34. 33.</note> but it
was under the vaile;<note place="margin">Exod. 34. 5.</note> and <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe
did see God, but it was in a cloud: so unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
is the Church while encompassed with
a body of sinne, to see the lustre of that glory
which is expected. Certainly as the Sonne
of God did admirably humble himselfe in his
<hi>hypostaticall union</hi> unto a visible flesh, so doth
he still with equall wonder and lowlinesse
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:12557:9"/>
humble himselfe in a <hi>Sacramentall union</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

mercy which is so wonderfull, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels
desire to look into it, so unconceiveable
as that it hath not entred into the thought
of man; of such height, and lenghth, and
breadth, and depth, as passeth knowledge,
should yet be made the object of our lowest
faculties: That that which is hid from the
wise and prudent in mans little world, his mind
and spirit, should bee revealed unto the

So humble is his mercy that since we cannot
raise our understandings to the comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

our corrupt nature, when we use them: and
even on these doth our soule look through
other darke glasses, the windowes of sense.
But yet at the best they are but glasses, whose
properties are to present nothing but the

things which are in their substance quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

in generall, the nature of a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to
be the representative of a substance, the signe
of a covenant, the seale of a purchase, the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of a body, the witnesse of our faith, the
earnest of our hope, the presence of things
distant, the sight of things absent, the taste of
things unconceivable, and the knowledge of
things, that are past knowledge.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>ERE then we see first the different
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> state and disposition of the Church,
here in a state of corruption and
therefore in want of water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme
to wash it; in a state of infancy, and
therefore in want of milke in the word to
nourish it; in a state of weaknesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in want of bread, the body of Christ, to
strengthen it; in a state of sorrow, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in want of wine, the blood of Christ,
to comfort it. Thus the Church while it is
a child, it speaks as a child, it understands as
a child, it feeds as a child, here a little and
there a little; one day in the week, one houre
in the day, it is kept fasting and hungry. But
when it is growne from strength to strength,
unto a perfect age, and unto the fulnesse of the
stature of Christ, then it shall be satisfied with
fatnesse, and drink its full of those rivers of
pleasures, which make glad the City of God:
It shall keep an eternall Sabbath, a continued
festivall; the Supper of the Lamb shall bee
without end, or satiety: so long as the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
is with them, (which shall be for ever)
they cannot fast.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly we see here, nor see only, but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:12557:10"/>
even taste and touch how gratious the Lord
is, in that he is pleased even to unroabe his
graces of their naturall lustre, to overshad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
his Promises, and as it were to obscure
his glory that they might be made propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
to our dull and earthy senses, to lock
up so rich mysteries as lie hidden in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in a bason of water, or a morsell of
bread. When hee was invisible by reason of
that infinite distance between the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and ours, hee made himselfe to be seen
in the flesh; and now that his very flesh is to
us againe invisible by reason of that vast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
between his place and ours, he hath
made even it in a mysticall sense to be seen
and tasted in the Sacrament. Oh then since
God doth thus farre humble himselfe and his
graces even unto our senses, let not us by
an odious ingratitude humble them yet low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
even under our feet. Let us not trample on
the blood of the Covenant, by taking it into a
noisome sinke, into a dirty and earthie heart.
He that eats Christs in the Sacrament with a
foule mouth, and receives him into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clensed
and sinfull soule doth all one as if he
should sop the bread he eates in dirt, or lay
up his richest treasures in a sink.</p>
               <p>Thirdly we learn how we should employ <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
all our senses. Not only as brute beasts do, to
fasten them on the earth, but to lift them up
unto a more heavenly use, since God hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:12557:11"/>
made even them the organs &amp; instruments of
our spirituall nourishment. Mix ever with the
naturall a heavenly use of thy senses. Whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thou seest<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> behold in it his wonder: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
thou hearest, hear in it his wisedome:
whatsoever thou tastest, taste in it the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as well of his love, as of the creature. If
Christ will not dwell in a foul house, he will
certainly not enter at a foul door. Let not
those teeth that eat the bread of Angelsgrinde
the face of the poor; Let not the mouth which
doth drink the blood of Christ, thirst after the
blood of his neighbour: Let not that hand
which is reached out to receive Christ in the
Sacrament, be stretched out to injure him in
his members: Let not those eyes which look
on Christ, be gazing after vanity. Certainly
if he will not be one<note n="a" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. 15.</note> in the same body with a
harlot, neither will he be seen with the same
eyes: he is really in the heaven of the greater
world, and he will be no where else Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally
but in the heavenly parts of man, the
lesser.</p>
               <p>Lastly, we see here what manner of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
we have; The church on earth hath
but the earnests of glory, the earnest of the
<hi>Spirit,</hi> and the earnest of the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> that
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note>witnessing, this<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> signifying; both confirming

our inheritance is laid up for us. A Prince that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:12557:11"/>
is haply bred up in a great distance from his
future kingdome in another Realm, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
enemies where he suffers one while a
danger, another a disgrace, loaded with dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and discontents, though by the assurance
of blood, by the warrant of his fathers own
hand &amp; seal he may be confirmed in the evident
right of his succession, can hardly yet so much
as imagine the honour he shall enjoy, nor any
more see the gold and lustre of his crown in
the print of the wax that confirms it, than a
man that never saw the Sunne can conceive
that brightnesse which dwelleth in it by its pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
drawn in some dark colours. We are<note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> a
royall people,<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 6. 17.</note> heirs, yea coheirs with Christ:
but we are in a farre countrey and<note n="c" place="margin">2. Cor. 5. 6.</note> absent
from the Lord, in houses ruinous and made
of clay, in a region of darknesse, in a shadow
of death, in a valley of tears, though compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in with a wall of fire, yet do the waves of
ungodly men break in upon us; though ship'd
in a safe Ark, the temple of God, yet often
tos'd almost unto shipwrack, and ready with
<hi>Ionah</hi> to be swallowed of a great Leviathan;
though protected with a guard of holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
which pitch their tents about us, so that
the enemy without cannot enter, yet enticed
often out,<note place="margin">Iames 1. 14.</note> and led privily but voluntarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away
by the enchanting lusts, the Dalilahs of
our own bosome. The kingdome and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
we expect is hid from us,<note place="margin">Ephes. 3. 9.</note> and we know
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:12557:12"/>
no more of it, but onely this, that it passeth
knowledge. Truly the assurance of it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmd
by an infallible pattent, Gods own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
and that made firm by a seal coloured
with that blood, and stamped with the image
of that body which was the price that bought
it. What remains then but that where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
is, thither the Eagles flie, where the treasure
is, there the heart be also, that we groan after
the revelation of the sonnes of God, when the
vayl of our mortallity shall be rent, the mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall
of the flesh made spirituall and transpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
the shadows and resemblances of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
abolished, the glasse of the creature
removed, the riddle of our salvation unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the vapours of corruption dispelled, the
patience of our expectation rewarded, and
from the power of the spirit within, and the
presence of Christ without shall be diffused on
the whole man a double lustre of exceeding
abundant glory. The hope and assurance of
this is it which in those holy mysteries of
Christs Supper we receive, which if received
without dependance and relation on that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which they foreshadow, and on that body
which withall the merits of it they obsignate,
doth no more good than the seal of a king,
without any grant or patent whereunto it
should be joyned, in which there is no profit
beyond the bare wax, and much danger in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flin

of them by hand and seale, are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
performed by the men themselves who
are interessed in them. A Secretary may
write the letter, but his Lord will himselfe
subscribe and seale it. Thus the pattent of
Gods covenant hath been drawn out for the

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:12557:14"/>
inspired instruments, unto whom God did
dictate so much of his will by divine sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,

is the impiety of those who mixing
humane inventions and ceremonies of their
owne unto the substance of these sacred my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,
and imposing them as divine duties
with a necessitie of absolute obedience, do by
that meanes wrench Christs owne divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
out of his owne hands, and make
themselves, shall I say confounders and joynt
authors of his Sacraments? nay rather indeed
the destroyers of them: since as he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives

not Christ but rather damnation; so he
that gives otherwayes than Christ instituted
doth not indeed give Christ, but an Idoll of
his own making.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we see here with how great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
we ought to approach Gods Temple,
to receive these deep mysteries of Salvation,
which it pleas'd Christ in his owne person to
institute, and with his owne presence to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
unto the Church: was a beast slaine for
touching the Mount, and shall not a man of
beastly and vile affections,<note place="margin">Heb. 12, 20.</note> bee punished for
touching that table where the Lord is present?
was <hi>Moses</hi> to put off his shooes at that bush
which represented Gods power, and must
not we shake off our earthly and corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
at those mysteries which represent his
mercy? were <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> destroyd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord for offring strange fire at his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:12557:16"/>
Altar, and shall we plead immunity if we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
strange soules, and a false faith at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
was <hi>Adam</hi> thrust out of Paradise for his
sinne in eating of the tree of knowledge; and
shall we escape if we sinne in eating of the
bread of life? even unto the institutions of
mortall men, though often in their substance
needlesse, in their observance difficult, and in
their end not much beneficiall, so long as
they keep within the compasse of indifferent
things, there is requir'd not only our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
but our reverence. The word of God,
though delivered unto us in earthen vessells,
by men of like, weak, and fraile affections with
our selves, yet because of that native preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
which resides in it, and of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
glory which it brings from the spirit
that reveald it, is so farre to be honor'd, as
that the vessells that bring it, are to be had in
high estimation, even for their works sake:
But the Sacraments are not either of humane
authority, as are positive lawes, nor of; divine
inspiration unto holy men, as were the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
but they are by so much the more the
immediate effects of divine power, by how
much they are instituted without the least
concurrence of any other instrument; being
reach'd out first unto the Church of God
by that immaculate and pretious hand, which
was it selfe presently stretcht forth on the
Crosse to embrace the weary and heavy laden.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:12557:16"/>
Let us not then venture to receive so sacred
things with unwashen hands, as matters of
meere custome, fashion, or formality. But
let us look unto that high authority that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayn'd
them, on that holy mouth that blessed
them, on that arme of mercy that exhibits
them; being ever assur'd that as Christ hath
one hand of bounty and redemption which
reacheth forth life to the worthie receiver, so
hath he another of justice and power ready
to avenge the injuries and contempt that shall
be done to his owne holy institution.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we see here the honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the faithfull, in that they not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ, and all the benefits of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
and actions, but all this they receive from
his owne hands. For we may not think that
the actions of Christ in looking up and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
and breaking, and giving, were meerly
temporary, locall, or confined actions, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
only to the present company that
were then with him. Certainly as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
were then the representative Church, so
was that a representative action, the vertue
and effect whereof descends, and passeth
through all successions of the Church. The
arme of the Lord is not shortned or any way
shrunk that it cannot still exhibit what then
it did. If he can so lengthen the arme of faith
in us, as to reach as farre as heaven to embrace
him, he can as well stretch out his owne arme
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:12557:17"/>
of mercy from heaven to present that unto
us which he did unto his disciples. It was an
admirable and unexpected honour that was
shewd to <hi>Mordecay</hi> when the royall Crowne
and the Kings owne apparell was put upon
him,<note place="margin">Easter. 6. 10.</note> though by the service of wicked <hi>Haman:</hi>
But Christ doth not only bestow on us his
Kingdom in the Sacrament (which seales unto
us our inheritance with him) nor doth only
invest us with his own meritorious purple
roabs,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> his red garments from <hi>Bozrha</hi> (the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of innocency and of unity) but doth all
this with his owne immediate hand;<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 17.</note> so that
our honour must needs be so much greater
than was <hi>Mordecay's,</hi> by how much the roabs

with the nature and quality of his passion, that
it should be as Bread to strengthen, and as
Wine to comfort the faint hearted, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
the knees that tremble, and the hands

wherein he was betrayed,<note place="margin">Vid. Aug. de unitate Eccl. cap. 11.</note> to let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

Gift or Legacy. In his life time hee gave his
Church, his Word, and his Miracles, he went
about doing good, but now in his passion he
bestowed that which added weight and value,
to all his other gifts, himselfe. Other men
use to bequeath their bodyes to the earth,
from whence it came;<note place="margin">Acts 2. 27.</note> but Christs body was

lay his head in, had no place where to eat the

new Supper any variety of rich and costly
dishes; as his Kingdome is not, so neither is
his Supper of this world. It was not his purpose
to make our worship of him a chargeable ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and to enjoyne us such a table, as should
six our thoughts on the meats rather than on
the substance which they resembled. Hee
knew that where the senses are overcharg'd

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:12557:20"/>
Supper in the Chancell or upper roome of
the Temple; besides, it was a spatious and
great roome, and so it should bee, for it was a
great Supper, the Supper of a King. The Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
were then the type &amp; representative of
the whole Catholick Church, which was now
by them to be begotten unto God, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Chamber must needs be a resemblance
and Modell of the whole world throughout
which the sound of Christs name, and the
memory of his passion, should in his Supper be
celebrated untill the end of all things, and
then no marvell if it were a great Chamber.
Lastly, it was ready spread, fitted, trimmed,
and prepared. So sacred a mysterie as this may
not be exhibited in an unfitted, or uncleane
place, much lesse received into a corrupt and
unprepared soule. The body of Christ was
never to see corruption, and therefore it will
never be mix'd with corruption. It lay first
in a cleane womb, it was after buried in a
virgin Sepulcher; it then was taken into the
brightest heavens, and it still resides in molten
and purifide hearts. He that had the purity
of a Dove, will never take up the loding of
a Crow. Here then we see from these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
with what reverence and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with what affection and high esteeme
we should receive these sacred mysteries.
The gift of a dying friend (though of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
value) is yet greatly prized for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:12557:20"/>
memory of the donor; for though the thing
it selfe be small, yet is it the pledge of a great
love.<note place="margin">debetur maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo operi haec ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neratio, ut no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vissimum sit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor<expan>

was to give gifts unto men: how much more
sacred were his last words,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4. 7. 8. 11</note> who all his life time
spake as never man spake. The very presence
of a dying man estamps on the mind an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of feare and awe, much more should
the words and gifts of him who was dead and
is alive againe. Certainly he hath a flinty soule
whom love as strong as death,<note place="margin">Cant. 8.</note> and death the
work of that love cannot melt into a sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

this Sacrament was a time of passion, let not
us be stupid; it was a time of passeover, let
not our soules be unsprinkled; it was a time of
unleavened bread, let not our doctrine of it,
be adulterated with the leaven of heresie, not
our soules in receiving, tainted with the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

of Christ unworthily, make it as the sop was

as the Author of those mysteries was holy by

Wine:</hi> common, vulgar, obvious food, (wine
with water being the only knowne drinke
with them in those hot Countries) amongst
the Jewes a lamb was to bee slaine, a more
chargeable and costly Sacrament, not so easie
for the poore to procure, And therefore in
the Sacrifice of first fruits, the<note n="k" place="margin">Levit. 12. 8.</note> poore were
dispenc'd with, and for a Lamb offred a pair of
pigeons. Christ now<note n="l" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 14.</note> hath broken down that
partition wall, that wall of inclosure which
made the Church as a<note n="m" place="margin">Cant. 4. 12.</note> garden with hedges,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:12557:23"/>
and made only the rich, the people of the
Jewes, capable of Gods Covenants and
Sacraments: now that Gods Table hath
crumms as well as flesh,<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 15. 27.</note> the Dogs, the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
eat of it too; the poorest in the world is
admitted to it, even as the poorest that are
do shift for bread, though they are not able to
provide flesh. Then the Church was a<note n="b" place="margin">Cant. 4. 12.</note> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
sealed up, but in Christ there was a<note n="c" place="margin">Zech. 13. 1.</note>
fountaine opened for transgressions and for
sinnes. Fourthly <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> Bread<note n="d" place="margin">Psal. 104. 19.</note> to

of which though in a confluence of all other
blessings causeth famine<note n="g" place="margin">Amos 8. 11.</note> in a Land. See here
the abundant sufficiency of Christs passion, It
is the universall food of the whole Church,
which sanctifieth all other blessings, without
which they have no relish nor comfort in
them. Sinne and the corrupt nature of man
hath a venemous quality in it to turne all
other good things into poyson, unlesse corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by this antitode, this Bread<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 6.</note> of life, that

jarring and contentious; one affection strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
in the same soule with another for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
ambition fights with malice, and pride
with covetousnesse, the head plots against
the heart, and the heart swells against the
head; reason and appetite, will and passion,
soule &amp; body set the whole frame of nature in
a continuall combustion, like an<note n="b" place="margin">Arist. Eth. l. 3.</note> unjoynted or
broken arme, one faculty moves contrary to
the government or attraction of another, and
so as in a confluence of contrary streames and
winds, the soule is whirld about in a maze of
intestine contentions. But when once we
become<note n="c" place="margin">Philip. 3.</note> conformable unto Christs death, it
presently makes of<note n="d" place="margin">Eph. 2. 15. 16.</note> two one, and so worketh
peace, it slayeth that hatred and warre in the
members, and reduceth all unto that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
harmony, unto that uniforme spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which<note n="f" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 18.</note> changeth us all into the same
Image from glory to glory. Sixtly <hi>Bread and

to gather those that wandred either from

Lastly <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> sever'd and asunder;
that to be eaten, this to be drunken; that in a
loafe, this in a Cup: It is not the bloud of
of Christ running in his veynes, but shed on
his members that doth nourish his Church.
Impious therefore is their practice, who
powre Christs blood as it were into his body
againe, and shut up his wounds, when they
deny the Cup unto the people under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
that Christs Body being received, the
blood by way of concomitancy is received
together with it: and so seale up that preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Fountaine which he had opened, and
make a monopoly of Christs sacred wounds,
as if his blood had been shed only for the
Priest, and not as well for the people; or as
if the Church had power to withhold that
from the people of Christ which himselfe had
given them.</p>

Wheresoever God hath bestowed a vitall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

Even the new-borne Babe by the impression

it is a presumption that he is not only

of Christ being so obvious as the commons,
and so sufficient as the properties of these Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
declare: we see how little we should
be dismaid at any either inward weaknesses

assaults of enemies, having so powerfull a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy

to trust in any thing within our selves, whose
sufficiency and nourishment is from without.
There is no created substance in the world
but receives perfection from some other

lost his owne native integrity go out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to procure a better estate, which in vaine
he might have done for ever, had not God

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:12557:26"/>
whatsoever waves or tempests rise against us:
his wounds are holes to hide and shelter us:
what though sinne be poyson, have we not
here the bread of Christ for an Antidote?
What though it be red as Skarlet, is not his
blood of a deeper colour? What though the
Darts of Satan continually wound us, is not
the issue of his wounds the balme for ours?
Let me be fed all my dayes with bread of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and water of affliction, I have another
bread, another Cup to sweeten both. Let Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
tempt mee to despaire of life, I have in
these visible and common Elements, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of life made the food of life unto me; let
who will perswade me to trust a little in my
owne righteousnesse, to spie out some ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spings
and faint reliques of life in my selfe:
I receive in these signes an all-sufficient Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
and I will seeke for nothing in my selfe
when I have so much in him. Lastly, we see
here, both from the example of Christ who
is the patterne of unity, and from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christ which is the Symboll of unity,
what a conspiracy of affections ought to be in
us, both betweene our owne, and towards
our fellow-members. Thinke not that thou
hast worthily received these holy mysteries,
till thou finde the image of that unity which
is in them, conveighed by them into thy soule.
As the breaking of the bread is the Sacrament
of Christs Passion, so the aggregation of many
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:12557:27"/>
graines into one masse should be a Sacrament
of the Churches unity<note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 17.</note>. What is the reason
that the bread and the Church should be both
called in the Scripture by the same name? The
bread<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 24.</note> is the body of Christ, and the Church<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 27.</note>
is the body of Christ too? Is it not because as
the bread is one Loafe out of diverse cornes,
so the Church is one body out of diverse Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers;

beginnes to be that unto which the blessing
had consecrated it: In like manner did the
eternall Sonne of God assume into the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
of his owne infinite person, the whole
nature of man, the body and the soule, by the
vertue of which wonderfull union notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the properties of the divine nature,
remaine absolutely intransient and uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable

apart for that work of incomprehensible love

secondly as the Bread is taken by us from

did alter only the <hi>manner</hi> of its being, the
<hi>operation,</hi> and <hi>efficacy,</hi> the dignity and <hi>use,</hi> but
no way at all the element or <hi>nature</hi> of the

many glorious effects, and advance it to an
estate farre above its common and ordinary
capacity (alwayes yet reserving those defects

and weaknesses which were required in the
aeconomie, and dispensation of that great
work for which he assumed it) but yet he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
alterd the essentiall and naturall qualities
of the body, but kept it still within the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and limits of the created perfection
which the wisdome of God did at first share
out unto it. Lastly, to (come neerer unto the
Crosse of Christ) as hee did by prayer and
thanksgiving consecrate their elements unto
a holy use; so did he immediately before his
passion (of which this is the Sacrament) make

yet typically and sacramentally shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
and exhibited in the Bread broken,
and the Wine powred out.</p>
               <p>The third Action was the <hi>giving,</hi> or deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
of the Bread and Wine: which first,
evidently expresseth the nature and quality
of Christ crucified, with these benefits which
flow from him, that they are freely bestowed
upon the Church, which of it selfe had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
or claime unto any thing save death.
Secondly, we see the nature of Christs passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that it was a free, voluntary, and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
passion, for though it be true that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>

himselfe with a most mercifull and gracious

they could<note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 12. Phil. 2. 7. Iohn 19. 11.</note> never have laid hold on him)
and his death was a most free and voluntary

may seeme to have enforc'd and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd

make Actions involuntary, or at least dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate

liberty? and Christ did feare<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 2. 33.</note>, how then is
it that Christs Passion was most voluntary
though attended with necessitie, feare, and
reluctance? surely it was most voluntary
still, and first therefore <hi>necessary</hi> because <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary,</hi>
the maine and primitive reason of
the necessitie, being nothing else but that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable
will which had fore-decreed it.
Christs death then was necessary by a <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
of the event,</hi> which musts needs come to
passe after it had once been<note n="l" place="margin">Acts 2. 23.</note> fore-determined
by that most wise will of God, which never
useth to repent him of his counsells; but not
by <hi>a necessitie of the cause,</hi> which was most
free and voluntary. Againe, <hi>necessary</hi> it was in
regard of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> whose truth could
not miscarry, in regard of the <hi>promises</hi> made
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:12557:30"/>
of him, which were to be performed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

which were to bee abrogated, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded
with that substance which they did
fore-shaddow, but no way necessary in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to Christs will, which was the first mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
into which both this necessitie and all the
causes of it are to be finally resolv'd.</p>
               <p>And then for the fear and reluctance of
Christ, noe marvell if he who was in all things
like unto us, had his share in the same passions
and affections like wise though without sin. But
neither of these did any way derogate from
the most free Sacrifice which hee himselfe<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note>
offered once for all, in asmuch as there was
an absolute submission of the inferiour to the
higher will, and the inferiour it selfe, shrunk
not at the obedience, but at the pain. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine

a double Will, or rather a double respect of
the same Will. First the <hi>naturall</hi> Will of
Christ, whereby hee could but wish well unto
himselfe, and grone after the conservation of
that being, whose anguish and dissolution did
now approach; whereby he could not upon
the immediate burden<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> of the sinne of man,
and the wrath of God but<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 5. 7.</note> feare,<note n="p" place="margin">Matth. 26. 39</note> and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding

torment, great drops of blood, and then no
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:12557:30"/>
marvell if we here, <hi>Father if it be possible let
this Cup passe from me.</hi> But then again consider
not the naturall, but the <hi>mercifull will of</hi>
Christ by which he intended to appease the
wrath of an offended, &amp; by any other unsatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
God; the removall of an unsupportable
curse, the redemption, of his own, and yet his
fellow creaturs, the giving them accesse unto
a father, who was before a consuming fire, in
a word, the finishing of that great work which
the Angles desire to looke into, and then wee
finde that hee did freely lay downe his life and
most <hi>willingly</hi> embraced what hee most <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi>
did abhorre. As if Christ had said (if wee
may venture to paraphrase his sacred words)
Father thou hast united mee to such a nature
whose Created and Essentiall property it is to
shrink from any thing that may destroy it,
and therefore if it be thy Will let this Cupp
passe from mee: But yet I know that thou hast
likewise annoynted mee to fullfill the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Decree of thy love, and to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of such an office the dispensation wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
requires the dissolution of my assumed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and therefore not as I, but as thou
wilt. So then both the desire of preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
was a naturall desire, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring
up of his Body was a free-will offring.
And indeed the light of nature hath required
a kind of willingnesse, even in the Heathens
bruit Sacrifices. And therefore the beast<note n="s" place="margin">f Macrob. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. lib. 3. c. 5. Plin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was led, and not haled to the Altar; and the
struggling of it, or flying and breaking from the
Altar, or bellowing and crying was ever coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ominous and unhappy. Now our Saviour
Christs willingnesse to offer up himselfe is
herein declared, in that hee opened<note n="b" place="margin">Pet.</note> not his
mouth; in that he suffred such a death where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
hee first did beare<note n="c" place="margin">Iohn 19. 17.</note> the Crosse before it
bore him, in that hee dehorted<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 23. 28.</note> the women
that followed after him to weepe or expresse
any passion of willingnesse for his death. Thus
did hee in his passion, and still doth in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
really, perfectly, and most willingly
give himselfe unto his Church. In somuch as
that the Oyle of that unction which consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him unto that bitter worke, is called an
Oyle<note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 1. 9.</note> of gladnesse. So then Christ freely
offreth both in himselfe Originally, and in his
Sacraments Instrumentally, all grace sufficient
for nurishment unto life, to as many as reach
forth to receive or entertaine it.</p>

which is betwixt him and those things

<hi>Physicall, common,</hi> or <hi>costly,</hi> either for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing,
or for the supporting, or for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting

those excellent properties of good<note n="p" place="margin">

<hi>Aristotle</hi> hath observed, either to conserve
nature entire, or to restore it when it hath
beene violated, or to prevent diseases ere they
creep upon it. And all these benefits do the
faithfull receive by Christ. First, his body and
blood is an Antidote against all infections of
sin, or feare of death. When he said, Feare<note n="q" place="margin">Matth. 14. 27.</note>
not, it is I. It was an argument of comfort
which no temptation could repell. Secondly,
it hath a purging and purifying property. The<note n="r" place="margin">1 Iohn 1. 7.</note>
blood of Christ clenseth us from all sinne.
Thirdly, it hath a quickning, preserving, and
strengthning power. Christ<note n="s" place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note> is our life, and
our<note n="t" place="margin">Col. 3. 3, 4.</note> life is hid with Christ<hi rend="sup">u</hi>, and Christ liveth
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:12557:33"/>
in us, and he hath quickned<note n="w" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 5.</note> us together
with Christ, and we are<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 4. 13.</note> able to do all things
through Christ that strengtheneth us. And
lastly, it hath a joying and delighting proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
I rejoyce<note n="b" place="margin">Gal. 6. 14.</note> in nothing but in the Crosse of
Christ: I count<note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 3. 8. Phil. 4. 4.</note> all things dung that I may
winne Christ, and I protest<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 31.</note> by our rejoycing
which we have in Christ. Whether we want

us, or sweet meats to delight us, Christ
is unto us all in all, our <hi>health,</hi> our <hi>strength,</hi>
our <hi>joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the Sacrament is eaten and
drunken, to signifie the necessity we stand in
of Christ crucified: many things there are
usuall in the life of man both for delight and
profit; beautifull and pleasant objects for the
eye; melody and harmony for the eare; oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and odours for the smell; curiosities
and luxuriancies of invention for the fancie:
but there is no faculty of nature that doth so
immediately concurre to the support and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of the whole man, as the sense of
<hi>Tasting,</hi> which is, as it were the Sluce &amp; in-let
to life; without which we have not so much as
a capacity of that delight, which other objects
of an inferiour and subordinate nature can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford:
even so many things there<note n="e" place="margin">Eccl. 2. 24. 3. 12. 22. 5. 17.</note> are where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the children of God may and ought to take
pleasure and solace, even as many as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
from God for blessing; but there
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:12557:33"/>
is nothing in the world which is the object
and principle of our life, but only Christ: no
quality in man, which is the Instrument and
Organ of our life, but onely a lively and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
faith, by which only we taste<note n="f" place="margin">Crede et man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducasti. Aug. in Iohan.</note> how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
the Lord is. The just<note n="g" place="margin">Hab. 2.</note> shall live by

Eagles flye, that they may eat and live.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Sacrament is eaten and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to shew unto us the greedy <hi>desire</hi> which
is and ought to be in the hearts of Beleevers
towards Christ crucified. There is no one
faculty in man will so much put to its utmost
for procuring satisfaction, as this of Tasting if
once brought into anguish or straits. Because

with famine; and therefore no power
of nature more importunate and clamorous
for satisfaction; no motive stronger to worke
a love, and attempt a conquest on any nation,
than an experience of such excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
as may from thence be obtained for
the releeving of this one faculty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Almighty God when he would provoke
the people to forsake <hi>Egypt,</hi> and comfort
them with the newes of a better Countrey,
describes it by the plenty that it brought
forth; I<note n="m" place="margin">Exod. 3. 17.</note> will bring you to a Land which
floweth with Milke and Honey. And when
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:12557:34"/>
the people murmured against God in the
Wildernesse, all that hatred of <hi>Egypt</hi> which
the tyranny of the Land had wrought in them,
all the toyle and servitude that was redoubled
on them, was wholly swallowed up by the
one consideration of flesh-pots<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 16. 3. Numb. 11. 5.</note> and Onions
which they there enjoyed. And<note n="c" place="margin">Num. 13. 21. 24.</note> when by
Gods appointment Spies were sent into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
to enquire of the goodnesse of the Land,
their Commission was to bring of the fruit of
the Land unto the people, that thereby they
might be encouraged unto a desire of it. And
we finde how the Roman Emperours did
strictly prohibit the transportation of Wine,
or Oile, or other pleasant commodities unto
barbarous Nations, left they might prove ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temptations to some mischievous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
than matters of mutuall intercourse and
trafique. No marvell then if the Sacrament
of Christ crucified, who was to be the <hi>Desire</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Hag. 2. 8.</note>
                  <hi>of all Nations,</hi> the desire of whom was not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to transcend and surpasse, but even (after a
sort) to nullifie<note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1. Mat. 13. 44, 45. Luke 18. 28 Phil. 3. 7, 8.</note> all other desires, be received
with that faculty which is the seat of the most
eager and importunate desire.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we eat and drink the Sacrament,
to intimate unto us the conformity of the
faithfull unto Christ. As in all the appeties
and propensions of naturall things we finde an
innate amity, betwixt the natures that doe so
incline towards, or imbrace one another, so
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:12557:34"/>
principally in this maine appetite unto food,
is there ever found a proportion betweene
nature and its nourishment: insomuch, that
young<note n="a" place="margin">Clem. Alex. Paedag. 1. l. c. 6.</note> Infants are nourished with that very
matter of which their substance consisteth.
Whatsoever hath repugnant qualities unto
nature, she is altogether impatient of it, and
is never quieted till one way or other she dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthen
her selfe. And thus is it, and ought
to be betwixt Christ and the faithfull; there
is a conspiracy<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 6. 4, 5. Rom. 8. 17. 1 Cor. 15. 49 2 Cor. 3. 18. Phil. 3. 10. Phil. 3. 20.</note> of affections, motions, passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
desires, a conformity of being in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
as well as in nature, a similitude, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation,
and communion with Christ in his
death, sufferings, glory. All other things in
the world are very unsuitable to the desires of
faith, nor are able to satiate a soule which
hath tasted Christ, because we finde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in them of a different, yea, repugnant
nature, unto that pretious faith by him infus'd:<note place="margin">Luke 5. 39.</note>

unto which different diffusions of

his Attributes, God (without any impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Immensity) may be said to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
to depart, and to turne away from his
Creature, as the words are every where in
the Scriptures used. Thus is God united to
the creature in generall, by the right of a Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator,
upholding<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3.</note> all things by his mighty
word, without the participation whereof
they could not but be annihilated and resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into their first nothing: but besides, there
is a more distinct and nobler kind of union
unto his more excellent Creature, man? for
as there are some things which partake only
of the vertue and efficacy, others which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the Image and nature of the Sunne;
as the bowels of the earth recceive only the
vertue, heat and influence, but the beame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the very Image and forme of it, light:
so in the creatures, some partake of God only
as an Agent, as depending on his eternall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
from whence they did originally issue,
and by which they doe now still subsist, and so
receive only some common Impressions and
foot prints of divine vertue, whereby they
declare<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 19. 1.</note> his glory, others partake of the
Image<note n="l" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 24.</note> of God, of the divine<note n="m" place="margin">2. Pet. 1. 4.</note> nature as Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> speaks, and receive from him those two

speciall properties wherein principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
the Image of God, <hi>holinesse</hi> and <hi>happinesse,</hi>
that giving perfection to our working, and
this to our being, (which two satisfie the
whole compasse of a created desire) and so
declare his love; some acknowledge God as
their maker, others as their Father, in them
is dependance and gubernation only, in these
is cognition and inheritance. The bond of
this more speciall union of the reasonable
creature unto God, was originally the Law
of mans creation, which did prescribe unto
him the forme, and limits of his working, and
subordination unto God, which knot he by
his voluntary aversation violating and unty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
there did immediately ensue a dis-union
between God and man, so saies the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,

long as they are by the naturall bonds of
joynts and sinewes united to the whole, doe
receive from the fountaines of life, the heart
and the braine, all comfortable supplies for
life and motion, which are due unto them;
but being once dissolved and broken off,
there then ceaseth all the interest which they
had in the principall parts: so as long as man
by obedience to the Law, did preserve the
union between God and him intire, so long
had he an evident participation of all those
graces spirituall, which were requisite to the

his parts unto another Prince, even

generall unto all, or speciall unto some, in
which he did either more expressely manifest

we may observe something generall whereby
he is united to the whole mankind, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
speciall whereby he is united unto his
Church, and that after a double manner; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and necessary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, besides this, there is a farther <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
of Christ unto all the Professors of his
truth in knowledge and explicite faith, which
is by a farther operation infusing into them
the light of truth, and some generall graces

               <p>Thirdly, there is a more speciall and neere

of one and the selfe-same spirit, which
spirit conveighs to the faithfull, whatsoever
in Christ is communicable unto them. For as
the members naturall of man are all conserv'd
in the integrity and unity of one body, by that
reasonable soule which animates, enlivens,
and actuates them, by one simple and undivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

to him, and our knowledge of him shall

               <p>Sixtly, <hi>we eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> the Sacrament of
Christs Passion, that thereby we may expresse
that more closse and sensible <hi>pleasure</hi> which
the faithfull enjoy in receiving of him. For
there is not any one sense whose pleasure is
more constant and expresse, than this of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting:
the reasons whereof are manifest. For
first it followes by the consequence of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites,
that that faculty when fully satisfied,
must needs be sensible of the greatest plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
whose penury &amp; defect brings the extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest
anguish on nature. For the evill of any
thing being nothing else but an obliquity and
aberration from that proper good to which it
is oppos'd. It must needs follow, that the
greater the extent and degrees of an evill are,
the more large must the measure of that good
be in the distance from which that evill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:12557:40"/>
Now it is manifest that the evill of
no senses is so oppressive and terrible unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as are those which violate the taste and
touch (which later is ever annexed to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;)
no ugly spectacles for the eyes, no
howles or shrikings for the eare, no stench or
infection of aire for the smell, so distastefull,
through all which the anguish of a famine
would not make a man adventure to purchase
any food, though affected even with<note n="a" place="margin">Moriens<expan>

qualities. Secondly, the pleasure which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
takes in any good thing, is caused by the
union thereof to the faculty, by meanes
whereof it is enjoyed; so that the greater the
union is, the more necessarily is the pleasure
of the thing united. Now there is not any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
whose object is more closely united un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it than this of Tasting: in Seeing, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
or Smelling, there may be a farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
betweene us and the things that do so
affect us, but no tasting without an immediate
application of the object to the faculty. Other
objects satisfie though without me, but meats
never content nor benefit till they be taken
in. Even so is it with Christ and the faithfull:
many things there are which affect them with
pleasure, but they are without, and at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;

and actions, restore us unto our

were at first open to let in death, may now
much more be open, not only to receive, but
to praise him, who is made unto us the Author

Certainly we come unto God, either as unto a
Physitian, or as to a Judge: wee must needs
bring soules either full of sores to be cured, or
full of sins to be condemned. Againe, in that
this Rock of ours was <hi>broken,</hi> we know whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to flie in case of tempest and oppression,
even unto the holes<note n="e" place="margin">Cant. 2. 14.</note> of the Rock for succor.
To disclaime our owne sufficiency, to disavow
any confidence in our owne strength, to flie
from Church treasures and supererrogations
and to lay hold on him in whom were the
treasures<note n="f" place="margin">Col. 2. 3.</note>, the fulnes<note n="g" place="margin">Col. 1. 19.</note> of all grace<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 1. 16.</note>, of which
fulnesse we all receive; to forsake the private
Lampes of the wisest Virgins, the Saints and
Angels, which have not light enough to shine
into anothers house; and to have recourse
only unto the Sonne of righteousnesse, the
light not of a House, but of the World, who
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:12557:44"/>
inlightneth every man that commeth into it.
Think when thou seest these Elements bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
that even then thou applyest thy lips un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his bleeding wounds, and doest from thence
suck salvation. That even then with <hi>Thomas</hi>
thy hand is in his side, from whence thou
mayest pluck out those words of life, <hi>My God,
my God;</hi> that even then thou seest in each
wound a mouth open, and in that mouth the
blood, as a visible<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 12, 24.</note> prayer to intercede with
God the Father for thee, and to solicite him
with stronger cries for salvation, than did
<hi>Abels</hi> for revenge. Let not any sins, though
never so bloody, so numberlesse, deterre thee
from this pretious Fountaine. If it be the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Christs blood to wash away sinne,
then is it his greatest glory to wash away
the greatest sins. Thy <hi>sinne</hi> indeed is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of Gods <hi>hate,</hi> but the <hi>misery</hi> which sinne
brings upon thee is the object of his <hi>pitty.</hi> O
when a poore distressed soule, that for many
yeares together hath securely weltered in a
sinck of numberlesse and noisome lusts, and
hath even beene environed with a Hell of
wickednesse, shall at last, having received a

terrors of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>,
cast away his rags, crouch and crawle unto the
throne of grace, solicite Gods mercy with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:12557:45"/>
strong cries for one drop of that blood which
is never cast away, when powred into sinfull
and sorrowfull soules, how think we will the
bowels of Christ turne within him? How will
he hasten to meet such an humbled soule? to
embrace him in those armes which were
stretched on the Crosse for him, and to open
unto him that inexhausted Fountaine, which
even delighteth to mix it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>elfe with the teares
of sinners? Certainly, if it were possible for
any one of Christs wounds to be more preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
than the rest, even that should be opened
wide, and powred out into the soule of such a
penitent. Yea, if it might possibly be, that the
sins of all the World could be even throng'd
into the conscience of one man, and the
whole guilt of them made proper and perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
unto him, yet if such a man could bee
brought to sue for grace in the mediation of
Christs broken body, there would thence issue
balme enough to cure, blood enough to wash
and to drowne them all. Only let not us sin,
because grace abounds; let not us make work
for the blood of Christ, and go about by crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and presumptuous sins, as it were to pose
Gods mercy. The blood of Christ, if spilt
and trampled under foot, will certainly cry
so much lowder than <hi>Abels</hi> for vengeance, by
how much it is the more pretious. It may be
as well <hi>upon</hi> us, as <hi>in</hi> us. As the vertue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Christs blood is <hi>in</hi> those that imbrace
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:12557:45"/>
it unto life and happinesse, so is the guilt of it
<hi>upon</hi> those that despise it unto wretchednesse
and condemnation.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in that Christ <hi>gave</hi> and <hi>delivered</hi>
these mysteries unto the Church<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> we likewise
must learne not to ingrosse our selves, or our
owne gifts, but freely to dedicate them all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the honour of that God and benefit of that
Church, unto which he gave both himselfe
and them. Even nature hath made men to
stand in need of each other, and therefore
hath imprinted in them a naturall<note n="a" place="margin">Arist polit. l. 1.</note> inclination
unto fellowship, and society, in one common
City: by Christ we are all made of one City<note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 2. 19. 21.</note>,
of one houshold, yea, of one Church, of one
Temple<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 6. 19. 1 Pet. 2. 5.</note>. He hath made us members<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 12.</note> of one
body, animated by one<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 13. Rom. 8. 11. Eph. 4. 4.</note> and the same Spirit;
stones<note n="f" place="margin">1. Pet. 2. 5.</note> of one entire building, united on one
and the same foundation<note n="g" place="margin">Eph. 2. 20. 1 Cor. 3. 11.</note>; branches<note n="h" place="margin">Iohn 15. 2.</note> of one
undivided stock, quickned<note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 11. 16, 17, 18.</note> by one and the
same root, and therefore requires from us all
a mutuall support, succour, sustentation, and
nourishment, of each other a kind of trafique,
and continuall intelligence from part to part;
a union of members by the supply of nerves<note n="k" place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note>
and joynts, that so each may be serviceable
unto the whole. The eye seeth not for it self,
but for the body; and therefore if the eye<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 6. 22.</note> be
simple, the whole body is full of light, for the
light of the body is the eye. Nay, God in
each creature imprinteth a love of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12557:46"/>
(which is that whereby one thing doth as it
were bestow it selfe on another) farre above
the private and domestick love, whereby it
labours the preservation and advancement of
it selfe: from which generall charity and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of communion it comes to passe, that if
by any casualty the whole body of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
be like to suffer any rupture or defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
(as in the danger of a <hi>vacuum,</hi> which is
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>tumely of nature) each particular crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is taught to relinquish his owne naturall

even by forsaking and forgetting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Agreeable unto which noble impresse

the fruition of God an infinite Good, and

whereby the gift is convayed. The labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
doth not deserve his wages because hee
receives it, but hee receives it because hee
hath before deserv'd it, receiving convayeth,
it doth not merit it. Neither is salvation gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us for our faith in the vertue of a work,
but onely because of that respect and relation
which it hath unto him who trod the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
alone, without any assisting or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting
cause. Even <hi>Adam</hi> in innocenry could
not be without an Assent and firme beleefe
that the faithfull God would performe the
promise of life made and annexed unto the
Covenant of workes: But this faith could
not be the merit of life, but the fruit and
effect of merit anteceding; for his perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the Law (in the right whereof hee
had interest unto glory) preceding, there
should immediatly from thence have issued,
by faith, a prepossession (as it were) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehension
of that glory which by vertue
of that legall obedience he should have had
interest unto; so that it is repugnant absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the nature of faith to be any way the
cause meritorious of salvation, it being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but the application and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of that salvation, which in vaine our
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:12557:49"/>
faith layeth claime unto, unlesse in the right
of some anteceding worke either our owne
or some others in our behalfe it be first meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for us. Hee which beleeves and so by
consequence layes hold on life, without a
ground preceding for his claime thereunto,
is a robber rather than a Beleever, and doth
rather steale heaven than deserve it, though
hee is not likely so to speed,<note n="a" place="margin">Math. 6. 20.</note> for in heaven
theeves break not through nor steale. Again,
suppose Faith, in the quality of the worke,
should merit that, which untill merited can
in truth be never by Faith apprehended, yet
in as much as nothing can merit for another
any farther than as it is his owne proper
worke,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 29.</note> Faith therefore being not within the
compasse either of naturall or of acquir'd
endowments, but proceeding from a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall
and infused Grace, it is manifest that
even so, it cannot possibly obtaine salvation
by any vertue or efficacie of its owne. For as
hee which bestowes money on his poore

which hee gave, may be thus farre said ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

we see how we should use this pretious gift

and quality of this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
it followes in Order
to treate of the <hi>Ends</hi> or <hi>Effects</hi>
thereof, on which depends its necessity, and
our comfort: our Sacraments are nothing else
but Euangelicall Types or shadowes of some
more perfect substance; for as the Legall Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
were the<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 10. 1.</note> shadowes of Christ expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
and wrapped up in a Cloude of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting,
and in the loines of his Predecessors:
so this new mysticall Sacrifice of the Gospell
is a shadow of Christ risen indeed, but yet hid
from us under the Cloud of those Heavens
which shall containe him untill the dissolution
of all things; for the whole heavens are but
as one great cloud which intercept the lustre
of that Sunne of Righteousnesse who enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth
every one that commeth into the world:
now shadowes are for the refreshing of us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the lustre of any light unto which the
weaknesse of the sense is yet disproportioned:
as there are many things for their owne smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:12557:54"/>
imperceptible, so some for their magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
doe exceed the power of sense, and have
a transcendency in them which surpasseth the
comprehension of that faculty unto which
they properly belong. No man can in one
simple view looke upon the whole vaste frame
of Heaven, because he cannot at the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
receive the species of so spreading and
diffused an Object, so is it in things Divine,
some of them are so above the reach of our
imperfect faculties, as that they swallow up
the understanding, and make not any immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
impression on the Soule, betweene which
and their excellency there is no great dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.

                  <hi>disproportion</hi> useth in all things
to arise from a double Cause; the one naturall,
being the limited Constitution of the faculty
whereby even in its best sufficiency, it is disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for the perception of too excellent an
Object, as are the eyes of an Owle in respect
of the Sunne.</p>
               <p>The other Accidentall, namely by some
violation and distemper of the faculty even
within the compasse of its owne strength; as
in sorenesse of eyes in regard of light, or
lamenesse in regard of motion.<note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 3. 16.</note> Great cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

observable.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:12557:54"/>
For first of all, man while he is on the earth,
a Traveller towards that Glory which yet he
never saw, and which the tongue of<note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 4.</note> Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> himselfe could not utter is altogether e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in his highest pitch of Perfection unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
to comprehend the excellent mystery of
Christ either crucified, or much more, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied:
and therefore our manner of assenting
in this life, though in regard of the authority
on which it is grounded (which is Gods owne
Word) it be most evident and infallible, yet in
its owne quality it is not so immediate, and
expresse as is that which is elsewhere reserved
for us;<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 19.</note> for hereafter we shall know even as
we are knowne, <hi>by a knowledge of Vision,</hi> fruiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and possession, heere darkly, by stooping
and captivating our understandings unto those
divine Reports which are made in Scripture,
which is a knowledge of Faith, distance and
expectation; wee doe I say, heere bend our
understandings to assent unto such truths as
doe not transmit any immediate species or
irradiation of their owne upon them, but there
our understandings shall be raised unto a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
capacity, and bee made able without a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary
report and conveyance to apprehend
clearely those glorious Truths, the evidence
whereof it did heere submit unto, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
credit of God, who in his Word had
revealed, and by his Spirit obsignated the
same unto them; as the<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Samaritans</hi> knew
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:12557:55"/>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> at first, onely by the report of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
which was an assent of Faith, but after
when they saw his Wonders, and heard his
Words, they knew him by himselfe, which
was an assent of vision.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as the Church is heere but a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling
Church, therfore cannot possibly have
any farther knowledge of that Countrey whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it goes but onely by the Mappes which
describe it, the Word of God, and these<note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 13. 21.</note> few
fruites which are sent unto them from it, the
<note n="c" place="margin">Gal 5.</note>fruits of the Spirit, whereby they have some
taste and relish of the World to come: so
moreover is it even in this estate, by being
enclosed in a body of sinne, (which hath a
darkning property in it, and addes unto the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
limitednesse of the understanding, an
accidentall defect and sorenesse) much disabled
from this very imperfect assent unto Christ
the Object of its Faith: for as sinne when it
wastes the Conscience and beares Rule in the
Soule, hath a power like <hi>Dalila</hi> and the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines,</hi>
to put out our eyes, (as<note n="d" place="margin">Hom. Odyss. l. 9.</note>

conveying all morall truths to the Soule, as
some concave glasses use to represent the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of things to the eye, not according to
their naturall rectitude or beauty, but with
those wrestings, inversions, and deformities
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:12557:55"/>
which by the indisposition thereof they are
framed unto; so even the least corruptions
unto which the best are subject, (having a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
antipathy to the evidence and power of
divine Truth) doe necessarily in some manner
distemper our understandings, and make such
a degree of sorenesse in the faculty as that it
cannot but so farre forth bee impatient and
unable to beare that glorious lustre which shines
immediately in the Lord Christ. So then we
see what a great disproportion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
us and Christ immediately presented;
and from thence wee may observe our necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Gods mercy in affoording us the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment
of a <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Shadow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Shadowes were to the Church of
the <hi>Iewes</hi> many, because their weaknesse in the
knowledge of Christ was of necessity more
than ours, in as much as they were but an<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 3.</note> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant,
wee an adult and growne Church, and
they looked on Christ at a distance, wee neare
at hand, hee being already incarnate; unto us
they are the Sacraments of his Body and Bloud
in the which wee see and receive Christ as
weake eies doe the light of the Sunne, through

one maine and principall end of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to bee an instrument fitted unto the

being a thing of so important consequence

It will not be impertinent to make some short

in the vertue of his Godhead an infinite and
unlimited Presence, whereby hee so filleth all
places as that hee is not contained or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in them, which immensity of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him intimately present with all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
is that whereby they are quickened, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and conserved by him; for by him all
things consist, and hee upholdeth them all by
the Word of his power, and in him they live
and move and have their being. But this is not
that Presence which in the Sacrament wee
affirme, because that presupposeth a Presence of
Christ in and according to that nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was the Redeemer of the World, which
was his humane nature. Yet in as much as this
his humane nature subsisteth not but in and
with the infinitenesse of the second Person;
there is therefore (in the second place) by the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:12557:58"/>
                  <hi>Lutherans</hi> framed another imaginary Presence
of Christs humane Body, (after once the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
was pleased to derive glory in fulnesse
on it) which giveth it a participated ubiquity
unto it too, by meanes whereof Christ is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally
<hi>in</hi> or <hi>under</hi> the Sacrament all Elements.
But this opinion as it is no way agreeable with
the truth of the humane nature of Christ, so is
it greatly injurious to his Divinity: for first,
though Christs humane nature was in regard of
its Production extraordinary, and in regard of
the sacred union which it had with the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
admirable, and in regard of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of glory from the Godhead, and of the
unction of the Holy Ghost farre above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
names that are named in heaven or earth,
yet in its nature did it ever retaine the essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and primi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ive properties of a created sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
which is to bee in all manner of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
finite, and so by consequence in place
too, for glory destroies not nature, but exalts it,
nor exalts it to any farther degrees of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
than are compatible to the finitenesse of
a Creature, who is like unto us in regard of all
naturall and essentiall properties<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but these
men give unto Christs Body farre more than
his owne divine nature doth, for hee glorifies
it onely to bee the Head, that is, the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and first-borne of every Creature, but
they glorifie it so farre as to make it share in
the essentiall properties of the divine nature;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:12557:58"/>
for as that substance unto whom the intrinsecall,
unseparated, and essentiall properties of a
man belong, is a man necessarily (man being
nothing else but a substance so qualified) so
that being unto which the divine attributes
doe belong in that degree of infinitenesse as
they doe to the divine Person it selfe must
needs bee God; and immensity wee know is
a proper attribute of the Divinity, implying
infinitenesse, which is Gods owne Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
neither can the distinction of ubiquity
communicated, and originall or essentiall salve
the consequence: for God is by himselfe so
differenced from all the Creatures, as that it
is not possible any attribute of his should bee
participated by any Creature in that manner
of infinitenesse as it is in him; nay it implies an
inevitable contradiction that in a finite nature
there should bee roome enough for an infinite
attribute. We confesse that in as much as the
humane nature in Christ is inseparably taken
into the subsistence of the omnipresent Sonne
of God; It is therefore a truth to say, That
the Sonne of God, though filling all places,
is not yet in any of them separated or asunder
from the humane nature, may by the vertue
of the communication of the properties; it is
true likewise to say that the <hi>Man Christ</hi> is in
all Places, though not <hi>in</hi> or <hi>according</hi> to his
humane nature. But now from the union of the
Manhood to the Godhead to argue a coexten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:12557:59"/>
or joynt-presence therewith is an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
argument, as may appeare in other
things. The Soule hath a kinde of immensity
in her little world, being in each part thereof
whole and entire, and yet it followes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Soule is united to the Body, that
therefore the Body must needs partake of this
Omnipresence of the Soule, else should the
whole body be in the little finger, because the
Soule unto which it is united is wholly there.
Againe, there is an unseparable union betweene
the Sunne and the beame, so that it is infallibly
true to say, the Sunne is no where severed
from the beame, yet wee know they both oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy
a distinct place: againe, Misle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>oe is so
united to the substance of the Tree out of
which it groweth, that (though of a different
nature) it subsisteth not but in and by the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence
of the Tree, and yet it hath not that
amplitude of place which the Tree hath.</p>
               <p>Letting goe then this opinion, there is a
third <hi>Presence</hi> of Christ, which is a <hi>carnall</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall,
locall <hi>Presence,</hi> which wee affirme his
humane nature to have onely in Heaven: The
Papists attribute it to the Sacrament, because
Christ hath said, This is my Body: and in
matters of fundamentall consequence, hee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
no figurative or darke speeches; to this
wee say, that it is a carnall Doctrine, and a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
like that of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and of <hi>Origen,</hi>
from the Spirit to the letter. And for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:12557:59"/>
it is none to men that have more than
onely a carnall eare to heare it: for what dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
is it to say that then the King gives a
man an Office when hee hath sealed him such
a Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ent in the right whereof that Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth,
and is conveyed unto him? And if
Christ bee thus locally in the Sacrament, and
eaten with the mouth, and so conveyed into
the stomacke: I then demand what becomes
of him when and after hee is thus received
into the stomacke? If hee retire from the
accidents out of a man, then first accidents
shall be left without any substance at all under
them to sustaine them, and which is (if any
thing can bee) yet more absurd, bare accidents
should nourish, bee assimulated and augment a
substance; for it is plaine, that a man might
bee nourished by the Bread; yea, the Priest by
intemperate excesse made drunke with the
consecrated Wine; unto which detestable
effects wee cannot imagine that God by a
more especiall concurrence and miracle would
enable the bare accidents of Bread and Wine.
But if Christ stay, and doe corporally unite
himselfe to the Receiver; then I see not how
all they that receive the Sacrament, being phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sically
and substantially united to Christs Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
have not likewise a naturall union to his
Person too, that being no where separated
from this, which is blasphemous to affirme.</p>
               <p>Secondly, how Christs Body may not bee
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:12557:60"/>
said to have a double subsistence, Infinite in the
second Person, and Finite in all those with
whom he is Incorporated.</p>
               <p>Leaving then this as a fleshly conceit, wee
come to a fourth <hi>Presence</hi> of Christ which is
by <hi>Energy</hi> and power; thus where two or three
bee gathered together in his Name,<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> Christ is
in the middest of them by the powerfull wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of his holy Spirit; even as the Sunne is
present to the Earth, in as much as by its influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and benignity it heateth and quickeneth
it. For all manner of operation is by some
manner of <hi>Contact</hi> betweene the Agent and
the Patient, which cannot bee without some
manner of <hi>presence</hi> too; but the last manner of
Presence is a <hi>Sacramentall Relative,</hi> mysticall
Presence. Understand it thus, The King is in
his Court or Presence-chamber onely <hi>locally,</hi>
and physically; but <hi>representatively</hi> he is where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
his Chancellour or subordinate Judges
are, in as much as whatsoever they in a Legall
and judiciall course doe determine, is accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him as his owne personall act, as being
an effect of that power, which though in them
as the instruments, doth yet originally reside
no where but in his owne Person; just so
Christ is locally in Heaven, which must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
him till the restitution of all things, yet
having instituted these Elements for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
as it were of his absence, hee is accompted
present with them, in as much as they which
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:12557:60"/>
receive them with that reverend and faithfull
affection as they would Christ himselfe doe
together with them, receive him too, <hi>really</hi>
and <hi>truly,</hi> though not <hi>carnally</hi> or <hi>physically,</hi> but
after a <hi>mysticall</hi> and <hi>spirituall</hi> manner. <hi>A reall
Presence</hi> of Christ wee acknowledge, but not a
<hi>locall</hi> or <hi>physicall;</hi> for <hi>Presence reall</hi> (that being
a metaphysicall terme) is not opposed unto a
meere physicall or locall absence, or distance,
but is opposed to a false imaginary, phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke
presence; for if reall presence may bee
understood of nothing but a carnall and locall
presence, then that speech of Christ, Where
two or three bee gathered together in my
Name, there am I in the middest of them;
cannot have any reall Trueth in it, because
Christ is not locally in the middest of them.
This reall Presence being thus explained may
bee thus proved, The maine end of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(as shall be shewed) is to unite the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto Christ, to which union there must of
necessity be a Presence of Christ by meanes of
the Sacrament, which is the instrument of that
union. Such then as the union is, such must
needs bee the presence too: since Presence is
therefore only necessary that by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
that union may be effected. Now united unto
Christ we are not carnally, or physically, as the
meat is to the body, but after a mysticall manner,
by joynts and sinewes, not fleshly but spirituall:
even as the faithfull are united to each other in
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:12557:61"/>
one mysticall Body of Christ, into one holy
<note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 2. 5.</note>spirituall Building, into one fruitfull olive,
into a holy, but mysticall marriage with Christ.
Now what Presence fitter for a <hi>Spirituall union</hi>
than a <hi>spirituall presence.</hi> Certainly, to confine
Christ unto the narrow compasse of a piece of
Bread, to squeeze and contract his Body into
so strait a roome, and to grinde him betweene
our teeth is to humble him (though now glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified)
lower than hee humbled himselfe, hee
himselfe to the forme of a servant, but this to
the condition of a monster. That Presence
then of Christ which in the Sacrament wee
acknowledge is not <hi>any grosse Presence of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription,</hi>
as if Christ Jesus in Body lay hid
under the accidents of Bread and Wine; as if
hee who was<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 20. 20. 27.</note> wont to use the senses for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and proofe of his Presence,<note place="margin">Luk. 24. 39.</note> did now hide
from them,<note place="margin">Matth. 28. 6.</note> yea deceive them under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of that which hee is not; but it is a
<hi>spirituall Presence, of energie, power, and concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy</hi>
with the Element, by which Christ doth
appoint that <hi>by</hi> and <hi>with</hi> these mysteries, though
not <hi>in</hi> or <hi>from</hi> them, his sacred Body should
bee conveyed into the faithfull Soule: and
such a Presence of Christ in <hi>power,</hi> though ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in flesh as it is most compatible with the
properties of a humane Body, so doth it most
make for the demonstration of his power, who

nor stint of merit, nor bounds of efficacy, nor

why may not hee, I say, really unite himselfe

               <p>The second End or Effect of this Sacrament
which in order of Nature immediately follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth

the mysticall union of the Church un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

which infuseth the reasonable soule (which
is the first act or principle of life naturall) doth
also unite it unto the body, to the making up
of one man; so the same Sacrament which
doth exhibite Christ unto us (who is the first
act and originall of life divine) doth also unite
us together unto the making up of one Church.

was generall from the benefit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

Baptisme my right is made personall, and I
now lay claime unto Christ not onely in the
right of his common Promise, but by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
of this particular Washing, which sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
and ratifieth the Covenant unto mee.
Thus is our first union unto Christ wrought,
by the grace of the Covenant effectively, and
by the grace of Baptisme (where it may bee
had) Instrumentally, the one giving unto
Christ, the other obsignating and exhibiting
that right by a farther admission of us into
his Body. But now wee must conceive that as
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:12557:63"/>
there is a union unto Christ, so there must, as
in naturall bodies, be after that union, a<note n="e" place="margin">Eph. 4. 13. 15.</note> gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
up, till wee come to our <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the measure
of the fulnesse of Christ. This growth being
an effect of the vitall faculty is more or lesse
perfected in us, as that is either more or lesse
stifled or cherished: for as in the soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
so in Christ and the Church. We are not to
conceive the union without any latitude, but
capable of augmentation, and liable to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
diminutions, according as are the severall
meanes which for either purpose wee apply
unto our selves. The union of the soule and
body, though not dissolved, is yet by every
the least distemper slackned, by some violent
diseases almost rended asunder, so that the
body hath sometimes more, sometimes lesse
hold-fast of the soule; so heere wee are in the
Covenant and in Baptisme united unto Christ;
but wee must not forget that in men there is
by Nature a<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 12. 15.</note> roote of bitternesse, whence
issue those<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> fruites of the flesh, a spawne and
wombe of actuall corruptions, where sinne is
daily<note n="c" place="margin">Jam. 1. 15.</note> conceived and brought forth, a <hi>mare
mortuum,</hi> a lake of death, whence continually
arise all manner of noysome and infectious
lusts; by meanes of which our Union to
Christ (though not dissolved) is yet daily
weakened and stands in need of continuall
confirmation; for every sinne doth more or
lesse smother and stoppe the principle of life in
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:12557:63"/>
us, so that it cannot worke our growth which
we must rise unto with so free and interrupted
a course as otherwise it might. The Principle
of life in a Christian is the very same from
whence Christ himselfe according to his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Graces receiveth life, and that is the<note n="d" place="margin">Gal. 4. 6. Rom. 8. 2.</note> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

not more in being, than in affections

now Christ hath redeemed us from this estate

us by one uniforme rule his holy Word, and
by one vitall Principle his holy Spirit; wee
are by the meanes of this holy Sacrament
after the same manner reunited into one spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall

hath ever beene the Wisedome of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

annexed unto this Sacrament in the Primitive
times, notwithstanding for superstitious abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses

delightfull affection arising from an attractive
power in the goodnesse of some excellent
Object, unto which it endeavoureth to cleave

argument of hellish hypocrisie in <hi>Iudas,</hi> and an
imitation of his father the Divell, (who trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth

holy symbole of love for the instrument of a
hatred so much the more devilish than any,
by how much the object of it was the more

               <p>Thirdly, after the celebration of the divine
Mysteries, the Christians, to testifie their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
love to each other, did eate in common
together; which Feasts from that which they
did signifie (as the use of God and his Church

there were extraordinary oblations and

this present life, expecting the glory which
should be revealed unto them: those did they
make the Treasures of the Church, their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
the hordes and repositaries of their piety,
and such as were orphanes, or widowes, or aged,
or sicke, or in bonds condemned to Mine-pits,
or to the Islands, or desolate places, or darke
Dungeons (the usuall punishments in those
times) with all these were they not ashamed
in this holy worke to acknowledge a unity of
condition, a fellowship and equality in the
spirituall Privileges of the same Head, a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
relation of fellow-members in the same
common Body, unto which if any had grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
right than other, they certainly were the
men, who were conformed unto their Head
in suffering, and did goe to their Kingdome
through the same path of blood which he had
before besprinckled for them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, it was the<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Stuck. An. Conv. lib. 1. ca. 3.</note> custome in any solemne
testimoniall of Peace to receive and exhibite
this holy Sacrament, as the seale and earnest
of that union which the parties whom it did
concerne had betweene themselves. Such hath
ever beene the care of the holy Church in all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:12557:67"/>
the customes and ceremoniall accessions whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of decency or charity which have beene
by it appointed in this holy Sacrament, that
by them and in them all, the concinnation of
the Body of Christ, the fellowship, sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
and unity of his members, might be both
signified and professed: that as wee have all
but one Sacrament, which is the Food of life,
so wee should have but<note n="b" place="margin">

the Spirit of life, and from thence but one
heart, and one minde, thinking, and loving
and pursuing all the same things, through the
same way, by the same rule, to the same end.
And for this reason amongst others I take it,
it is that our Church doth require in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of these Mysteries a uniformity in all
her Members, even in matters that are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
indifferent, that in the Sacrament of u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

               <p>Lastly, if we consider the very act of eating

and the union of the faithfull to each

Besides this small light which shined
from the Passeover on the people of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
and by which they were something though
darkly enabled to behold Christ, was but like
the light in a house or family, which could
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:12557:70"/>
not shine beyond the narrow compasse of that
small people, and therefore it was to bee eaten
in such a<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 12. 46.</note> family, to signifie, as I conceive,
that the Church was then but as a handfull
or houshold in respect of that fulnesse of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> which was to follow. Now then the
Church being to enlarge its borders, and to
bee coextended with the World, it stood in
need of a greater light, even that Sunne of
Righteousnesse, who was now to be as well the
<note n="b" place="margin">Luk. 2. 32.</note>light to lighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as he had beene
formerly the Glory of his People <hi>Israel.</hi> And
therefore we may observe that this second Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
was not to bee eaten in a private sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Family, but the Church was<note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 33.</note> 
                  <hi>to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
and <hi>to stay one for another,</hi> that in the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the People, and the publikenesse of

Church might be expressed. Besides the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
were uninterested in that temporall Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
of the <hi>Iewes</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it being a
particular and nationall benefit, and therefore
the commemoration thereof in the Paschall
Lambe, could not, by them, who in the loines
of their ancestours had not beene there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
be literally and with reflexion on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
celebrated. Requisite therefore in this
respect also it was, in as much as the<note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 14.</note> partition
wall was broken downe, and both <hi>Iew</hi> and
<hi>Gentile</hi> were incorporated into one head,<note place="margin">Hos. 1. 10, 11.</note> that
nationall and particular relations ceasing, such
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:12557:70"/>
a Sacrament might bee reinstituted; wherein
the universall restoring of all mankinde might
bee represented. And certainely for a man at
mid-day to shut his windowes from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the generall light, and to use onely
private lampes of his owne, as it is towards
men madnesse, so it is impiety and Schisme in
Religion. There is betweene the Gospell and
the Legall Ceremonies (as I observed) the
same proportion of difference as is betweene

Creatures must moulder into their first no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
should himselfe dye, and expire, the
frame of Nature still subsisting? that he who
filleth all things with his Presence, should bee
stretched out upon a piece of wood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within a narrow stone? hee who uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all things by his power, should bee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
kept under by that which is nothing, by
death? Certainely, that at which the World
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:12557:73"/>
stood amazed, that which against the course
of Nature brought darkenesse on the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of Light, (which could no longer shine,
when his Glory who derived lustre on it was it
selfe ecclipsed) that which made the earth to
tremble under the burden of so bloudy a sinne,
that which the Angels stoope and looke into
with humble astonishment and adoration,
that which consisteth of so great a combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and confluence of wonders, must needs
make a deepe impression on the Soule, though
hard as Marble, at which the stones themselves
of the Temple did rend asunder.</p>
               <p>Secondly, those things use to make impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions

meanes of that naturall affinity and subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which is betweene them. Observe it in
one passion of <hi>Love,</hi> how it removes the mind
from all other objects, firmely fixing it on one

makes us desire to know more of the object:
the reason whereof is that inseparable union
which Nature hath fixed in all things betweene
the trueth and the good of them; either of
which working on the proper faculty to which
it belongeth, provokes it to set the other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
on worke, either by distinction as from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:12557:74"/>
the understanding to the passion, or by insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
as from the passion to the understanding:
even as fire doth not heate without light, nor
enlighten without heate. Where the treasure
is, the heart cannot bee absent, where the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

bee good I must love it, and where I love the
goodnesse of it I cannot but desire to know it,
all divine objects being as essentially good as
they are true, and<note n="b" place="margin">

of them being as naturally linked as the nerve
is to the part which it moveth, or as the beame

where they have beene loved before, and if in
that case it bee fit that the quantity of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
love should bee the rule and measure of
the latter, how can it bee that our love to him
should not exceed all other love (even<note n="d" place="margin">1 Joh. 14. 19.</note> as hee
justly requireth) since<note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5. 7, 8.</note> greater love than his
hath not beene seene, that a man should neglect
the love of himselfe and lay downe his life for
his enemies. And if we love Christ, that will
naturally lead us to remember him too, who
as he is<note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 1 5. 13.</note> the Life, and so the object of our love;
so is he the<note n="g" place="margin">Ibid.</note> Truth likewise, and so the object
of our knowledge: and therefore the same

               <p>Lastly, those things worke strongly upon
the memory, which doe mainly concerne, and
are beneficiall to man; there is no man, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possessed
of reason, who in sicknesse doth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
the Physician, neither did ever man heare of

is, because wheresoever Nature hath left a
capacity of receiving farther perfection from
some other thing, there she hath imprinted an
appetite to that thing: and there is such a
sympathy betweene the faculties of Nature,
that the indigence of one sets all the rest on
motion to supply it. Now what thing was

yet because the remembrance of Christs
Death heere is nothing else but a recordation
of those unvaluable blessings which by meanes
of it were together with his holy Bloud shed
downe upon the Church, I will touch a little
upon the principall of them.</p>
               <p>That Christ Jesus is unto his Church the

                  </gap>e deny it. Let us then
see by what meanes he doth all this; and wee
will not heere speake of that worke whereby
Christ, having formerly <hi>purchased the Right,</hi>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:12557:75"/>
doth afterwards conferre and actually apply
the benefit and interest of that right unto his
members, which is the worke of his quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Spirit, but onely of those meanes which
hee used to procure the right it selfe, and that
was in generall Christs <hi>Merit.</hi> The whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
of Christ on the earth was nothing
else but a continued merit, proceeding from a
double estate, an estate of <hi>Ignominy</hi> and Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
procuring, and an estate of Exaltation and
<hi>honour</hi> applying his benefits.</p>
               <p>The Passion of Christ was his Death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
I understand not that last act onely of expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but the whole space betweene that and
his Nativity, wherein being<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> subject to the
Law of Death, and to all those<note n="b" place="margin">Esuriens sub diabolo, sitiens sub samaritide, &amp;c. Tert.</note> naturall infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
which were the Harbingers of Death,
hee might in that whole space bee as truly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>A man of Death,</hi> as<note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Zeaman de Imag. Dei in Homine. cap. 8. artic. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> was a dead
man in the vertue of the Curse that very day
beyond which notwithstanding hee lived ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
hundred yeares, that which we call<note n="d" place="margin">Senec. Epist.</note> Death,
being nothing else but the consummation of
it. The estate of exaltation is the Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Christ, whereby the efficacy of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which was on the Crosse consummated is
publikely declared, and his Intercession where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is proposed and presented unto God the
Father as an eternall Price and Prayer in the
behalfe of his Church. Now the Benefits
which by this merit of Christs we receive are
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:12557:76"/>
of severall kindes. Some are Privative, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
in an immunity from all those evils which

sinne or punishment: others are Positive, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
in them a<note n="c" place="margin">

the Prerogatives of the sonnes of God. The
one is called an <hi>Expiation, Satisfaction, Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Deliverance.</hi> The other a <hi>Purchase,</hi> and
free <hi>Donation</hi> of some excellent blessing. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
thus distinguished is either a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of Grace</hi> from the bondage and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny
of <hi>Sinne;</hi> or a <hi>Redemption of Glory,</hi> from
the bondage of <hi>Corruption:</hi> and both these
have their parts and latitudes; for the first,</p>
               <p>In <hi>Sinne</hi> we may consider three things. The
<hi>state</hi> or masse of sinne: the <hi>Guilt</hi> or damnable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of sinne: and the <hi>Corruption,</hi> staine or
deformity of sinne.</p>
               <p>The state of sinne is a state of<note n="a" place="margin">Ephes. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>deadnesse</hi> or
immobility in Nature towards any good:
the understanding is dead and disabled for any
spirituall perception: the will is dead and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
for any holy propension: the affections are
dead and disabled for any pursute: the body dead
and disabled for any obedient Ministery; and the
whole man dead, and by consequence disabled
for any sense of its owne death. And as it is a state
of death, so it is a <hi>state of enmity</hi> too; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in this state wee are the objects of Gods
hatred and detestation: so then, the first part
of our Deliverance respects us as we are in this
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:12557:76"/>
state of death and enmity, and it is (as I said
before) a double Deliverance, <hi>negative</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
us out of this estate; and <hi>positive</hi> by
constituting us in another, which is an estate
of life and reconcilement. First, the<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14. Gen. 6. 5. 2 Cor. 3. 5.</note> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is delivered from the bondage of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
vanity, worldly wisedome, misper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions,
carnall principles, and the like, and
is (after removall of this<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> darknesse, and<note n="d" place="margin">2 Co. 3. 15, 16.</note> vaile)
<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 26. 18.</note>opened to see and acknowledge both its owne
Darkenesse, and the evidence of that Light
which shines upon it. Our wils and affections
are delivered from that disability of embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
or pursuing of divine Objects, and from
that love of darknesse and prosecution of evill
which is naturally in them, and after this, are
wrought unto a sorrow and sense of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
estate, to a desire and love of Salvation,
and of the meanes thereof, with a resolution
to make use of them: and the whole man is
delivered from the estate of Death and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unto an estate of Life and Reconciliation
by being adopted for the sonnes of God: of
these Deliverances Christ is the Authour, who
worketh them (as I observed) by a double <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality,</hi>
the one that whereby he meriteth them,
the other that whereby hee conveyeth and
transfuseth that which hee had merited. This
<hi>conveying cause</hi> is our <hi>Vocation,</hi> wrought by the
<note n="a" place="margin">2 Co. 3. 16, 17 2 Cor. 3. 8.</note>Spirit of Christ effectively, by the<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. 8. Jam. 1. 18. 2 Thess. 2. 14.</note> Word
of Life, and Gospell of Regeneration instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:12557:77"/>
by meanes of both which (this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
as the seed, that other as the formative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
that doth vegetate and quicken the<note n="c" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 23.</note> seed)
are wee from dead men engrafted into Christ,
and of enemies made sonnes and Coheires
with Christ; but the meritorious cause of all
this was that Price which Christ laid downe,
whereby he did ransome us from the estate of
Death, and purchase for us the Adoption of
sonnes; for every Ransome and Purchase
(which are the two acts of our Redemption)
are procured by the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ying downe of some
<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 6, 20.</note>Price valuable to the thing ransomed and
purchased. Now this Price was the precious
Blood of Christ, and the laying downe or
payment of this Bloud was the powring it out
of his sacred Body, and the exhibiting of it
unto his Father in a passive obedience: and this
is to be applied in the other Deliverances.</p>
               <p>The second consideration then of sinne was
the <hi>Guilt of it,</hi> which is, the binding over unto
some punishment prescribed in the Law: so
we have here a double Deliverance, from the
<hi>Guilt of sinne,</hi> and from the <hi>Bondage of the Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, for sinne, though it leave still a <hi>staine</hi>
in the soule, yet the <hi>sting</hi> of it is quite remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
though wee are not perfectly cleansed
from the soile, yet are wee soundly healed
from the mortalnesse and bruises of it.</p>
               <p>Then for the <hi>Law,</hi> wee are first freed from
the<note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Curse</hi> of the Law, It is not unto us a kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:12557:77"/>
letter, nor a word of Death, in as much as
it is not that rule according unto which wee
expect Life.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee are freed from the <hi>Exaction</hi>
of the Law, wee are not necessarily bound to
the rigorous performance of each jot and title
of it, a performance unto which is ever an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
Legall Justification; but our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
though imperfect, are accepted, our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
though sundry are forgiven for his
sake,<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 17.</note> who was<note n="f" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note> under both these Bondages of
Law for our sakes. And as wee are thus deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the <hi>Guilt of sinne,</hi> so are wee far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
endued with <hi>positive Dignities,</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> interest
and propriety to all the Righteousness of
Christ, with which wee are<note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 13. 14.</note> clothed as with
a garment: claime unto all the blessings which
the Law inferres upon due obedience perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to it, and the comforts which from either
of these Title and Prerogatives may ensue.
And this is the second branch of Deliverance,
<hi>conveyed by the act of Iustification,</hi> but merited as
the rest, by the Death of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
               <p>The third consideration of sinne was the
<hi>Corruption</hi> of it, from the which likewise wee
are by Christ delivered, sinne doth not any
more rule, nor raigne, nor lead captive those
who are ingrafted into Christ, though for
their patience, triall, and exercise sake, and
that they may still learne to live by faith, and
to prize mercy, the remnants of it doe cleave
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:12557:78"/>
fast unto our Nature, like the sprigges and
rootes of Ivie to a Wall,<note place="margin">Epiphan.</note> which will never out
till the Wall bee broken downe and new built
againe. Sinne is not like the people of <hi>Ierico</hi>
utterly destroied, but rather like the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>
it liveth still, but in an estate of bondage, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
and decay; and besides this, wee are
inabled to<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 7. 22.</note> love the Law in our inner man,
to delight in it, to performe a ready and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,
though not an exact and perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it, we are made partakers of the divine
Nature, the Graces with which Christ was
anointed doe from him streame downe unto
his lowest members, which of his<note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 1.</note> fulnesse
doe all receive, and are all renewed after
<note n="c" place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note>Gods Image in righteousnesse and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>The next part of our Redemption was
from the <hi>Bondage of Corruption,</hi> unto the<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of Glory,</hi> which likewise is by Christ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
for us, which is a Deliverance from
the Consequents of sinne; for sinne doth
binde over unto punishment, even as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
obedience of the Law would bring a man
unto Glory. Now the <hi>Punishments</hi> due unto
sinne are either <hi>Temporary</hi> or <hi>Eternall,</hi> consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
principally in the oppressions and distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Nature: for as <hi>Sinne</hi> is the <hi>evill</hi> of our
<hi>working,</hi> so <hi>Punishment</hi> is the evill of our <hi>being:</hi>
and it includes not onely bodily and spirituall

<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 3. 13. Phil. 2. 7. Joh. 8. 36. 1 Joh. 1. 7.</note>Curse of the Law, and humbling Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the forme of a servant, that thereby wee
might be made free; this is it which removeth
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:12557:79"/>
all both temporall and eternall punishment
from the faithfull, it having beene a perfect
payment of our whole debt; for in as much
as Christ himselfe said on the Crosse, It is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
wee are to conclude, that the other
worke of Resurrection was not properly an
essentiall part of Christs merit, but onely a
necessary consequent required to make the
Passion applicable and valuable to the Church.
As in coined metals, it is the substance of the
coine, the Gold, or Silver, onely that buyeth
the ware, but the Impression of the Kings I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
is that which makes that Coine to bee
currant and passable, it doth not give the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
or worth to the Gold, but onely the <hi>appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of that value</hi> unto other things: even so
the Resurrection and Intercession of Christ
doe serve to make actuall applications of those
merits of his to his Church, which yet had
their consummation on the Crosse.</p>
               <p>And if it be heere demanded how it comes
to passe, if all these consequents of sinne be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
that the faithfull are still subject to all
those temporall evils both in life and death
which even in the state of Nature they should
have undergone; wee answere in generall,
that the faithfull dye in regard of the <hi>state,</hi> but
not in regard of the <hi>sting</hi> of Death, they are
subject to a dissolution, but it is to obtaine a
more blessed union,<note n="k" place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> even to bee with Christ:
and though a man may not take the whole
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:12557:79"/>
World in exchange for his Soule, yet he may
well take Christ in exchange for his life.<note n="l" place="margin">Mercatura est paeuca amittere, ut majora lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. Tertul. ad Martyr.</note> It is

merchandise, to part from it for the procuring
of such commodities as are more valuable;
and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telles us that to<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. 1. 21.</note> dye is gaine.
The<note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> sting wee know of Death is sinne, (for
sinne is the cause of all inward discomforts;
for which cause the<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 124. 5. Esay 55. 20. Jud. ver 13.</note> wicked are often compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the foaming Sea, which is still tossed
and unquiet with every winde) and the<note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 56.</note> strength
of sinne is the Law, with the malediction and
bondage thereof, from the which wee being
perfectly delivered, by him who was himselfe
<note n="e" place="margin">Gal. 4. 4, 5.</note>made under the Law, and by that meanes
became a<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 7. 25.</note> perfect and sufficient Saviour, wee
are in like manner delivered from the penalty
of Death; for weaken sinne by destroying the
Law, (which is the strength of it) and Death
cannot possibly sting.</p>
               <p>To examine this point, though by way of
digression, something farther will not bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
impertinent, because it serves to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
the power of Christs Passion. The evils
which wee speake of are the <hi>violations of the
nature and person</hi> of a man: and that evill may
bee considered two waies, either <hi>physically<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> as
it oppresseth and burdeneth Nature, working
some violence on the primitive integrity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
and by consequence imprinting an affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>sorrow</hi> in the minde, and so it may bee
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:12557:80"/>
called <hi>paine;</hi> or else <hi>morally</hi> and <hi>legally,</hi> with
respect unto the motive cause in the Patient,
<hi>Sinne;</hi> or to the originall efficient cause in the
Agent, <hi>Iustice;</hi> and so it may be called <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Punishment</hi> being some evill inflicted on
a subject for transgressing some Law comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him by his Law-maker, there is ther unto
requisite something on the part of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,</hi>
something on the part of the <hi>Subject,</hi>
and something on the part of the <hi>Evill</hi> infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
In the <hi>Commander</hi> there must bee first a
<hi>will</hi> unto which the actions of the Subject must
conforme, and that signified in the nature of a
<hi>Law.</hi> Secondly, there must bee a <hi>Iustice</hi> which
will. And thirdly, a <hi>Power</hi> which can punish
the transgressours of that Law. In the Subject
there must be first <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Free-will</hi> (I meane
originally) for a Law proceeding from Justice
presupposeth a power of obedience, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
impossibilites is both absurd and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous,
befitting <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and not God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
there must bee a <hi>Debt</hi> and <hi>Obligation</hi>
whereby hee is bound unto the fulfilling of
that Law. And lastly, the Conditions of this
Obligation being broken there must be a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,
<hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Demerit</hi> following the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Law. Lastly, in the <hi>Evill</hi> it selfe
inflicted there is required first something <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute,</hi>
namely a <hi>destructive Power,</hi> some way or
other oppressing and disquieting Nature (for
as <hi>sinne</hi> is a violation offered from man to the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:12557:80"/>
Law, so punishment must bee a violation retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Law to man.) Secondly, there
must bee something <hi>Relative,</hi> which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
first the authour of the evill, whose Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
being by mans sinne provoked, is by his
owne power, and according to the sentence of
his owne Law to bee executed. Secondly, it
may respect the end for which it is inflicted,
it is not the torment of the Creature, whom
as a Creature God loveth, neither is it the
pleasing of the Devill, whom as a Devill God
hateth, but onely the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and the <hi>Manifestation</hi> of his Wrath.
These things being thus premised, wee will
againe make a double Consideration of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi>
either it may be taken <hi>improperly,</hi> and
incompletely, for whatsoever oppressive evill
doth so draw its <hi>originall</hi> in a Reasonable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from <hi>Sinne,</hi> as that if there were not an
habitation of sinne, there should be no roome
for such an evill, as in the man that was borne
blinde, though sinne were not the cause of the
blindenesse, yet it was that which made roome
for the blindenesse: or it may bee taken <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
and perfectly, and then I take it to admit
of some such <hi>Description</hi> as this <hi>Punishment</hi> is
an evill or pressure of Nature, proceeding
from a Law-giver just and powerfull, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
on a Reasonable Creature, for the diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
and breach of that Law unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
whereof it was originally by the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:12557:81"/>
naturall faculty of free-will enabled, whereby
there is intended a Declaration of Wrath, and
Satisfaction of Justice.</p>
               <p>Now then I take it wee may with confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
unto the Scriptures, and with the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
of Faith set downe these Conclusions.</p>
               <p>First, consider <hi>Punishments</hi> as they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
and paines, and as they are impressions
contrary to the integrity of Nature, so the
temporall evils of the godly are punishments,
because they worke the very same manner of
naturall effects in them which they doe in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. Secondly, take <hi>Punishments impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi>
for those evils of Nature which doe <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally</hi>
follow sinne, and unto which sinne hath
originally opened an entrance, which declare
how God stands affected towards sinne, with a
minde purposing the rooting out and destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it; in this sense likewise may the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of the godly bee called <hi>Punishments,</hi> as
God is said to have beene<note n="a" place="margin">Numb. 12. 9.</note> exceeding angry
with <hi>Aaron.</hi> But now these evils though infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
on the godly because of their sinnes, as
were, the death of the child to <hi>David,</hi> the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest
to <hi>Ionah,</hi> and the like, yet are they not evils
inflicted for the <hi>Revenge of sin</hi> (which is yet the
right Nature of a proper Punishment) (so saith
the Lord, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay it)</hi> but
they are evils by the Wisedome of God, and
love towards his Saints inflicted for the <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw</hi>
of <hi>sinne,</hi> for weakening the violence, and
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:12557:81"/>
abating the outrageousnesse of our naturall
corruptions. As then in the godly sinne may
be said to be, and not to bee in a diverse sense,
(so saith Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in one place,<note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> 
                  <hi>If wee say wee
have no sinne wee deceive our selves,</hi> and yet in
another,<note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 3. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Hee that is borne of God sinneth not)</hi> It
is not in them in regard of its <hi>Condemnation,</hi>
although it bee in them in regard of its <hi>inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation,</hi>
though even that also as daily dying
and crucified, even so punishments or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
of sinne may be said to be in the godly,
or not to be in them in a different sense. They
are not in them in regard of their <hi>sting</hi> and
<hi>curse</hi> as they are proper <hi>Revenges for sinne,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they be in them in regard of their <hi>state,
substance,</hi> and <hi>painefulnesse,</hi> untill such time as
they shall put on an eternall Triumph over
Death, the last enemy that must be overcome.
Lastly, I conclude, that the temporall evils
which doe befall the godly are not <hi>formally or
properly punishments,</hi> nor effects of divine ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction
or vengeance towards the persons of
the godly, who having obtained in Christ a
plenary reconciliation with the Father, can be
by him respected with no other affection (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
in manner of appearance it may seeme
otherwise) than with an affection of love and
free grace.</p>
               <p>The reasons for this position are these: first,
<hi>Punishment,</hi> with what mitigation soever qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
is <hi>in suo formali,</hi> in the nature of it a thing
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:12557:82"/>
                  <hi>Legall,</hi> namely the execution of the Law, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law is ever the square and rule of that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of which punishment is the effect and work.
Now all those on whom the execution of the
Law doth take any effect, may truly bee said to
be so farre under the Law in regard of the sting
and curse thereof, (for the curse of the Law is
nothing else but the evill which the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
to bee inflicted, so that every branch
and sprigge of that evill, must needes beare in
it some part of the nature of a Curse, even as
every part of water hath in it the nature of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
but all the godly are wholly delivered
from all the sting and malediction of the Law,
Christ<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 10. 4.</note> is unto us the end of the Law, aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
the shadowes of the Ceremoniall, the
the Curses of the Morall;<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 6. 14.</note> wee are no more
under the Law, but under Grace, under the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,</hi>
but not under the <hi>Covenant,</hi> under the<note n="d" place="margin">PlanÃ¨ &amp; nos sic dicimus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessisse legem quoad onera non quoad Iustiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Tert. de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nog. cap. 7.</note> 
                  <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi>
but not under the <hi>bondage</hi> of the Law:
unto the<note n="e" place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 9.</note> righteous there is no Law, that is,
there is no condemnation to them that are in
Christ: wee are dead unto the Law by the
Body of Christ, it hath not the least power or
dominion over us. Secondly, the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
nature of a punishment is to satisfie an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
Justice, but Christ bearing the iniquity
of us all in his Body on the Tree, did therein
make a most sufficient and ample satisfaction
to his Fathers wrath, leaving nothing wherein
wee should make up either the measure or the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:12557:82"/>
vertue of his sufferings, but did himselfe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
save us: for an infinite person suffering,
and the value of the suffering depending on the
dignity of the Person, it must needs bee that
the satisfaction made by that suffering must be
likewise infinite, and by consequence most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
Lastly, if we consider (as<note n="a" place="margin">Omnis rei in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectio Authore cognito planior est. Tert. de fug. in persec. cap. 1.</note> it is in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of consequence necessary) but the author
of this evill, we shall finde it to be no true and
proper punishment; for it is a reconciled fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 12. 6.</note>who chasteneth every sonne whom hee
receiveth, who as hee often doth<note n="c" place="margin">Indignantis Dei major haec plaga est ut nec intelligant deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta nec plangunt Cypr. de Lapsis.</note> declare his
severest wrath by forbearing to punish, so doth

unto those that suffer them, in none of which
things are there the prints of punishment.</p>
               <p>But if Christ have thus taken away the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
of all temporall punishments, why are
they not quite removed? to what end should
the substance of that remaine whose proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

Our salvation cost Christ a pretious price, his
owne bloud, and shall not we so much as lay
up the memory of it in our mindes, that wee
may have it forth-comming to answer all the
objections that can be made against our title
to salvation? consider with thy selfe the feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
and horror of thy naturall estate, wherin
thou wert expos'd to the infinite wrath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, whom thou therfore being both
finite and impotent wert no way able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease,
subiect to the strokes and terrors,
not onely of thine owne Conscience, a
bosome Hell, but of that most exact
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12557:87"/>
justice, which it is as impossible for thee to
sustaine with patience, as with obedience,
to satisfy. The creatures thine enemies
thine owne heart thy witnes, thy Creator,
thy Judge, eternity of expreslelesse anguish,
gnawing of conscience, despaire of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
&amp; whatsoever misery the most search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
understanding can but imagine thy sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,
for according to his feare, so is his
wrath, from this, and much more hath the
death of Christ, not onely delivered thee,
but of a cast away, an enemy, a deplored
wretch, weltring in thine owne bloud, rotting
&amp; stinking in thine owne grave, hath restored
thee not only to thine originall interest, and
patrimony, but unto an estate so much more
glorious then that could have been, by
how much the obedience of Christ, is more
pretious, then any thy innocency could
possibly have performed. Consider the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
filthines of sinne, the pertinacious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence
thereof unto thy nature, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the incarnation, and bloud of the
Sonne of God, the Creator of the World
could wash it out; consider the Justice,
and undispensable severity of our God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
sinne, which would not spare the life
of his owne Sonne, nor be satisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Sacrifice of infinite, and coequall
vertue with it selfe: consider that it was
thy sinne, which were thy associates with
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12557:87"/>
                  <hi>Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Iewes</hi> to crucify
him: It was thy Hypocrisy which was the
<hi>kisse</hi> that betraid him, thy covetousnes the
<hi>thornes</hi> that crowned him, thy oppression,
and cruelty the <hi>nayles,</hi> and Speares that
peirced him, thy Idolatry and superstition
the <hi>knee</hi> that mocked him, thy contempt
of religion the <hi>spittle</hi> that defiled him, thy
anger and bitternes the <hi>gall,</hi> and <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that distasted him, thy Crimson, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled
sins the <hi>Purple</hi> that dishonord him,
in a word thou wert the <hi>Iew</hi> that kild him.
Canst thou then have so many members as
weapons wherewith to crucify thy Saviour,
and hast thou not a heart wherein to recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize,
and a tongue wherewith to celebrate
the benefits of that bloud which thy sinnes
had powred out? The fire is que<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that water which by its heate was caused
to runne over, and shall not any of thy sins,
be put out by the over-flowing of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
bloud which thy sinnes caused to run
out of his sacred Bodie? Lastly, consider
the immensitie of Gods mercie, and the
unutterable treasures of his grace, which
neither the provocations of thy sinne, nor
the infinite exactnes of his owne justice
could any way overcome, or constraine to
dispise the worke of his owne hands or nor
to compassionate the wretchednes of his
creature though it cost the Humiliation
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:12557:88"/>
of the Sonne of God, and the exinanition
of his Sacred person to performe it. Lay
together all those considerations, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
they are able even to melt a heart of
Adamant into thoughts of continuall
thankfulnes towards so bountifull a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, wee must remember the death
of CHRIST with a <hi>Remembrance of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi>
even the commands of God should
be sufficient to inforce our obedience. It is
not the manner of Law-makers to use in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations,
and plausible provokements, but
peremptory, and resolute injunctions upon
paine of penalty: but our God deales not
onely as a Lord, but as a Father, he hath
delivered us from the penalty, and now ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
invites, then compels us to obedience,
least by persisting in sinne we should make
voyd unto our selves the benefit of Christs
death, yea should crucify him a fresh, and
so bring upon our selves not the benefit
but the guilt of his bloud. Is it nothing
thinke we that Christ should die in vaine,
and take upon him the dishonor, and shame
of a servant to no purpose? and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
as much as in it lyes doth nullify,
and make voyd the death of Christ: Is it
nothing that that sacred Bloud of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
should bee shed onely to be troden,
and trampled under foote as a vile thing?
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:12557:88"/>
and certainely he that celebrates the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

the scope of all reasonable desires, so the

the Prophet, speaking of Christ) shall bee
<hi>the desire of all Nations,</hi> in as much as without
him that happinesse which all doe naturally

wee see that even the light of our inbred rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

doth leade us unto a desire of Christ, who
alone is the Authour and Matter of that

us therefore to beware how we give enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment

True it is that these creatures naturally have

<hi>Instrument</hi> to ratifie and make sure our claime
unto his Covenant, we learne. First, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to admire and adore the unspeakeable
love of God, who is pleased not onely
to make, but to confirme his promises un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Church. As<note n="b" place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>God,</hi> so his <hi>truth,</hi>
whether of judgments or promises, are all
in themselves <hi>immutable,</hi> and <hi>infallible</hi> in
their event; yet notwithstanding, as the
Sunne though in it selfe of a most uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
light and magnitude, yet by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the great distance, and of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of mists and vapours through which
the raies are diffus'd, it often seemeth in
both properties to varie: so the promises

of God; however in themselves of a fixed and
unmoveable certainty, yet passing through the
various tempers of our minds one while serene
and cleere, another while by the steeme of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
and temptations of Satan, foggie and
distemperd, doe appeare under an inconstant
shape. And for this cause, as the Sunne doth it
selfe dispell those vapours w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did hinder the
right perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>tion of it; so the grace of God, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with and by the holy Sacrament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated,
doth rectifie the minde and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
those diffident affections w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did before
intercept the efficacie and evidence thereof.</p>
               <p>God made a <hi>Covenant</hi> with our fathers, and
not accounting that enough hee <hi>confirmed</hi> it by
an <hi>oath,</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Heb. 6. 18.</note> that by 2. <hi>immutable</hi> things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it was impossible for God to ly, they might
have strong consolation who have had refuge
to lay hold on the hope that is set before them.
The strength wee see of the consolation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon the stability of the covenant. And
is Gods covenant made more firme by an <hi>oath</hi>
than by a <hi>promise?</hi> The <hi>truth</hi> of God is as his
<hi>nature</hi> without<note n="d" place="margin">Iam. 1 17.</note> variablenesse or shadow of
changing, and can it then bee made more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable?
Certainly as to infinitenes in regard
of extension, so unto immutabillity in regard
of firmenes, can there not bee any accession of
degrees, or parts: All <hi>immutability</hi> being no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

else but an exclusion of whatsoever
might possibly occur to make the thing vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:12557:95"/>
and uncertaine. So then the <hi>Oath</hi> of God
doth no more adde to the certainty of his
word then doe mens oathes and protestations
to the truth of what they affirme; but because
wee consist of an earthly and dull temper,
therefore God when he speakes unto us doth
ingeminate his compellations,<note n="a" place="margin">Ierem. 22. 9 Vel praesentem desideramus. Plin. Paneg.</note> 
                  <hi>O Earth,
Earth, Earth, heare the word of the Lord.</hi> So
weake is our sight, so diffident our nature,
as that it seemes to want the evidence of
what it sees: peradventure God may repent

Covenant of grace bee as mutable as was
that of gwords? God promised to<note n="c" place="margin">Psalm. 48. 8.</note> esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
<hi>Sion</hi> for ever, and yet <hi>Sion,</hi> the City
of the great God is fallen; was not<note n="d" place="margin">Ierem 7 12</note> 
                  <hi>Shilo</hi>

                  <hi>Israel</hi> the naturall Olive
that did partake of the fat and sweetnesse
of the roote, and is yea cut off, and wrath
come upon it to the uttermost? Though God
be most immutable, may he not yet alter his
promise? did the abrogation of Ceremonies
prove any way a change in him who was as
well the erector as the dissolver of them?
Though the Sunne be fastned to his owne
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:12557:96"/>
Spheare, yet may hee bee moved by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Orbe. What if Gods <hi>promise</hi> barely
considered, proceed from his <hi>Antecedent</hi>
and <hi>simple will</hi> of <hi>benevolence</hi> towards the
Creature, but the stability and <hi>certainty</hi> of
his promise in the event depend on a second
resolution of his <hi>consequent will,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposeth
the good use of mine owne liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
may not I then abuse my free will and
so frustrate unto my selfe the benefit of
Gods promise? Is not my will mutable,
though Gods bee not? may not I sinke
and fall though the place on which I stand
be firme? may not I let goe my hold though
the thing which I handle bee it selfe fast?
what if all this while I have beene in a
Dreame, mistaking mine owne private fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
and misperswasions for the dictates
of Gods Spirit? mistaking Satan (who
useth to transforme himselfe) for an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell
of light? God hath promised, it is
true, but hath hee promised unto mee?
did hee ever say unto mee, <hi>Simon, Simon,</hi>
or <hi>Saul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 22. 31.</note>

and a tongue, a promise, and a promise, that
is, a various and uncertaine promise. And
for this cause (notwithstanding<note n="c" place="margin">Senec. Epist. 3.</note> diffident
and distrustfull men doe indeed deserve what
they suspect, and are worthy to suffer what
they unworthily doe feare) doth God yet in
compassion towards our fraitly condescend to
<hi>confirme</hi> his <hi>promises</hi> by an <hi>Oath,</hi> to engage
the truth of his own essence for performance,
to <hi>seale</hi> the <hi>Patent</hi> which he hath given with
his own <hi>blood,</hi> and to exhibite that seale unto
us so often as with faith wee approach unto
the Communion of these holy mysteries.
And who can sufficiently admire the riches
of this mercy which makes the very weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
and imperfections of his Church oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
of redoubling his promises unto it?</p>
               <p>Secondly, in that this Sacrament is the
<hi>instrumentall cause</hi> of <hi>confirming</hi> our faith from
this possibility, yea, facility of obtaining, we
must conclude the necessity of using so great
a benefit, wherein wee procure the strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our graces, the calmeing of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
and the experience of Gods favour;
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:12557:97"/>
in the naturall body there being a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
activity and conflict betweene the heate
and the moisture of the body, and by that
meanes a wasting depassion, and decay of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it is kept in a perpetuall necessity of
succouring it selfe by food: so in the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
man there being in this present estate an
unreconcileable enmity betweene the spirit,
and the flesh, there is in either part a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension
towards such outward food, whereby
each in its distresses may be releeved. The
flesh pursues all such objects as may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
and cherish the desires thereof, which
the Apostle calleth the provisions of lust.
The Spirit of the contrary side strengthens
it selfe by those divine helps which the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God had appointed to conferre
grace, and to settle the heart in a firme
perswasion of its owne peace. And amongst
these instruments this holy Sacrament is
one of the principall, which is indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but a <hi>visible oath,</hi> wherein Christ
giveth us a tast of his benefits and engageth
his owne sacred body for the accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
of them, which supporteth our tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
faith and reduceth the soule unto a
more setled tranquility.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, In that in this one all other <hi>Types</hi>
were abrogated and nullified, wee learne to
admire and glorifie the love of God, who
hath set us at liberty from the thraldome

               <p>But yet though we under the Gospell are

the spirit that worshippeth. It is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerated

               <p>Sixtly, in that by these frequent cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
we are led unto the celebration of
Christs death, and the benefits thereby
arising unto mankinde, we may hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the naturall deadnes, and stupidity
of mans memory in the things of his sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
It is a wonder how a man should
forget his Redeemer that ransomed him
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:12557:99"/>
with the price of his owne bloud, to whom
he oweth whatsoever he either is or hath,
him whom each good thing we injoy lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
unto to the acknowledgment of. Looke
where we will, he is still not onely in us, but
before us. The wisdome of our minds, the
goodness of our natures, the purposes of
our wills and desires, the calmenes of our
consciences, the hope, and expectation of
our soules and bodies, the liberty from
law, and sinne, what ever it is in or about
us which we either <hi>know,</hi> or <hi>admire,</hi> or
<hi>enjoy,</hi> or <hi>expect,</hi> he is the Treasury whence
they were taken, the fulnes whence they
were received, the head which transferreth
the hand which bestoweth them, we are
on all sides compassed, and even<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 1. 10.</note> hedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in with his blessings; so that in this
sense we may acknowledge a kind of <hi>ubiquity</hi>
of Christs body, in as much as it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where even visible, and palpable in
those benefits which flow from it. And
yet we like men that looke on the River
<hi>Nilus,</hi> and gaze wonderously on the
Streames, remaine still ignorant of the
head, and Originall from whence they
issue. Thus as there is betweene bloud,
and Poyson such a naturall antipathy as
makes them to shrinke in, and retire at the
presence of each other: so though each
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:12557:100"/>
good thing we enjoy serve to present that
pretious blood which was the price of it
unto our soules, yet there is in us so
much venome of sinne as makes us still to
remove our thoughts from so pure an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.
As in the knowledge of things many
men are of so narrow understandings that
they are not able to raise them unto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the <hi>causes</hi> of such things,
whose <hi>effects</hi> they are haply better acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with, then wiser men; it being the worke
of a discursive head, to discover the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
knittings, obscure dependances, of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
things on each other: so in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of practice in Divinity many men
commonly are so fastned unto the present
goods which they enjoy, and so full with
them that they either have noe roome, or
noe leisure, or rather indeed no power, nor
will to lift up their minds from the streames
unto the Fountaine, or by a holy logick
to resolve them into the <hi>death of Christ</hi>
from whence if they issue not, they are
but fallacies, and sophisticall good things,
and what ever happines we expect in or
from them, will prove a <hi>non sequitur</hi> at the
last. Remember, and know CHRIST
indeed, such men may, and do in some
sort, sometimes to dishonor him, at best
but to discourse of him. But as the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
speakes of intemperate men, who
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:12557:100"/>
sin, not out of a full purpose uncontroled
swinge of vitious resolutions, but with checks
of judgement and reluctancy of reason,
that they are but<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>. Ar. Eth. l. 7. c. 10</note> halfe vitious
(which yet is indeed but an halfe-truth.)
So certainly they, who though they doe not
quite forget Christ, or cast him behinde their
backe, doe yet remember him onely with a
<hi>speculative</hi> contemplation of the nature and
generall efficacy of his death, without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
application of it unto their owne
persons and practices, have but a halfe and
halting knowledge of him. Certainely a
meere Schoole-man who is able exactly to
dispute of Christ and his passion, is as farre
from the length, and breadth, and depth, and
heigth of Christ crucified, from the requisite
dimensions of a Christian, as a meere Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiour
or Architect, who hath onely the
practise of measuring land or timber, is from
the learning of a Geometrician. For as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks,
being a speculative Science
cannot possibly bee compris'd in the narrow
compasse of a practicall Art; so neither can
the knowledge of Christ, being a saving and
practick knowledge be compleat, when it floats
only in the discourses of a speculative braine.
And therefore Christ at the last day will say
unto many men who thought themselves
great Clerks, and of his neere acquaintance,
even such as did preach him and doe wonders
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:12557:101"/>
in his name, that hee never<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 7. 22. 23.</note> knew them,
and that is an argument, that they likewise
never knew him neither. For as no man can
see the Sunne, but by the benefit of that light
which from the Sunne shineth on him: so
no man can know Christ, but those on whom
Christ first shineth, and whom he vouch safeth
to know, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> could not say <hi>Rabboni</hi>
to Christ, till Christ first had said <hi>Mary</hi> to
her. And therefore that we may not faile to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ber
Christ aright, it pleaseth him to insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
this holy Sacrament as the image of his
crucified body, whereby wee might as truely
have Christs death presented unto us, as if
he had beene<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1.</note> crucified before our eyes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we see here who they are who in
the Sacrament receive Christ, even such as
remember his death with a recognition of
faith, thankefulnesse and obedience. Others
receive onely the Elements, but not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
As when the King seales a pardon to
a condemned malefactour, the messenger
that is sent with it receives nothing from the
King but paper written and sealed, but the
malefactor (unto whom onely it is a gift) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it as it were a resurrection. Certainely
there is a staffe as well of Sacramentall as of
common bread, the staffe of common bread
is the <hi>blessing</hi> of the Lord, the staffe of the
Sacramentall is the <hi>body</hi> of the Lord; and
as the wicked, which never looke up in thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:12557:101"/>
unto God, doe often receive the
bread without the blessing, so here the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
without the body, they receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
as it is fit uncleane Birds should doe,
nothing but the carcasse of a Sacrament,
the body of Christ being the soule of
the Bread, and his bloud the life of the
Wine. His body is not now any more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of dishonour, it is a glorified body, and
therefore will not enter into an earthy, and
uncleane soule: As it is corporally in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
so it will be spiritually and sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
in noe place but a heavenly soule.
Thinke not that thou hast received Christ,
till thou hast effectually remembred, seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
meditated, and been religiously af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
and inflamed with the love of his
death, without this thou maist be guilty
of his body, thou canst not be a partaker
of it: guilty thou art, because thou didst
reach out thy hand with a purpose to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ into a polluted soule, though
he withdrew himselfe from thee. Even as
<hi>Mutius Sevola</hi> was guilty of <hi>Porsena's</hi> bloud,
though it was not him, but another whom
the Dagger wounded; because the error
of the hand cannot remove the malice of
the heart.</p>

fit, and predispose
him for the comfortable receiving, and
proper interest in these holy mysteries.
Sacraments, since the time that Satan
hath had a Kingdome in the World, have
been ever notes, and Characters whereby
to distinguish the Church of God from
the Ethnick, and unbeleeving part of men;
so that they being not common unto all
mankinde, some subject unto whom the
right, and propriety of them belongeth
must bee found out. GOD at the first
created man upright, framed him after his
owne Image, and endowed him with gifts
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:12557:102"/>
of nature, able to preserve him entire in
that estate wherein he was created. And
because it was repugnant to the <hi>essentiall
freedome</hi> wherein he was made, to neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitate
him by any outward constraint unto
an immutable estate of integrity, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                     </gap> in dialog. Cum Tryph.</note> framed him that it might be
within the free liberty of his owne will
to cleave to him, or to decline from him.
Man being thus framed, abused this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
freedome, and committed sinne, and
thereby in the very same instant became
really, and <hi>properly dead.</hi> For as he was
<hi>dead iudicially</hi> in regard of a temporall,
and <hi>eternall death</hi> (both which were now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
pronounced though not executed on
him) so was he <hi>dead actually, and really</hi>
in regard of that <hi>spirituall death;</hi> which
consisteth in a separation of the soule from
God, and in an absolute immobility un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Divine operations. But mans sinne did
not nullifie Gods power. He that made
him a glorious creature when he was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
could as easily renew, and rectifie
him when he fell away. Being dead, true
it is, that <hi>active concurrence</hi> unto his owne
restitution he could have none, but yet
still the same <hi>passive obedience,</hi> and capacity
which was in the red Clay of which
<hi>Adams</hi> body was fashioned unto that di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vine
Image which God breathed into it,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:12557:103"/>
the same had man being now fallen unto
the restitution of those heavenly benefits
and habituall graces which then hee lost;
save that in the clay there was onely a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
obedience, but in man fallen there is
an<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 7. 51. Rom. 7. 23.</note> active rebellion, crossing resistance,
and withstanding of Gods good worke in
him. More certainely than this hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have, because howsoever in regard of
naturall and reasonable operations hee bee
more selfe-moving than clay, yet in regard
of spirituall graces hee is full as dead. Even
as a man though more excellent then a beast,
is yet as truely and equally not an Angell
as a beast is. So then thus farre wee see all
mankinde doe agree in an equallity of
<hi>Creation,</hi> in a universallity of <hi>descrtion,</hi> in
a capacity of <hi>restitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God made the world that therein hee
might commuicate his goodnesse unto the
creature, and unto every creature in that
proportion as the nature of it is capable
of. And man being one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
creatures is amongst the rest capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of these two principall attributes, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>linesse,</hi>
and <hi>happinesse,</hi> which two God out
of his most secret Counsell and eternall
mercy, conferreth on whom he had chosen
and made accepted in Christ the beloved,
shutting the rest either out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,
as Heathen, or at least out of the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:12557:103"/>
inward priviledges and benefits of that
Covenant which hee hath established with
mankind, as hypocrites and licentious
Christians. Now as in the first Creation
of man, God did into the unformed lumpe
of clay infuse by his power the breath of
life and so made man, so in the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Christian doth hee in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
man who is dead in sinne, breathe a
principle of spirituall life, the <hi>first Act,</hi> as
it were, and the originall of all superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
motions, whereby hee is constituted
in the first being of a member of Christ.</p>
               <p>And this first Act is <hi>faith,</hi> the soule
of a Christian, that whereby we<note n="a" place="margin">1 Ioh. 5. 13.</note> live
in Christ, so that till wee have faith wee
are dead and out of him. And as <hi>faith</hi> is
the <hi>principle</hi> (next under the Holy-Ghost)
of all spirituall life here, so is <hi>Baptisme</hi> the
<hi>Sacrament</hi> of that life, which accompanied
and raised by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of grace, is unto
the Church though not the <hi>cause,</hi> yet the

                  <hi>meanes</hi> in and by which this grace is
conveyed unto the soule.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Adam</hi> after once <hi>life</hi>
was infus'd into him, was presently to
preserve it by the<note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 1. 29.</note> eating of the
<hi>fruites</hi> in the Garden where God had pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
him, because of that continuall depa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion

                  </gap>l heat<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
which made Nature to stand in need of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:12557:104"/>
succours and supplies from outward nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment:
so after man is once <hi>regenerated</hi>
and made alive, hee is to preserve <hi>that faith</hi>
which quickneth him by such <hi>food</hi> as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by God for that purpose, it being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
of it selfe subject to continuall
languishings and decayes. And this life is
thus continued and preserved amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes by the grace of this <hi>holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist,</hi>
which conveyes unto us that true food
of life, the body and bloud of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.
So then in as much as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Christs supper is not the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>regeneration,</hi> but of <hi>sustentation</hi> and
nourishment; and in as much as no dead
thing is capable of being nourished <hi>(aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi>
being a vegetative and <hi>vitall</hi> act)
and lastly in as much as the <hi>principle</hi> of
this spirituall life is <hi>faith,</hi> and the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
of it <hi>Baptisme,</hi> It followeth evidently
that no man is a subject quallified for the
holy communion of Christs body, who hath
not beene before partaker of faith and
Baptisme.</p>
               <p>In Heaven, where all things shall bee
perfected and renewed, our soules shall be
in as little neede of this Sacrament, as our
bodies of nourishment. But this being a
state of <hi>imperfection</hi> subject to decayes, and
still capable of further augmentation, wee
are therefore by these holy mysteries to
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:12557:104"/>
                  <hi>preserve</hi> the <hi>life</hi> which by <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Baptisme</hi>
wee have received: without which life, as
the Sacrament doth conferre and confirme
nothing, so doe we receive nothing neither
but the bare elements. Christ is now in
Heaven, no eye sharpe enough to see him,
no arme long enough to reach him but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>faith.</hi> The <hi>Sacrament</hi> is but the<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note> seale
of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Covenants</hi> essentially in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude

part is <hi>faith,</hi> no faith no Covenant, no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
no Seale, no Seale no Sacrament.

of the holy Eucharist, without which hee is

he first provides the materialls, and

In the building of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple the

were brought, there was neither Hammer,

the house while it was in building. And
so should it be in the Temple of which
that was a type even in the mysticall body
of CHRIST, every man should be first
hewed, and fitted by repentance, and other
preparatory workes before he should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
to incorporate himselfe into that
spirituall, and eternall building. In the
observation of Leviticall ceremonies wee
may note that<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 12. 3. 6.</note> before the celebration
of the Passeover the Lambe was to be taken
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:12557:107"/>
and severed from the flocke three dayes
ere it was slaine, in which time the people
might in that figure learne to sanctifie

And our saviour Christ in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the last Supper, would not have

he sent his Disciples before hand about

should be first a <hi>preparation</hi> before a <hi>cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration.</hi>

of preparing, and deliberating be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

depending rather on the <hi>Author</hi>
then on the emolument of the Law, yet
GOD, who is not wanting all wayes
to winne men unto the observance of what
he requires, urgeth us thereunto not onely
with an argument of <hi>debt</hi> because we are
his <hi>servants,</hi> but with an argument of
<hi>profit</hi> too, because the omission of it will
not onely nullifie unto us the benefit of
his Sacrament but make us, guilty of that
very bloud which was shed for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

What this danger of being guilty of
Christs blood is, I will not stand long to
explaine. Briefly, to be guilty, of the body
and bloud of Christ, is to offer some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
contempt, and indignity unto the
sufferings of Christ, to sinne against the
price of our redemption, and to<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 10. 29.</note> vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
and set at nought the pretious bloud
of the new covenant, as if it were a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and profane thing when men out of
ignorant, sensuall, secure, presumptuous,
formalizing, inconsiderate, and profane
affections approach unto Christs Table to
Communicate of him. To be guilty of

downe very compendiously the manner
of this examination, onely naming some
principall particulars. The maine <hi>querie</hi> is
whether I am a fit guest to approach Gods
Table, and to share in the fellowship of his
sufferings. The suffrings of Christ are not
exposed unto the rapine and violence of each
bold intruder, but he who was first the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
is for ever the despenser of them. And
as in the dispensation of his <hi>miracles,</hi> for
the most part, so of his <hi>sufferings</hi> likewise,
there is either a question premised, <hi>beleevest
thou,</hi> or a condition included, <hi>bee it unto
thee as thou beleevest.</hi> But a man may bee
alive, and yet unfit to eate, nor capable of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:12557:110"/>
any nourishment by reason of some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
diseases, which weaken the stomacke,
and trouble it with an apepsie, or difficulty
of concoction. And so faith may sometimes
in the <hi>Habit</hi> lye smothered, and almost sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled
with some spirituall lethargie, binding
up the vitall faculties from their proper
motions. And therefore our faith must be
an operative, and expedite faith, not stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with any knowne and practised course
of sinne, which doth ever weaken our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
unto grace, they being things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent.
The matter then wee see of
this triall must bee that <hi>vitall quallification</hi>
which predisposeth a man for the receiving
of these holy mysteries, and that is <hi>faith.</hi>
To enter into such a discourse of faith, as
the condition of that subject would require
were a labour beyond the length of a short
meditation, and unto the present purpose
impertinent. Wee will therefore onely
take some generallities about the causes,
nature, properties or effects of faith (which

to the Conscience, that so the <hi>major</hi> and

First, for the causes of faith, not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with that extraordinary cause, I meane
<hi>miracles,</hi> the ordinary are the word of God,
and the Spirit of God, the Word as the
Seed, the Spirit as the formative and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall
virtue making it active, and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:
for the <hi>Letter</hi> profiteth nothing, it is
the <hi>Spirit</hi> which quickneth. What the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality
of that particular action is, whereby
the Word and Spirit doe implant this
heavenly branch of faith in the soule.</p>
               <p>(Faith it selfe having in its nature seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
distinct degrees, some intellectuall of

some of abnegation, renouncing,
and flying out of our selves, as insufficient
for the contriuance of our owne salvation,
and so in congruity of reason requiring in

shall therefore touch upon some p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>incipall
properties of either, all which if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
not unto the originall production, doe
certainely to the raduation and establishing
of that divine virtue, and therefore may just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come within the compasse of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
from the evidences of which assumed
and applied, the Conscience is to conclude
the truth of its faith in Christ.</p>
               <p>And first for the <hi>word,</hi> to let passe those
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:12557:111"/>
properties which are onely the inherent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes,
and not any transient operations
thereof (as its sufficiency, perspicuity, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
selfe-Authority, and the like) let us
touch upon those which it carrieth along
with it into the Conscience, and I shall
observe but two, Its<note n="a" place="margin">2 Pet. 1<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 19. Psalme 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Light,</hi> and its
<note n="b" place="margin">Rom 1. 16.</note>
                  <hi>Power:</hi> Even as the Sunne where ever
it goes doth still carry with it that <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
whereby it <hi>discovereth,</hi> and that <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
whereby it <hi>quickneth</hi> inferiour bodies.
First, for the Word, the properties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
are first to make manifest and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the hidden things of darknesse, for
whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
The heart of man naturally is a labyrinth
of<note n="c" place="margin">Rom 1<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 21. Plangendae tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae in quibus me mea facultas la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

they are<note n="a" place="margin">Rev. 2. 24.</note> depths,<note n="b" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 11.</note> devices,
<note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 11<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 3.</note>craftinesse,<note n="d" place="margin">Ephes. 6. 11<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </note> methods. The Word of
God alone is that light<note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor 14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 15.</note> which maketh
manifest the secrets of the heart, that<note n="f" place="margin">Iam. 1.</note>
glasse wherein wee may see both our
selves, and all the devices of Satan a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us discovered. And secondly by this
act of manifesting doth light distinguish
one thing from another. In the darke we
<note n="g" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 11.</note>make no difference of faire or foule,
of right or wrong waies, but all are alike
unto us: and so while wee continue in
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:12557:111"/>
the blindnes of our naturall estate, wee
are not able to perceive the distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
Divine, and naturall objects, but
the Word of God like a touchstone, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth
the differences of truth, and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
good, and evill, and like fire seperateth
the pretious from the vile.</p>
               <p>Secondly, light is quickning, and a
comforting thing. The glory of the Saints
is an<note n="k" place="margin">Colos. 1.</note> inheritance of light, and they
are<note n="l" place="margin">Ephes. 5.</note> children of light who shall shine
as the Sunne in the Firament, whereas
darknes is both the Title, and the Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the wicked. The times of darknes
men make to be the times of their sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
(which is an Image of Death,) tis
in the light onely that men worke: And
so the Word of GOD is a comforting
Word; It was<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> 
                  <hi>Davids</hi> delight, his
hony-Combe. And it is a quickning Word
too, for it is the<note n="n" place="margin">Heb 312. Ioh 668.</note> Word of Life.
Lastly,<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh 12<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>35.</note> light doth assist, direct, and
guide us in our waies, and so doth the
Word of GOD, it is a<note n="p" place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> Lanterne to our
feete, and a light unto our pathes. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
for the <hi>power</hi> of the Word, it is
two fold, even as all power is, a <hi>govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
power</hi> in respect of that which is <hi>under
it,</hi> and a <hi>subduing power</hi> in respect of that
which is <hi>against it.</hi> First the Word hath
a governing power, in respect of those
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:12557:112"/>
which are subject to it; for which cause
it is every where called a Law, and a<note n="q" place="margin">Iam. 2. 8.</note>
royall, that is, a commanding Soveraigne
Law, It beares Dominion in the soule con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
each faculty to it selfe, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the righteous, furnisheth unto good
workes, raiseth the drooping, bindeth the
broken, comforteth the afflicted, reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the straggling. Secondly, it subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
all emnity, and opposition, discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth
Satan, beateth downe the strong
holdes of sinne, tis<note n="r" place="margin">Heb 3. 12.</note> a Sword to cut
off, a<note n="s" place="margin">2 Cor 10 4.</note> weapon to subdue, a<note n="t" place="margin">Ierem 23. 29</note> Hammer
to breake in peeces whatsoever thought
riseth up against it. Now then let a mans
conscience make but these few demands
unto it selfe.</p>
               <p>Hath the <hi>light,</hi> and power of Gods
Word discovered it selfe unto mee?
Have the Scriptures made me knowne
unto my selfe? have they unlocked those
crooked windings of my perverse heart?
have they manifested unto my soule not
onely those sinnes which the light of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
could have discerved, but even those
privy corruptions which I could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
have knowne? have they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
me with the devices of Satan,
wherewith he lieth in waite to deceive?
have they taught me to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
truth, and appearances, betweene
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:12557:112"/>
goodnes, and shaddowes, to finde out the
better part, the one necessary thing, and
to adhere unto it? am I sensible of the
sweetnes and benefits of his holy Word,
doth it refresh my soule, and revive me
unto every good worke? Is it unto my
soule like the<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> hony Combe, like<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 23.</note>
pleasant pastures, like<note n="c" place="margin">Esay 12. 3. Esay 49<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 10.</note> springs of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
like [d] the Tree of life? doe I take
it along with me wheresoever I goe, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
me from stumbling, and straggling in
this valley of darknes, and shaddow of
death? Againe doe I feele the <hi>power</hi> of it
like a Royall commanding Law, bearing
rule in my soule? Am I willing to submit,
and resigne my selfe unto the obedience
of it? doe I not against the cleere, and
convincing evidence thereof, entertaine in
my bosome any the least rebellious thought?
Doe I spare noe <hi>Agag,</hi> noe ruling sinne?
withdraw noe wedge or babilonish Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
noe gainefull sin? make a league
with noe <hi>Gibeonite,</hi> noe pretending sinne?
But doe I suffer it like <hi>Ioshua</hi> to destroy
every <hi>Cananite,</hi> even the sinne which for
sweetnes I roled under my tongue? doth
it batter the Towers of <hi>Ierico,</hi> breake
downe the Bul-warkes of the flesh? lead
into captivity the corruptions of nature?
mortifie, and crucifie the old man in
me? doth it minister comforts unto me
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:12557:113"/>
in all the ebbs, and droopings of my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
even above the confluence of all
earthly happines, and against the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of all outward discontents? and doe
I set up a resolution thus alwayes to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
my selfe unto the Regiment thereof?
In one word, doth it convince me of sin
in my selfe, and so humble me to repent
of it? of Righteousnes in CHRIST, and
so raise me, to beleeve in it, of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
judgment in governing the soules
of true beleevers by the power of love, and
beauty of his graces, and so constraine,
and perswade me to be obedient unto it?
These are those good premises out of which
I may infallibly conclude, that I have
had the beginnings, the seeds of Faith
shed a abroad in my heart, which will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
be further quickned by that <hi>holy
spirit</hi> who is the next, and principall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer
of it.</p>
               <p>The operations of this <hi>holy spirit</hi> being
as numberlesse, as all the holy actions of
the Faithfull, cannot therefore all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be set downe, I shall touch at some
few which are of principall, and obvious
observation. First of all, the spirit is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of <hi>liberty,</hi> and a spirit of <hi>prayer,</hi> It
takes away the<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> bondage, and<note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 1. 7.</note>
feare, wherein we naturally are (for feare
makes us runne from God as from a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:12557:113"/>
and revenging Iudge, never any
man in danger fledde thither for succour
whence the danger issued, feare is so farre
from this that it<note n="d" place="margin">Wisd. 17. 11. Timor ctiam an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilia reformidat, q Curt.</note> betrayeth and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth
those very assistances which reason
offereth) and it enableth us to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
and recourse unto God himselfe whom
our sins had provoked: and in our prayers,
like <hi>Aron,</hi> and <hi>Hurr,</hi> it supporteth our
hands that they doe not faint nor fall. It
raiseth the soule unto divine and unutte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
petitions, and it melteth the heart
into sights and groanes that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the holy Ghost is compared
unto a <hi>witnesse,</hi> whose proper worke it is to
reveale and affirme some truth which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in question. There is in a mans bosome
by reason of that enmity and rebellion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the flesh and the spirit, and by
meanes of Satans suggestions sundry dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
and conflicts wherein Satan questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
the title wee pretend to salvation. In
this case the Spirit of a man (as one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
choose but do when his whole estate is
made ambiguous) staggereth, droopeth and
is much distressed: till at last the Spirit of
God, by the light of the Word, the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie
of Conscience, and the sensible
motions of inward grace, layeth open our
title, and helpeth us to reade the evidence
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:12557:114"/>
of it, and thus recomposeth our troubled
thoughts.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the<note n="e" place="margin">Ephs 430.</note> Spirit of God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to a <hi>Seale:</hi> the<note n="f" place="margin">Cui ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> worke of a <hi>Seale</hi> is first to make a <hi>siampe</hi> and <hi>impression</hi> in
some other matter, secondly, by that means
to difference, and <hi>distinguish</hi> it from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things: And so the Spirit of God
doth fashion the hearts of his people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a conformity with Christ, framing in
it holy impressions, and renewing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed
Image of God therein; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
separateth them from sinners, maketh
them of a distinct common-wealth under
a distinct governement, that whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were subject to the same Prince,
Lawes, and desires with the world, being
now called out, they are new men and have
another character upon them. Secondly, a
<hi>Seale</hi> doth <hi>obsignate,</hi> and ratifie some Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Grant, or conveyance to the person
unto whom it belongeth. It is used amongst
men for confirming their mutuall trust in
each other. And so certainely doth the
Spirit of God<note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 1. 14.</note> pre-affect the soule with
an evident taste of that glory which in the
Day of Redemption shall be actually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferd
upon it, and therefore it is called an
hansell, earnest, and first fruit of life.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Spirit of God is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to an <hi>oyntment;</hi> now the properties of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:12557:114"/>
oyntments are first to <hi>supple</hi> to <hi>asswage</hi>
tumors in the body: and so doth the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God <hi>mollifie</hi> the hardnesse of mans
heart, and worke it to a sensible tendernes
and quicke apprehension of every sinne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>oyntments</hi> doe open, and penetrate
those places unto which they are applied;
and so the<note n="c" place="margin">1 Ioh. 2. 20.</note> Unction which the faithfull
have, <hi>teacheth</hi> them all things, and openeth
their eyes to see the wonders of Gods Law,
and the beauty of his graces. In<note n="d" place="margin">Sonus verbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nostrorum aures percutit magister intus est quantum ad m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

are all outward sounds or Sermons, unlesse
this Spirit be within to teach us. Thirdly,
oyntments doe <hi>refresh</hi> and lighten nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
as they make way for the emission of
all noxious humours, so likewise for the free
passage and translation of all vitall spirits,
which doe enliven and comfort. And so
the Spirit of God is a Spirit of <hi>consolation,</hi>
and a spirit of <hi>life,</hi> hee is the<note n="e" place="margin">Ioh. 14<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>16.</note> comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Church. Lastly,<note n="f" place="margin">Ex. 30. 25. 30.</note> oyntments
in the Leviticall Law, and in the state of
the Iewes were for <hi>consecration</hi> and <hi>seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi>
of things unto some holy use. As
Christ is said to bee<note n="g" place="margin">Heb 1. 9.</note> annoynted by his
Father unto the oeconomy of that great
worke, the redemption of the world: and
thus doth the holy-Ghost annoint us to be
a<note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 9.</note> Royall Priest-hood, a holy Nation,
a people set at liberty.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, and lastly, I finde the holy Ghost
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:12557:115"/>
compared unto<note n="b" place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 19</note> fire, whose properties
are, first, to bee of a very <hi>active</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
nature, which stands never still, but
is ever doing something: and so the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of God and his graces are all opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in the hearts of the faithfull, they set
all where they come on worke. Secondly,
the nature and proper motion of fire is to
<hi>ascend,</hi> other motions whatever it hath, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise
from some outward, and accidentall
restraint, limiting the nature of it: and so
the Spirit of God, ever raiseth up the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
from earth, fastneth the eye of
Faith upon Eternity, ravisheth the soule
with a servent longing to bee with the
Lord, and to bee admitted unto the fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition
of those pretious joyes which heere
it suspireth after, as soone as ever men have
chosen Christ to bee their Head, then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<hi>ascendunt de Terra,</hi> they goe up out
of the Land. <hi>Hos.</hi> 1. 11. and have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
above where Christ is. Thirdly, fire
doth <hi>inflame</hi> and <hi>transforme</hi> every thing that
is combustible into the nature of it selfe:
and so the Spirit of God filleth the soule
with a divine fervour,<note place="margin">Spiritus Ardor is Isai 44.</note> and zeale which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
away the corruptions and drosse of
the flesh, with the spirit of judgment, and
with the Spirit of burning. Fourthly, fire
hath a <hi>purifying</hi> and <hi>cleansing</hi> property, to
draw away all noxious or infectious vapors
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:12557:115"/>
out of the Ayre, to separate all soyle and
drosse from mettalls, and the like: and so
doth the Spirit of God clense the heart,
and in heavenly sighes, and repentant teares,
cause to expire all those steemes of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
those noysome and infectious lusts
which fight against the soule, Fifthly, fire
hath a <hi>penetrating</hi> and <hi>insinuating</hi> quallity,
whereby it creepeth into all the pores of a
combustible body, and in like manner the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit of God doth penetrate the heart
though full of insensible and inscrutible
windings, doth search the reines, doth pry
into the closest nookes, and inmost cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the soule, there discovering and
working out those secret corruptions which
did deceive and defile us. Lastly, fire doth
<hi>illighten,</hi> and by that meanes communicates
the comforts of it selfe unto others: and
so the Spirit being a Spirit of truth doth
illuminate the understanding, and doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it likewise to discover its light unto
others who stand in need of it: for this is
the nature of Gods grace, that when Christ
hath manifested himselfe to the soule of one
man, it setteth him on worke to manifest
Christ unto others, as <hi>Andrew</hi> to <hi>Simon.

               <p>These propositions being thus set downe,
let the conscience assume them to it selfe

of feare, and bondage, which maketh a
man like <hi>Adam</hi> to fly from the presence
of GOD in his Word? doe I finde my
selfe able with affiance, and firme hope
to fly unto God, as unto an Alter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge
in time of trouble, and to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Name? and this not onely with
an outward battology, and lipp-labour but
by the spirit to cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father? doth
the testimony of Gods Spirit settle, and
compose such doubtings in me as usually
arise out of the Warre betweene Flesh,
and Faith? doe I finde a change, and
transformation in me from the vanity of
my old conversation unto the Image of
Christ, and of that originall Justice where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I was created? doe I finde my selfe
distinguished, and taken out from the
World by Heavenly mindednes, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
affections, by renouncing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
abandoning the corruptions, suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

but with that blessed hope of a City,
made without hands, immortall, undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and that fadeth not away? doe I
finde in my heart an habituall tendernes,
and aptnes to bleed, and relent, at the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of any sinne, though mainly crossing
my carnall delights, and whatever plots

mine owne secular ends, if by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectnes,

doe I finde my selfe in reading, or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Gods Word, inwardly wrought upon,
to admire the Wisdome, assent unto the

a concionable conversation? Lastly, are the

Then I have an evident, and infallible
token that having thus farre partaked of
the spirit of Life, and by consequence
of Faith, whereby our soules are fastned

               <p>The second <hi>medium</hi> formerly proposed
for the tryall of Faith was the nature,
and essence of it. To finde out the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall
nature</hi> of Faith we must first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that all Faith, is not a saving Faith.
For there is a Faith that worketh a<note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 2 19.</note> 
                  <hi>trembling</hi> as in the Divels, and there is a
Faith which<note n="b" place="margin">Rom 5. 1.</note> worketh <hi>life, and peace</hi>
as in those that are justified. Faith in
generall is an <hi>assent</hi> of the reasonable soule,
unto revealed truths. Now every <hi>medium,</hi> or in

from the <hi>light</hi> which the <hi>obejct</hi> it selfe
proposeth to the faculty, and this the
blessed<note n="d" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 7.</note> Apostle contradistinguisheth
from <hi>faith</hi> by the name of <hi>light;</hi> or else
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:12557:118"/>
it is drawne from the <hi>authority,</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticalnes</hi>
of a <hi>narrator,</hi> upon whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
while we relie without any evidence
of the thing it selfe, the <hi>assent</hi> which we
produce is an assent of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>credence.</hi>
The<note n="e" place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Samaritans</hi> did first assent unto
the miracles of CHRIST by the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>
of the woman, and this was <hi>faith,</hi>
but afterwards they assented because them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had <hi>heard</hi> him speake, and this was
sight. Now both those assents have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed
unto them, either <hi>evidence,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
or onely <hi>probability</hi> admitting
degrees of feare, and suspition. That <hi>faith</hi>
is a <hi>certaine assent,</hi> and <hi>Certitudine rei</hi> in
regard of the object, even above the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of demonstrative conclusions is on
all hands confest: because howsoever <hi>qan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
ad certitudinem mentis,</hi> in regard of
our weakenes, and distrust wee are often
subject to stagger, yet in the thing it
selfe it dependeth upon the infallibility
of Gods owne Word, which hath said it,
and by consequence is neerer unto him
who is the Fountaine of all truth, and
therefore doth more share in the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of truth which are <hi>certainty,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi>
then any thing proved by meere
naturall reasons, and the assent produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by it is differenced from suspition, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitancie,
or dubitation in the opinion of
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:12557:119"/>
Schoole-men themselves.</p>
               <p>Now then in as much as we are bound
to yeild an <hi>evident assent</hi> unto the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of our christian Faith, both <hi>intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall</hi>
in regard of the <hi>truth,</hi> and <hi>fiduciall</hi>
in regard of the <hi>goodnes</hi> of them respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
to our owne benefit, and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Necessary it is that the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
be convinced of those <hi>two</hi> things.
First <hi>that GOD is of infallible Authority,</hi> and
cannot lie nor deceive, which thing is
a principle unto which the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
doth willingly assent. And <hi>secondly
that this Authority</hi> which in Faith I thus
relie upon <hi>is indeede,</hi> and infallibly <hi>Gods
owne</hi> Authority. The <hi>meanes</hi> whereby I
come to know that may be eyther <hi>extroardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi>
as <hi>revelation;</hi> such as was made to
prophets concerning future events: or else
<hi>ordinary,</hi> and <hi>common</hi> to all the Faithfull.
For discovery of them we must againe
rightly distinguish the double Act of Faith.
First that Act whereby wee assent unto
the <hi>generall</hi> truth of the object <hi>in it selfe,</hi>
secondly, that Act whereby we rest per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
of the <hi>goodnes</hi> thereof unto us in
<hi>particular,</hi> with respect unto both with
these doth a double question arise.</p>
               <p>First touching the meanes whereby a
beleever comes to know that the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and authority within the promises,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:12557:119"/>
and truths of Scripture hee relieth upon,
are certainly, and infallibly <hi>Gods owne
Authority.</hi> Which question is all one with
that how a Christian man may infallibly be
assured <hi>(ita ut non possit subesse falsum)</hi>
that the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> are the very dictates
of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>For the resolution whereof in a very
few words wee must first agree, that as
noe <hi>created understanding</hi> could ever have
<hi>invented</hi> the <hi>mystery</hi> of the Gospell, (it
being the counsell of Gods owne bosome,<note place="margin">Vid. Chrysost Hom. 7. in 1 Cor.</note>
and containing such manifold wisdomes as
the Angels are astonished at) So, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dictated, and revealed by Almighty
God, such is the deepnes, excellency,
and holines of it, that the <hi>naturall man,</hi>
whose faculties are vitiated by originall,
and contracted corruption cannot by the
strength of his owne naked principles be
able to <hi>understand</hi> it. For notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  </gap>, <hi>demonstration,</hi> and

                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:12557:120"/>
And this doth plainly appeare upon this
ground. One principall end, we know, of
the Gospell is, <hi>To cast downe every high
thing that exalteth it selfe against the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of GOD,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 10 4. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>and to bring into capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi>
So that untill such time as the light of
Evangelicall truth have thus farre prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
over the conscience, certaine it is that
the practicall Judgment is not yet fully
convinced of it, or acquainted with it.
It is an excellent speech of the Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher

such likewise doth the <hi>end</hi> appeare unto
him. And therefore naturall men whose

sensuall, and worldly, never have
a supernaturall good appeare unto them

and corrupt worship which was amongst
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Naturall Reason</hi> then being (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
any remainders of strength, or vigour
in it) too impotent to discover the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Gods Word, and unable alone to
present the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as <hi>objectum credibile,</hi> and
as the infallible <hi>Oracle</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> It remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
that wee consider by what further
meanes this may bee effected. And, in one
word, there is a three-fold different, but sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
causality requisite to the founding
of this Assent.</p>
               <p>The first is <hi>ministeriall, dispositive,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory</hi>
by <hi>Ecclesiasticall dispensation,</hi> which
is likewise two-fold. First, to those that are
bred in her bosome, and matriculated by
Baptisme, and so from their infancie trained
up to have a reverend and due esteeme of
her authority, there is her act of <hi>Tradition,</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:12557:122"/>
delivering to her children in this age,<note place="margin">Aug de doctr. Christ. in pro. Hooker. lib. 3. ss. 8 Camer. de Eccl. pag. 411.</note> as
shee her selfe by a continued succession hath
also received, this as an indubitate principle
to bee rested on, that holy Scriptures are
the Word of <hi>God.</hi> Secondly, If the Church
meete with such as are without her bosome,
and so will not ascribe any thing to her
maternall Authority in <hi>Testification</hi> and
<hi>Tradition,</hi> except shee can by strength of
argument evince what shee affirmeth, shee
is not in that case destitute of her <hi>Arma
praelusoria,</hi> valid and sufficient arguments to
make <hi>preparation</hi> in mindes not extreamely
possessed with prejudice and perversenesse
for the entertaining of this principle.</p>
               <p>As first, that all Sciences have their
<hi>Hypotheses</hi> and <hi>Postulata.</hi> Certaine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
which are to bee granted, and not
disputed, and that even in lower Sciences
and more commensurate to humane reason,
yet <hi>Oportet discentem credere,</hi> hee must <hi>first
Beleeve</hi> principles for granted, and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
some progresse and better proficiency
in the study, he shall not faile more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to perceive the infallibility of them by
their <hi>owne light.</hi> That therefore which is
granted unto all other Sciences more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending
to the reach of humane judgment
than Divinity doth, cannot without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
pertinacy be denied unto it, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
considering that of all so many
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:12557:122"/>
millions of men, who, in all ages, have
thus been contented to beleeve, first, upon
Ecclesiasticall <hi>Tradition</hi> and suggestion, there
hath not in any age been enough to make
up a number, who upon inducements of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
and debate have forsaken the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
at the last, which is a strong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
that they all who persisted in the
embracing of them, did after triall, and
further acquaintance by certaine taste and
<hi>experience</hi> finde the <hi>Testimony</hi> and <hi>tradition</hi>
of the <hi>Church</hi> to bee therein faithfull, and
certaine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That man being made by God,
and subject to his will, and owing unto
him worship and obedience, which in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ought to bee prescribed by none other
than by him to whom it is to bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that therefore requisite and congruous
it is, that the Will of God should bee
made knowne unto his Creature, in such a
manner, and by such meanes, as that hee
shall not without his owne willfull neglect
mistake it; in as much as <hi>Law</hi> is the rule
of <hi>obedience,</hi> and <hi>promulgation</hi> the force of
Law.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that no other Rule or Religion
can bee assigned, either of <hi>Pagans</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetans,</hi>
which may not manifestly by the
strength of <hi>right reason</hi> bee justly disproved,
as not proceeding from <hi>God,</hi> either by the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:12557:123"/>
latenesse of its originall, or the shortnesse
of its continuance, or the vanity and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tishnesse
of its rules, or the contradictions
within it selfe, or by some other apparent
imperfection. And for that of the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
notwithstanding it had its originall from
Divine ordination, yet from thence like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it may bee made appeare out of those
Scriptures which they confesse, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
its period and abrogation. <hi>God</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
that as hee had the first time sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the Mount in the publication of the
Law, and first founding of the <hi>Mosaicall</hi>
Pedagogie, so he would once againe shake
both the Earth, and the Heaven, in the
promulgation of the Gospell. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
that force of reason will easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that with such a God, as the old
Scriptures set forth the Lord to be, the
bloud of Bulls, and Goates could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
make expiation for sinne, but must
necessarily relate to some greater sacrifice,
which is in the Gospell revealed. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
whereas the Lord was wont for the
greatest sinnes of that people, namely Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry,
and pollution of his worship, to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
them notwithstanding, with more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
punishments (their two greatest cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities
having beene that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which
was not much above two hundred yeares, and
that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> which was but seventie;) yet
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:12557:123"/>
now, when they hate Idolatry as much as
ever their fathers loved it, they have lien
under wrath to the uttermost, under the
heaviest judgment of dispersion, contempt,
and basenesse, and that for fifteene hundred
yeeres together; a reason whereof can bee
no other given than that fearefull impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which hath derived the staine of the
bloud of Christ upon the children of those
that shed it unto this day.<note place="margin">Matth. 27 25.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>prevailing</hi> of the Gospell
by the ministery of but a <hi>few,</hi> and those
unarmed, impotent, and <hi>despised men,</hi> and
that too, against all the <hi>opposition</hi> which
power, wit, or malice could call up, making
it appeare, that Christ was <hi>to rule in the
midst of enemies.</hi> When <hi>Lucian, Porphyrie,
Libanius,</hi> and <hi>Iulian,</hi> by their <hi>wits; Nero,
Severus, Diocletian,</hi> and other Tyrants by
their <hi>swords,</hi> the whole world by their scorne,
malice, and contempt, and all the arts
which Satan could suggest, laboured the
suppression, and extinguishing of it. The
<hi>prevaling,</hi> I say, of the <hi>Gospell</hi> by such
<hi>meanes,</hi> against such <hi>power,</hi> in the midst of
such <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>danger,</hi> and that over
such <hi>persons</hi> as were by long custome and
tradition from their fathers trained up in
a Religion extreamely contrary to the
truth, and very favourable to all vitious
dispositions, and upon such <hi>conditions</hi> to
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:12557:124"/>
deny themselves, to hate the world, and
the flesh, to suffer joyfully the losse of
credit, friends, peace, quiet, goods, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
life and all, for the name of a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
Saviour, whom their eyes never saw,
and whom their eares daily heard to bee
blasphemed, such a prevailing as this must
needs prove the originall of the Gospell
to bee divine, for had not God favoured
it as much as men hated it, impossible it
must needs have been for it, to have continued.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, that the doctrines therein deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered,
were confirmed by <hi>miracles,</hi> and
divine operations. And certaine it is, that
God would not in so wonderfull a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
have honoured the figments of men,
pretending his Name, and Authority to
the countenancing of their owne inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And for the Historicall Truth of
those <hi>miracles,</hi> they were not, in those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
when the Church in her Apologies
did glory of them, and when, if faigned,
they migh most easily have been dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
nor yet by those enemies who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailously
maligned and persecuted Christian
Religion, ever gain saied.</p>
               <p>Lastly, That were it not so that <hi>omne
mendacium est pellucidum,</hi> and hath ever
something in it to bewray it selfe, yet it
could not bee <hi>operaepretium</hi> for them to
<hi>lie</hi> in publishing a Doctrine whereby they
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:12557:124"/>
got nothing but shame, stripes, imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
persecution, Torments, Death. Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
since the holinesse of their lives,
their humility, in denying all glory to
themselves, and ascribing all to God, must
needs make it appeare to any reasonable
man, that they did not lay any project for
their owne glory, which they purposely
disclaymed, refused to receive from the hands
of such as offered it, yea, and registred
their owne infirmities upon perpetuall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
               <p>With these and many other the like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
is the <hi>Church</hi> furnished to <hi>prepare</hi>
the mindes of men, swayed with but ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
ingenuity, and respect to common
Reason, at the least to looke further, and
make some sad inquiry into the Doctrine
of the Gospell. There being therein especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
promises of good things made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
monie or price, of incomprehensible
value, and of eternall continuance.</p>
               <p>But now though a Philosopher may
make a very learned discourse to a blinde
man of colours, yet it cannot bee that any
formall and adaequate notion of them should
bee fashioned in his minde, till such time
as the faculty bee restored, and then, all
that preceeding Lecture being compared
with what hee afterward actually seeth in
the things themselves, doth marvailously
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:12557:125"/>
settle and satisfie his minde. So though
the <hi>Church</hi> by these and the like induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
doth <hi>prepare</hi> the minds of men to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to <hi>divine Authority</hi> in the Scriptures,
yet till the <hi>naturall ineptitude</hi> and <hi>disposition</hi>
of the soule be healed, and it raised to a
capacity of <hi>supernaturall light,</hi> the worke is
no whit brought to maturity.</p>
               <p>Two things therefore doe yet remaine
after this <hi>ministry</hi> and <hi>manuduction</hi> of the
<hi>Church.</hi> First, an Act of the <hi>Grace</hi> of Gods
Spirit healing the understanding, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the eye that it may see wonders in
the Law, writing the Law in the heart, and
so making it a fit receptacle for so great a
light. Secondly, the <hi>subject</hi> being thus by
the <hi>outward motives</hi> from the Church <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi>
and by the <hi>inward Grace</hi> of God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,</hi>
then lastly the <hi>object</hi> it selfe being
proposed, and being maturely considerd by
<hi>reason</hi> thus <hi>guided,</hi> and thus <hi>assisted,</hi> doth
then shew forth such an Heavenly <hi>light</hi>
of holinesse, puritie, majesty, authority,
efficacy, mercy, wisedome, comfort, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
in one word, such an unsearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Treasurie of internall mysteries, as that
now the soule is as fully able by the <hi>native
light</hi> of the Scriptures to distinguish their
<hi>Divine originall,</hi> and <hi>authenticalnesse</hi> from
any other meere humane writings, as the eye
is to observe the difference betweene a
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:12557:125"/>
                  <hi>beame</hi> of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and a <hi>blaze</hi> of a <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second question is how the Soule
comes to bee setled in this <hi>perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
that the <hi>goodnesse</hi> of these truths foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on the <hi>Authority</hi> of God, doe <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly</hi>
belong unto it? Whereunto I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
in one word, That this ariseth from
a <hi>two-fold Testimonie</hi> grounded upon a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
worke of Gods Spirit. For first, the
Spirit of God putteth his feare into the
hearts of his servants, and purgeth their
consciences, by applying the bloud of Christ
unto them, from dead workes, wish affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
strongly, and very sensibly altering
the constitution of the minde, must needs
notably manifest themselves unto the soule,
when by any reflex act shee shall set her
selfe to looke inward upon her owne ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
               <p>This being thus wrought by the grace
of God, thereupon there ensueth a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Testimonie. The first of a mans owne
spirit, as wee see in the examples of <hi>Iob,
David,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 31. Ps 116. 1. 26. 1. 11 Isai. 38 3 Nehe 13. 14. 22. Act. 24. 16. Iob. 21 15. 17. 2 Cor 1. 12. Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Hezekiah, Nehemiah, Saul,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
namely, That hee desireth to feare
Gods name, to keepe a conscience void of
offence, to walke in all integrity towards
God, and men, from which, and the like
personall qualifications, arise joy in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Ghost,
peace of conscience, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:12557:126"/>
of sweetnes in the fellowship with
the Father, and his Sonne. Secondly, the
Testimony of the holy Spirit, bearing
witnes to the sincerity of those affections,
and to the evidence and truth of those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions
which himselfe, by his grace
stirred up. So then first the Spirit of
God writeth the Law in the heart, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
obedience whereunto ariseth the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of a mans owne spirit: And then
he writeth the promises in the heart, and
by them ratifieth and confirmeth a mans
hops, and joyes unto him.</p>
               <p>I understand not all this which hath been
spoken <hi>generally</hi> of all <hi>assents</hi> unto objects
Divine, which I take it in regard of their
evidence, firmnes, and stability doe much
differ according unto the divers tempers
of those hearts in which they reside; but
principally unto the cheife of those as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
which are proper unto saving Faith.
For assent as I said in <hi>generall</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
unto Divils with men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to make up the creature of true Faith.
There is required some differencing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
whereby it may be constituted in
the entire essence of saving Faith. In each
sense we may observe that unto the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
faculty whereby it is able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
objects proportioned to it, there is
annexed ever another property whereby
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:12557:126"/>
according to the severall nature of the
objects proposed it is apt to delight or
be ill affected with it: for example, our
eare apprehendeth all sounds in common,
but according as is the Harmony or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
of the sound, it is apt to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
or offence at it. Our taste reacheth
unto whatsoever is the object of it, but
yet some things there are which grievously
offend the Palate, others which as much
delight it, and so it is in Divine assents.
Some things in some subjects bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
with them tremblings, horrors, feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expectations, aversation of minde, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to admit or be pursued with the
evidence of Divine truths, as it is in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
and despayring sinners. Other as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
on the contrary doe beget serenity
of minde, a sweete complacency, delight,
adherence, and comfort: Into the hearts
of some men doth the Truth of GOD
shine like Lightning with a penetrating,
and amasing brightnes, in others like the
Sunne with comfortable, and refreshing
Beames.</p>
               <p>For understanding whereof wee are to
observe that in matters practicall, and
Divine (and so in all others,<note place="margin">Doctor <hi>Iack<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>â€¢</desc>
                        </gap>on</hi> of Faith.</note> though not
in an equall measure) the <hi>truth</hi> of them
is ever mutually embraced, and as it were
insolded in their <hi>goodnes;</hi> for as <hi>truth</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:12557:127"/>
doth not delight the understanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be a <hi>good truth,</hi> that is such as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the understanding beares a relation of
convenience (whence arise diversities in
mens studies, because all men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
affected with all kindes of truth)
so <hi>good</hi> doth noe way affect the will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be a <hi>true,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Isay. 29. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>and reall good.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
it proves but like the banquet of a
dreaming man, which leaves him as
hungry, and empty as when he lay downe.
<hi>Goodnes</hi> then added unto <hi>truth</hi> doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the assent generate a kinde
of rest, and delight in the heart on which
it shineth.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>goodnes</hi> Morall, or Divine hath a
<hi>double relation.</hi> A relation unto that <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi>
in dependency on, and propinquitie
whereunto it consilleth, and a relation unto
that <hi>faculty</hi> or subject wherein it resideth, and
whereunto it is proposed. <hi>Good</hi> in the
former sense is that which beares in it
a <hi>proportion</hi> unto the Fountaine of good;
for every thing is in it selfe so farre good
as it resembles that originall which is
the author, and patterne of it, and that
is GOD. In the second sense that is
good which beares a conveniency, and
fitnes to the minde which entertaines it.
good, I meane not alwayes in <hi>nature,</hi>
but in <hi>apprehension.</hi> All Divine truths are
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:12557:127"/>
in themselves essentially good, but yet
they worke not alwaies delight, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
in the minds of men untill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned,
and fitted unto the faculty that
receives them. As the Sunne is it in it selfe
equally light, the water in a Fountaine
of it selfe equally sweete: but according
unto the severall Temper of the eye
which perceiveth the one, and of the ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
through which the other passeth, they
may prove to be offensive, and distastfull.
But now further when the faculty is thus
fitted to receive a good, it is not the
generality of that good which pleaseth
neyther, but the particular <hi>propriety,</hi> and
interest thereunto. Wealth and honor as
it is <hi>in it selfe</hi> good, so is it likewise
<hi>in the apprehension</hi> of most men; yet we
see men are apt to be griev'd at it in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and to looke on it with an evill
eye, nothing makes them to delight in
it, but possession and propriety unto it.
I speake here onely of such <hi>Divine good
things</hi> as are by God appointed to make
happy his creature, namely our blessed
Lord, and Saviour Jesus Christ, his
Obedience, Satisfaction, Resurrection,
Ascension, Intercession, Glory, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elce it is of which he hath been unto
his<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Church the Author, Purchaser, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyer,

Now, unto these as unto other good
things there is a <hi>double right</hi> belonging
by free donation from him unto the
Church, a <hi>right of propriety unto</hi> the thing,
and a right of <hi>possession</hi> in the thing. This
latter is that which here in Earth the
Church suspireth, and longeth after;
that other onely it is which here we have,
and that confirmed unto us by a double
Title. The first as the Land of <hi>Cannan</hi>
was confirmed unto the <hi>Israelits</hi> by some
few clusters of Grapes, and other Fruits
of the Land, I meane by the earnest first
fruits, and pledges of the spirit: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
by the free promise of Christ who
cannot deceive. Thus then at last we have
discovered the proper, ultimate, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<hi>object</hi> of faith, which is all Divine
truth, and goodnes, unto which there
is a right and propriety given to all such
as are Christs, though not in <hi>actuall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,</hi>
yet in an <hi>infallible promise,</hi> and
the <hi>Acts</hi> by which they entertaine that
object, <hi>assenting, adhearing,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
in it as <hi>particularly good.</hi> By
these two, to wit the object and the Act.
(as all other habits of the minde) so
is this of faith to bee defined. So that
from these observations I take it wee
may conclude that the nature of saving
faith admits of some such explications
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:12557:128"/>
as this, <hi>Faith</hi> is a particular, personall,
<hi>applicative,</hi> and experimentall <hi>assent</hi> unto
all Divine Revelations, as <hi>true,</hi> and good
not in <hi>general</hi> onely, but <hi>unto me</hi> arising
out of that sweete correspondency which
is betweene the soule, and from that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
and experience of sweetnes which the
soule, being raised, and illightned by Gods
Spirit, doth finde in them.</p>
               <p>I have been over teadious in finding
out this definition of the nature of faith,
and therefore brieflie from these grounds,
let the conscience impartially examine it
selfe in such demands as these. Doe I
finde in my selfe a most <hi>willing assent</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole compasse of Divine truths,
not out of constraint, nor with griefe,
reluctancie, and trembling of spirit? doth
Gods Word shine on me not like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
which pierceth the Eye-lids
though they shut themselves against it,
but doth this finde in my heart a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and a willing admittance? Am I
glad when I finde any Divine truth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
of which formerly I had been ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant?
doe I not of purpose close mine
eyes, forbeare the meanes of true infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
stifle and smother Divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
quench the motions, and dictats
of Gods Spirit in me? am I not ignorant
<hi>willingly</hi> of such things, the mention where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:12557:129"/>
would disquiet me in my bosome sin,
and the inquiry whereunto would crosse
the reserved resolutions, and unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
projects which I am peremptory to
prosecute? am I not so in league with
mine owne corruptions that I could har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
wish some Divine truths were not
revealed,<note place="margin">Vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sting my conscience, and disable me from

I assent unto all Divine truths as a like
pretious, and with equall adherence? am
I as little displeased with the truth of
GODS threats as of his promises? doe
they as powerfully worke upon me to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,</hi>
as the other to <hi>refresh</hi> me? doe
I beleeve them all not onely in the <hi>Thesis</hi>
or generall, but in the <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> and
respectively to mine owne particular?
againe, doe I finde my heart fitted unto
the goodnes of Divine truth? am I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to embrace with much affection,
and loving delight whatsoever promises
are made unto me? doe I finde a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
taste and relish in the food of life?
which having once tasted of, I finde my
selfe weaned from the love of the World?
from admiring the honours, pursuing the
preferments, hunting after the applause,
adoring the glories, and selling my soule
and liberty for the smiles thereof? doe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:12557:129"/>
the sweetnes of those promises like the
fruits brought by the spies from <hi>Canaan,</hi>
so much affect me as that to come to
the full possession thereof, I am at a point
with all other things, ready to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
any <hi>Cananite,</hi> or sinfull lust that shall
oppose me, to adventure on any difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that might deterre me, to passe
thorow a Sea, a Wildernes, through fiery
Serpents, the darts of Satan; yea, if
neede were by the gates of Hell? briefly
doe I finde in my heart (however in it
selfe froward, and wayward from any
good) a more then naturall livelinesse, and
vigor which disposeth me to approve of
the word, promises, and purchases of my
salvation as of an unvaluable Jewell, so
pretious as that all the things in this
World are but as dung in comparison?
to a most fervent expectation, and longing
after them, to a heavenly perswation of
my happines by them, and Lastly, to a
sweete delight in them, working peace of
conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost,
a love of CHRISTS appearing, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to bee like unto him, and a
desire above all things to be with him,
and enjoy him, (which are all so many
secret, and pure issues of the spirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption)?
I may from these premises
infallibly conclude that I am possessed of
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:12557:130"/>
a lively faith, and thereby of those first
fruits which bring with them an assurance of
that great harvest of glory in the day of
redemption. And in the meane time hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this wedding garment, I may with much
confidence approach Gods Table to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

was assigned for the

was the properties or
effects of it, by which
as by stepps we raise
our thoughts to the

it selfe. To assigne all the consequences
or effects of Faith is a labour as difficult
as it would be tedious. I decline both,
and shall therefore touch upon some spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
ones which if present, all the rest in

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:12557:130"/>
And now as in the soule of man there
are two kinde of operations, one <hi>primitive,</hi>
and <hi>substantiall,</hi> which we call the act of
<hi>information,</hi> others <hi>secondary,</hi> and <hi>subsequent,</hi>
as to understand, to will, to desire, and
the like: so <hi>Faith,</hi> being (as hath been
formerly observed) in some sort the <hi>Actus
primus,</hi> or <hi>forme</hi> of a Christian, I meane
that very <hi>medium unionis</hi> whereby the soule
of man is really united to CHRIST,
hath therefore in it two kinds of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The first as it were <hi>substantiall,</hi> the
other <hi>secondary.</hi> The former of these is
that act of <hi>vivisication</hi> or quickning, by
which, Faith doth make a man<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 2. 20.</note> to live
the life of Christ, by<note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 4. 16.</note> knitting him
unto Christ as it were with Joynts, and
Sinews, and<note n="c" place="margin">Iob. 15, 1. 2.</note> ingrafting him into
the unity of that Vine whose Fruit is
Life.</p>
               <p>That which doth quicken is ever of a
more excellent nature then that which is
quickned, now the soule being a spirit,
and therefore within the compasse of
highest created perfection, cannot possibly
be quickned by any but him who is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all perfection, which the Heathen
themselves have acknowledged to be God.
For S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath observed it out of them,
that in him we live, and move, and have
our being. Now unto <hi>life</hi> necessary it is
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:12557:131"/>
that there bee a <hi>vnion</hi> unto the <hi>principall</hi>
or originall of life, which to the soule is
<hi>God.</hi> In regard of the essence of God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be seperated from him he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immense, and filling all things: but
yet in regard of his voluntary communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and dispensing of himselfe unto
the creature, the manner of his <hi>speciall
presence</hi> doth much vary, unto this <hi>speciall
union</hi> of the creature unto God (in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
whereof the creature is quickned) and
doth in some sort live the Life of God.
There is necessarily presupposed some sinew
or <hi>ligament,</hi> which may be therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the <hi>medium,</hi> and instrument of <hi>life.</hi>
This knot in the estate of mans Creation
was the obedience of the Law, or the
covenant of workes, which while man did
maintaine firme, and unshaken, he had an
evident Communion with God in all those
vitall influences which his mercy was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to shed downe upon him: but once
untying this knot, and cutting asunder
that bond, there did immediately ensue
a seperation betweene GOD, and man,
and by an infallible consequence <hi>death</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But God being rich in mercy, and
not willing to plunge his creature into
eternall misery, found a new meanes to
<hi>communicate</hi> himselfe unto him, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a more easie Covenant, which
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:12557:131"/>
should be the second knot of our union unto
him, onely to beleeve in Christ incarnate, who
had done that for us which we our selves had
formerly undone. And this new Covenant is
the <hi>covenant of faith</hi> by which the just doe live.</p>
               <p>But here a man may object that it is
harder for one to discerne that hee doth
live in Christ then that he beleeves in him,
and therefore this can be noe good meane
by which we may finde out the truth of
our Faith. To this wee answer, that life
must be discerned by those tokens which
are inseperable from it, and they are
first a <hi>desire of nourishment,</hi> without
which it cannot continue, for nature hath
imprinted in all things a love of its owne
being, and preservation, and by consequence
a prosecution of all such meanes as may
preserve, and a removeall of all such as
may endanger or oppresse it. Secondly, a
conversion of nourishment into the nature
of the body. Thirdly, <hi>augmentation,</hi> &amp; growth
till we come unto that Stature which our life
requires. Fourthly, <hi>participation</hi> of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
from the vitall parts, the Head, the
Heart, and others, with conformity unto the
principall mover amongst them, for a dead
part is ever withered, immoveable, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient
to the other faculties, Fiftly, a <hi>sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi>
and <hi>communion</hi> in paines, or delights
with the fellow members. Lastly, a free use
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:12557:132"/>
of our senses<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and other faculties, by all
which we may infallibly conclude that a
creature liveth.</p>
               <p>And so it is in Faith. It frameth the
heart to delight in all such spirituall food
as is requisite thereunto. Disposing it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the view, at lest upon the taste of
any poysonous thing to be pained with it,
and cast it up. The food that nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Faith is as in little Infants, of the
same quality with that which begat it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the <hi>word of life,</hi> wherein there is sincere
Milke, and strong meate. The poyson
which endangereth it is <hi>heresie,</hi> which tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the <hi>roote</hi> of Faith, and goeth about
to prevert the assent, and <hi>impiety,</hi> which
blasteth, and corrupteth the <hi>branches.</hi>
All which the soule of a Faithfull man
abhorreth.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in Faith there is a conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
likewise, the vertue whereof ever there
resides where the vitall power is. In <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
life</hi> the power of altering is in the
<hi>man,</hi> and not in the <hi>meate,</hi> and therefore the
meate is assimilated to our flesh: but in
<hi>spirituall</hi> life the quickning faculty is in
the <hi>meate,</hi> and therefore the man is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>similated,
and transformed into the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the meate. And indeed the word
is not cast into the heart of man, as
<hi>meate</hi> into the <hi>stomacke,</hi> to be converted
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:12557:132"/>
into the corrupt quality of nature, but
rather as <hi>seed</hi> into the <hi>ground</hi> to convert
that Earth which is about it into the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of it selfe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, where Faith is there is some
growth in grace, wee grow neerer unto
Heaven then when we first beleeved, an
improvement of our knowledge in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
of godlines, which like the Sunne,
shines brighter, and brighter unto the
perfect day: An increase of willingnes
to obey God in all things; and as in the
growth of naturall bodies if they be sound,
and healthy, so in this of Faith likewise,
it is universall, and uniforme, one part
doth not grow, and another shrivell, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doth one part grow too bigge, and
disproportioned for another, the Head
doth not increase in knowledge,<note place="margin">Ephes 4. 16.</note> and the
Heart decay in love, the Heart doth not
swell in zeale, and the Hand wither in
charity, but in the nourishment of Faith
every grace receives proportionably its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituall
confirmation.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, by the spirituall life of Faith,
the faithfull doe partake of such heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>influences</hi> as are from the <hi>head</hi> shed
downe upon the <hi>members.</hi> The influences
of Christ in his Church are many, and
peradventure in many things impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Some principall I conceive to be the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:12557:133"/>
influence of his <hi>truth,</hi> and the influence of
his <hi>power.</hi> His <hi>truth</hi> is exhibited in <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
the Church, which is <hi>illumination,</hi>
his <hi>power</hi> partly in <hi>guiding</hi> the Church, and
partly in <hi>defending</hi> it, that is <hi>direction,</hi> this
<hi>protection.</hi> Now in all these doe they who
are in Christ, according to the measure and
proportion of his Spirit, certainely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.
They have their eyes more or
lesse opened, like <hi>Paul,</hi> to see the terrours
of God, the fearefulnesse of sinne, the rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennesse
of a spirituall death, the pretious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of Christ and his promises, the glimp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and rayes of that glory which shall be
revealed: they have their feete loosned with
<hi>Lazarus,</hi> that they can now rise, and walke,
and leape, and praise God. Lastly, they are
strengthned and cloathed with the whole
armes of God, which secureth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all the malice, or force of Satan.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, where faith is, there is a <hi>naturall
compassion</hi> in all the members of Christ to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
each other. If sinne be by one mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
committed, the other members are
troubled for it, because they are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of that Spirit which is grieved with
the sinnes of his people. If one part bee
afflicted, the other are interested in the paine,
because all are united together in one head
which is the Fountaine, and originall of
Sense. The members of the Church are
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:12557:133"/>
not like paralyticke, and unjoynted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
which cannot move towards the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
of each other.</p>
               <p>Lastly, where Faith is, there all the <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi>
are <hi>expedite</hi> and free in their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.
The eye open to see the wonders
of Gods Law, the eare open to heare his
voyce, the mouth open to praise his name,
the arme enlarged towards the reliefe of
his servants, the whole man tenderly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
of all pressures, and repugnant qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p>The secondary effects of faith are amongst
sundry others such as these. First,<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> a
<hi>love</hi> and liking of those spirituall <hi>truths</hi>
which by faith I assent unto.<note place="margin">Iustin Martyr. quaest. Orthod. q8.</note> For saving
Faith being an <hi>assent</hi> with <hi>adherence</hi> and
delight, contrary to that of <hi>Divils</hi> which is
with trembling and horror (which delight
is a kinde of relish, and experience of the
goodnesse of those objects wee assent unto.)
It necessarily followes even from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ate
of Nature (which instructeth a man
to love that which worketh in him delight
and comfort) that from this assent must
arise an approbation and love of those
objects whence doth issue such sweetnesse.
A second effect is <hi>affiance,</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
for the present relying on the
goodnesse, and for the future waiting on
the power of God, which shall to the full
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:12557:134"/>
in time performe what hee hath in his
Word promised, when once the minde of
a man is wrought so to assent unto divine
promises made in Christ, as to acknowledge
an interest, and propriety unto them, and
that to bee at last actually performed not
by a <hi>man,</hi> who is subject both to <hi>unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse</hi>
in perseverance and to <hi>disability</hi> in
performance of his promises (for every man
is a lyar, either by imposture, ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
or by impotencie, likely to disappoint
the expectations of those who rely upon
him) but by <hi>Almighty God,</hi> who the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to confirme our faith in him, hath both
by his <hi>Word,</hi> and <hi>Oath</hi> engaged his fidelity,
and is altogether omnipotent to doe what
hee hath purposed: Impossible it is but
from such an assent, grounded on the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,
and on the All-sufficiency of God,
there should result in the minde of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
man a confident dependance on such
promises, renouncing in the meane time all
selfe-dependance, as in it selfe utterly impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and resolving in the midst of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to relie on him, to hold fast his
mercy, and the profession of his Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
wavering, having an eye to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of reward, and being assured that he
who hath promised will certainely bring it
to passe.</p>
               <p>A third effect of Faith is <hi>ioy, and peace</hi> of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:12557:134"/>
Conscience,<note n="b" place="margin">Rom 5<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 1.</note> for <hi>being iustified by faith we
have peace with God.</hi> The minde is by faith,
and the impression of sweetnesse in Gods
Promises, composed unto a setled calme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and serenity. I doe not meane a <hi>dead
peace,</hi> an immobility, and sleepinesse of
Conscience, like the rest of a dreaming pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner:
but such a peace as a man may by
a syllogisme of the practicke judgment
upon right examination of his owne inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
in Christ, safely inferre unto himselfe.
The wicked often hath an appearance of
peace as well as the faithfull: but here is
the difference. Betweene a wicked mans
sinne and him there is a <hi>Doore</hi> shut, which
will surely one day open, for it is but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a doore of <hi>Error,</hi> or the doore of
<hi>Death:</hi> for sinne lieth at the doore, ready
to flye at his throate as soone as it shall
finde either his eyes open to see it, or
his life to let it in upon the soule: but
betweene a faithfull man, and his sinne,
there is a <hi>Corner-stone,</hi> a Wall of fire,
through which Satan himselfe cannot
breake, even the merits of Christ Iesus.
Briefly, the peace which comes from Faith
hath these two properties in it, <hi>tranquility</hi>
and <hi>serenity</hi> too; otherwise it is but like the
calmenesse of the dead Sea, whose un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveablenesse
is not <hi>Nature,</hi> but a <hi>Curse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The last effect which I shall now name
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:12557:135"/>
of Faith, is that generall effect of <hi>fructifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Act. 15.</note>
                  <hi>purifying the heart,</hi> and dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
it unto holinesse, and new obedience,
which is to bee framed after Gods Law.
Faith <hi>unites</hi> us unto Christ, being thus u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
we are quickned by <hi>one</hi> and the same
<hi>Spirit,</hi> having one spirit, and soule we must
needs agree in the <hi>same operations,</hi> and those
operations must necessarily beare conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
unto the same <hi>rule,</hi> and that rule is the
Law, under which Christ himselfe was for
our sakes made. So that the rule to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
this effect of Faith by, should bee
the whole compasse of Gods Law, which
to enter into, were to redouble all this la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
past, for thy Law (saith <hi>David)</hi> is
exceeding wide. Briefly therefore in all
our <hi>obedience</hi> observe these few rules. First,
The <hi>obligatory power</hi> which is in the Law
depends upon the one, and sole <hi>authority</hi>
of the <hi>Law-giver</hi> who is God. He that
breakes but one Commandement venturs
to violate that authority which by the
same Ordination made one equally obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
with the rest. And therefore our
obedience must not bee <hi>partiall,</hi> but <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall</hi>
unto the whole Law, in as much
as it proceeds from that Faith which
without indulgence, or dispensation yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
assent unto the whole compasse of
Divine Truth. Secondly, as is God, so
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:12557:135"/>
is his Law, a <hi>spirituall,</hi> and a <hi>perfect Law,</hi>
and therefore requires a <hi>universality of the
subject,</hi> as well as of the <hi>obedience.</hi> I meane
(besides that perfect integrity of Nature,
which in regard of present inherence is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> and supplied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the imputed righteousnesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
of Christ) an inward, spirituall,
sincere obedience of the heart, from thence
spreading like lines from a Centre un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the whole Circumference of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
unto our Words, Actions, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
unto all our parts, without croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
mercenary, and reserv'd respects, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
men often in stead of the Lord, make
their ends, or their feares their God.
Lastly, remember that in every Law all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogeneall
matters to the maine duty
which is commanded, every sprigge, or
seed, or originall, or degree thereof is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
as all the severall branches of a
Tree are fastned to one and the same stocke.
And by these rules are wee to examine
the truth of our obedience. But heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I draw downe these premises to an
Assumption, I will but name one caution
which is this, That Faith as it may bee
either <hi>habituall</hi> or <hi>Actuall,</hi> so it is the
cause of these holy actions either habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by framing and disposing the heart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, or actually, when it is it selfe,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:12557:136"/>
as it ought ever to bee sound, and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
But sometimes Faith (so great is
the corruption of our nature) admits of a
decay, and languor, wherein it lies as it
were like fire under ashes raked up, and
stifled under our corruptions. Againe in
some there is a weaker, in some a stronger
Faith, according unto which difference,
there must be a difference in the measure,
and magnitude of the effects. But yet it
is infallibly true that all, or most of those
holy fruits doe in some seasons or other
bud forth of that stocke which is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by Faith, though sometimes in some
men lesse discernable by reason of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
interposed. For it usually thus
falleth out, that our graces are but like
the Army of <hi>Gedeon,</hi> a small handfull where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our corruptions are like the <hi>Midianits</hi>
which lay on the ground as Grashoppers
innumerable. But yet in these God crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
his owne meanest gists with victory,
and successe.</p>
               <p>So then these things being thus proposed
let the conscience without connivence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
it selfe by such interrogatories as
these. Doe I finde my selfe live by the
Faith of the Sonne of GOD who gave
himselfe for me? Doe I delight in his
Word more then my appoynted food, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
adulterating it with the Leaven or
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:12557:136"/>
Dreggs of hereticall fancies or dead workes?
Doth the word of Truth transforme me
to the Image of it selfe, Crucifying all
those corruptions which harboured in
me? Doe I finde my selfe to grow in all
graces universally, and uniformely towards
God and man, not thinking to recompence
some defects which my nature drives me
unto, with supererogation (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
and over performance of such du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as are not so visibly repugnant to my
personall corruptions? Doe the beames of
the Sunne of righteousnesse shining on
my soule illighten me with his truth, and
with his power sway me unto all good?
Am I heartily affected with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Gods Church, to mourne, or
to rejoyce with it even at such times,
when mine owne particular estate would
frame me unto affections of a contrary
temper? Have I free use of all my spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall
senses, to see the light of God,
to heare his Word, to taste his mercies,
to feele with much tendernes all the wounds
and pressures of sinne? Doe I love all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
truth, not so much because propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
unto my desires, but because
conformable unto God? Am I resolv'd
in all estates to relie on <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, and
providence, though He should kill me to
trust in him? Doe I wholy renounce all
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:12557:137"/>
trust in mine owne worthines, or in any
concurrences of mine owne naturally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God? Doe I not build eyther my
hopes or feares upon the faces of men,
nor make eyther them or my selfe the
<hi>rule</hi> or <hi>end</hi> of my desires? finally, doe I
endeavour a universall obedience unto Gods
Law in all the whole latitude, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of it, not indulging to my selfe li<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>berty
in any knowne sinne? Is not my
obedience mercenary, and hypocriticall, but
spirituall, and sincere? Do I not swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
gnats, nor stumble at straws, not
dispense with my selfe for the least of
sinns, for irregular thoughts, for occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of offence, for appearances of evill,
for the motions of concupiscence for idle
words, and vaine conversation, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover
is in the lowest degree forbidden?
And though in any, or all these I may be
sometimes overtaken (as who is it that
can say I have washed my hands in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
I am cleane from my sinnes?)
Doe I yet relent for it, strive, and resolue
against it? in a word, doth not mine
owne heart condemne me of selfe-deceite,
of hypocrisie, of halting and dissembling
in Gods service. Then may I safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that I have partaked of the saving
efficacy of Faith, and am fitly qualified
to partake of these holy mysteries,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:12557:137"/>
whereby this good worke of Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
in me, may bee strengthned, and
more perfected against the day of the Lord
Jesus.</p>
               <p>In the receiving of which we must use
all both inward, and outward reverence,
secret elevations of spirit, and comfortable
thoughts touching the mercies of God in
Christ, touching the qualities, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of his passion, and of our sinnes
that caused it: and Lastly, for the course
of our life after wee must pitch upon a
constant resolution to abandon all sinne,
and to keepe a strict hand over all our
wayes;<note n="a" place="margin">Desertor de charactere dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur de quo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans honoratu: Augustin. Brisson. de Reg. Perfis lib. 2.</note> least turning againe with the
Swine to the mire that which should bee
the badge of our honor, prove the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of our shame. The <hi>Persians</hi> had a
festivall time one day in the yeere which
they cald <hi>Vitiorum interitum,</hi> wherein they
slew all Serpents, and venemous, creatures, and
after that till the revolution of that same
day suffred them to swarme againe as fast
as ever: If we thinke in that manner to
destroy our sins, and onely one day in
the yeere, when we celebrate this holy
Festivall, the evill spirit may hapily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
for a day in policie, but surely he will
turne againe, with seven other spirits, &amp; make
the end of that man worse then his beginning.
But that ground which drinketh in the

raine which commeth of upon it (and what
raine comparable to a showre of Christs
bloud in the Sacrament?) and bringeth

dressed it, receiveth blessings from God;
