            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Pet. 1.15.16.</note> he which hath called you is holy, so ye may be holy in all maner of conuersation, because it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Bee ye holy for I am holy. Yee are fellow Citizens <note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 2.19.</note> with the Saints, let your conuersation (as the Apostle <note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 3.20</note> saith) bee in heauen, that is, an holy conuersation, which is in truth an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly conuersation, as first descending from God, and from heauen, and then most vndoubtedly making you to ascend to God, and vnto heauen.</p>
            <p>Sanctitie and holinesse is the very end of our election, for God <note n="t" place="margin">Eph 1.4.</note> hath chosen vs, that wee should bee holy and without blame before him. It is the end of our redemption, for Christ hath redeemed vs, that <note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 1.74.</note> we being deliuered from our enemies should serue him in holinesse and righteousnesse all the daies
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:9502:5"/>
of our liues. It is the end of our vocation that <note place="margin">1. Thes 4.4.7.</note> euery one should possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour, for God hath called vs not vnto vncleannesse, but vnto holinesse.</p>
            <p>Without this, had ye all the blessings that mortality doth possesse, or mans heart can desire, yet neuer can they bring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true happinesse, or sound comfort vnto the mind. Riches are accounted a great blessing of God, and indeed they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen a crowne of glory, when they are found in the way of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, but without sanctity all the wealth in the world is woorse than pouerty.

            <p>I will heere omit what before out of the Scripture is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that Gods grace in our conuersion is not onely an exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, but a viuificant grace, whereby we are not wakened, but reuiued and quickned, as the Apostle saith, from the death of sinne; as also that it is not onely an alluring or perswading, but an attracting, and drawing grace, as both Christ himselfe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth <note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 6.44.</note>, None can come to me except the father draw him, and his Church acknowledgeth <note n="h" place="margin">Cant. 1.3.</note>, <hi>Draw me,</hi> and we will run after thee.

               <hi>Sed nos eam gratiam nolumus,</hi> saith S. Austen, but this is not that grace which the Scripture, &amp; which we do teach, for it is not enough that the promises be proposed, vnlesse they be beleeued, nor that wisedome be reuealed, vnlesse it be loued, <hi>nec suadetur so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum omne quod bonum est, verùm &amp; persuadetur,</hi> neither doth Gods grace in our conuersion onely counsell and perswade vs vnto good, but it makes a man effectually to yeeld vnto Gods motions and perswasions: and in the 24. chap. speaking of this very worke of God, which is as he there saith, inward and hidden, he addes, <hi>mirabili ac ineffabili potestate operatur Deus in cordibus hominum, non solùm veras reuelationes, sed etiam bonas voluntates,</hi> that God by a wonderfull and ineffable power, (which must needs be more then any perswasion) doth worke in mens mindes not onely true Reuelations (which is wrought vpon the reason) but good affections and desires, which is wrought immediately vpon the will. The very same doth he againe teach in his 107. epist. where purposely he refutes <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> for saying, that to consent to Gods calling or his Gospell was not any speciall gift of God, but an act flowing from the freedome of our will, when our vnderstanding is enlightned by the doctrine of God.

Apoc 3.20.</note> are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly termed the vocation and calling, or the knocking of God at our hearts) he truely saith, that to consent or dissent is an act indeed of our will, but this that we doe consent is the gift and worke of God in our hearts, which worke he elsewhere more especially declares, to consist not onely in setting those obiects before our minde or will, but <hi>praebendo</hi>

he saith, not from the freedome of our will, but from the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God which is giuen vnto vs. And afterwards <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 34</note> hee moues (as he well termes it) a profound, but a verie notable question to this purpose, how it comes to passe that when God vseth the same or the like perswasions and suggestions to two me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>vni ita suadeatur vt persuadeatur,</hi> the one is effectually perswaded, &amp; not the other: did mans conuersion depend on mans owne will? he might most easily haue answered this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, because the one by the freedome of his will assented vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods motions, and the other by the like freedome of his will dissented there from, or else because to the one, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions and suggestions were congruous and fitting, and not vnto the other. But S. Austen knowing right well, that it might iustly &amp; no doubt would againe be replied, what should worke the congruitie of the ones will vnto Gods perswasions, and not of the other? which he saw could be referred to no other cause but onely to the grace of God giuen to the one, and not giuen to the other, therefore he tels vs, that hee can giue no other answer to that question, but that of the Apostle, <note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 11 33.</note> 
               <hi>O altitudo,</hi> O the depth of Gods iudgements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who of his mercy giues his grace, and thereby makes the one willing to turne to God, and so hee is effectually perswaded, and in his iustice withholdes that grace from the other, and so he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains stil vnwilling &amp; vnperswaded. In which answer, as being most sufficient, S. Austen so fully rests himselfe, that he addes this conclusion, If any desire a better answer, <hi>quaerat doctiores,</hi> let him seeke to those that are more learned, but take heed he finde not those that are more presumptuous.</p>
            <p>Thus we see that there is a further working of Gods grace on our wils, besides that illumination &amp; perswasion which is wrought on our vnderstanding: for though it be most true which both Philosophers and the Schoolemen teach, that the will doth euer follow the last iudgement and conclusion of our practike reason, yet because (which is most specially to be obserued in this point) euen this last iudgement of our reason is subiect to the power &amp; arbitrement of our will, that so ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing had a most pregnant and fit reason and conclusion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed

            <p>Wherefore to end this argument, wherein by reason partlie of the obscuritie, and partly of the varietie of the matter, I haue stood longer then I first intended, I conclude this whole point with that short sentence of S.

And this be spoken of the author of our sanctification, which is God, of whom the Apostle heere desires this sanctity when he praied, <hi>God sanctifie you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>God of peace.</hi>] The title which the Apostle giues to God is not lightly to be ouerpassed, in that he heere calles him <hi>the very God of peace.</hi> And though many reasons might be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged why God is so called, yet for our present purpose I will propose but one, which is to put vs all in minde of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian charitie, peace and concord which ought to be among all Gods children, seeing this God, who is God and father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs all, is the God of vnitie and loue; and as the Apostle heere describeth him, The very God of peace.</p>
            <p>And truely whether it be to teach vs the necessitie of this lesson, or to signifie our dulnesse and frowardnesse in learning and practising thereof, or for some other reason, I cannot tell, but I verily suppose that neither any one doctrine is more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vrged in the whole Scripture, then is this doctrine of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, nor any one sinne more often and more earnestly reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued therein, then is the want of charitie.

            <p>Now as charitie is most acceptable, and like the ointment of Aaron <note place="margin">Psal. 133 2.</note> pleasing vnto God, so doe the Scriptures in infinite places witnesse how much God hateth and detesteth the want
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:9502:13"/>
of charity; yet out of that maine Ocean I will but take one drop or two. In the 1. <note n="d" place="margin">v. 3.4.5.</note> of <hi>Amos</hi> God threatneth to breake the bars of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascus,</hi> and send a fire into the house of <hi>Hazael,</hi> and deuour the palaces of <hi>Benhadad</hi>; and why? because they were not satisfied with the ouerthrow of the Gileadites their enemies, but further without all compassion to wreake their wrath vpon them, they threshed <hi>Gilead</hi> and that with threshing instruments of iron. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the second chap. <note n="e" place="margin">v. 1.2.</note> God threatens to destroy the Moabites, and that they shall die with shouting, &amp; with the sound of a trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, because they were not contented onely to spoile the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, though they were not theirs onely, but Gods enemies, but to satisfie their rage and malice, they burnt the bones of the king of Edom into lime. This is that which God so earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooues in the Edomites, in the prophesie of <hi>Obadiah</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">v. 10. ad 16.</note>, &amp; threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens for this cause to cut them off for euer. Thou shouldest not haue beholden the day of thy brother when he was made a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thou shouldest not haue reioiced in the day of their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor haue spoken proudly in the day of affliction, neither shouldst thou haue looked on their affliction in the day of their destruction; but as thou hast done, it shall be done to thee, thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward shall be vpon thine owne head.</p>
            <p>I might adde heereto a further iudgement of God, mentioned in the Apostle, <note n="g" place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.15.</note> Whosoeuer hateth his brother is a manslayer, &amp; yee know that no manslayer hath eternall life abiding in him. But hauing spoken thus much concerning that brotherly charitie and peace which wee ought to haue one towards another, I would gladly adde somewhat of that peace, which we all iointly owe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>Of this peace the prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith <note n="h" place="margin">Ps. 122.6.7.</note>, O pray for the peace of Ierusalem, they shall prosper that loue thee, Peace be within thy wals. Of this the Apostle saith <note n="i" place="margin">Rom. 16.17.18.</note>, I beseech you marke them dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently which cause diuision and offences contrary to the doctrine which yee haue receiued, and auoid them, for they that are such serue not the Lord Iesus, for <note n="k" place="margin">1.

In the one you suffer martyrdome but for one soule, in the other you suffer for the whole Church of God. Thus said <hi>Dionysius.</hi> Of this <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> was so studious and zealous, that when the Church at <hi>Constantinople</hi> began to be diuided, as he supposed by occasion that he possessed that sea, he openly said, and his speech was much more commendable then his fact, <hi>Si propter me ista tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestas,</hi> If this stirre and tempest be for my sake, take me, &amp; cast me into the sea, that the storme may cease, and the Church may enioy her calme, as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> reports in his 2. booke &amp; 9. chap. To this S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> at large perswaded in his booke <hi>de vnitate ecclesia:</hi> Let no man thinke, saith he, that the good will depart from the Church; <hi>Triticum non rapit ventus, sed paleas:</hi> It is not wheate but chaste which the winde blowes away. Those can neuer abide in God, that will not abide in the vnitie of the Church of God. Though such giue their bodies to be burned, or to be deuoured of wilde beasts, <hi>Non est illa corona fides, sed poena persidiae,</hi> That is no crowne of their saith, but a punishment for their perfidiousnesse: <hi>Occidi talis potest, coronari non potest</hi>: A man may happily be killed, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer crowned in a schisme. Of this <hi>Martianus,</hi> though no good bishop, most passionately said, when <hi>Sabbatius</hi> whom he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ordained <hi>Presbyter,</hi> began to make a tumult and diuision in the Church, <hi>Multa satius <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

For preseruing this peace <hi>Polycarp</hi> and other ancient bishops were so carefull, that though they di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Polycarp</hi> and <hi>Victor,</hi> They iudged it friuolous and childish, and indeed not without cause, to disagree and make a separation for customes &amp; ceremonies, when they did agree in the substance &amp; chiefe points of Religion.

            <p>There were some euen in the Apostles time, as S.

To which heresie when some in S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens own time inclined, he purposely writ against them his book <hi>De side &amp; operibus</hi>; the summe and effect wherof, is the very same which S.

               </gap>, without breath (for so the word doth there rather signifie then the soule, seeing good works doe not animate or giue life to faith, but as an effect doth follow it, as S. Austen <note place="margin">

               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:9502:18"/>It is a memorable story which <hi>Ruffinus</hi> sets downe in his 2. booke and 6. chap. of one Moses an holy man in the primitiue church, who being to be ordained a Bishop, refused to haue Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us a wicked persecutor to lay his hands, or giue consecration vnto him: At which Lucius disdaining, and supposing hee had taken some exception to his faith, If you be ignorant, said he, or misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of my faith, I will recite and relate my beliefe vnto you. You need not, said Moses, recite your faith vnto me, I know it wel enough, so many seruants of God that you haue condemned to the mines and minerals, so many bishops, presbyters, &amp; deacons, that you haue banished, so many Christians that you haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, some to the fire, and others to the fury of wilde beasts, these doe report and make knowne your faith vnto me. <hi>Nunquid verior potest esse fides quae auribus capitur, quàm quae oculis peruidetur?</hi> I wil rather beleeue mine owne eies, and your actions concerning your faith, then your bare words and profession. To which purpose S. Austen saith in his 3. tract vpon the epistle of S. Iohn, <hi>Non atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damus ad linguam, sed ad facta:</hi> Let vs not looke to a mans words, but to his works; he that in works denies Christ, he is an antichrist: <hi>Opera loquuntur, &amp; verba requirimus?</hi> His works doe speake what he is, we need not seeke to his words.</p>

            <p>Wherefore let me put you in minde of the Apostles <note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 2.12.</note> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Take heed lest at any time there bee found in any of you an euill heart and vnfaithfull to depart away from the liuing God: Remember the Apostles <note n="i" place="margin">Gal. 3.1.</note> reproofe, O foolish Galathians, are yee so foolish that when yee haue begun in the spirit, yee will end in the flesh? Better it had beene, as S. Peter saith <note n="k" place="margin">2.
