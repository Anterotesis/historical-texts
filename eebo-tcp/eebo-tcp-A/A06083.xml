            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This manner of reformation is made after two ſorts: either by lawes limiting the times certaine for this reformation; or accidentally thereunto led and provoked by occaſions: for ſo the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> after the overthrowe given by the power of the <hi>Gaules</hi> did reforme their common-weale and all diſcorders for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by them committed. The <hi>Athenians</hi> alſo after the <hi>Megari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> had recovered from them the Ile of <hi>Salamina,</hi> and the haven of <hi>Nicoea,</hi> reformed that common-weale.

                  <p>Firſt we are to remove all occaſions, which may move the people or beholders, to pittie or favour offendours. For when <hi>Manlius Capitolinus</hi> was ſometimes accuſed as a mover of ſedition in <hi>Rome,</hi> his caſe was no ſooner pleaded, but the ſight of the Capitoll troubled his accuſers, and the Iudges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; when as pointing with his hand, he ſhewed the place vnto the Gods, and weeping tenderly, laide before them the remembrance of the hazarde of his life, in fighting for the common liberty and ſafetie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in defending the Capitoll it ſelfe, and repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Gaules; in ſuch ſort, as the Iudges moved with pittie, knew not what to doe, and therefore put over the hearing of his cauſe vnto another day, becauſe the place of his ſo notable good ſervice was ever ſtill before their eies: wherfore wiſely <hi>Camillus</hi> finding the cauſe of delay of Iuſtice, did make the place of Iudgement to be removed without the Citie into a place called the wood <hi>Petelian,</hi> from whence they coulde not ſee the Capitoll, where his accuſers gave apparant evidence againſt him, and the Iudges conſidering all his wicked practiſes, conceived a iuſt cauſe to puniſh him as he had deſerved, ſo as they gave ſentence of death againſt him. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no orator, or pleader of cauſes, is to be ſuffered to ſpeake in the behalfe of offendors, either to move the Iudges to compaſſion, or to winne the offendors favour in the eie of the beholders. The miſchiefe which ariſeth hereby, did ſometimes appeare, when as <hi>Caeſar</hi> was ſuffered to ſpeake in the behalfe of <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Cothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> companions of <hi>Catiline</hi> in his conſpiracie, by whoſe eloquence the offendors had then beene delivered, or at the leaſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the handes of the officers to be put to death, if the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie and authority of <hi>Cato,</hi> and vehemency of <hi>Catulus,</hi> had not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1277:14"/>
the contrary. Laſtly, the more often princes ſhal acquaint their ſubiectes with the diſcipline of the lawe, the more great obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhall the ſubiects yeelde, as well vnto lawes, as magiſtrates, and the leſſe difficultie and danger ſhall princes finde therin. For the right diſcipline of lawes, doeth admoniſhe men of their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and doeth cauſe them to leade their lives agreeable to lawe, and from time to time doth ſuppreſſe the malice of the offendors. For proofe whereof, the <hi>Romaines</hi> ſo long as they vſed the iuſt and exact diſcipline of laws, they puniſhed the offendors without feare danger, ſedition, or mutiny; yea farther, when as they condemned <hi>Camillus</hi> vniuſtly, there was found no friend, no ſouldier, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whereof were many and great, that durſt make any reſiſtance in his behalfe: for when as hee called vnto him his friendes and ſouldiers, which had ſerved vnder him in the warres, or that had taken charge with him, which were manie in number, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſought them, that they would not ſuffer him thus vilely to be condemned, through falſe and vniuſt accuſations laide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and to bee ſo ſcorned and defamed by his enemies: his friends having laide their heads togither, and conſulted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, made him anſwere, how that for his iudgement they could not remedy it, but if he were condemned, they would al ioine togither with a very good will for the payment of his fine. But not long after, <hi>Cum toto decennio nullum Romae ſtatuebatur exemplum paenae delinquentium,</hi> then could not the Senate examine <hi>Ceſar</hi> with their ſafetie, neither yet coulde the Iudges condemne <hi>Claudius</hi> without peril. </p>

                  <p>Therefore in ſuch common-weales, where the manners of the people are altogether corrupted, for not apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good time the diſcipline of lawes, it behoveth the Iudges, and ſuch as ſhall revive the force of auncient lawes by the exact diſcipline thereof, ſtrongly to be garded, according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Cicero</hi> being accompanied with a ſtrong garde of Iuſtie men, when as Conſull he was to convict and execute <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegus,</hi> for their conſpiracies with <hi>Catiline.</hi> But <hi>Caeſar</hi> vnadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſing a garde in ſuch caſes for the ſafetie of his perſon, did eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones with the loſſe of his life approve his follie: for <hi>Brutus,</hi> and others, finding him asked in the Senate, without any ſtrength, or

After this maner did <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> proceede againſt <hi>Lentulus,</hi> and <hi>Cethegus,</hi> when as vpon proofe onely, in open Senate, without any lawful inditement or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he commanded their delivery into the handes of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to be put to death; for ſo much may be gathered out of <hi>Caeſar</hi> his Oration, who at that inſtant mightily inveyed againſt that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding, ſaying, it was not lawfull, neither that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of <hi>Rome</hi> did beare it, to put men of ſuch nobility to death, without lawful inditement or condemnation, but in caſes of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.

they had elected their <hi>Decemviri,</hi> for the making of a thorough and abſolute reformation of the common-weale of <hi>Rome,</hi> they forthwith gave into their handes the ſole and abſolute power of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſo as all other authorities and iuriſdictions either of Conſull, Senate, or Tribunes, ceaſing, they wholy and only governed <hi>Rome,</hi> without any provocation or appeale to bee made to any other.

The ordinary vvaies and meanes, are in number three: Firſt you ſhall vviſely obſerve the affections of ſuch perſons, as you intende to perſwade; ſecondarilie, you ſhall vviſelie acquit, and deliver, as vvell the matter, as the perſon of him that perſwadeth, from all ſuſpition of fraude and guile; laſtly you ſhall dravv the people vnto a particular conſideration of the matter you intende to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade. We muſt diligently obſerve their affections; for ſo <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias Leſbian</hi> vvriteth, that the mighty and daungerous faction ſometimes entertained betwixt the rich and the poorer ſort of the citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> vvas by you <hi>Solon</hi> eaſelie pacified, in that you dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved the affections of either, and did ſecretly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the poore to devide the landes, vvherewith they remained
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1277:23"/>
highly pleaſed, to the rich you promiſed the confirmation of their contracts, which was the matter they chiefely deſired. Alſo you did not let to feede their humours and affections with the dailie publiſhing of this ſentence, equality doth breede no ſtrife; the which did pleaſe as well the rich and wealthie, as the poore and needy ſorte; for the one conceived of this worde equality, that you woulde meaſure all thinges according to the quality of the men, and the other tooke, for their purpoſe, that you would mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure things by the number, and by the poule onely; thus both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſed with you, for that you well obſerved their humours and affections, they gave into your handes ſoveraine authoritie for the ending of all quarrels, whereby that mighty faction was happely appeaſed, to the generall good of <hi>Athens.</hi> You alſo well obſerved the affections of the people, when as you clothed things bitter and vnpleaſant, with pleaſing names; calling taxes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions; garriſons, gardes; priſons, houſes; and ſuch like: by the which pollicie, you made even things odious, pleaſing and acceptable to the people, and eaſily thereby perſwaded the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing thereof. In like manner <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> indevouring like a wiſe generall to augment his ſtrengthes by the aide of the <hi>Ioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> in his warres againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> did wiſely obſerve the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as well of the <hi>Ionians,</hi> as of the <hi>Perſians</hi> then his enemies: for paſſing by ſome places, where he knewe the enemie muſt of neceſſity fall vppon that coaſt for harborough, hee did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave certaine wordes ſpoken vnto the <hi>Ionians,</hi> in great letters in ſtone, which he founde there by chaunce, or otherwiſe brought thither for that purpoſe; theſe were the wordes, that the <hi>Ionians</hi> ſhould take the <hi>Graecians</hi> part, being their firſt founders and aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetours, and ſuch as ſought for their liberty; or at the leaſt they ſhoulde trouble the army of the Barbarous people, and doe them all the miſchiefe they coulde, when the <hi>Graecians</hi> ſhoulde come to fight with them: by theſe wordes thus in graven, and diſperſed in fitte places, where the enemy was likely to harborough, he hoped either to induce the <hi>Ionians</hi> to take their part, or at the leaſt, that therby he ſhould make the Barbarous people, ielous and miſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of them.</p>

the citie of <hi>Rome</hi>) to be inhabited by ſtraungers in time to come, or els to be a common paſture for vvilde beaſts to feede on? By vvhich manner of perſwaſion he eftſoones appeaſed the mutinye, and quenched their ardent deſire for the inhabitinge of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ies.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, did <hi>Pacuvius</hi> proceede in pacifiyng and ſubduing the peoples affections from killing their Senatours; which matter by them was fully determined, vntill ſuch time, as he conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the people and Senatours, as for the hearing and determining of ſome publike and waighty cauſe, did proceede with them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner: now my friends and Citizens (ſaith he) that which you have even with an ardent deſire and affection long wiſhed, namelie the puniſhment and correction of this deteſtable and wicked Senate, the ſame hath fortune now given into your powre and handes, freely to diſpoſe of them at your pleaſure, being nowe altogether naked, and cloſed in on everie ſide with walles, where, without tumult of the Citie, and perill of your perſons, you may freely diſpoſe of them; but leaſt you ſhoulde preferre the deſire of private revenge, before the common ſafety of al here gathered together, it behooveth before you give ſentence of theſe Senatours, whom you doe mortallie hate, that you proceede firſt to the choice of others; for of force you muſt either have Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, which alwaies have bene the moſt wiſe and fit councellors of free eſtates; or otherwiſe you muſt of neceſſitie fall into the hands of a Lorde or King, which free eſtates haue ever hated; proceede therefore to the election of new, and make choice of better men, which may ſupply their places: this matter appearing vnto the people doubtfull, did hold them long in ſilence, but at the laſt one among the reſt beeing nominated, their clamour and noyſe farre exceeded their former ſilence, ſome affirming they knewe him not, ſome accuſing his perſon, others deſpiſing his baſe art and ſcience; and much more in the choice of the ſecond, and third, this diſſenſion was increaſed, they being more baſe and obſcure, then the firſt: then beholdinge the grounde, vvith ſhame faſtnes they confeſſed their former errour, ſayinge, they did chuſe rather to tollerate an old evill, then a new, which might farre exceede the olde. In like manner the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1277:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at large, founde that they ſuſtained in all warres the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt force of the enemie, they found themſelves alſo to be called to all labours and workes, whereby the common-wealth was to be preſerved or augmented, and ſo forthwith they iudged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues as worthy of the office and dignity of the Tribuneſhip, and Conſulſhip, as any Patrician whatſoever: and therevppon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the Tribunes ſhould be equally elected, as wel of the one as of the other ſorte; the which beeing vnto them graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and deſcending to make election, could finde none in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar worthy of that honour, or at the leaſt ſo worthy as the Patrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and nobles were; then forthwith they did acknowledge their former errour, and made choice of the Patricians only. After this manner, the people generallie conſulting of the delaies and cunctation, which <hi>Fabius</hi> vſed in repelling the forces of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> forthwith they condemned him to be a cowarde and faint harted; but afterward they waighing that their councell by the ſeverall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and overthrowes they received by the raſh and over-haſty proceeding of <hi>

In like ſort the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> after ſuch time as <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> had fully executed the conſpiracie then intended againſt the perſon of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> generally conſulting of that action, remained for a time, as indifferent beholders thereof, neither accuſing, neither yet making allowance thereof; but no ſooner did <hi>Caeſar</hi> his friendes ſhevv forth his teſtament, his ſeverall legacies vnto the people, his manie and cruell woundes, and thoſe every where freſhly bleeding and increaſing like a running ſtreame, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as poſſeſſed with ſome furie or frencie, every vvhere in the market place, every where in the corners of the ſtreete, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat houſes, in the fieldes, and in the vvoodes alſo, cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred all ſuch, as vvere partakers vvith <hi>Brutus</hi> in that action. After this manner, the auncient Tirantes of <hi>Athens,</hi> contending ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to perſwade the people to labour, and eſpecially to til and ploughe the grounde, thereby to render them more obedient vnto their governement, did give out a certaine fable; they

tell of the Goddeſſe <hi>Pallas,</hi> that ſhee contending vvith <hi>Neptune</hi> about the patronage of the countrie of <hi>Athens,</hi> brought foorth and ſhewed to the Iudges the Olive tree, by meanes whereof ſhe obtained the preheminence: by vvhich particular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, the people vvere mightily induced to labour and till the land. After this manner the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> generallie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting of the diviſion of landes gained by conqueſt, did fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mutinies and ſeditions againſt the Senators; then vviſely the Senators deducted forthwith certaine colonies out of the confines of <hi>Italie,</hi> vvhereby eftſoones the multitude vvere given to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande, of the particular charge, travell, and other ſundry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, that did ariſe by poſſeſsing of lands gained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, vvherewith all mutinies vvere appeaſed.

forſaken the Citie, pointing them the vvaie vnto the ſea; and againe, he vvonne them with a propheſie, which commaunded them to ſave themſelves in walles of woode, ſaying, that the walles of woode, did ſignifie nothing elſe but ſhips; and for this cauſe <hi>Apollo</hi> in his Oracle, called <hi>Salamina</hi> divine, not miſerable and vnfortunate, becauſe it ſhoulde give the name of a moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie victorie, vvhich the <hi>Graecians</hi> ſhoulde gette there; by vvhich extraordinarie perſwaſions, hee did induce them at the laſt to leave the Citie of <hi>Athens,</hi> and to betake themſelves to the ſea: by occaſion vvhereof, they did not onely deliver themſelves from the handes of their enemies, but became at the laſt conquerours, and victours over them. In like manner, when all ordinarie meanes of perſwading failed to effect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation ſometimes intended by <hi>Numa,</hi> he made his recourſe to theſe extraordinarie helpes and meanes, laying before the peoples eies a terrour and feare of their Gods, bearing them in hande, that they had ſeene ſtraunge viſions, or that he had heard voices, by vvhich their Gods did threaten them with ſome great troubles and plagues: whereby hee did pull downe and humble their hearts (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witneſſeth) and made thereby a thorough chaunge and reformation, aſwell of the common-weale, as of the manners of the people. Therefore <hi>Plutarch</hi> not without iudgment affirmeth, that the multitude in matters vvaightie, and difficult, reſt ſatiſfied and perſwaded, rather by extraordinarie, then by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meanes: all which he doeth lively manifeſt, vvhereas he induceth the multitude exclaiming vppon <hi>Themiſtocles,</hi> for not ſacrificing the three young priſoners, in ſo much as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their rage and clamour, did ſacrifice at the laſt the three pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; wherewith the people remained fully perſwaded, that the victorie ſhoulde be given vnto them over their enemies.

hundreth and fiftie <hi>Myriades</hi> made at the common charge of the citizens, by the which councell he quenched not onely a preſent great feare, but did in happy time ſcatter and diſperſe abroade the beſt part of <hi>Caeſars</hi> force and power, at ſuch time as hee was made Praetor, and that for reſpect of his office he vvas moſt to be feared.

ſometimes in the handes of fewe, and ſometimes into the handes of all in generall.

                  <p>The inſtitution no doubt of the Monarchie, is the moſt firme and durable, and freeſt from al diſſention, mutinies, and ſedition. And the wiſe men of <hi>Rome</hi> vvere not deceived, when beholding the market place filled with bowes, ſlings, and ſwordes, and the pulpit for orations ſprinckled with bloud, they ſaid, there remaineth nowe no other way to give helpe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie to theſe troubles of our common-weale, but the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one man onely, that may commaunde vs all. And as this eſtate is freeſt from trouble, as you have ſaide, ſo is it of all others moſt honourable and glorious, and even the very lively image of God and nature, as <hi>Artibanus</hi> did ſometimes faithfully deliver vnto <hi>Themiſtocles.</hi> The next manner of inſtitution in account, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be the <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> for that it acquiteth it ſelfe beſt of al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther common-weals, from corruption &amp; errours in their cenſures and iudgements: for as the large and running waters, are not ſo eaſily corrupted, as the ſtanding poole; ſo many wittes, and mindes, are not ſo eaſily deluded and corrupted, as one. But worſt of all others doeth this common-weale acquite it ſelfe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie, diſſention, and emulation amongeſt themſelves, which like vnto a mothe or worme, gnaweth a ſunder the heart and intralles of that common-weale, and at the laſt confoundeth and deſtroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the ſame. But yet the popular eſtate is of all others leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, eſpecially where the common-weale is mere popular, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in regard of the ſoveraintie and commaundement, as of the forme &amp; manner of governement; wherof the common-weale of <hi>Athens</hi> maie be vnto vs an example, which was inſtituted by you <hi>Solon,</hi> and after in the ſame age confounded by <hi>Piſiſtratus: </hi>

So it was: for wanting ſufficient power and forces, I was forced to make ſuch lawes for the inſtituting of that common-weale, as they vvere willing to receive, and not ſuch as I was willing to give: for I muſt confeſſe, that popular inſtitution, which is equallie tempered, and compounded of the three ſortes and formes of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement, after the maner and inſtitution of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be more firme and durable; and this forme of governement alſo doeth give a perfection and continuance to all other eſtates before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred. Therefore <hi>Romulus</hi> after the death of <hi>Remus,</hi> and <hi>Tatius Sabinus,</hi> did ayme at that forme of government in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the common-weale of <hi>Rome</hi>; for he reſerved vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſole and kingly auctority over the armie onely, and to convent the Senators for the affaires publicke, the which forme of governement, in his perſon was kinglike, and after the forme of a Monarchie; but in the perſon of the Senators, who had auctoritie to conſulte, and publikely to perſwade and diſſwade the attempts for wars, and to diſcuſſe all other civill cauſes, as the ſtate of that common-weale required, the forme of an <hi>Ariſtocratia,</hi> was right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by him obſerved; and in the other partes of his governement, as in framing of his lawes and ſuch like, he rather affected a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar liberty, then a Monarchie. </p>

from a iuſt proportion eyther in obeyinge or governing the ſubiecte. This diſtemperature with all other thinges hathe his beeinge and ſubſiſtinge from his proper matter and forme: the matter alſo hath his beeing, eyther from a generall corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of maners in the people, as in the times wherein <hi>Galba,</hi> and <hi>Pertinax</hi> lived and raigned, who though moſt iuſt and vpright kings, were notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding ſlaine by their ſubiects; or els it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from a corruption in the heade onely, the which ſometimes raigned in <hi>Tarquine</hi>; for if the people had then beene corrupted in maners, they could not have beene founde ſo conſtant defendors of their liberties, and ſo deſirous of reformation.

                  <p>But heere we are to obſerve this caution, that if this forme hath not his proper matter vvhich is the corruption of manners in the people, vvherein it maie make a deepe impreſſion, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature that groweth thereby, ſhall eaſilie be recovered: and for this cauſe the forme vvhich <hi>Tarquine</hi> gave to his ambition, was eaſilie defaced by <hi>Brutus,</hi> and <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>alerius,</hi> for that the manners of the people vvere not then corrupted. In like manner <hi>Marcus Manlius,</hi> and <hi>Spurius Caſſius,</hi> had ſet downe vnto themſelves a forme of diſturbing the peace of the common-weale, and for the advauncing of their owne ambition, but finding the manners of the people then vncorrupted, the matter wanting into which, the forme which they before had framed, might be received, they both failed of their purpoſe. But otherwiſe it fareth vvith the common-vvealth, when this forme hath founde his proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and embraceth the ſame, namelie the corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the people; for in ſuch a caſe there is kindled foorthvvith
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1277:56"/>
ſo mighty a diſtemperature, as without great reſiſtaunce it maie not be quenched: and for this cauſe the forme of ambition vvhich ſometimes <hi>Sylla, Marius,</hi> and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> had framed vnto themſelves, meeting and concurring at once vvith the corruption of manners in the people as his proper matter, did aſſuredly advaunce their ambition, to the overthrow of that eſtate. Therefore moſt falſe is that poſition, vvhich affirmeth, that the people corrupted in manners, are more eaſily held in ſubiection, then a nation vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The ſeconde caution to be obſerved, is the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſundry formes of diſturbing common-weales, vvhich vſually doth advaunce her ambition not after one ſelfeſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but ſometimes vvith a ſhevv of profit, ſometimes vvith the ſhevv of magnanimitie, and at other times ſhee promiſeth an alteration and chaunge of thinges to the contentment of al. After this laſt manner ſhe preſented her ſelfe ſometimes vnto the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians,</hi> and therefore it is ſaide, that notwithſtanding the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Athens</hi> obſerved and obeyed the lawes, which you <hi>Solon</hi> made for their reformation, yet they were found ſo corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in manners, partly by reaſon of their ſeverall factions, and partly by idleneſſe, vvherewith the citie of <hi>Athens</hi> was well neare deſtroyed, as they deſired nothing ſo much as a change and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of thinges, every man hoping thereby to be better then his adverſaries. Secondarily by a ſhevv of magnanimitie, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome</hi> were ſometimes induced ſo farre to imbrace the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>arro</hi> for the reſiſting of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> as thereby they neare periſhed themſelves and the common-vveale. Finally, many are no leſſe bewitched with a gliſtering ſhew of profit and gaine, the which <hi>Pericles</hi> vvel vnderſtanding, did forthvvith devide the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies landes gayned by conqueſt, among the people, and did appointe them rewardes for all thinges, and did make large di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributions among them, whereby at the laſt he did withdravv their obedience from the counſell <hi>Areopagite,</hi> vnto his ſole rule and governement: in like manner <hi>Phillip</hi> of <hi>Macedonie</hi> corrupted certaine tirauntes of the Ile of <hi>Euboea,</hi> who with money in like ſort corrupted the people, vvhereby they became rebels and trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toures to their countrie; after the ſame manner he corrupted and
