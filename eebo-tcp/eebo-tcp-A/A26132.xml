         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Mount <hi>Zion.</hi> With a deſire of their return to him that hath confounded their

into thy hand, who art yet a ſtranger to our
proceedings, and ſhould queſtion why I walked

againſt their principles and practice, I
ſhall endeavour to ſatisfie thee with this brief
account: after the Lord began to work upon my ſoul, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
me in the hope of my redemption, then did I deſire to
walk with thoſe that I thought were neareſt unto the Lord, and
hearing of this people to cry out againſt all others that were not
of their perſwaſion, that they were all out of the way, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
hearing them ſpeak of high attainments in themſelves, that
they were come to the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the City of the living
God.</p>
            <p>Then did I think theſe were the fitteſt people to direct me
thither, wherefore I was reſolved to follow their directions and
examples, then they preached that we had a light within us, that
ſhewed us good and evil, and that I knew was in me: then they
ſaid if we would mind that, it would lead us out of all evil,
thus they ſet us to feed upon the Tree of knowledge, which indeed
was good, but not for food: but the ſubtile twining Serpent
called it the Tree of life: thus by harkning unto them was I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
and blinded to forſake my firſt love, which was already
<pb facs="tcp:55346:3"/>
eſpouſed unto me by promiſe, though I had not preſent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and I with many others have ignorantly followed a
ſtranger, and if the Lord called unto us at any time to ſhew us
where we were; and we began to harken and ſtand ſtill a little,
then did they tell us tha we were grown ſloathful, becauſe
we would not go along with them, then we complained that we
ſaw little difference between them and the world, except in
outward ſhow; for one would over-reach another, and others
were envious and backbiters, and many others things I might
name that ought not to be ſo much as thought of amongſt Saints,
then would they ſlight it over, ſaying, that we had let in preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
that made us look out at others, we must mind our own
condition, thus did they many times draw us in again, calling
good evil, and evil good, ſaying, it was the Enemy that would
lead us back into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when it was the Lord that in his
mercy followed us ſeeking our return, whom I now truſt will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
us.</p>
            <p>That we return no more unto folly, now the Lord at last ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
diſcovered unto me the wiles of this old Serpent, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
by his love in my heart to publiſh it for the good of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for when the ſnare is diſcovered it is the better avoided,
and though we cannot add any thing to our Maker, becauſe in
him all fulneſs dwels, yet it is his will that we ſhould improve
our talent for the benefit of our fellow ſervants, and in obedience
to my Lord that hath commanded us to ſerve one another, in
love have I written this deſiring the welf are of all the creation
of God, thy friend to ſerve thee in the love of God.</p>

God made the world, by Chriſt the word, and the bright
ſhining of his life was the light of men, this was by creation, and
this Chriſt is indeed the true light that enlightens every one that
comes into the world: and by this light man knew the will of his
Maker, but being diſobedient thereunto he fell into the wrath of
God, it being the juſt reward of his rebellion but the Lord being
full of compaſſion towards the work of his hands, ſendeth his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved

and redeem poor miſerable man again out of it, and herein is the
rich mercy, and admired loving kindneſs of the Lord, unto the
Sons and Daughters of men, but what will become of thoſe that
tread this mercy under foot, it was by faith in the promiſe of this
Redeemer, that all the Saints were ſaved under the diſpenſation
of the Law, for they beleived he that had promiſed was faithful,
therefore their beleif was the ground of their obedience, and not
their obedience the ground of their belief, and when the fulneſs
of time was come, that the promiſe came to be fulfilled, many
would not believe that he was the Saviour, for had they beleived
him, they would have received his doctrine, for thoſe that truly
beleive in the Lord Jeſus, will have good works ſpring up in them

been abundance of it, to ſprinkle ſo many conſciences, which doth
ſufficiently ſhew your ſenſual earthly ſpirits, that knows not the
miſtery of faith, by which the woman was healed that had the
bloody iſſue, touching the hem of his garment, and yet the ſpirit

light that ſheweth good and evil Salvation, which is but a glance
from him who came to be Salvation. For all that would beleive

out of curioſity meddle with an Inſtrument that will wound him,
he muſt apply then himſelf to the Phyſitian if he will be cured;

him, but augment his pain to think of his folly, that he would
not be ruled by him that knew the danger, neither will the light

certainly cured.</p>

it be not ſo with thee thou art not come to the beginning of the

every one according to their deeds, not their words, thoſe that

have prophyſied in his name, and caſt out Devils, yet they ſhall
not enter, many have been called, but they are not all choſen,
for by the ſubtilty of the Enemy transforming himſelf, they
have been deceived and this hath been by not keeping humble
and low, to follow the Lord, as he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

them under what diſpenſation he pleaſeth but they would
come before, elimbing in their heart, and this hath wearied
them, and cauſed them to ſlumber, and then did this painted
guide ſtep before them and now they are following him and
will not ſee their miſtake, for he blinds them with a ſeeming
righteouſneſs, becauſe they ſhould not look under his vizard,
and this puffs them up with pride, ſaying they are the people
and none beſides them, it will be hard for theſe to be renewed,
and brought down again to the acknowledgment of the truth.
Except they hearken to the voice of the Lord behind them,
which calleth them back again, ſaying this is the way walk in
it, now you that have not yet heard the voice calling you
out of the broad way, ſtand ſtill and hearken until thou hear
him call unto thy ſoul, and when thou haſt his mercy tendred
unto thee, proffering thee the Covenant of peace, and reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
beleive him, but run not before him, for he is faithful
that promiſeth, and mind the condition of the Covenaut, and
follow wim with thy eye fixt upon him, and if he will have thee
under a School maſter for a while be content and learn thy
leſſon, for as thou comeſt forward, thou groweſt nearer to the
Mark of the high calling, for he is the end of the law, therefore
let us preſs forward in faith and patience that we may come to
the end of our race with joy. O that we may never forget
to wait upon the fountain of wiſdome, for our Enemy, is
ſubtile but prayſes be to the Lord for ever that doth diſcover
his devices, and as he hath diſcovered the miſtery of iniquity,
ſo I truſt he will water us with the dew of Heaven, that we may
grow in ahe miſtery of Godlineſs, and this is my deſire who am
a lover of the ſouls of all people, though not of the Sectarian
contention.</p>
