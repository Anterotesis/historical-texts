         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <head type="sub">SAITH THE RESOLVER,</head>
               <p>§. 1. THE Church is a Body or society of men separated from the rest of the
World, and united to God and to themselves by a Divine Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> He saith this is the plainest description he can give:
That is not the fault of his Auditors or Readers. 1. As to the <hi>Genus,</hi> a
Community of equals without Rulers is a body: but I suppose he meaneth
not such. 2. Is it enough that it be of <hi>Men?</hi> sure now they should be
<hi>Christians?</hi> 3. Many are <hi>separated from the rest of the World, secundum quid,</hi>
that are no Christians; some in one respect and some in another, and none
in all respects. 4. <hi>Vnited to God,</hi> is an ambiguous word, no <hi>Creature</hi> is
<hi>Vnited</hi> to him perfectly so as to be thereby what he is, <hi>God,</hi> in the created
Nature. Only Christ is united to him Hypostatically in his created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
All are so far united to him in natural being, as that in him they
live and move and have their being: And the Nature of man is one sort of
his Image: All things are united to him as effects to their constant efficient.
The Church should not be defined without any mention of Christ: The
Churches Union with God is by Christ. 5. Christ himself as Head is an
essential part of the Church, and should not be left out of a Definition, thô
the meer Body may in common speech be called <hi>the Church,</hi> as the People
may be called <hi>a Kingdom.</hi> 6. Will any <hi>Divine Covenant</hi> serve? or must it
not be only the Baptismal Covenant? 7. Is it called <hi>Divine</hi> only as <hi>made
by God,</hi> or as <hi>commanded by God and made by Man,</hi> or as mutual? Certainly
Gods Law and offered or Conditional Promise is most frequently called <hi>His
Covenant</hi> in Scripture; and this uniteth not men to God, till they consent
and Covenant with him. Their own <hi>Covenant Act</hi> is necessary hereto: And
that is a <hi>Divine Covenant,</hi> only as commanded, and <hi>accepted</hi> and done by
Gods assisting Grace. 8. The form of a Church is Relative, and the <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus</hi>
is essential to a Relation. It is no definition that hath not the End
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:59353:3"/>
of the Association: Therefore this is none at all; and so the beginning tells
us what to expect.</p>
               <p>This description hath nothing in it but what may agree to divers forms
of Society, and so hath not the form of a Church: And if he intended not a
Definition, but a loose description, I would a defining Doctor had had the
Chair, during this controversie.</p>
               <p>Let us try this description upon a <hi>Mahometan</hi> Kingdom, Army, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
or suppose them meer Deists.</p>
               <p>1. Such a Kingdom, Army, or Navy may be a Society. 2. Of Men.
3. Separated from the rest of the World <hi>secundum quid &amp; ad hoc</hi> (and none
are separated from it <hi>simpliciter &amp; ad omnia:</hi> e. g. No man is separated from
the common humanity; No Deist from any but Atheists, and no Christian
in believing a God and the Law of Nature and Nations.) 4. They are
<hi>Vnited to God</hi> so far as <hi>owning a God</hi> and Worshipping him amounts to, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the Union of the Creature with the Creator in whom he liveth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
And no unregenerate ungodly Christian is united to him savingly. 5. They
are united among themselves. 6. This is by a Covenant: 7. And by a
Covenant Divine, as to <hi>command, approbation</hi> and <hi>object.</hi> It is God that they
Covenant to own and obey: The common Profession of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi>
is, <hi>There is one God, and</hi> Mahomet <hi>is his Prophet.</hi> It is Divine in <hi>tantum</hi> as
commanded. For God Commandeth all men to Own him; to believe that
<hi>Godis,</hi> and <hi>that he is the Rewarder of them that diligently seek him:</hi> And God so
far approveth it: St. <hi>James</hi> saith, <hi>(Thou dost well)</hi> to him that believeth
there is a God, much more that is professedly devoted to him.</p>
               <p>Let us by this examine the Jewish Church: <hi>Jews</hi> now may be 1. A Body,
2. Of Men, 3. Separated from the rest of the World, even in Religion
and Church pretensions. 4. United to God as Creatures, as Men, as the
corporal seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as professing Belief, Love and Obedience to
God, as their God. 5. Strictly united among themselves: 6. By a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
7. Which God once commanded, and still approveth so far as they
own God.</p>
               <p>Let us consider whether this description take not in, those in every Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that fear God and work Righteousness, that never heard of Christ,
(being thus combined.) And whether the Kingdom of God, be not larger
than his Church: Joyn the Head and Tail of this mans book together, and
by the Head (the description) for ought I see, <hi>Jews, mahometans,</hi> if not
almost all Heathens, are the Church: But at the End, I think none on
Earth is the Church: At least none that separate from a pair of Organs, or
an ignorant Curate, Nor can any man know who.</p>
               <p>Page 2. §. 2. <hi>He explaineth his Word</hi> [Body] <hi>as</hi> opposed to a confused
Multitude.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> But a <hi>Community</hi> of <hi>Equals,</hi> that have no Governours, may have order,

                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:59353:3"/>
P. 3. §. 3. <hi>And in many places, his Confusion and grand errour is repeated,
that the</hi> Christian Church is but one: <hi>p.</hi> 7. We know no Church but what all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
are members of by Baptisme, which is the Vniversal Church: <hi>p.</hi> 8. There is
but one Church, of which all Christians are members, as there is but one Covenant;
<hi>p.</hi> 19. If there be but one Church and one Communion, of which all true Christians
are members, <hi>&amp;c. p. 23. I am no otherwise</hi> a member of any particular Church,
than I am of the Vniversal: <hi>p. 40. It's a</hi> schismatical Notion of membership that
divides the Christian Church into distinct memberships, and therefore into the distinct
Bodyes: <hi>And p. 19. and often he saith,</hi> those Churches which are not members
of each other, are separate Churches and Schismaticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I had hoped that no man but Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> had talkt at this rate.</p>
               <p>I. It's agreed on, that there is but one Universal Church: The contrary
is a Contradiction. 2. It is agreed, that there is no lawful particular
Church which is not a part of the Universal. 3. That whoever hath just
Union and Communion with a true particular Church, hath Union and
Communion with the Universal: 4. That all men in their Worship of God,
should accordingly perform it (and do all that they do) as Men in that
Relation to the Universal Church: None of this is controverted.</p>
               <p>II. But I had hoped never to have heard any but <hi>Seekers</hi> say, that there are
<hi>not many lawful</hi> particular Churches, <hi>distinct</hi> from the whole and from one
another, though not disjunct in the Common Essentials. For the proof of
the contrary,</p>
               <p>1. <hi>I begin with that which I expect should be most powerful; The mans
own after-Confessions, to which he is oft brought.</hi> Pag. 8. Distance of Place
and the necessities and conveniences of Worship and Discipline, has divided the
Church into several parts and members, and Particular Churches, <hi>&amp;c. So</hi> pag. 14.
pag. 19. All Christian Churches ought to be members of one. <hi>More fully</hi> p. 20,
21. <hi>This is</hi> ad hominem, Yea and Nay <hi>is his Resolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>But I'le bring other Arguments that prevail more with me. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures oft tell us of</hi> many Churches, <hi>therefore there are many.</hi> Act.
9. 31. The Churches had rest; <hi>and</hi> 15. 4. Confirming the Churches; 16. 5. So
were the Churches established in the Faith; <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 4. All the Churches of the
Gentiles: <hi>So ver. 16. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 17. So ordain I in all Churches; 11. 16. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Churches of God <hi>(have such Custom;)</hi> 14. 33. As in all the Churches
of the Saints; 34. Let your Women keep silence in the Churches. <hi>So</hi> 16. 1. 19.
&amp; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 1. The Grace of God bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia: 18.
Whose Praise is in the Gospel through all the Churches. <hi>So 19. 23, 24. and</hi> 11.
8. 28. The care of all the Churches; 12. 13. Inferior to the other Churches. <hi>Gal.

17, 29. and 3. 6, 13, 22, 23. and 22. 16. <hi>His Concordance might have shew'd
him all these in order,</hi> Phil. 4. 15. No Church communicated with me (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
giving and receiving) but ye only. <hi>The dispute now must be, whether
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59353:4"/>
the Apostles or this</hi> Resolver <hi>be to be believed: They say, there are</hi> many
Churches, <hi>parts of</hi> One; <hi>he saith,</hi> There is but one, and it's Schismatical to divide
it into distinct memberships <hi>or</hi> Bodyes, <hi>&amp;c. It's no Schisme here to say, I am for</hi>
Paul <hi>and the Holy Scripture: Let who will believe the contradictor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>3. My next Argument is this: Where there are many Political Societies,
consisting of Christian Pastors and People, professedly associated <hi>for the</hi>
ordinary Exercise of those Relations as such, in holy Communion, in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Doctrine, Worship, Order and Conversation, for Edification in
true Faith, Hope, Love and Obedience, and the Glorifying of God
therein. There are many distinct true Churches, parts of the Church
Universal;<hi>But on Earth there are many such Societyes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Either the controversie is <hi>De re</hi> or <hi>de nomine</hi> (for we called <hi>Separatists</hi>
use to separate these.) 1. If <hi>de re;</hi> Let the existence of the thing defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
be tryed by Scripture, Reason and common Experience: 2. If <hi>de nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne;
Forma quae dat esse dat Nomen:</hi> Here is the true <hi>specifick form</hi> which is
found in many single Churches, <hi>ergo</hi> the Name of such <hi>single</hi> (or individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al)
Churches is due to them.</p>
               <p>4. Again <hi>ad hominem,</hi> from the consequences: 1. If there be not many
single Churches in the Universal, then there are not many Patriarchal, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
Provincial, Metropolitical, Diocesan, or Parochial Churches: For
<hi>non entium non datur numerus:</hi> Many <hi>nothings</hi> is a contradiction. <hi>Multae sunt
ergo sunt; Ab est tertij adjecti ad est secundi valet argumentum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if there be not many, then 1. All the Parish Churches in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but one, and not many, a Patron can have right to present to no one as
a Church, more than to another. 2. Then the Parson, Vicar or Curate
is no more the Parson of one Church than of another; nor bound to no
more Care and Duty; for there is but one. 3. Then no one is bound to
go to one Parish Church more than another; for there is but one. 4. Then
the Temple and Tithes belong no more to one than another. 5. Then no
Bishop is the proper Bishop of one Diocesan Church, more than of another.
6. Then all the revenues of the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> are no more appropriate
to one Church than to another. 7. Then you owe no more Obedience to
the Bishops of one Diocesan Church than another: 8. Then you make the
King no more Head or Governour of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> than of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
9. Then a Diocesan oweth no Reverence to a Metropolitane Church
(if there be none such.) 10. Then many Churches cannot have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor send Bishops to Councils; (if there be not many.) 11. And the
charge of Separation from a Church that is no Church, is a contradiction.</p>
               <p>5. I adde, from Parity of Reaon, if many distinct subordinate Societies
may make one Civil Body Politick, so they may one Universal Church: But
the Antecedent is undoubted. If it be Learnedly said with Mr. <hi>Cheny,</hi> that <hi>one
whole cannot be Part of another whole;</hi> One may attain the perfection by that
time he hath worn the Breeches but a few years, to know that a whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59353:4"/>
may be part of a whole Village, and a whole Vicinage be part of a
whole City, and a whole Colledge be part of a whole University; and a
whole City part of a whole Kingdom; and a whole Kingdom part of the
whole Earth.</p>
               <p>And if it be objected, that the Names of the <hi>whole</hi> and <hi>parts</hi> are here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
but a <hi>Church</hi> and a <hi>Church</hi> are the same Name. I Answer, at the same age
one may learn that the same Name proveth not the sameness of the things
Named; and that <hi>ex penuria nominum</hi> the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> the <hi>Totum</hi> and
<hi>Parts</hi> have oft equivocally the same Name, with the Addition of just Notes
of distinction. Sometimes an Academy of many Schools is called <hi>Schola,</hi> and
so are the single Schools therein: The City of <hi>London</hi> is a <hi>Society;</hi> and so
are the Societies of Merchant-Taylors, Drapers, Mercers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>§. 4. But these Churches must be members of one another, or they are Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. How can that be, if they be all but one. 2. This is also above or
below the <hi>ferula</hi> age. They are no members of one another, but all members
of the whole: Yet how oft have we this with the sting of Schisme (as <hi>Damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
as <hi>Murder or Adultery)</hi> in the Tail of it. The hand is not a member or part
of the Foot, or the Foot of the Hand, or the Liver a member of the Lungs,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but each one of the Man: If ever I were a Schoolmaster again, I would
perswade my Boyes, that A is not a member of B, nor B of C, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but each
of the Alphabet; And that one leaf of their Book is not a member of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but both of the Book; And if they were ripe for the University, I would
perswade them that <hi>Exter</hi> Colledge is not a member of <hi>Corpus Christi,</hi> nor
that of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> &amp;c. but all of the Universitie of <hi>Oxford.</hi> And I think that
<hi>Bristol</hi> is not a member of <hi>Exeter</hi> or <hi>Gloucester,</hi> &amp;c. but all of <hi>England;</hi> and
that the Company of Stationers are not part of the Society of Merchants or
Drapers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all of <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What a Priviledg is it, that a Man may believe this about any such thing
without Schisme and Damnation! And how dreadful to fall into such Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
hands that in their Case make it Schisme, Separation and Damnation.
But there is a Remedy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 5. But he hath reason for what he saith:</hi> p. 3, 4. [Indeed it <hi>is</hi> extreamly absurd
<hi>and</hi> unreasonable, to say, that the Christian Church, which is built on the same
Foundation, <hi>&amp;c. who</hi> enjoy all Priviledges <hi>in</hi> Common, should be divided into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>

                  </gap>e kind and nature, <hi>as</hi> Peter, James <hi>and</hi>
Iohn <hi>are</hi> distinct Persons—It's absurd to say, <hi>That</hi> where every thing is common
there is not one Community.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Let us not swallow this without Chewing: 1. Whether all be
<hi>extreamly absurd</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> which such Doctors call so; I am grown
to doubt as much as whether all be Schism which Schismaticks call so: <hi>Ipse
dixit</hi> is no Proof.</p>
               <p>2. What the meaning of this great, Decantate Word <hi>[Separate]</hi> is,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59353:5"/>
must anon be enquired: But, may not Churches be <hi>distinct</hi> and not culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
separate? He confesseth afterwards both local distinction and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>3. How far are the <hi>Vniversal Church</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Churches distinct? As
<hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts?</hi> Must the World at last learn that <hi>Whole</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> are
not distinct? If you take if for absurd to distinguish a Man from a Body,
or from a Liver, Hand or Foot, Dissenters do not; nor to distinguish a
Colledge from an University, a House from a Street, a Street from a
City, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how are the Particular Churches distinguished one from another?
Reader, so constantly do such men fight with themselves, that it's meet
to ask, whether they that thus say there are not many distinct Churches,
do not assert a far wider difference between many, than those they dissent
from. We affirm that there are many, and that they differ not <hi>in specie,</hi>
but <hi>numero,</hi> as Colledges, Cities do among themselves; but these men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all this, hold not only a numerical, but a specifick difference, even as
Parochial, Diocesan, Provincial, Patriarchal, National; at least Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and Diocesans differing <hi>Ordine vel Specie</hi> with them, the Church deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
from them must do so too.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi>But he confirms it. [Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> thô they partake of the
same common nature, yet each of them have a distinct Essence and Subsistence of their
own, and this makes them distinct Persons; but whether the very Nature and Essence
of a Body or Society consists in having all things common, there can be but one
Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I hope its no culpable Separation to distinguish things as differing
<hi>specie &amp; numero;</hi> and this is the Doctors meaning, if his words are signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant:
and the common way of expressing it would have been, [Peter <hi>and</hi>
John <hi>differ numerically but not</hi> in specie; <hi>but two Churches differ neither</hi> specie
<hi>nor</hi> numero.]</p>
               <p>And 1. Reader, whereas he said before, that the <hi>Church is not divided into
distinct Bodies,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> &amp;c.] did you think till you, that <hi>James</hi>
and <hi>John,</hi> and the Doctor, and the several Bishops had not been distinct
parts of the Church in their distinct natural bodies?</p>
               <p>2. And why may there not be distinct Politick Bodies, or Compound in
one whole as well as natural? certainly, all things corporeal save Attomes
are Compounds: A Muscle, a Hand, a Foot, parts similar and dissimilar
in man are all compounded of lesser Parts. If many Students may make one
Colledge, why may not many Colledges make one University? It's strange
if a Doctor deny this.</p>
               <p>3. <hi>But let us consider of his Reason, and enquire</hi> 1. Whether the Church
have all things Common. 2. Whether the very Essence of it consist in this.</p>
               <p>I. It is granted that the whole <hi>Essence</hi> of the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> is found in
every individual of that <hi>Species,</hi> Natural or Politick; but did we ever hear,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59353:5"/>
till Mr. <hi>Cheny</hi> and this Doctor said it, that Politick Bodies differ not <hi>nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>
as well as Natural? The Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> and of <hi>France</hi> are two;
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> long strove which should be uppermost,
but who ever said that they were not two?</p>
               <p>II. Have they all things common? Dissenters would have excepted
Wives and Husbands, (thô the Canons called Apostolical do not;) Why
should the Essence of a Church lie in this, and not the Essence of a City or
Kingdom? Tories in <hi>Ireland</hi> would have all common; Merchants and
Tradesmen, Knights, Lords and Princes here would not. But it's no Schism
here also to distinguish <hi>simpliciter</hi> &amp; <hi>secundum quid,</hi> Propriety and the use
of Propriety: There is no <hi>Community</hi> without <hi>Propriety:</hi> Men have first a
Propriety in themselves, their members, their food, the acquests of their
Labours, their Wives and Children, and Goods. And they consent to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
to preserve this Propriety, because every man loveth himself: And
yet they must use their Propriety, (even of Life) for common good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all are better than one: But if they had no Propriety they could not
so use it for the Common-wealth.</p>
               <p>And I never conformed to the Doctrine that denyeth <hi>Propriety</hi> in Church
Members and Particular Churches, and thought all simply <hi>common.</hi> I'le
tell you what <hi>Particular</hi> Churches have to individuate them, not common
to all.</p>
               <p>1. They consist of individual natural Persons, <hi>many</hi> of which as much
differ from <hi>many</hi> other Persons, (those in <hi>England</hi> from those in <hi>Spain)</hi> as
<hi>one man</hi> doth from <hi>another.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Their Graces and gifts are numerically distinct (Faith, Hope, Love, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
from those of other Churches thô <hi>ejusdem speciei. 3. England</hi> and <hi>France,
London</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> have Churches of different <hi>place</hi> and Scit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> 4. But
the <hi>formal individuating</hi> difference is their nearest Relation to their several
<hi>Pastors;</hi> as several Kingdoms, Cities, Schools are n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Wife, Children and Servants must be used for the common good, and yet
are not common, one mans Wife and Children are not anothers; So the
Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> &amp;c. must govern his Church for the good of the
Universal; but he is not the Bishop of <hi>Gloucester, Norwich, Paris, Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are differences enow to constitute a <hi>numerical</hi> difference of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
<hi>Paul</hi> distinguisheth the Bishops of <hi>Philippi, Ephesus,</hi> &amp;c. from others.</p>
               <p>Do you yet see no <hi>Priviledges</hi> that one hath Proper, and not common to

                  </hi>
1. All Churches have not Bishop <hi>Jewel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> Doctor <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet,</hi>
Doctor <hi>Sherlock</hi> to be their Teachers: All Churches be not taught all
that's in this Resolver. 2. All Churches have not men of the same sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59353:6"/>
nor excellency of Parts: It was once taken for lawful to account them
<hi>specially worthy of double honour who laboured in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> and to
esteem men for their <hi>works sake. Paul</hi> saith of <hi>Timothy, I have no man like
minded.</hi> If those that heard not a Sermon in many years differed not from
your Congregation, why do you preach?</p>
               <p>I am reproached in Print for telling the world this notorious truth; That I
lived till ten years old, where four men, four years hired successively were
Readers and School-masters; two Preached (as it was called) once a
Month, the other two never: Two drank themselves to beggery. After
I lived where many Parishes about us had no Preachers: The Parish that I
lived in, had a Church with a Vicar that never preached, and a Chappel
with a Parson eighty years old, that had two Livings twenty Miles distant,
and never preacht: His Son a Reader and Stage-player was sometime his
Curate: His Grand-son, my School-master, his Curate next that, never
preacht in his life, but drunk himself to beggery. One year a Taylor read
the Scripture, and the old man (the best of them all) said the Common-Prayer
without book (for want of sight.) The next year a poor Thresher
read the Scripture. After that a Neighbours Son (my Master) was Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
who never preacht but once, and that when he was drunk, (in my
hearing) on <hi>Mat. 25. Come ye Blessed,</hi> and <hi>go ye Cursed;]</hi> the saddest Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
that ever I heard. These things were no rarities: Now my assertion
is, That the Church that had such as <hi>Austin, Chrysostome, Jewel, Andrews,</hi>
and such worthy men as <hi>London</hi> now hath many, had Priviledges distinct
from these, (and many the like) that I was in.</p>
               <p>If you say that every Bishop and Preacher is as much the Bishop and
Preacher to all other single Churches, as to that which is his Title; then
1. He must be condemned for not <hi>teaching</hi> them all. 2. Then he may claim
maintenance from them all. 3. Then he may intrude into any mans Charge.
4. Then no Church is unchurcht for want of a Bishop, for any one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
is Bishop to every Church in the World; and so <hi>ubi Episcopus ibi
Ecclesia,</hi> signifieth but that Church and Bishop are on the same Earth; and
<hi>Ecclesia est Plebs Episcopo adunata</hi> may be verified if there be but one in the
World. 5. And so Mr. <hi>Dodwell</hi> and such are self-confuted before you are
aware: <hi>Geneva, Holland,</hi> and all Presbyterians are true Churches, for they
have all Bishops; <hi>e. g.</hi> The Bishop of <hi>London</hi> is Bishop to them all: For if
one man be no more a Member of one single Church than of another, and
so no more a Subject to one Bishop than to another, then one Bishop is no
more Pastor of one Church than of another.</p>
               <p>7. And how can you magnifie the Church of <hi>England</hi> for a Wise, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Pious Clergy above other Churches, if all Priviledges be common, and
they have no proper Pastors of their own.</p>
               <p>8. Do you think that the Church, <hi>e. g.</hi> Of <hi>Hippo,</hi> that was in <hi>Austins</hi>
dayes, was the same numerical single Church with that which is there now,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59353:6"/>
(were there any) or with the Diocesan Church of <hi>London?</hi> if not, then
at least distance of time, and change of Persons maketh divers Particular
Churches; and it's no more against the unity of the Church Universal to have
divers particular Churches in it in the same Age, than in divers Ages.</p>
               <p>In short, Diversity of matter and form maketh a numerical Diversity
(as of Natural, so) of Politick Bodies of the same <hi>species:</hi> But the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Ephesus, Smyrna, Thyatira, Philadelphia,</hi> &amp;c. were of divers matter and
form numerically; <hi>Ergo</hi> they were divers Political Churches.</p>
               <p>Sure God doth not commend <hi>Laodicea</hi> for <hi>Philadelphia</hi>'s Church Virtues,
nor condemn the Church of <hi>Philadelphia</hi> for the other Churches Sins.</p>
               <p>And if the Angels be Bishops, why are some Bishops praised as the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
of such Churches, and the Bishops of other Churches threatned.</p>
               <p>But I confess this is a ready way to end the Controversies between the
Bishops of several Churches which snall be greatest, if they be all but one.</p>
               <p>But I hope that when the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Church was corrupted,
it is not true that every Bishop and Church fell with him, (or with any
that hath turned to Mahumetanism.)</p>
               <p>To be no longer on this, (which I thought no Prelatist would ever have
put me on) if these men speak not notoriously against Scripture, against
the constant Language of Canons and Fathers, Historians and Lawyers,
and all Antiquity, and all Christian Countreys and Divines, (yea, even
those that at <hi>Trent</hi> would have had only the Pope to be of immediate Divine
Right) then I know not any thing by Reading. And if poor Nonconformists
must be put to defend themselves against such singularities, and be Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
unless they will differ from all the Christian World of all Ages, there
is no Remedy.</p>
               <p>§. 7. <hi>But</hi> p. 5, 6. <hi>he tell us, [that</hi> a Church is made by a Divine Covenant-God
only can constitute a Church: Such Persons, if there be any so absurd, are not
worth disputing with, who dare affirm the Church to be an humane Creature, <hi>or</hi>
the invention of men.—And no Church can depend on humane Contracts; for
then a Church would be a humane <hi>Creature and</hi> Constitution, whereas a Church can
be founded only on a Divine Covenant—</p>
               <p>1. Who would think but this man were a Nonconformist, that talks
so like them <hi>(e. g. Amesius in Medul. Theol.)</hi> against humane Church Forms?
But what then will Bishop <hi>Bilson,</hi> and almost all other Bishops and Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
be thought of, who affirm Patriarchal and Metropolitical Churches (and
many of the Diocesane) to be but humane Constitutions and Inventions.
And if these be not worth the disputing with, it seems, that you differ from
them more than Separatists do: and then were not all these Schismaticks?
and then, are not you a Schismatick if you communicate with them? yea,
your Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> himself maketh Diocesan Churches to be a humane Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and A. Bishop <hi>Bromhall</hi> much pleadeth for mans power to make Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal
Churches; and so do such others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:59353:7"/>
2. But is it true that humane Contracts make not a Church? <hi>Ans.</hi> Not
alone: But I think that all Churches are made by mutual Contracts, and
humane is one part of that which is mutual.</p>
               <p>1. As to the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> 1. God as Legislator and Donor, insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuteth
the <hi>species</hi> of Covenanting by Baptism, and therein he commandeth
mans consent to his <hi>offered Covenant;</hi> and conditionally promiseth to be our
God: But, <hi>Conditionale nihil ponit in esse:</hi> This much maketh no Christian,
nor Church. To command a man to be a Christian, and conditionally to
promise him life if he will be one, proveth him not to be one; else all
were Christians that reject an offered Christ.</p>
               <p>2. But when man <hi>consenteth</hi> and covenanteth with God, then Gods condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
gift becomes actual and efficacious, the man being a capable Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
and not before: and in this it is the Contract that is the <hi>Fundamentum
Relationis;</hi> but a single Promise is not a mutual Covenant or Contract.</p>
               <p>So that it is no wiser Divinity to say, Gods Covenant and not mans consent,
Covenant or Contract with God, doth make Christians, and the universal
Church; than it is sober Reason to say, That Gods Institution of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
or Magistracie only doth make the Relation of Husband and Wife, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their covenanting consent, or doth make Common-wealths, without
the consent or Covenant of Sovereign and Subjects, Did this Doctor think
that <hi>Voluntariness</hi> is not as necessary to the Relation of Christianity as to
the Relation of Prince and Subjects; yea, or of Husband and Wife? if he
do, he is shamefully mistaken. Baptism delivereth men possession of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
Grace</hi> and <hi>right</hi> to Glory; and can men have this against their wills? One
would think by the Doctrine and course of some men, that they could
force men to Pardon and Salvation! if I believed that their force could
accomplish this, I would never call it Persecution. If they can force men
to be true Christians, they may force them to be justifyed and saved; and
then they are very uncharitable if they do not: Let them then cease preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and disputing us to their Opinion, but bring us all to Heaven whether
we will or not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea the self-contradictor, playing fast and loose, confesseth</hi> p. 6. <hi>That</hi>
no man at age can be admitted to Baptism, till he profess his faith in Christ, and
voluntarily undertake the Baptismal Vow: <hi>And is not that</hi> humane Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</p>
               <p>Yea, he knoweth that the Liturgie maketh even Neighbours or Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
vow and covenant, both in the name of the Child and for the Child.
And so necessary doth the Episcopal Church think <hi>humane Covenanting,</hi> that
without this no Child must be Baptized publickly though the Parents would
covenant, and that they can neither for Love nor Money (for many poor
men hire Godfathers) get any one (much less three) who examined, will
seriously purpose to perform the Covenant for the Childs holy Education
which they make</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59353:7"/>
II. But is not <hi>humane Covenanting</hi> a cause of <hi>single Church</hi> Relation as well
as of <hi>universal?</hi> I see no cause to doubt it; and I am sure that the Church
for a thousand years (before and since Popery came in) have declared him
no Bishop that comes in without <hi>consent</hi> of Clergie and People; which
<hi>Consent</hi> is their covenanting act.</p>
               <p>To make a single Church, manifold consent goeth to the <hi>Fundamentum Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lationis.</hi>
1. God commandeth single Church Officers, order and consent,
and promiseth them his blessing where they are met: The Lord and his
Angels are among them: No command is vain, and without a virtual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
2. To this a threefold humane consent is needful, Ordinarily:
1. the Persons called. 2. The Ordainers (when it may be had.) 3. The
Peoples. He that formerly, from the Apostles dayes, for a thousand years,
should have said, that neither the covenanting, that is the <hi>consent</hi> of the
Pastor, or People, or Ordainers, is necessary to the <hi>Fundamentum</hi> of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Church Relation or Form, would have been taken for a wild-brain'd
Schismatick at least.</p>
               <p>§. 8. <hi>But saith this Doctor (and another of them)</hi> [p. 6. But the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Church Covenant between Pastor and people, is of a very different nature
from this: Vnless any man will say, that the voluntary Contract and Covenant which
the Independents exact from their Members, and wherein they place a Church state,
be part of the Baptismal vow; if it be not, then they found the Church upon a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Covenant; for Christ hath made but one Covenant with Mankind which is
contained in the Vow of Baptism; if it be, then no man is a Christian but an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Alas for the Church that is taught at this rate!</p>
               <p>1. I never saw what Independents do in this case; but I think none of
them that are Sober own any other sort of Church but the <hi>universal,</hi> and <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Churches</hi> as members of it, and therefore require no Contract but 1. To
the Covenant of Baptism or Christianity. 2. To the Duties of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Church-relation.</p>
               <p>2. And nothing is here of necessity but <hi>manifested Consent</hi> (which is a
real Contract) but a clearer or a darker, an explicite or implicite consent
differ only <hi>ad melius esse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Is not God the Author of Magistracy, Marriage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is it any
violation of Gods part, if Rulers and People, Husband and Wife be Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters
by his command?</p>
               <p>4. Is it any renuntiation of Baptism to promise at Ordination to obey
the Arch-Bishop and Bishop, and to take the Oath of Canonical Obedience?
Is it not still exacted? Are not the Takers of it obliged? are not Covenants
imposed on all that will be Ministers in the act of Uniformity? are not
multitudes kept out and cast out for not making these Covenants? <hi>Quo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neam
nodo,</hi> &amp;c. How should one deal with such slippery men? Good Mr.
<hi>Zachary Cawdry</hi> that wrote to have all men to covenant Submission to Bishops
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59353:8"/>
and Parish Ministers, did not dream that it was any violation of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
               <p>5. Do not men owe duty to their Pastors which they owe to no others?
If not, put them not on it: Why are you angry with them for going from
you? Why doth the Canon suspend those that receive them to Communion
from another Parish that hath no Preacher? Why are we ruined for not
covenanting as aforesaid? if yea, then is it against Baptism to promise to
do our duty?</p>
               <p>6. But hath God commanded or instituted no Covenant but Baptism?
Yes sure, the Matrimonial at least; and I think Ordination is covenanting
for the Ministry: Did not the Apostle <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23. ordain Elders in every
Church? if you would have [by <hi>Suffrage]</hi> left out of the Translation, no
sober man can doubt but it was by the Peoples consent; and was it without
their consent that <hi>Titus</hi> was to ordain Elders in every City? Could any then
come otherwise in? Did not all Churches hold and practise this after, and
was it none of Gods Institution? If so, God requireth us not to take any
of you for our Bishops or Pastors: Who then requireth it? What meaneth
<hi>Paul</hi> when he saith, <hi>they gave up themselves to the Lord and to us, by the Will
of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>7. Can the wit of man imagine how it is possible without consent, for a
man to be made the Pastor of any Flock? Who ever ordained a man against his
will? or for any man to have Title against his will, to the proper over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
and pastoral care of any one Pastor, or the priviledges of any Church?
If any think they may be cramm'd and drencht with the Sacrament, or that
an unwilling man may have a sealed pardon and gift of Salvation delivered
him, he will make a new Gospel. And how any particular Pastor is bound
to give that man the Sacrament ordinarily, that consents not ordinarily to
receive it of him, I know not. No man is a member of any City, or any
Company of Free-men in the City, but by mutual consent; and the Oath
of Allegiance and Supremacy to the King maketh not the Oath of a Citizen
as such or of a Member of a Company as such, unlawful.</p>
               <p>8. Doth this Doctor think that he ever yet proved to sober men,
that the Covenant aforesaid, of Godfathers and Godmothers, to make
Christians, and members of the universal Church, is more (or so much)
of Gods Institution, than the Contract or Consent between Bishops or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors
and People to make a single Political Church?</p>
               <p>9. If it follow not, that no man is the Kings Subject that sweareth not to
the City; It will not follow, that none is a Christian, but an Independent, or
Church-consenter.</p>
               <p>10. How are your Parish or Diocesan Church members known to your
selves or any others? Are all that dwell in the Parish or Diocess your Church
members? Then Atheists, Sadducees, Hobbists, and all vicious men and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
that never communicate are such: Yea those that you call Separatists.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59353:8"/>
If it be every transient Communicant, have you a proper Pastoral care of
every Travellers Soul that so communicates with you? You after plead that
his very ordinary Communion maketh him not a member, if he be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be one. And is not his consent then necessary? Or if ordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
be the test (how few then of great Parishes are of the Church) yet
that is because such Communion signifieth their Consent to your over-sight
of them.</p>
               <p>§. 9. But it's much to be approved which <hi>p.</hi> 5. and oft he saith, that
<hi>to be taken into Covenant with God, and to be received into the Church is the very
same thing,</hi> as to the Universal Church. By which all his gross Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Accusations afterwards are confuted. No man then is out of the Church
that is not out of the Baptismal Covenant, either by not <hi>taking</hi> it, or by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing
some <hi>Essential part</hi> of it? And when will he prove, that to take him,
rather than Dr. <hi>Bates</hi> that was cast out, to be a Teacher or Pastor at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stans,</hi>
or to take this man and not another to be the Lawful Bishop or Priest,
and to obey him in every Oath and Ceremony, is an Essential part of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Covenant, or of Christianity? But such a rope of Sand, as Mr. <hi>Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi>
and this man tye together, to bind men to their Sect, will serve turn with
some that know not who speaks Truth, by any surer way than prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>§. 10. His Doctrine of</hi> Separation <hi>and</hi> gathering Churches out of Churches <hi>is
anon to be considered: But whereas he addes,</hi> p. 7. [These men convert
Christians from common Christianity, and the Communion of the Vniversal Church
to Independency.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> My acquaintance with them is small, save by reading their Books:
And there are few Men of any Common Denomination (Episcopal, or
other) that are not in many things disagreed. But I must in Charity to them
say, that as far as I can judge by their Writings or Speech, he palpably
slandereth them; and that none that are grave and sober among them do
separate their Churches from the common Christianity or the Universal
Church, any more than the Company of Stationers, Ironmongers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
separated from the City of <hi>London,</hi> or <hi>London</hi> from <hi>England,</hi> or Trinity
Colledge from the University of <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford.</hi> I never met with
man, and I am confident never shall do, that doth not take his Independent
Church to be part of the Universal, and Dependent as a part on the whole.
If belying others stopt at words, the wrong were small: But when it's made
but the stairs to hatred and destroying, it's his way to cure Schism that is
commonly painted with Horns and Cloven feet. If a man come from a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Village and be made by Covenant a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> how prove you
that he renounceth King or Kingdom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he saith,</hi> p. 9. Those who wilfully separate from the Corporation to which
the Charter was granted, forfeit their Interest in the Charter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> What Reader doth this man presume upon that will not ask him,
how he proveth 1. That Gods Law or Charter to his Church doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59353:9"/>
them to congregate in distinct single Churches (as <hi>London</hi> Charter
doth to erect several Companies, and the Universities several Colledges?)
2. And that God hath not in his Word given order or command for such
single Churches: But that the Apostles and <hi>Titus</hi> by fixing Elders to their
several Churches and Cities, separated from the Universal Church? 3. And
that their subordinate Churches have not need of distinct subordinate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
and duty: And that our Diocesan Churches all separate from the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal?
Did he think these things need no proof at all?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It may be he will say that the</hi> Diocesan depend on the Vniversal, but the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
or Independent do not.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. God hath made one General Law, for Christians congregating
with their fixed Elders or Bishops in particular Churches all the World
over: And his Command is not without Promise of <hi>being with them</hi> to the
End of the World; and that Promise becometh a Promise to every Church
so congregate. God hath not made distinct Laws or Promises to every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian:
But the Promise to Justifie all Believers justifieth each single Person
when he believeth. If the King should make one common Law to command
all his Subjects that are Freeholders to live in Corporations or Hundreds,
described with their priviledges, those priviledges would be all theirs that
are so incorporated: As one Charter may Priviledge every <hi>London</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
diversified by subordinate Agreements.</p>
               <p>2. And that God who will have them thus incorporated and distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

demerits to each. Do I need to recite the peculiar Promises and threats to
the seven <hi>Asian</hi> Churches, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. and 3. which are Covenants to them?</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59353:9"/>
words, it is to tell us that <hi>Communion</hi> is <hi>nothing but Vnion:</hi> I know that <hi>quoad
notationem nominis, Communion</hi> may signifie, <hi>Vnion with others:</hi> But they that
write Politicks have hitherto distinguished <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> taking
<hi>Communion</hi> for Actual <hi>Commnication,</hi> or exercise of the duties of men in
Union? But to speak cross to other Writers on the same Subjects and give
no reason for it, and to confound <hi>Vnion</hi> and <hi>Communion,</hi> is one part of this
edifying Resolution.</p>
               <p>§. 13. Pag. 11. [Our Communion with the Church consists in being members of
the Church, which we are made by Baptism,] <hi>(saith he.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then the Baptized are still in Communion with the Church, till their

               <p>§. 14. Pag. 12. Should any man who is no member of the Church, nor owns
himself to be so, intrude into the Church and Communicate in all Holy Offices, it's

               <p>

owning of Communion: If it do not, would you would tell us how to
know who are of your Church.</p>

but in membership: Now as a member is a member of the whole Body (not meerly
of any part of it, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> All the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> who never saw nor converst

               <p>

<hi>Meerly</hi> signifieth <hi>Only</hi> I suppose; and if he would make his Reader think
that they that are for <hi>single Church peculiar membership</hi> and consent, do take
themselves to be <hi>[meerly</hi> or <hi>only]</hi> members of those single Churches, and
not of the Universal, it is shameless injury.</p>
               <p>2. Will he ever draw men to conformity by making them believe, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they owe Common Communion to all Christians, therefore we owe
no special duty to the Bishops, Priests, Churches or Neighbours where we
are setled? Do the Men of one Colledge, School, Corporation, owe no
more duty to that than to all others? Do the Free-holders of <hi>Belford-shire</hi>
choose Knights for <hi>Middlesex;</hi> or the Citizens of <hi>Oxford</hi> choose Officers in
<hi>London?</hi> These seem strange Resolutions to us.</p>
               <p>3. But doth he remember that <hi>[if Communion consist not in Acts of Communion</hi> to

and performeth no other Acts of Communion to the Bishops, Parson or

Is it a sin to Promise Duty? 4. Sure it is not meer <hi>Place,</hi> but a mutual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation

Constantinople,</hi> &amp;c. one party is uppermost (by the Judgment of
Councils and Prince) one Year, and another contrary party the next.
And what shall they do where the Prince equally tolerateth both, and it's
hard to know which is the more numerous? as in <hi>Zeno</hi>'s and <hi>Anastasius</hi>
Reign, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And what shall they do when many Chnrches in one City are of
divers Tongues, as well as Customs? Have the <hi>Greeks, French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>
in <hi>London</hi> no rule of Catholick Communion but communicating in all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce;
with the English, and obeying all your Bishops Courts?</p>
               <p>§. 19. P. 21. <hi>Saith he</hi> [Distinct and particular Churches which are in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with each other, must have their distinct bounds and limits, as every member
has it's natural and proper place, and Situation in the Body.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Why may not the <hi>Greeks, Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> live in Communion with
the Churches <hi>London</hi> though they live dispersedly among them! In
<hi>Brandenburg, Hassia,</hi> and many free Cities, and <hi>Belgia,</hi> where Lutherans
and Calvinists (as called) live together, and own each other as Brethren,
why may not both be Churches of Christ?</p>
               <p>§. 20. P. 21, 22. <hi>A great deal more he hath of the like, making Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
at his Pleasure.</hi> [This is plain in the Case of the Presbyterian and Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
Churches and those other Conventicles—<hi>They</hi> are Churches in a Church,
—Nothing can justifie the Distinction of Christians into several Churches, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in Government and Discipline. Every Christian is a member of the Whole

Christian Church, and in Communion with it, but he is under the immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
and Government of his own Bishop and Presbyters, and is bound to perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Communion with them; and this constitutes a particular Church, in which all
Acts of Worship and all Acts of Discipline and Government are under the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and conduct of a particular Bishop.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Omitting that he seemeth to make the Parochial Churches no Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
but parts of one, here he saith all that he seemed to write against, and
that those that he reproacheth hold, allowing the difference of the <hi>extent</hi>
of <hi>Churches.</hi> And is it Edifying to read such a discourse, that saith and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saith
by self-contradiction? And he adjoyns 28. p. how by agreement

               <head type="sub">Of his first Case.</head>
               <p>§. 1. PAge 31. <hi>His first Case,</hi> 
                  <q>Whether Communion with some Church or
other be a necessary Duty incumbent on Christians:]</q> 
                  <hi>And he thinks</hi>
                  <q>
                     <hi>the Resolution</hi> of this is as plain, as whether it be necessary for every man to be a
Christian: For every Christian is baptized into the Communion of the Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In this I know no Christian adversary to him: But it being the <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church</hi> that he giveth his proof of necessary Communion with, it's
odde to say, <hi>We must have Communion with some Church or other:</hi> As if there
were more than one Universal Church. 2. But we grant more, that all that
can well, should be also members of some single Church.</p>
               <p>§. 2. P. 32. <hi>He saith</hi> [<q>External and Actual Communion is an Essential du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of a Church-member <hi>(meaning a</hi> Christian.]</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 1. And yet before he denyed that Communion lay essentially in this
Exercise, but only in <hi>Vnion:</hi> Yea and Nay is his Custom. 2. Some few
Christians (as those that live where such Communion cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are not bound to it; therefore it is not true that it is <hi>Essential</hi>
to Universal Church-membership. And I think sickness endeth not the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentials,
that disableth men.</p>
               <p>3. Note Reader, that by this mans Doctrine we are all unchristened and
damned if we do not gather into disallowed Churches, if we be unjustly
cast out of the allowed ones: For all must be Church members that will be
Christians, and an unjust Excommunication cannot disoblige us from Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
nor bind us to consent to be damned. Now read the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Canons of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommunicate

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59353:11"/>
sinful, and answer <hi>Spalatensis</hi> arguments against Excommunicating <hi>ipso
facto,</hi> and prove all this just, and you may prove what you will just. But you see
where he layeth the Controversie: If any be Excommunicated without suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
cause, or by Lay Civilians to whom God never gave that power, or by such
Bishops or Pastors as have no just Authority for want of a true call or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent;
or if any unlawful thing be made necessary to Communion, all such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
must by his own confessions hold Church-communion whether these im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers
will or not; for all Christians are bound to be of some Church.</p>
               <p>§. 3. p. 33, 34. <hi>He saith that</hi> [None but publick Prayers are the Prayers of
the Church properly, and acts of Communion, <hi>that is, such as are</hi> offered by the
hands of men authorized and set apart for that purpose, <hi>&amp;c.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Who would have thought that we are more for the Liturgy than
he? I undertake to prove, that all the Responsal Prayers, and all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany
Prayers, in which the Minister names but the matter to them, and
the People make it a Prayer by speaking the petitioning parts, are all the
publick Prayers of the Church, and so are all the petitioning Psalms spoke
or sung by the People, and not only that which is offered by the Priest: I
do not think that he believeth what he carelesly saith here, himself.</p>
               <p>But the Independents are stiffer for his first <hi>Thesis</hi> (of the necessity of
Church-communion) than he is, his unfit words I pass by.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of his second Case.</head>
               <p>§. 1. THE next question of <hi>Occasional Communion</hi> as distinct from fixed,
he turns out of doors, as if there could be no such thing, and it's
very true as to the Church universal; but as to visible, actual Communion
with this or that particular Church, it is not true.</p>
               <p>1. A Traveller of another Country, who on his journey communicateth
with every Church where he passeth, is not a fixed Member of that Church:
for, 1. The Pastor or Bishop hath not that peculiar Charge of him as of
fixed members. 2. He is not bound where he passeth to take such notice of
the lives of Communicants or Pastors, and to admonish the Offenders, and
tell the Church, as fixed members are. 3. He hath not the right in choose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pastors or Deacons as the fixed Members have. 4. An itinerant Bishop
<hi>in transitu</hi> is not their fixed Bishop; <hi>ergo</hi> an Iterant Lay-man is not a fixed
Member.</p>
               <p>The same I may say of one that is a fixed member of another Church in
the same City, and cometh to that only to signifie universal Communion, or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59353:12"/>
neighbourly; which, though he deny to be lawful, I shall further prove
anon.</p>
               <p>And the same I may say of those that dwell where there is no fixed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
Church at all, for want of a Pastor, but they congregate only when some
strange Minister passeth through the Town.</p>

               <head type="sub">His third Case.</head>
               <p>§. 1. <hi>PAge 48, 49. He resolveth his third Case:</hi> [Whether it be lawful to
Communicate with two distinct and separate Churches] <hi>negatively,
and saith,</hi> [It is contrary <hi>to all the</hi> Principles of Church Communion, as any thing
can possibly be; it is to be contrary to our selves, it is Communicating with Schism:
That the Presbyterian and Independent Churches have made an actual separation from
the Church of <hi>England</hi> he hath evidently proved;—<hi>and</hi> they are Schismaticks,
and to communicate with them is to partake in their Schism; and if Schism be a great
sin, and that which will damn us as soon as Adultery and Murther, then it must
needs be a dangerous thing to communicate with Schismaticks. <hi>And p.</hi> 42. There
cannot be two distinct Churches in one place, one for occasional, and another for
constant Communion, without Schism.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> To save those that are willing from the Poyson of these Schismati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Doctrines, lapt up in confusion by men that abhor distinction, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not what they say; I will first lay down that truth that he sights
against, with convincing evidence, and then shew you the mischief of his
false Doctrine and Application.</p>
               <p>§. 2. The confusion of these words <hi>[Church, Communion, Separation</hi> and
<hi>Schism]</hi> which every one signifie divers things, is the chief means to blind
and deceive his Reader; whether it do so by himself I know not.</p>
               <p>I. The Word <hi>Church</hi> signifieth sometime the universal Church; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
a single Organized Church as part of it, and sometime humane combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of such single Churches; and that into Diocesan, Classical, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,
Patriarchal, National, and Papal.</p>
               <p>II. The Specification and Nomination of Churches is from the formal
cause, and the proper Government is that form: And the Individuation is
from matter and form, but principally from the form.</p>
               <p>III. The Union of Pastor and Flock in Relation makes that which is a
form aptitudinal (as the Soul to the Body) to be the form in act (as the
Union of Soul and Body) and Gods command and consent with the
consent of the necessary relate and correlate cause that union.</p>
               <p>IV. Union is in order to Communion, which is primary by the exercise
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59353:12"/>
of the formal powers on the matter, and secondary by the action of all the
parts according to their several capacities and Offices.</p>
               <p>V. The Union of the Church is of divers degrees. 1. The formal Union
of the Head and Body, which maketh it essentially the <hi>[Christian Church.]</hi>
2. The <hi>Vnion of the parts among themselves as Christian,</hi> which maketh
them a <hi>Body</hi> capable of Union with the Head. 3. The Union of the parts
as unequal Organized, the Official with the rest, which maketh it an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized
Body,</hi> fit for its special use and welfare. 4. Union in <hi>integrity</hi> of
parts, which maketh it an intire Body. 5. Union in due temperament and
Qualities, which maketh it a <hi>healthful</hi> Body. 6. Unity in <hi>Commou Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,</hi>
which make it a <hi>Comely Beautiful</hi> Body joined with the rest. But, 7.
Union in mutable Accidents is unnecessary and impossible.</p>
               <p>VI. These several degrees of Union are found in Bodies natural and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
1. The Union of Soul and Body makes a man, and an Embryo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it be organized. 2. The Union of the Body maketh it capable of the
Souls further Operation. 3. The Union of the Organical, chief parts, (as
Heart, Lungs, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> to the rest make it a true humane Body compleated
to the nutriment and action of Life. 4. That it have Hands and Fingers,
Feet and Toes, and all integral parts, makes it an intire Body. 5. The
due site, temperament and qualities of each part make it a sound Body.
6. Comely colour, hair, action, going, speech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make it a <hi>comely Body.</hi>
7. To have all parts of equal quantity and office, would make it uncomely:
And to have the same hair, colour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is unnecessary at all.</p>
               <p>1. The Union of King and Subjects as such makes a Kingdom. 2. That
the People be agreed; for one conjunct interest and Government maketh
them a <hi>Community</hi> capable of Politie or Government. 3. That there be
Judges, Maiors and Justices, and subordinate Cities or Societies, maketh
it an Organized Body, in which Kingly Government may be exercised to
its end, the common good. 4. That no profitable part be wanting, (Judge,
Justice, Sheriff, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> maketh it an <hi>entire</hi> Kingdom. 5. That all know
their place, and be duly qualified with Wisdom, Love, Justice, Conscience,
Obedience to God first, to the Sovereign Power next, to Officers next, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
maketh it a sound and safe Kingdom. 6. That it be well situate, fertile,
rich, eminent in Learning, Skill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> maketh it an adorned beautiful King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
7. That all be equal in Power and wealth is destructive; and that
all be of one Age, complexion, calling, temper, degree of knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is impossible: And that all have the same language, cloathing, utensils, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
is needless at least.</p>
               <p>VII. Jesus Christ is the only Universal Soveraign of the Church, both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of vital influence and Government; nor hath he set up any under him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Monarchical, Aristocratical, Democratical, or mixt, Pope, Council,
or diffused Clergy, that hath the Power of Legislation and Judgment as
governing the whole Chorch; but only Officers that <hi>per partes</hi> govern it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59353:13"/>
them, each in his Province, as Justices do the Kingdom, and Kings
and States the World; nor is any capable of more.</p>
               <p>VIII. To set up any <hi>universal Legislators</hi> and Judge, (Pope or Council)
is to set up an Usurper of Christs Prerogative, called by many a Vice-Christ
or an Antichrist; and as bad as making one man or Senate the Soveraign of
all the Earth; and to attempt the setting up of such or any <hi>forreign Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
in this Land, is to endeavour to perjure the whole Kingdom that is
sworn against it in the Oath of Supremacy, and sworn never to endeavour
any alteration of Government in Church or State in the Corporation Oath,
the Vestry Oath, the <hi>Militia</hi> Oath, the <hi>Oxford</hi> Oath, with the Uniformity
Covenants: And if any should endeavour to introduce such a forreign Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
who themselves have had a hand in driving all the Kingdom to all these
Oaths against it, I doubt whether all the Powers of Hell can devise a much
greater crime against Clergy, Cities, and all the Land. Good reason there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
had Doctor <hi>Isaac Barrow</hi> to write against it as he hath done, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> and all such as of late go that pernicious way, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Church Union and Communion. As if one universal Soveraign and
Legislator and Judge, were not enough to unite Christs Kingdom, or man
could mend his universal Laws, and could not stay for his final judgment;
and Churches and Kingdomes might not till then be ruled without one hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
universal Soveraign by necessary and voluntary agreement among
themselves.</p>
               <p>XI. To be a true Believer or Christian, (or the Infant seed of such) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, according to the sense of
the Baptismal Covenant, uniteth each Member first to Christ himself di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly,
and consequently to his Body or Church; and this <hi>coram Deo,</hi> as
soon as it is done by heart consent; and <hi>coram Ecclesia,</hi> regularly, as soon
as he is invested by Baptism; which Baptism, when it may be had so, is
regularly to be administred by none but an authorized Minister or Deacon;
but if through necessity or mistake it be done by a Lay-man, the Ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
took it not for a nullity, much less if the Baptizer was taken for a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
by mistake, being in his place; and if no Baptism can be had, open
covenanting is vallid.</p>
               <p>X. The papists (and their truckling Agents here) have here hampered
themselves in a fatal contradiction: To make themselves masters of the
World, they would perswade us, that Sacraments only regenerate and
sanctifie, and that God saveth none (by any known way and grant) but
by his Covenant Sealed by the Sacraments; and that he authorizeth none
to administer this Covenant but Prelates and their Priests, and none can
validly have it from other hands: And so if you will but abate them the
proof of many things that stand in the way, Heaven and Hell, Salvation
and Damnation are at the will and mercy of such Prelates and Priests. But
unhappily they cannot retrieve their old Opinion, but maintain that Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:59353:13"/>
and Women may baptize in necessity validly, and that Baptismputs one
into a State of Salvation.</p>
               <p>XI. As he that swears and keeps his Allegiance to the King is a Subject
and Member of the Kingdom, though he be no Member of any Corporation;
so, though he disown a thousand fellow Subjects; yea, though he deny the
Authority of Constable, Justice, Judge; so he that is devoted to Christ
truly in the Baptismal Covenant, is a Christian, and a Member of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church, though he were of no particular Church, or did disown
a thousand Members, or any particular Officer of the Church.</p>
               <p>XII. All faults or crimes are not Treason: A man that breaketh any Law,
is in that measure Culpable or punishable: but every breach of Law, or
wrong to fellow Subjects or Justices, as it is not Treason, so it doth not
prove a man no Subject; though some may be so great as to deserve death
and make him intolerable: And so it is in the case of our Subjection in the
Church to Christ.</p>
               <p>XIII. To own Christs Instituted <hi>species</hi> of Church Officers is needful to the
just Order, Safety and Edification of the Church (as to own the Courts of
Judicature, Justices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Kingdom) but to own this or that <hi>numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Officer</hi> as truly commissioned, is needful only to the right administration
of his own Province.</p>
               <p>XIV. As Christ did his own work of <hi>universal Legislation</hi> by himself and
his <hi>Spirit</hi> eminently in the Apostles and Evangelists, who have recorded all
in Scripture, so he settled Churches to continue to the end associated for
Personal Communion in his holy <hi>Doctrine, Worship, Order</hi> and <hi>Conversation</hi>
with authorized Ministers, subordinate to his administration in his <hi>Prophetical,
Priestly, Kingly</hi> and <hi>Friendly</hi> Relations. And thô these may not always or
often meet in the same place, their neighbourhood maketh them capable of
<hi>Personal</hi> presential Communion, as men that may know and admonish each
other and meet by turns, and in presence manage their concerns; which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enceth
single Churches of the lowest order from associated Churches of men,
that have Communion only by others at distance.</p>
               <p>XV. As Logicians say of other Relations, the <hi>matter</hi> must be capable of
the <hi>end,</hi> or it is not capable of the name and form; so is it here: <hi>e. g.</hi> It is
no <hi>Ship</hi> that is made of meer Sponge or Paper, or that is no bigger than a
Spoon; it is no Spoon that is as big as a Ship: One House is not a Village,
nor one Village a City, nor a City a meer House. So twenty or an hundred
or a thousand P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rishes associate, cannot be a <hi>single Church</hi> of the <hi>first or lowest
Order,</hi> being not capable of <hi>mutual Knowledge, Converse</hi> or <hi>personal present
Communion:</hi> Nor are two or three Lay-men capable to be such a Church,
for want of due matter. But supposing them capable, thô a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>rich</hi>
Church have advantage for <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> yet a <hi>small</hi> and <hi>poor</hi> one is
<hi>ejusdem ordinis</hi> as truely a Church; and so is their Pastor, as <hi>Hierom</hi> saith of
<hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Eugubium</hi> so <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Maju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>an</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Gregory Neocaesar</hi> was
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59353:14"/>
equally Bishop of nineteen at first, as after of all save nineteen in the City.</p>
               <p>XVI. If the Apostles have Successours in their care and Superiority over
many Churches, it will prove that there should yet be men of eminent worth
to take care of many Churches, and to instruct and admonish the younger
Ministers: But it will neither prove 1. That they succeed the Apostles in
the extraordinary parts of their Office. 2. Nor that they have any forcing
power by the Sword. 3. Nor that one <hi>Church</hi> hath power over others by
Divine right; for the Apostles fixed not their power to any particular
Churches, but were general <hi>Visitors</hi> or Overseers of many: Yet if the same
Man who is fixed in a particular Church, have also the <hi>visiting admonishing
oversight</hi> of many as far as was an Ordinary part of the Apostles Office, and
be called an Archbishop, I know no Reason to be against him.</p>
               <p>XVII. There be <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>Integral</hi> Acts of the Sacred Ministry instituted
by Christ: These none may take the Power of from any Ministers, nor alter the
<hi>species</hi> or <hi>integrity</hi> of the Offce, by setting up any such Superious as shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
them of that which Christ hath instituted, or arrogating the like uncall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But as in <hi>worship,</hi> so in <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Church Government,</hi> there are undetermined
accidents: As to choose the time and place of Synods, to preside and moderate
and such like: And these the Churches by agreement, or the Magistrate may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to some above the rest: And if the Magistrate affix Baronies, Honours, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
or his own due Civil forcing Power, and make the same Men Magistrates
and Ministers, whether we think it prudent and well done or not, we must ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and obey them.</p>
               <p>XVIII. Some call these <hi>humane Accidental Orders, forms of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and affirm (as Bishop <hi>Reignolds</hi> did, and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his Ireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con
and many excellent men by him cited) that no <hi>form</hi> of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is of <hi>Divine Command.</hi> Which is true of all this second sort of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is but Accidental aud humane; but not at all of the first sort
which is Divine and Essential to Christ himself first, and to Pastors as such
by his appointment; so that the essential Government of the Universal
Church, by Christ, and of each particular Church by Pastors specified by
him (if not of Supervisors of many as succeeding Apostles and Evangelists in
their Ordinary work) are of unalterable Divine right. But the humane
forms are alterable: Such I account 1. The Presidency and Moderator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and accidental Government of one Bishop in a single Church over the
other Presbyters, Deacons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. The accidental Government of a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesan
as an Archbishop over these lowest Bishops and Churches. 3. And the
Superiority of Metropolitans and Patriarchs over them, so it be but in such
<hi>Accidentals</hi> and within the same <hi>Empire,</hi> not imposing a forreign Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
These <hi>tota specie</hi> differ from the Divine Offices.</p>
               <p>XIX. All these single Church being parts of the Universal are less noble
than the whole, and are to do all that they do as members in Union with
the <hi>Whole,</hi> and to do all as Acts of Communion with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:59353:14"/>
XX. The General precepts of doing all to Edification, Concord, Peace,
Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> oblige all the Churches to hold such correspondencies as are
needful to these Ends: And Synods are one special means, which should
be used as far and oft as the Ends require: And if National Metropolitans
and Patriarchs order such Synods, I am not one that will disobey them.
But if on these pretences any would make Synods more necessary than they
are, and use them as Governours, by Legislation and Judgement over the
Particular Bishops by the use of the Church Keyes, and will affixe to them
or Metropolitans, besides an <hi>Agreeing Power</hi> and the said <hi>Government</hi> in Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentals,
a proper Church Government by <hi>making and unmaking Ministers</hi> or
<hi>Christians, excommunicating</hi> and <hi>absolving</hi> as Rulers by the said Keyes, it may
be a duty to disown such usurpations. As the King would disown an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Princes any where met that would claim a Proper Government of him
and his Kingdom; Thô it were much to be wisht that all Christian Princes
would hold such Assemblies for the Concord and Peace of Christendom.</p>
               <p>XXI. The Essentials of Faith, Hope and Loving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, essentiate the
Church objectively: And these are all summarily contained in the Baptismal
Covenant, explained in the Creed, Lords Prayer and Decalouge; and all
with much more, even Integrals and needful Accidentals in the Sacred
Scriptures, which taking in the Law of Nature, are Gods Universal Law.</p>
               <p>XXII. There is no Church on Earth so sound and Orthodox as to want
no Integral part of Christian Religion: Proved: There is no man on Earth,
much less any multitude, so sound as to want no Integral part: But all
Churches consist only of Men; And therefore if all the Men be so far defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
all the Churches are so.</p>
               <p>It is not their <hi>Objective Religion</hi> Generally and implicitely received that I
mean, but their <hi>Subjective Religion,</hi> and their explicite reception of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective.
The Scripture is our perfect Objective Religion in it self, and as
an Object proposed, and in general and implicitely we all receive it. But as
a man may say, I believe all that's in the Scripture, and yet be ignorant of the
very Essentials in it; so a man may explicitely know and believe all the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials
and more, and yet be ignorant of many Integrals.</p>
               <p>All things in Scripture proposed to our Faith, Hope and Practice, are the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrals
of our Religion: But no Christian understandeth all these proposals or
words of Scripture: Therefore no Christian explicitely believeth them all, or
practiceth all. To hold the contrary, is to hold that some Church is perfect in
Understanding, Faith, Hope and Practice, without Ignorance, Errour or Sin:
that is, not to know what a man or a Christian on Earth is.</p>
               <p>XXIII. Much less do all Churches agree in unnecessary indifferent acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
nor ever did, nor ever will or can do.</p>
               <p>XXIV. The measuring out Churches by limits of Ground, Parochial or
Diocesan, is a meer humane ordering of a mutable accident, and no Divine
Determination: And if all were taken for Church members-because they
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:59353:15"/>
dwell in those precincts, it were wicked: But if it be but all in those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts
that are qualified Consenters, it is usually a convenient measure:
But such as in many Cases must be broken.</p>
               <p>XXV. If a Church with Faithful Pastors be well setled in a place first
where there are not more than should make up that one Church, it is not
meet for any there to gather a distinct Church (thô of the same Faith) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
such weighty reason as will prove it necessary, or like to do more good
than hurt: 1. Because Love inclineth to the greatest Union; 2. Because
a Great Church is more strong and honourable than a small, if the number
be not so great as to hinder the Ends. 3. And the Ancient Churches kept
this Union.</p>
               <p>XXVI. If Magistrates make such Laws about Church Accidents as tend to
further the Churches wellfare, or are so <hi>pretended,</hi> and not <hi>against it,</hi> we
must obey them. But if they will either <hi>invade Christs Authority</hi> or <hi>cross</hi> it,
by making Laws <hi>against his,</hi> or such as are <hi>proper to his Prerogative</hi> to make,
or invade the <hi>Pastors Office,</hi> and the <hi>Churches properright</hi> given by Christ, or
determine Accidents to the <hi>Destruction of the Substance</hi> (the Church, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
Worship or Ends) these bind the Consciences of none to Obedience;
but Christ must be obeyed, and we must patiently suffer.</p>
               <p>XXVII. Self-interest, Self-Government and Family-Government are all
antecedent to Publick Government, which Ruleth them for the Common
good, but hath no Authority to destroy them: No King or Prelate can bind
a man to do that which would damn his Soul, nor to omit that which is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to his Salvation: All power is for Edification: They are Gods Ministers
for Good.</p>
               <p>XXVIII. As it belongs to self-government to choose our own Dyet, and
Cloaths, and Wives, and Physicians, (thô we may be restrained from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
publick hurt on such pretences;) And it belongs to Family Government
to educate our own Children, and choose their Tutors, Callings, Wives,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> so it more nearly belongs to self-government to choose the most safe
and profitable means of our own Salvation, which no man may forbid us;
and to avoid that which is pernicious or hurtful; and to Family-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to do the like for our Children.</p>
               <p>XXIX. It is false Doctrine of those late Writers who tell us, that only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
sanctifie or give right to Salvation: The whole Tenor of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
tells us that men are brought to Faith and Repentance, and to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and Godly men, and by Faith to be justified, by the Preaching of the
Gospel: and that Gods word is his appointed means of Salvation, which his
Ministers must preach skilfully, instantly, in season and out of season, to
that End: And if the Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost.</p>
               <p>XXX. The Gospel saveth not like a Charm, by the bare sound or saying
of the words; nor the Sacrament like an Amulet; But as a Moral means
(specially blest by him that instituted it) to work on man as M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n, by infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:59353:15"/>
his Mind, perswading his Will and exciting his Affections, as Men are
wrought on in other Cases; (which methinks those called Arminians should
least deny, who are said to lay more of the Spirits operation on Moral sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
than their Adversaries; yea and those that account it Fanaticism to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any other gift of Prayer from the Spirit but what is given morally by
use.) And the contrary Doctrine feigneth God to Work even constantly by
Miracle: And as the Papists make every Mass-Priest a Miracle Worker in
Transubstantiation, so do they that make the bare saying over the Words and
doing the outward Acts in the Sacrament, to save us <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> and
the Pastoral teaching and oversight of an ignorant drunken Lad or Reader
to be (near) as great a help to Salvation, as the Ministry of a wise skilful, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and exemplary Pastor, and the clear affectionate Preaching of Gods word:
And that tell us (as Mr. <hi>Dodwell)</hi> how sufficient a man is to administer the
Sacramental Covenant that understands what a Covenant is in matters of
Common Conversation.</p>
               <p>XXXI. If a Wise and Skilful and Conscionable Ministry be as needless to
Edification and Salvation as some Men pretend, it is as needless that they
should study to be such, and vain to Glory that they are such, and that the
Church of <hi>England</hi> hath such a Ministry, and vain to expect that men should
pay them any more respect than I owed my Master that never preacht but
once, and that drunken; (and divers very like him.) Or that they should
use this as an argument to draw men to hear them.</p>
               <p>XXXII. If the King or Law should settle a Physician of his (or a Patrons)
choice in every Parish, it were well done if it be but to have help at hand
for Volunteers: But if he command all to use them and to use no other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them or against them, where unskilful or untrustly men are placed, no
man is bound to obey this command: NO mens Law can dissolve the Law
of Nature, nor disoblige a man from a due care of his Life, nor bind him to
cast it away upon Obedience to ignorant or bad and treacherous Men. And
a mans Soul is more precious than his Health or Life; and he is bound to
greater care of it; and is no more to trust it on the will of his Superiours
How vast is the difference between an ignorant rash Physician or Pastor, and
one that is wife, experienced and trusty? They that scorn Men for going
for <hi>greater edification</hi> from one to another, do not so if a man prefer a skilful
Physician to one that kills more than he cures; or a skilful and careful Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
for his Son, yea or a Farrier for his Horse.</p>
               <p>XXXIII. If one Preacher be not for Edification to be great<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> preferred
before another, then <hi>One Book</hi> is not: And so it's no matter what Book they
read or value; and what a Student will this make? And what a Trade for
the Booksellers? And why then should their own Books be so valued? And
why then do they silence hundreds or thousands and forbid them to preach
on pain of ruine, (thô no false Doctrine be proved against them) if they
think not that the difference is very great.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:59353:16"/>
XXXIV. When Councils hereticated and condemned Thousands or Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds
of Priests and Bishops, whom Christian Emperours and Princes owned
as Orthodox, they did not then think every Patron, Prince or Prelate a
competent Judge with what Pastor Men should trust the conduct of their
Souls: Nor did they think so that forbad men hearing fornicators; Nor
<hi>Cyprian</hi> that required the People to forsake <hi>Basilides</hi> and <hi>Martial (&amp; Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catorem
Praepositum.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>XXXV. So full was the proof given in the Book called, <hi>The first Plea</hi> for
<hi>Peace,</hi> that the Church from the beginning denyed Princes and Magistrates
to be entrusted with the choice of Bishops, or Pastors to whom the Churches
were bound to trust the conduct of their Souls, that he who denyeth it, is
not worthy to be therein disputed with. And yet we doubt not but they
may force Infidel Subjects and Catechumens to hear sound and setled Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and Catechists; And may dispose of the Tythes, Temples and many
other Accidents of the Church; and may drive on Pastors and People to their
Duty.</p>
               <p>XXXVI. It is false Doctrine that <hi>two distinct Churches</hi> may not be in the
same Precincts or City; This being a meer Accident which abundance of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
make unnecessary and unlawful: Which I shall prove.</p>
               <p>That which is no where commanded by God, is no duty: But that
there shall be but one Church (or Bishop) in the same Precincts, is not
commanded of God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> &amp;c. (Divine of Gods making.)</p>
               <p>They own the Major in the case of <hi>Indifferent</hi> thing. If they deny the
Minor let the affirmers prove any such command. We grant a command of
Love and Concord, and a prohibition of all that is against them. But in
many instances, to have several Churches in the same precincts, is not against
them.</p>
               <p>If they fly to the Canons of foreign Councils, the reason of them we shall
weigh and duely regard; But they were National, and had their Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Power only from their own Princes and their Counselling Power only
from Christ: And we disown all foreign Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>XXXVII. In all these Cases following (and more) two Churches may
be in the same precincts (yea and a City.)</p>
               <p>1. In Case that several Bishops are called justly to dwell in the same City,
or Diocess, and many of their Flock be with them, <hi>e.g.</hi> Many Bishops of
<hi>England</hi> dwell long, yea mostly in <hi>London</hi> or in <hi>London</hi> Diocess: <hi>e. g.</hi> The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Eli</hi> dwells in the Parish of St. <hi>Andrews Holbourn: Qu.</hi> Whether
there he be a Subject to Dr. <hi>Stilling sleet</hi> as his Pastor, and bound to obey
him? or whether many out of his Diocess (thousands) may not as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
dwell half the Year in <hi>London</hi> as he? And whether when he preacheth
to them, he do it not as their Bishop (in <hi>London</hi> Diocess.) And so of many
other Bishops that here reside.</p>
               <p>XXXVIII. 2. Either our Parish Churches are true Churches, or not. If
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59353:16"/>
not, the Separatists are so far in the right; And separate not from true
Churches <hi>eo nomine</hi> because they separate from them. If yea, then many
Churches are in the same City and Diocess. (Of their agreement and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
on the same Bishop I shall speak anon.)</p>
               <p>XXXIX. 3. In case that in one City there be resident Stranges, that are
sent on Embassies, or live for Merchandize, or flee from Miseries, and are
the Subject of other Princes, whose Laws and Customs they are under, <hi>e. g.</hi>
At <hi>Frankford, Hamburgh, Middleburgh, Dantzick, Const<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

been English distinct lawful Churches: And in <hi>London</hi> there are <hi>Dutch</hi> and
<hi>French</hi> Churches: And if the King allowed a <hi>Swedish</hi> Church, a <hi>Danish</hi>
Church, a <hi>Saxon</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with their several Bishops, who is so weak
as to need proof that this is lawful, and they true Churches?</p>
               <p>XL. 4. In case men of different Language are not capable of mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
by personal communion or help: As <hi>Dutch, French, Italian, Greeks,
Germans,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (oft in <hi>Dissert,</hi> and <hi>Annot.)</hi> do
maintain that <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> had a Church of <hi>Jews,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> a Church of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi>
And that the like distribution of Churches of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> there
was at <hi>Antioch, Alexandria</hi> and other places: And by this they Salve the
Contradictions in Church History about the Succession of <hi>Linus, Cletus</hi> and
<hi>Clemens:</hi> And the Apostles setled not a sinful Church way.</p>
               <p>XLI. 5. Yea <hi>Grotius</hi> maintaineth that the Apostles setled the Churches at
first not like the Jewish Priesthood, but in the order of their Synagogues;
<hi>(de Imper. sum. Patest.</hi> and in <hi>Annot.)</hi> And that as there were divers Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
in a great City with their <hi>Archisynagogus</hi> and Elders, so there were
divers Churches in a City with Bishops and Presbyters.</p>
               <p>XLII. 6. When there are a greater number of Persons in one City o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
precinct than can have any just personal Knowledge and Communion, and
more than any one Bishop with his Presbytery can perform the needful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storal
oversight to, it is lawful and a duty, to gather another Church in that
City or Precinct: But this is truly the Case of many great Cities, though
wordly Wisdom have at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other places oft denyed notorious evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and experience. He that will gather up all the duties that Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
saith were charged on the Bishops (in his Annotations on all the Texts
that name Elders and Bishops) if he can believe that any Bishop can perform
the tenth part of them to all in the Diocess of <hi>London, York, Lincoln, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi>
&amp;c. I will not dispute against him if he maintain a Bishops U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iquity,
or that at once he can be in twenty places. But if they say, that what then
was commanded them to do personally, they may do by others, I say, that
if they may change the <hi>Work,</hi> they may change the <hi>Power,</hi> that specifieth
the Office; and so it is not the same Office in <hi>specie</hi> instituted in Scripture:
And then Lay-men may have Power to preach and administer Sacraments,
and do the Office of Priest, and yet be no Priest (as Civilians do of Bishops)
which is a Contradiction. Certainly if there be more Scholars in the City
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59353:17"/>
than one Master can Teach and Rule, it is no Schism to set up more Schools
and Schoolmasters, but a duty. And if the Lord Mayor on pretence of City
Government should put down but as great a part of Family Government,
as those Diocesans do of Parochial Church Goverment, who allow none
under them to be truly <hi>Episcopi Grigis,</hi> and have the power of their Church
Keyes, I think that it were no Sch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m to restore Families so that the City
might have more than one (entirely.)</p>
               <p>XLIII. 7. If the Soveraign Power upon Politick or Religious Reasons
should determine, that <hi>e. g.</hi> Dr. <hi>A,</hi> and Dr. <hi>B,</hi> and Dr. <hi>C.</hi> shall all be
Bishops in <hi>London,</hi> to such Volunteers of Clergy and Laity as shall choose
each of them to be their Bishop, and this without altering their dwellings,
no man can prove it sinful; And of his reasons the King is judge.</p>
               <p>XLIV. 8. If the Bishop or Clergy of a City, Diocess or Nation, do agree
by Law or Canon to admit none to the Ministry or Communion that will
not commit a known sin deliberately as the Condition of his Communion,
it is a duty to congregate under other Pastors in those prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>cts. This is
confest: If they should not only hold any errour, or practise sin, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
men to subscribe and approve it, and say it is no sin, no man ought to
do this; nor yet to live like an Atheist, and forsake all Worship because
men forbid him, if it were but to subscribe one untruth: But alas, this is no
rare Case: In one Emperours Reign all were Anathematized that subscribed
not to the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and quickly after all that did, or that would
not renounce it: The same division and changes were made by the Councils
against and for the Monothelites, <hi>de tribus Captrulis,</hi> Images, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when
all Men living have many Errours, and the Church of <hi>England</hi> disclaimeth
her Infallibility, and yet will receive no Minister that will not subscribe that
there is nothing in her Books contrary to the word of God, the Case is hard.
But when all the things mentioned in the <hi>Plea for Peace</hi> are proved lawful,
we shall be more yielding in this Case.</p>
               <p>XLV. 9. If true and sound Christians mistakingly think one or many things
to be heinous sins, (as Perjury, Lying, Renouncing Obedience to God,
and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> which are things indifferent, but of so great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that most Learned and Godly and Willing Men cannot discern the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and agree, and yet are not necessary nor just conditions of Ministry
or Communion, and so it is the Imposer that entangleth them by difficulty
in their dissent, it is not lawful for these men therefore to forbear all Church
Worship, but mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t use it as they can.</p>
               <p>XLVI. 10. If any Church unjustly excommunicate such men; or others,
they must not forbear all Church order and worship because men so excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
them. No man must Sin to escape Excommunication; and every
man in the World is a sinner; And therefore all the World must be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
if all Sinners must be so. As I before said, the times oft were
when almost all the Bishops in the Empire were excommunicated by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59353:17"/>
Councils and Popes have oft excommunicated some for trifles and some
for Truth and Duty. And such must not therefore renounce all Church
Worship and Communion.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> do by their standing Law <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
all (as aforesaid) that affirm any thing to be repugnant to Gods Word
or sinful, in their whole Church Government, Articles, Liturgy and Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
and so to stand till they Publickly revoke this as a wicked Errour.
Now many Lords and Commoners in Parliaments, have spoken against some
of these particulars; and some out of Parliament: Many Ministers have
done the like when the King Commissioned them to treat for Alterations;
And many when the Accusations or demands of others have called them to
give a Reason of their Actions. Some have maintained that it is repugnant
to Gods word that Lay Civilians should have the decretive Power of the
Keyes, and that the Parish Minister must cast out of Communnion all that the
Lay Doctors or Chancellors excommunicate, and all that dare not receive
kneeling, and that they should deny Christendom to all that scruple the
English sort of God-Fathers Covenants, and the transient Symbolical Image
of the Cross, with abundance such things: Now all these are <hi>ipso sacto</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate.
And thô they be not bound to avoid the Church till this be
applicatorily declared, yet <hi>actually excommunicate</hi> they are, and that by a
higher authority than the Bishops; and they know the Churches decree; and
the Priests are sworn to Canonical Obedience; And he that will not temp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
them to be forsworn, nor come into a Church that hath excommunicated him,
seems therein excuseable: But must he therefore renounce the Church of God?</p>
               <p>XLVII. 11. If the People are so set against one Bishop for another, as that
half being for one and half for the other, and both Orthodox, they cannot be

Atheists.</p>
               <p>XLVIII. 12. An undetermined accident must be so determined as most

divers Churches shall promiscuously live in the same City or Diocess or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish,

one of these to be a true Church, and which is it?</p>

men (as <hi>Frankford</hi> did) to set up a Church of the English Form and Liturgy,
I think few Prelatists would deny it to be lawful.</p>

when I was licensed twenty years ago, at <hi>Christmas,</hi> as I was Preaching, some
Lime or Stone fell down in the Steeple with the crowd, the Church being
old and under suspicion, they all thought it was falling, and most ran out
in tumult, and some cast themselves headlong from the Gallery for hast;
when they were quieted and came in again, the Boyes in the Chancel broke
a Wainscot Skreen with climbing on it, and the noise made them run out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
one old woman going out, cryed, It's just with God because I took
not the first warning, Lord forgive me, and I'le never come again: Quere,
Whether these, or at least this resolving Woman was a Schismatick, and
separated from the Catholick Church?</p>
               <p>If not, there is some separation that is not so bad as Murder; and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
the Doctor should forgive it for the success; for the Parish hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
resolved to pull down the Church and build it new, a far better Fabrick
where the Dr. now Preacheth; and it drove me away that I preacht there
no more; Whether this new Church built where the old one had possession
before, be not a Schismatical Separatist, I leave to him.</p>
               <p>LII. 2. <hi>Local</hi> Separation without <hi>Mental</hi> can make no culpable Schism;
for <hi>Nil nisi Volunt artum est morale;</hi> if a man be imprisoned or be sick and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

this half year, much against my will, O that God would heal me of this
Separation!</p>
               <p>LIII. 3. If it must be <hi>mental Separation</hi> that must be culpable, then it is
diversified according to the mental degree and kind; and no man separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
from the universal Church who separateth not from somewhat <hi>essential
to</hi> it; to separate from its <hi>Integrals</hi> or <hi>Accidents</hi> may be culpable, but it's no
<hi>Separation from the Church,</hi> no more than every breach of the Law is a Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

               <p>LIV. 4. Some separate as to place, locally and not mentally, some men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally

Faith, Hope or essential Duty, separateth indeed. All those men that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believingly,
atheistically, wickedly, that in their converse prate against the
Scripture and immortality of the Soul, and that hate and persecute serious
Godliness, are damnably separated from Christ, and therefore from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick

General Councils, Monasteries, Parish Churches distinct from Cathedrals,

of <hi>England,</hi> he separateth not from that Church, though he refuse that which
is its Accidents, or some Integral parts: We are charg'd with separating
from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if it were a matter of fact beyond dispute,
and scorn'd for denying it, even by them that will not tell us what they mean
by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or by <hi>Separation.</hi> By the Church of <hi>England</hi> we

living in one land, under one Christian <hi>King who Governeth them by the Sword,</hi>
which includeth their Concord among themselves in true Christianity; we
are Christians, we profess agreement in Christianity with all Christians
we are under the same King as they are, and profess subjection, and take;
the same Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy; yea, we are not charged with
differing in any thing called Doctrinal from their Thirty Nine Articles; but
we disown certain late Covenants and Oaths which are not Twenty three
Years old, and the Subscription to one Canon about the Innocency of all in
their Liturgy; now either these new Oaths, Covenants and Canon, Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and Ceremonies are essential to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or not; If yea,
then, 1. It's a poor humane Church, made by them that made these Oaths,
Liturgy and Ceremonies. 2. And then it's a new upstart Church, and no
man can answer the Papists where it was before <hi>Luther,</hi> or before <hi>Henry</hi> 8.
yea, if its essentials were made by this King and Parliament, 1662. then
the present Church is no older: But if these things be <hi>indifferent,</hi> or <hi>not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>
to the Church, then to separate only from these, is not to separate from
the Church.</p>
               <p>If it be said, <hi>That for the sake of these we separate from the Church it self, and

it: If we separate from the Church essentially, it is either <hi>Locally</hi> or <hi>Mental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi>

not <hi>Mentally,</hi> for we own it for a true Christian Kingdom, called <hi>a National
Church,</hi> bound to serve Christ in Love and Concord to their Power: We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

title, and the qualification and right of a single man; and my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is, that if such a title were tryed before our Judges or King, and they
should mistake and give Judgment against him that had right, this were no
separating from Christ, nor proof that they are Infidels.</p>
               <p>LXXI. 21. If the Case of two contending Bishops or Presbyters come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a General or Provincial Council, and they mistake and give it to the
wrong, and so separate from the right, I do not think that thereby they se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from Christ or the Church Catholick, <hi>e.g.</hi> The Constantinopolitan
Council first gave the Church of <hi>Constantinople</hi> to <hi>Nazianzene,</hi> and after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him out as having no right; if by this they separated from Christ, they
that take them for the Catholick Church representative, must say that the
Catholick Church separated from Christ and it self.</p>
               <p>When another Council wrongfully deposed <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and separated
from him, and <hi>Cyril Alexandr.</hi> perswaded the continuance of it, did the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Church separate from it self and Christ? If a General Council which
should be wisest, be excusable from damning Schism, whenever it misjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and separateth from a rightful Bishop, sure every Lay-man and woman
that doth the same, doth not separate from Christ.</p>
               <p>If it prove that a General Council deposed <hi>Nestorius</hi> as unjustly as <hi>David
Derodon</hi> thought, or <hi>Dioscorus</hi> as unjustly as others thought, or <hi>Flavian</hi> as
unjustly as the Orthodox think, this proveth them Guilty of some Schism,
but not of separating from the universal Church.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Menna</hi> of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and the Pope excommunicated each other,
when a Synod in <hi>Italy</hi> renounced <hi>Vigilius,</hi> and all his Successors were an
hundred y<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>rs deposed from their Primacy, and a Patriarch at <hi>Aquileia</hi> set
up in his stead for a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> because <hi>Vigilius</hi> subscribed to a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Council, <hi>de tribus Capitulis,</hi> this was Schism (somewhere) but not
separating from Christ.</p>
               <p>LXXII. 22. If a man in <hi>England</hi> should think that all the old Councils
were obligatory, which decree that he shall be taken for no Bishop that comes
in by the choice (yea or Mediation) of Courtiers, Princes or great men,
or any that have not the true Consent of Clergy and People, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
should conclude that Bishops, Deans, Prebends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so chosen and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
are Lay-men and no true Bishops and Pastors, this were a separating
from <hi>those Persons,</hi> but not from <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Vniversal Church,</hi> when as
Mr. <hi>Thorndike</hi> saith, that <hi>till the right</hi> of <hi>Electing</hi> Bishops <hi>by the Clergy</hi> and
<hi>People be restored, we need look no further for the reason of the Contempt of Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy
here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So if a man think that God never trusted every Ignorant Wicked man that
can but get Money and buy an Advowson, to choose those Pastors to whose
conduct all the People are bound to trust their Souls, (and the Bishop to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:59353:21"/>
them for fear of a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> if they have but a Certificate and can
speak Latine) This is not damning Separation.</p>
               <p>LXXIII. 23. If a Bishop set up a seeming Convert, really a Papist <hi>(e.g.</hi>
Mr. <hi>Hutchinson</hi> alias <hi>Berry,</hi> or one of them that lately Confessed themselves
Papists,) the People that find by experience what the man is, are not damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Schismaticks for not taking him for their Pastor, or for going from
him.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> Bishop of <hi>Gloucester</hi> was a Papist, did he separate from
Christ that separated from the Diocesan Church of <hi>Glouc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>LXXVI. 26. If the Law command all to take one man for his Pastor, and
a Parent command his Child, or a Husband his Wife to take another and
not that, and the Child or Wife know not which should be obeyed, and
whether the choice belong more to the Domestick, or the Publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it is not a separating from Christ, which way ever such an one shall
go.</p>
               <p>LXXVII. 27. Yea if I should think that self-Interest and self-Government
bind me rather to choose a Pastor for my self, than to stand to such a choice
by Prince, Patron or Prelate, which I think intolerable, as well as (against
their will) I may choose a Wife, or a Physician, or a Tutor, or a Book, or

               <p>LXXVIII. 28. If owning the same Diocesan make them of one Church

Church who differ less. But, <hi>&amp;c. Jesuites, Dominicans, Jansenists,</hi> and all
the Sects of Papists are taken for one Church, because they own the Pope
and Councils. In <hi>England</hi> the Diocesan Conformists are taken for one

               <p>LXXX. 30. If a Bishop in any Diocess in <hi>London</hi> should openly write or
plead for a Foreign Jurisdiction, and we are told that none are true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59353:22"/>
that depend not obediently on the Bishop, he that for fear of the
Law, or of Personal or common perjury, should separate from that
Bishop and his numerical Diocesan Church, doth thereby neither separate
from the Catholick Church, nor from the Church of <hi>England.</hi> As if the
Kings Army should have a Colonel that declared himself an obliged Subject
to the King of <hi>France</hi> and bound to obey him, the Regiment may forsake
that Colonel. Yea if the General of the Kings Army should give up himself
in subjection to the Enemy or a Foreign Power, and say, I <hi>will take a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
from the Turk,</hi> and my <hi>Officers shall only obey me,</hi> and the <hi>Soldiers</hi> obey
them, were not this an Army of Traytors or Rebels, though none but the
General took a Commission from the Enemy? So if the Bishops should all
take Commissions from the Pope, or declare themselves Subjects to a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Jurisdiction, it were no separating from Christ, to separate from
them all, in Loyalty to Christ, and to avoid National perjury and
Schism.</p>

means of Salvation, and live in a Church that wilfully omitteth any

or Preaching, or the Lords Supper, or all Personal care, and discipline to
exclude the grosly intolerable, to resolve the doubting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He that in

City) that omitteth none of these, is no damned Schismatick.</p>

Worshipping God in a Church that will receive him: Nor any one that is

half as many and great Sins as the Nonconformists have said they fear (in
the first Plea for Peace, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LXXXIII. 33. If a Foreigner that doth but half understand our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,

obeying God and Nature is no damning Schism.</p>
               <p>LXXXIV. 34. If one that is erroneously conceited of the obligation of
General Councils, should think it a sin to kneel at the Sacrament on any

because Tradition and the twentieth Canon of the first Council, and that at

and whether they had power to repeal the Canons of the greatest Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
without a Council. Sure they that are for such Councils universal so<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veraignty,
when they have cast men into these snares, should scarce tell them
that they are damnable Schismaticks, for joyning with such Churches as obey
these Councils, rather than with those that ruine men for not disobeying
them.</p>
               <p>LXXXIV. And now Reader if thou art one that thinkest of these things
with Christian Sobriety and impartiality, I appeal to thee whether if I
should be of the mind of Mr. <hi>Dodwell,</hi> and such self-conceited <hi>Resolvers,</hi>
I should not write my own Condemnation, and be one of the grossest
Schismaticks that any History hath mentioned, unless ever there were any
man so mad as to hold himself to be all the Church: Yea, when he no more
distinguisheth of Separation and Schism, but involves almost all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in his Condemnation, and tells us that Schism will damn us as soon
as Adultery and Murder, is it not obvious for all men to infer that we are
as <hi>odious</hi> as <hi>Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Murderers?</hi> and doth he not Preach Christians

number is that these men damn, and how few on Earth in any Age they
excuse from being so far like Murderers.</p>
               <p>LXXXV. 1. It seems to me that he <hi>virtually</hi> damneth all Christians on
Earth as such Schismaticks; for it is most certain that all men have sin,
and culpable imperfection in Knowledge, Will and Practice; and if any
say, <hi>That he hath no sin, he is a Lyar,</hi> saith St. <hi>John;</hi> and it is certain that
all two persons on Earth have many errours, and many differences from
one another; it is certain that the Love and Duty of Christians towards
each other is culpably defective in all men: It is certain that no man living

the Name of <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Lawful Churches</hi> besides those allowed by Law,
though the King should License them.</p>
               <p>16. The twelfth Canon <hi>ipso facto</hi> excommunicateth all, that <hi>make Rules
and Orders in Causes Ecclesiastical without the Kings Authority, and submit to them,</hi>
e. g. All that without the King authority agree to turn the Table Altar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
to require People to kneel at the Rails, or to bow toward the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or East, or to set up Organs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All these are now excommunicate
by an Authority above the Bishops, which no Bishop or Priest can dispense
with (but only forbear to publish and execute it, but not nullifie it) no
nor absolve any that publickly repent not of it as a wicked Errour.</p>
               <p>16. By Canon fourteenth if any Minister shall <hi>diminish</hi> any part of the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Rites, Ceremonies,</hi> Prayers, <hi>&amp;c. in regard of Preaching or ANY</hi> OTHER
RESPECT, or shall <hi>adde any thing in matter or form,</hi> (e. g. If he let the
Parent <hi>express</hi> the <hi>dedication</hi> of his <hi>Child to God,</hi> or lay any charge on any
Parent) he breaketh the Church Law, and so far separateth from it.</p>
               <p>17. By Canon fifteenth when twenty or thirty thousand are commanded to
come to a Church that cannot receive six thousand, and the Alleys and
Pewes are wedg'd so that they cannot all kneel, yet all that kneel not at
the Prayers, and all that say <hi>not audibly</hi> the <hi>Confession, Lords Prayer, Creed</hi>
and <hi>Responses,</hi> disobey the Laws of the Church, and so far separate from
it.</p>
               <p>18. When twenty thousand Persons are commanded to come in more
than can, if ten thousand of them (or any number) should come to the
Church-yard or Porch, to shew that they are not presentable, but would
yet in if they could, the nineteenth Canon commands to drive them away.</p>
               <p>19. The Liturgy and Canon 22. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> bind all under the penalty of
the Law to receive the Sacrament thrice every year: If a secret Infidel,
sadducel, Hobbist, Socinian, or any Heretick say, <hi>I am not able to charge
my judgment, which is inconsistent with the Sacrament,</hi> or if one whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells him of the guilt of Adultery, and that he is not resolved to confess
and forsake it yet; or one that by Melancholy causelessly feareth unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
receiving to damnation; I say, if any of these will avoid the charge of

at their command. And yet all notorious Offenders are prohibited it Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

be perjured in <hi>England</hi> in City and Countrey, as many fear, it's a very
great number that are uncapable of Communion with the Church.</p>
               <p>20. By Canon twenty seventh on pain of Suspension no <hi>Minister must wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fingly
administer the Communion to any but such as Kneel, or to any that refuse to be
present at publick Prayers,</hi> &amp;c. So that all that Kneel not in receiving are rejected,
and if they worship God elsewhere, must be taken for Schismaticks, as dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
as adulterers or murderers.</p>
               <p>21. The twenty eighth Canon forbids admitting strangers to Communion,
and commands sending them home to their Parish Churches: It's disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to violate this.</p>
               <p>22. <hi>The twenty ninth Canon forbids</hi> urging Parents to be Present when their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are baptized, and admitting them to Answer as Godfathers for their own Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
and any Godfather to make any <hi>other Answer</hi> or speech <hi>than the</hi> prescribed.</p>
               <p>23. The thirtieth Canon describeth the Cross as a Sacrament, as seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
to us.</p>
               <p>34. By the thirty sixth Canon no man must be a Minister that subscribeth:
not that the Book of <hi>Common Prayer and Ordination contains nothing in it contrary
to the Word of God,</hi> and that <hi>he himself will use no other form in publick Prayer and
administration of the Sacraments:</hi> By which all that refuse this, or that use the
forms made and imposed by the Bishops on occasions of publick Fasts and
Thanksgivings, seem all to be under disobedience to the Church.</p>
               <p>35. By Canon fourty ninth no Person not Licensed as a Preacher, may <hi>in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Cure or elsewhere, expound any Scripture, or Matter or Doctrine,</hi> but onely shall
study to read plainly the Homilies: So that all Ministers before Licence to
preach, all School-masters, all Parents, or Masters, that do expound to
their Schollars, Children or Servants, the meaning of Baptism, or of any
Article of the Creed, any Petition of the Lords Prayer, any one of the
Ten Commandments (to fit them for Confirmation, or Salvation) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than by plain reading the Homilies or Church Catechism, doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey
the Law of the Church: And so do all Tutors in the Universities that
expound any Scripture, matter or Doctrine to their Pupils, before they
are examined or approved by the Bishop; or any Judge on the Bench or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
that presumeth to do it to the hearers, or any Friend or Neighbour in
discourse: For it is <hi>[No Person whatsoever not examined and approved by the
Bishop of the Diocess.]</hi> How few in <hi>England</hi> separate not from the Church as
far as this disobedience amounts to? If by [no <hi>Persons]</hi> be meant only
<hi>[no Ministers]</hi> it's hard enough, that Ministers may not be allowed out of
the Church what Lay-men are allowed.</p>
               <p>36. All those that deny not the validity of Baptism or the Lords Supper
when they are done by an unpreaching Minister, but yet think that a man
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:59353:26"/>
utterly unable to Teach otherwise than by Reading, may not lawfully be
encouraged in so high a function, (any more than a man in Physick or School-teaching
that hath not necessary skill, or is utterly illiterate,) and thinks
it a sin to consent to take such an Ignorant fellow for the Pastor of his Soul
if he can have better; If this man, I say, go to the next Parish Church for
Sacraments, he is to be suspended first and next excommunicate: Special<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
if he should judge that Ignorant Reader, no true Minister for want of
necessary capacity.</p>

               <p>38. By Canon thirty eighth no Minister must <hi>refuse or delay</hi> to Christen any
Child (without exception) <hi>according to the form</hi> of the <hi>Common Prayer, that's
brought to Church to him on Sundaies or Holy-daies,</hi> though the Parents be both
<hi>Jewes</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> or Atheists or Sadducees: The Minister must be suspended
that refuseth it.</p>
               <p>39. The seventy first Canon suspendeth all <hi>Ministers that Preach in any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
house</hi> (except to the sick or impotent in time of necessity.) By which had
<hi>Paul</hi> here preached publickly and from house to house, or <hi>Timothy in season</hi>
and <hi>out of season</hi> as dreadfully adjured, or Christ preacht as he oft did,
they must be suspended: And every Minister that preacheth to his Family:
And no doubt, repeating his Sermon, is preaching the same again.</p>
               <p>40. All <hi>Ministers</hi> must be <hi>suspended</hi> and then <hi>excommunicate,</hi> that <hi>without the
Bishops Licence appoint or keep any solemn Fasts publickly or in private houses, other
than by Law appointed, or be wittingly present at any:</hi> Thought it were in time
of Plague, or when divers of his Neighbours are sick or troubled in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,

Houses and Chappels: He is not to be trusted to fast and pray with
his own Flock or Friends, or come among them, lest being excommunicate
he be a damn'd Schismatick.</p>
               <p>The same prohibition is for <hi>holding meetings for Sermons called Exercises:</hi>
Which Arch-Bishop <hi>Grindall</hi> was zealous to set up, (<hi>Q.</hi> Was he then a

               <p>56. The Principles of Mr. <hi>Dodwel</hi> and his Associates condemn the Church
of <hi>England</hi> as Schismatical, 1. Those that claim Succession from <hi>Rome,</hi>
whose own Succession hath been oft and long interrupted, by incapacities
and Schisms. 2. For holding Communion with those Protestant Churches

that they would have them and cannot? And why cannot they?</p>
               <p>58. Their Principles make the Bishop of <hi>Oxford, Br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>l,</hi> &amp;c. Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
For their Dioceses are Churches taken out of Churches, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
parts of other Dioceses.</p>
               <p>59. And they condemn all the Parish Churches in <hi>England</hi> as Churches
distinct from Cathedrals: For they are all Churches gathered out of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es:
At first the Cathedrals were the only single Churches: Next Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were gathered; and next our Parish Churches. And the Parish Church
of <hi>Covent-garden,</hi> is a Church taken out of a Church.</p>
               <p>60. Their Principles damn St. <hi>Martin</hi> that separated to the death from
all the Bishops Synods and them that were near him (save one Man) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they perswaded <hi>Maximus</hi> to use the Sword against <hi>Priscillian <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
and brought men of strict Religion under Suspicion of Priscillianism: And
sure the ruined persecuted Protestants here, are more Orthodox than the
<hi>Priscillians.</hi> And they damn <hi>Gildas</hi> that told the English Clergy, that
he was not <hi>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

disgrace the many Churches dedicated to the Memory of St. <hi>Martin,</hi> if he
be a damned man?) I doubt they damn <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for local angry
separating from each other: Whatever they do by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> for
the Separation blamed <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>61. If all are Schismaticks that here conform not, all those called Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formists
are such, that conform to the words in a false sence.</p>
               <p>62. They separate from all that obey the twentieth Canon of the Nicene
Council: And from all that obey the Councils that forbid communicating
with a Fornicating Priest: And from all that obey the Councils which nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
the Episcopacy of such as are obtruded by Magistrates, or not consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to by the Clergy and People. And many more such.</p>
               <p>Abundance more instances of their Separation, and Damnation, I might
adde: In a word, I think their Principles are, as I first said, for damning
and separating from all men living; for all men living are gulity of some
sort and degree of Schism, that is, of Errours, Principles or Practices in
which they culpably Violate that Union and Concord that should be among
Christians and Churches: Every defect of Christian Love, and every sinful
Errour, is some degree of such a violation. All Christians differ in as great
matters as things indifferent: And no man living knoweth all things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
to be such: And these men distinguish not of Schism, nor will take
notice of the necessary distinctions given (in the third Part of the Treatise
of Church Concord,) And <hi>solu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

make us understand what sort of Separation it is that they fasten on, but
talk of Separation in general, as aforesaid.</p>
               <p>LXXXVII. They seem to be themselves deceived by the Papists in expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of <hi>Cyprians</hi> words <hi>de Vnit. Eccles. Vnus est Episcopatus,</hi> &amp;c. But they
themselves seem to separate from <hi>Cyprian</hi> as a Schismatick, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

others, nulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ying all their Baptisms, Ordinations and Communions: And
for this errour they declared against the Judgment of the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
and other Churches; and they were for it condemned as Schismaticks by
the said Bishop: And here is a far wider Separation than we can be charged
with. 2. And <hi>Cyprians</hi> words came from the Mind that was possest with
these opinions, and are expressive of his Inclination. 3. Yet they are
true and good, understood as he himself oft expounds them; the Bishop of

of Bishops; and limiting every man to his own Province, and saying that
they were to give account to none but God, with much the like.</p>

that all Bishops go to make up one Politick Governing Aristocracie, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

As the Catholick Church is one, whose welfare all Bishops ought

Concord. 4. And as effects, all are from <hi>one efficient institutor.</hi> As
it may be said that all <hi>official Magistracy</hi> in <hi>England</hi> is one: 1. As from one
King or <hi>summa potestas:</hi> 2. As described by one Law, and as Justices of
one <hi>Species:</hi> 3. As all their Cities and Counties and Hundreds are but part
of one Kingdom, whose welfare all are for: 4. And as they are all bound
to keep as much common Concord as they can; if any mean more, they
should tell us what: If any mean that all Bishops make one numerical Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Government, they are heinous Schismaticks, and the Kingdom is Sworn
against their Judgment: And these Men da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The truth is, <hi>Cyprian de Vnitate Ecclesiae</hi> (leaving out the Papists additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
is a good Book, and worthy to be read of all; and take <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s
Description of the Episcopacy of the Church which we must unite with, and
the nature of that Union, and we would rejoyce in such. But if <hi>Cyprian</hi>
had lived to see either <hi>Arians</hi> or <hi>Donatists</hi> the greater number, or any Sect
after call themselves the Church because that Princes set them up, and had
seen them depose <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and such other, doubtless he would never have
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:59353:28"/>
pleaded the Unity of Episcopacy for this, but have judged as he did in the
Case of <hi>Martial</hi> and <hi>Basilides;</hi> nor did he ever plead for an universal hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Soveraignty.</p>
               <p>LXXXVIII. If we are damned Schismaticks, I can imagine no pretended
manner of Separation in which our Schism consists, but first, either Local
as such. 2. Or Mental, as such. 3. Or Local, caused by Mental.</p>
               <p>If Local, as such be it: All Christians are Schismaticks, for being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally
separated from others, and absent from all Churches and places save
one.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Mental Separation</hi> be it, either all <hi>Mental Division</hi> is such, or but some
only; if <hi>all,</hi> then all mortall men are Schismaticks, as differing in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude

most, that do as the Bishops did against the Priscillianists, bring godly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

those that approve of their Communion and come to them: Joyning with
you signifyeth that they are of your way therein; But will you go to <hi>their
Churches</hi> and <hi>Communicate</hi> with them? You will receive the damned Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
if they come to you, when yet you make it damnable to joyn in
their meetings with them. This quibbling beseems not grave men in great
matters.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Reader, God having allowed more Legislative Power to
men in things <hi>Secular</hi> than in Religion, I may say this case is like ours in
debate.</p>
               <p>I. Some Judges and Lawyers say, that the Oath of Allegiance makes a
Subject in this Kingdom; that the <hi>Renouncing</hi> or Violating it by <hi>Treason,</hi>
or <hi>Rebellion,</hi> or <hi>deserting the Kingdom,</hi> overthrows the Relation. But that
other particular faults or quarrels against Neighbours, Justices, Judges,
yea the King himself, are punishable according to the Laws, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t are not all
Rebellion, nor dissolve Subjection, nor oblige the Subjects to renounce ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
converse with each other; though some contempt and obstinacy may
outlaw them. Such is our Judgment of Church Relation and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I need not rehearse.</p>
               <p>II. Suppose a fect of Lawyers and Judges arise, that say, no men are
the Kings Subjects, but are Rebels, that break any of his Laws, that Shoot
not in long Bows, that Bury not their dead in Woollen, that swear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanely,
that eat flesh in <hi>Lent</hi> unlicensed, that have any unjust Law-Suit,
that wrong any Neighbour, that oppress any Poor man, all these are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels;
yea all that plead opposite Causes at the Bar, and all Judges that
judge contrary to one another, and all that misunderstand any point of
Law and Practice accordingly, and all that besides the Oath of Allegiance
do constitute Marriages, Families, Schools, Societyes by any other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
of their own, and all that are of different Cities and Companies, parts
of the Kingdom, or all whose Justices, Mayors, Sheriffs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> differ from
one another in any point of Law and practice: Or all that obey not every
Constable and Justice; or that go to divers Justices in the same Precincts,
or that go from one Justice to another to avoid unrighteous Judgment, or
that go from the Physician of the Place for Health, and from the Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Town for greater edification, or that Travel beyond Sea for
Knowledge, yea all that understand not every word in the Law, that may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
them: If any say, none of these are the Kings Subjects, but Rebels, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to him and one another, and deserve to be all hang'd as Murderers, and
so are all that have Communion with them; <hi>Quaere,</hi> 1. Whether these men
are for the Unity of <hi>England?</hi> 2. And are Friends to the King that deprive
him of all his Subjects; as much as those that would have him have no
Subjects, that be not of the same Age, Stature, Complexion and Wit
3. And whether they are Friends to Mankind? 4. And whether they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:59353:31"/>
condemn not themselves if they live not as Anchorets, out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Society. 5. And whether that Nation be not by infatuation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for Destruction that would believe them, and would hate, scorn
and ruine them that are of the first mentioned opinion, according to
the saying, <hi>Quos perdere vult Jupiter, hos dementat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the more dangerous Doctrine now threatning this Land, that
would subject <hi>England</hi> to a Foreign Jurisdiction, on pretence of a
Necessity of either an Universal Church Monarch, or Church-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Senate or Council, or of all the Church on Earth represented
by Patriarchs or Metropolitans, or that plead for <hi>Subjection to them,</hi>
under the Name of Communion, they require a distinct Answer. But
Dr. <hi>Is. Barrow,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Beverley's</hi> Catholick Catechism, have effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
done it.</p>
