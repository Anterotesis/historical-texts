            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Griffith,</hi> and M. <hi>Vavaſor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel</hi> at <hi>New-Chappel</hi> in <hi>Montgomery</hi>: That day appointed was <hi>July 23.</hi> The Doctor promiſed a Sermon, but performed not.</p>

                  <p>It is an ill ſign, a bad omen when you begin to faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from truth, and fail in your exactneſs ſo ſoon in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, ſpecially in a circumſtance impertinent to your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, only to ſhew your rancour and itch to caſt aſperſions on the Doctor. To whom was it that he promiſed a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Can you tell? If you cannot tell to whom, you muſt be forced to acknowledge, to no body as you know: and ſo you can alledge no promiſe; and where no promiſe was, no perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance on that behalf was to be expected. I was preſent my ſelf when the Gentleman that built the Chappell, moved the Doctor in it, when there was ſome ſpeech of the Diſpute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118105:3"/>
ſaying, <hi>I hope you will beſtow a Sermon on us</hi>: The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour replied, that he could not promiſe; for his indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of health, and weakneſs of body was ſuch, that if any thing elſe was done, he could not hope to be able to hold out to preach, and this in the hearing of divers Gentlemen of note and credit.</p>

                  <p>The place appointed could not contain the people, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were fain to have the Disputation without doors: When they were ſetled on both ſides, the Doctor would go on with the Diſputation in Latine—</p>

                  <speaker>Animad.</speaker>
                  <p>In giving an exact Narrative, it was neceſſary you ſhould have told, what the Doctor ſaid and did, and for what reaſons then expreſſed; and not involved all in one generall phraſe, <hi>The Dr. would have Latin.</hi> And therefore ſeeing you have omitted ſo prolix a paſſage, the ground and foundation of all that which you call a Diſpute; give me leave truly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Reader.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>The Doctor firſt turned himſelf unto the company, and ſpake to this effect: <hi>This unuſuall concourſe of people met together bodeth ſome extraordinary expectation, and ſpeaketh the occaſion to be unuſuall. A ſtrange thing, a wonder ſcarce heard of in an age, to hold a ſolemn Academicall Diſputation in the Country, a ſphere not proper for it.</hi> He obſerved, that the company met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conſiſted of three ſorts of men; Many profeſſed Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars that expected ſatisfaction in the way of Learning: Divers Gentlemen of rank and quality, who though not profeſſed Artiſts, yet no ſtrangers to the Sciences and wayes of Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and their expectation alſo he conceived might be the ſame: The third ſort unlearned women and illiterate men, that knew not how to judge of ſuch matters: His deſire therefore was unto this meaner ſort, that they would have a little patience, while they ſhould diſpute, as was agreed, <hi>more Academico,</hi> promiſing that whatſoever paſſed, it ſhould faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be declared unto them in the way and language they were capable of. Hereupon M. <hi>Powel</hi> and his company began to cry out, <hi>Engliſh</hi>; but the better ſort, if not the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>Latin</hi>: In this time of noiſe, M. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaid ſomewhat of Prayer; the Doctor replied, That was not unthought of, nor ſhould be forgotten: Then in proſecution of his deſire to

give ſatisfaction to the principall part of the Aſſembly, he went on thus; <hi>Age igitur, accingamur ad opus: Seduti ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in Scholis disputaturi, nihil aggredi, preſertim in re Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicâ, inſalutato numine, brevi ſaltens Precatiunculâ Ordiamur.</hi>

               <p>The Prayer ended, (wherein M. <hi>Powel</hi> twice indeavoured to interrupt the Doctor, in loud Engliſh,) the Doctor began to repeat and ſtate the Queſtions in Latin: but M. <hi>Powel</hi> and his company began to clamour, and others on the other ſide to require the contrary to what they cried out for. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to prevent all occaſion of tumult, M. <hi>Powell</hi> withall yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding unto him in point of learning, condeſcended to repeat the Queſtions as they were propoſed to him by M. <hi>Powell</hi> in Engliſh.</p>

               <p>The Doctor told him, that in regard they were compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively propounded, they could not be clearly and well diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of in that way; and therefore either of them was to be reduced to diſtinct and poſitive Concluſions. In the firſt Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion two Propoſitions, the one Affirmative, the other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Calling of the Miniſters of the Goſpel in the Church of</hi> England <hi>is warrantable and according to the Word of God.</hi> This he ſaid was <hi>in terminis</hi> the Confeſſion of our Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 23. and atteſted unto by all the Reformed Churches in their Confeſſions.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:118105:4"/>2. <hi>Your Calling (if oppoſite to and diſtinct from this) is not warrantable nor according to the Word of God.</hi> Then added, That he came not there to alledge any thing againſt their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, untill they gave him fuller account of it, what it was; when M. <hi>Powel</hi> declared himſelf, what his opinion is, whether Eraſtian, Socinian, Browniſt, Anabaptiſt or Enthuſiaſt, he would conſider what to ſay unto it: In the mean time he ſtood only to defend the Doctrine of that Church whereof he is a Miniſter and member.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Queſtion are two Concluſions alſo:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt Affirmative. <hi>Our Parochiall, which you call mixt Congregations, are according to the Word of God.</hi> This concerns the Diſcipline of the Church, ſetled and eſtabliſed by Laws both of Church and State, avowed in the practice of all Chriſtian Churches. The ſecond Negative,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your wayes of Separation are not according to the Word of God.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Powell</hi> approved well of the Doctor's cleerneſs in thus opening the Queſtions.</p>
               <p>When it was expected M. <hi>Powell</hi> ſhould begin the Diſpute, he deſired he might have the liberty to propoſe ſome Rules, as he called them, and they were three:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That nothing which ſhould paſſe in that Diſpute, ſhould be made publike (he meant I beleeve, ſet out in Print,) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge and conſent of both parties. The Dr. aſſented readily, and hath exactly obſerved the Rule: whether they have done ſo or no, this Narrative is a ſufficient teſtimony.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Diſpute might be held in the ſpirit of love and meekneſs. Which the Dr. aſſented unto alſo, and performed accordingly. He leaveth them to anſwer for themſelves, and all true lovers of truth and peace to judge between them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third proved to be no Rule, but a tempting Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: <hi>In what capacity do you stand there, as an Epiſcopall man or a Presbyterian?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Dr. replied, that that was nothing to the Queſtion, but if he had any thing to ſay againſt either, he would anſwer for either. But M. <hi>Powell</hi> ſtill preſſed, <hi>Whether are you?</hi> The Dr. anſwered, I am both; if you will needs know, I am an Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Presbyterian. Then M. <hi>Powell</hi> repeated his words: So there was an end of the Rules.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118105:4"/>Then he went on (as you might expect, being paſt his Rules) irregularly, uſing all means and artifices he could deviſe to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade and deſert his Queſtion, which in fine he did wholly; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, that he had nothing to ſay againſt the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or the Calling of her Miniſters: but he was only againſt ſuch as abuſed their Calling. And thereupon he propoſed another Queſtion, <hi>Do you undertake to defend the corrupt part of the Miniſtry?</hi> The Doctor anſwered, No: he was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for no man's errors, neither would he defend his own, when they were made to appear unto him to be errors. And to evidence that perſonall miſcarriages did not abate the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, he inſtanced in <hi>Judas,</hi> who was an Apoſtle, though he were withall a Devil. Whereunto M. <hi>Powell</hi> very wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Will you be</hi> Judas <hi>then?</hi> What return was given him by a ſtander by, you may remember if you pleaſe: but the Doctor made no anſwer, demeaning himſelf as became him in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian meekneſs, deſpiſing ſuch obloquies.</p>

                  <speaker>Narrat.</speaker>
                  <p>But becauſe that would give no ſatisfaction to the people, for whoſe ſake chiefly the Disputation was intended, is was concluded it ſhould be in Engliſh.</p>

                  <p>How it was concluded, and upon what ground, is told you before. But you irrationally conclude, before you had delivered the premiſes: Such is your exactneſs. By the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſurely you mean here the ignorant only (for all the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the Company were of the contrary minde) and to intend ſatisfaction by way of diſputation, to ſuch as do not know what belongeth to diſputation, is a ſenſeleſs device. The Doctor ſure had ſome intereſt in the intention, as challenged to be a party and an actor in the Diſpute, and he ſhould beſt know his own intentions in it: And I heard him ſay, he had no mean regard to M. <hi>Powel</hi>'s ſatisfaction, who expreſſeth ſo much doubt in his Letter, if the Latine of it will bear any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. As for M. <hi>Powel</hi>'s intentions, they are alſo beſt known unto himſelf. But it ſhould ſeem by you, that all he aims at is, to be well thought of by the Ignorant, and applauded by the multitude: And much good may it do him with his popularity.</p>

                  <p>The Doctor being deſired to pray, prayed in Latin: the greateſt part of the people accounted what he ſaid little better then a latin maſs.</p>

                  <p>It is not true that any requeſt was made unto him; there was indeed an intimation only of the fittingneſſe of praying upon ſuch an occaſion, which the Doctor preſently apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and conformed unto: Your gloſſe and cenſure on his prayer is both arrogant and uncharitable. Arrogant in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to your ſelf to know the hearts of the greater part of the company, what they privately thought of it: then uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in endeavouring to caſt the aſperſion of Popery upon it. It is well known the Doctor was ever of another ſtrain, and hath withſtood Popery both by writing and preaching for above theſe twenty years, as much as any Miniſter in Wales. Your preachers are in the conſequence good agents for the Papiſts: it is too evident Popery is more improved amongſt us ſince the indiſcreet execution of the late Act of Propogation, then it was in above twenty years before. The prayer it ſelf, becauſe there are copies of it given by ſome that took notes there, you have here given you to prevent miſtakes. It will vindicate it ſelf to all undepraved judgements from all kind of reference either to Maſs or Popery.</p>

                  <p>Of this paſſage you have a fuller account then here is given before in its proper place: wherein M. <hi>Powel</hi>'s drift was eaſily diſcerned, hoping to finde by this means an occaſion to diſcover ſome diverſity or opinions in the Moderator and the Doctor: but the deſign failed.</p>

                  <p>The Doctor brought along with him M. Hilderſham, a Presbyterian, to be Moderator, who was altogether on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors ſide.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>An.</speaker>
                  <p>True it is that M. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> came along to the place with the Doctor, as did many others, whom he did not bring, but they rather did bring him to the place, as it is uſual with friends. Neither did M. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> come as a Moderator, for there was another able and well known Orthodox Divine of the neighbourhood deſired to do that office for the diſputants, who had alſo in part promiſed to be there upon the day, and the Doctor did rely upon it. But as he was taking horſe that morning, a gentleman delivered him a letter from his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118105:5"/>
Moderator, excuſing himſelf in regard ſome urgent occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had intervened, which neceſſarily called him another way. Upon this occaſion M. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> being their in place, and known to be fit for ſuch an employment, both for his integrity and learning, was deſired by the Doctor to take the place upon him; and ſo you have the truth, which you failed in the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering. What M. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> is, is well known throughout the land, a grave, learned, Orthodox Divine: what his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is in point of Church-government (for that is all ſhou'd rationally be underſtood by your ſtile of Presbyterian, though happily you may ſeem uncharitably to extend it further) he is able to give you a full and juſt account when he ſhall be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully required to do it. True it is, he eſteemeth of the Doctor as of his brother and friend, but not ſo as to ſide with him in any error: <hi>Amicus Plato, ſed magis amica veritas</hi>: and if you be remembred, M. <hi>Hilderſham</hi> did voluntarily. when he was deſired to moderate, profeſſe that he would do it to the beſt of his underſtanding impartially: So that your ſaying the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator was altogether on the Doctors ſide, inferreth that the truth alſo was altogether on his ſide, inferreth that the truth alſo was altogether on his ſide, at leaſtwiſe in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators judgement; for otherwiſe he profeſſed to become his adverſarie, if he ſaid or maitained any thing againſt the Truth.</p>

                  <p>M. <hi>Powel</hi> would have juſtified the communion of Saints in gathered Churches, which is called Separation: but the Doctor would be respondent for his own Calling and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</p>

                  <p>Both parts here are miſreported; although for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it be not much material, yet men ſhould ſpeak but truth in mean matters: I do not remember that the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints was ſo much as ſpoken of in this inſtant: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Doctor aſſume any undertaking for his Pariſh? But when M. <hi>Powell</hi> would have waved the firſt Propoſition, and go to the next, or haply to that of Separation, which it ſhould ſeem he had moſt mind unto; the Doctor bid him keep to the Queſtion, and either take the Propoſitions in order, or let them all alone.</p>

                  <p>That the people might not be diſappointed, Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> was content, ſignifying to the Doctor that his Arguments

                  <p>What M. <hi>Powell</hi> endeavoured to ſhun appeareth plainly by the ſtory, that is, diſputing of the Queſtion which he himſelf propounded, and therein the people were altogether diſappointed of their expectation: For they expected the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould have been diſabled by him, and then the way had been open to the new Diſcipline. But M. <hi>Powel</hi>'s reflecting upon the Doctor's perſon was a manifeſt deſign. And the Arguments ſhew it, that it did not only reflect upon him by a ſecondary diverted motion, but directly aimed to reproach him out of a depraved intention. That party looketh on the Doctor, as a man ſtanding in the gap before them.</p>

                  <p>The Doctor became Respondent, and M. <hi>Powell</hi> urged a Syllogiſme againſt his Miniſtry, which wast his;</p>

               <p>They that are not qualified, elected and ordained according to the Word of God, they have not their call from God. But you are not qualified, elected and ordained according to the Word of God, Therefore you have not your Calling from God.</p>

                  <p>Became! How? by ſome new change of the Scene? was he not Reſpondent from the beginning? He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook not at all to oppoſe, but only to anſwer, as he was challenged. As for the Syllogiſme, the Concluſion is inverted, and it is not againſt his Miniſtry, but intended only againſt his intereſt in the Miniſtry. But let it paſs.</p>

                  <p>The Doctor ſaid it was a falſe Syllogiſme, becauſe it conſiſted of Negatives. The Moderator, Prieſts, Scholars on their ſide triumphed, becauſe the Syllogiſme was falſe respect of the form: The Hearers approved of the matter; but the Doctor, Moderator and Scholars on that ſide, would by no means allow of the Syllogiſme—.</p>

                  <p>The Doctor excepted againſt the Syllogiſme, as falſe, conſiſting of all Negatives; and he ſtil perſiſteth in it againſt all the new Artiſts, affirming that no ſuch Syllogiſme was ever allowed of in Diſputation. As for the triumphing as ye ignorantly call it, (it was not a triumph, but a deſervedly cauſed laughter) it did not follow immediately upon the Doctors excepting againſt the Syllogiſme (for then all was

Give me leave for ſetting of things right to call it to your remembrance, if you have forgotten it. M. <hi>Powell</hi> perſiſting in his error or opinion of the Syllogiſme, was deſired by the Doctor, to tell him in what Mood and Figure it was; and he after ſome pauſe and conſideration anſwered, that it was in <hi>Barbara:</hi> and thereupon was raiſed that generall laughter, which you are pleaſed to call triumphing: an abſurdity ſo groſs, that it deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hiſſing.</p>

But let me ſay what I will, you ſtill plead Art, and Authority for your Ignorance. For ſhame! Is it not enough for you to bely the living, and abandon rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but ye muſt abuſe the Arts and defame the dead? They were not, I mean <hi>Keckerman</hi> and <hi>Burgerſdicius,</hi> ſush ſilly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, as you make your ſelves and them too. I have neither of the Authors by me; therefore I pray you lock on them again, and examin them. It may poſſibly be, the Printer hath deceived you; or it may be, you do not better (that is, not well enough) underſtand theirs, then other mens Latine. I ſhall tell you anon my conjecture, who in probability might be the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of this doughtie Narrative, but will firſt indeavour to ſhew you the groſſeneſs of this Ignorance that obſtructed M. <hi>Powell,</hi> by ſome examples.

So what remaineth but that they either except againſt the Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, and ſo I have my deſire: or deny the Concluſion; and that would make them more ridiculous, and that I would not wiſh my greateſt enemy.</p>
                  <p>Or what ſay you to another? Suppoſe the Dr. had urged thus againſt your Separation,</p>
                  <p>That which is according to the Word of God, is not to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken againſt.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Your way of Separation is not according to the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but M. <hi>Powell</hi> may as well finde a <hi>Barbara</hi> for this in the ſecond Figure, as for the other in the firſt, which conſiſted all of Negatives; and I will expect his anſwer when he hath ſtudied the Queſtion a little better.

                  <p>This is anſwered, I beleeve, ſufficiently already, And I ſhall adde no more; but only acquaint you by the way, that it is on this paſſage I ground my conjecture I ſpake of, concerning the Author of this exact Narrative, <hi>Suo ipſius indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio periit Sorex. Teren.</hi> For this piece agreeth exactly, as face anſwereth face, with a Note which was ſhewed me taken out of M. <hi>Moſiyn</hi>'s expoſition at <hi>Poole,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. <hi>July</hi> 25. 1552 Some of you were at the Diſpute. To that which was informed upon, we have ſince conſulted with the beſt Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in theſe later dayes: They ſay it was true according to Logick, and Arts in Univerſities, and Scholars, and form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I trouble you with no more of his ſilly nonſenſe vented the next week again at <hi>Oſweſtrie, Aug.</hi> 1, 1652. The Narrative, ye ſee, is grounded on the ſame conſultation with Logicians, and ſo ſent up, contrary to their own rule, without conſulting the Doctor. The matter is fully cleered before; I leave the Arts, Univerſities and Scholars to ſpeak for themſelves, who can ſoon vindicate themſelves from the reproach and ſcandal ſuch Ignorance can caſt upon them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, they muſt take this notice from me, that the Separatiſts are upon diſclaiming all intereſts in Arts, and Univerſities, and Scholars: For what ſaid M. <hi>Mostyn</hi> in his preachment <hi>July</hi> 25. <q>We did not ſtand upon Logick, but by the Truth; what is to ſway us but Scriptures?</q> An ingenious confeſſion, <hi>We did not:</hi> And ye do not yet, it ſeems. If ye ſtand not upon Logick, we are to expect but ſmall account of any other Art or Science from you. For Logick is <hi>Ars Artium,</hi> the Key and Gate or Entrance into all the reſt; and if ye care not for the Arts, ye are not for Univerſities: and take away Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, and then farewell Scholar. You ſtand not upon Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick! you Animal, you ſtand not upon reaſoning then, and yet you take upon you to diſpute forſooth, that is, to prate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reaſon. For what elſe is Logick, but a method, form and rule of reaſoning orderly for the perfecting of a mans natural diſcourſe? but that you ſtand not upon. What then? <hi>But by the Truth.</hi> What? do you ſwear? Or it may be, you mean, you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

by the Truth. You do indeed, as Contraries, <hi>juxt a ſe poſta:</hi> And your falſhood maketh it to appear brighter and more glorious; your daily prating inſtead of Preaching, hath made God's word very precious amongſt us: And one Orthodox true Sermon is more ſet by now, then an hundred heretofore; ſuch is the famine of the Word, which you have cauſed by your propagating the Goſpel. <hi>What is to ſway us but Scripture?</hi> My friend! Is Logick no help to the interpreting, and applying of Scripture? Let me tell you, that what the Lawyer faith of his profeſſion, is very true of yours and mine, <hi>Scire Leges non hoc eſt, earum verba tenere, ſed vim &amp; potestatem.</hi> It is not your potting of text, wherein by the help of a Concordance the word Separate may be found, that proveth your Tenents; but you ſhould demonſtrate, that the ſcope and meaning of the Text is pertinent to your purpoſe. And that you can never do without reaſon and Logick. But enough of this unreaſonable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>The Doctor formed the Syllogiſme, that's true indeed; but you miſreport the occaſion, not his own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour or liking, but becauſe M. <hi>Powell</hi> and his aſſiſtance could not do it, and that the diſputation might be no longer obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted through their ignorance. For you may remember, if you pleaſe, that when they were at a ſtand, the Doctor ſid, I partly know what you would have, and if you cannot form your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument into a good Syllogiſme, I will help you, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he did, and thus he is requited for his pains.

                  <p>M. <hi>Powell</hi> took the firſt particular in the Syllogiſme and proved, That the Doctor was not qualified, becauſe he was not qualified with the gift of Prayer, in regard be uſed the ſame ſet form of Prayer for many years together before and after Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which he alwayes read. Forms of Prayers are to ſupply the want of the Gifts, ſo the Doctor wanted the Gift, and was not qualified. The Dr. denied that a form of Prayer did exclude the gift of Prayer.</p>

                  <p>Here are ſome things of your own putting in

to ſhreds of the Diſpute. You put in 1. <hi>For many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>; It was not ſaid then, and your ſaying it now is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth. The Dr. hath uſed many forms of Prayer, and all he uſeth, he alrereth on occaſions: And he doth it upon a groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded perſwaſion, that it is the moſt edifying way, and moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and convenient for the people. 2. You put in, <hi>which he alwayes read:</hi> An untruth too, and intended for a calumny, the Lord forgive you. 3. <hi>Forms of prayers are to ſupply the want of gifts.</hi> No ſuch thing then ſpoken of; and I need not trouble my ſelf here impertinently to examine it. There are more uſes then one of ſet prayers. Neither will I trouble the reader with all the paſſages in urging this Argument, which in effect do ſignifie as much as nothing. All was fully anſwered in that compendious Poſition of the Doctors: The uſe of forms of Prayer doth nor exclude the gift of Prayer. Againſt which Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> offered not any proof. And for the Doctors perſonall qualification in this particular, he hath given ſufficient teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that he hath one gift more then his opponents have amongſt them all, to wit, The gift of praying in True Latine.</p>

                  <speaker>Narrat.</speaker>
                  <p>M. <hi>Powell</hi> deſired that he would anſwer the force of the Argument, and produce Scriptures for his deniall, that his words might ſatisfie the people.</p>

                  <p>Grant this paſſage to be true in ſubstance (in expreſſion it is not) it maketh little or nothing for the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents credit. When the Doctor had denied the <hi>major</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which was this, <hi>He that uſeth a Form of Prair, hath not the gift of Prayer,</hi> It was a ſenſeleſſe demand, or a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſhift in him to call for an anſwer to the force of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; whereas the denying of the Propoſition did plainly ſhew it to be of no force. For what force can there be in falſse premiſſes: And an unreaſonable thing to require Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of a Reſpondent for every thing he denieth! The truth is this, When M. <hi>Powell</hi> knew not how to prove the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition denied, he would have the Doctor to ſhew a reaſon why he denied it; who replied, It was reaſon ſufficient, that it was falſe; and it was the Opponent's part to prove the contrary. Then came the Aſſiſtants in to help, <hi>Moſtyn, Nevet, Edwards,</hi> confidently affirming, it was uſuall in the School to require a reaſon for the denying of any Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118105:9"/>
(M. <hi>Nevet</hi> indeed ſaid he had heard it;) The Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on the Doctors part, being many of both Univerſities, decried it. The Moderator alſo telling them, they inſiſted on a thing unheard of, and in it ſelf unreaſonable. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor himſelf put an end to this impertinent debate, who told them he had ſome reaſon to know the laws and uſe of diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as moſt there, and he never knew of any reaſon required for the denying of any ſimple Propoſition, nor of the denying of any conſequence, untill the Argument be grown to too great a bulk in proving conſequence upon conſequence. For when one argueth Enthymematically, and his conſequence is denied, his way to prove it is <hi>per rationem Conſequentiae,</hi> which being made the Antecedent layeth the ground of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Enthymeme, the whole former Argument making the Concluſion; And ſo forward, Argument after Argument, and Enthymeme by Enthymeme, untill it come to eleven. By that time the Concluſion conſiſting of all that went before, will be grown ſo great and full, that a weak memory can ſcarce retain or well remember it. Therefore when it was come to that pitch, the uſe was to require a reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall of the laſt conſequence. If a reaſon was given, the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent was to endeavour to ſhew it to be invalid; If no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given, it was free then for the diſputant to return to his firſt Antecedent, and go on to prove it. Againſt this the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents had nothing to object, and ſo deſiſted.</p>
                  <p>But M. <hi>Powell</hi> asked the Doctor, By what Scripture he could prove a Form of Praier? For that's altogether M. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell's</hi> diſputing, asking Queſtions: The Doctor anſwered, It was ſufficiently authorized, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. where our Saviour taught his Diſciples a Form of Praier: M. <hi>Powell</hi> replied, Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our wrought miracles, will you work miracles? It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, No, it did not follow; Our Saviours precepts and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imitable actions are different from his Miracles.</p>

                  <p>Sure, if they were ſilent, it was in expectation of ſome proof from M. <hi>Powell</hi> of his Propoſition, but none came; And ſo if you had meant to ſpeak truth, you ſhould have ſaid, that neither M. <hi>Powell</hi> nor his Aſſiſtant <hi>Moſtyn,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:118105:9"/>
nor M. <hi>Nevet</hi> that prompted both, had one word to ſay; And ſo it would have followed more rationally in your Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative</p>

                  <speaker>Narrat.</speaker>
                  <p>Then M. <hi>Powell</hi> went on to the ſecond particular of his Syllogiſm, and proved that the Doctor was not rightly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>

                  <p>Went on and proved? Nay, ſtay there; that is not yet done, your meaning is, He did his endeavour, as the man did that threſhed in his Cloak. But I had almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to put in minde of another paſſage by the by, which you would have called triumphing, if you had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it fit to be mentioned. Was there not a generall laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter juſtly raiſed, when M. <hi>Powell</hi> thinking to approve himſelf ſententious and learned, chanted it aloud, <hi>Debet mendacem eſſe memorem? Sed tranſeat hoc cum cateris erroribus.</hi>

                  <p>That he that is rightly elected, is elected by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Saints. But you are not elected by a Congregation of Saints, <hi>Ergò.</hi> The Doctor denied the minor, ſaying, He was elected by Saints (when as indeed he was placed there by the Biſhop, and impoſed upon them, rather then choſen by them.)</p>

                  <p>This laſt clauſe or Parentheſis was no part of the diſpute. Sorry they were ſure, that it was then omitted, and therefore they have here inſerted it, after Conſultation in the Narrative. Somewhat they muſt ſay to the dead Biſhop, as well as to the living Doctor. But God be thanked, the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vivor is able to anſwer for both. You ſhould have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Election here diſputed againſt, was his Election to the function or Miniſtery, and that's a different act from his Election to a place or charge wherein to exerciſe his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. In regard theſe men are ſo forward to ſeek to deprave the Doctor on this behalf, he is ready to give the world an account if need be of either: For preſent ſatisfaction I have with importunity extorted from him out of publike inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments this brief account of his Elections.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>His Election to his Calling or Miniſtery was in <hi>Oxford,</hi> by the Society whereof he was a member, and continued ſo to be untill he was Bachelor in Divinity. Then for the exerciſe of his Calling he was elected by the Univerſity, and ſent by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118105:10"/>
expreſſe licenſe or Commiſſion under their publike Seal, <hi>Ad Praedicandum Evangelium per univerſam Angliam, i. e.</hi> to preach the Goſpel throughout all <hi>England</hi>; A grace not granted unto any, but after performance of the exerciſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Statute in that behalf, that is, Anſwering in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity Schools, and preaching <hi>Quatuor laudabiles Conciones infra Praecinctum Univerſitatis.</hi> He was elected alſo by a Reverend Prelate the Late Biſhop of <hi>Aſap</hi> to be his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Chaplain, and by him preſented, by the right inveſted in him by the Law of the Land, firſt to the Rectory of <hi>New-Town,</hi> then of <hi>L'landrinio,</hi> and laſtly to <hi>L'lanymynech,</hi> where he hath conſtantly reſided theſe eighteen years, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the reſpective Pariſhes with approbation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
               <p>How and upon what grounds popular Elections of Biſhops and Paſtors were devolved to ſome one or more, eminent in every reſpective Dioceſe or Diviſion, with the conſent of the people, I will not trouble my ſelf now to ſhew you. But granting, that a formal Election by vote were neceſſary in this caſe (and the Doctors Academicall Elections are known to be ſuch, all graces paſſing there by ſuffrage) yet M. <hi>Powell</hi> hath too hard a task of it to unſaint ſo many; and that he muſt do, before he can by this <hi>medium</hi> inferre any thing againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors calling. Intreat M. <hi>Powell</hi> to have a charitable opinion or his own Progenitors among the reſt. To my knowledge his grandfather and grandmother were of the Doctors charge or flock.</p>

                  <speaker>Narrat.</speaker>
                  <p>M. <hi>Powell</hi> proved the <hi>minor</hi> thus; He that is cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by ignorant and ſcandalous men is not choſen by Saints. But you are ſo choſen, <hi>Ergò.</hi> The Doctor ſaid, his Pariſhioners were viſible Saints.</p>

                  <p>You heard before what Apology M. <hi>Powell</hi> made for himſelf, how ſorry he was that his arguments muſt have reflexion upon the Doctor's perſon; but here you ſee, that without ſcruple or preface, his zeal doubtleſſe ſet him on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt charity at once to ſcandalize and defame the whole Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh. They are beholding unto him for his unchriſtian opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them, whom he doth not know ſo much as by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118105:10"/>
to chooſe him for their Miniſter, or lift themſelves in his Congregation. But you ſay, the Doctor ſaid, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners were viſible Saints; wherein you commit a double errour, 1. In not reporting his full anſwer. 2. In impoſing words on him which were not his. The Doctor told you, that the Scripture ſpeaketh of two ſorts of Saints, ſome by ſpeciall Calling and Election of Grace, others by generall vocation to, and profeſſion of the name of Chriſt. The former we are not to judge of; The Doctor thought it ſufficient to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Saints of the later ſort. And for the phraſe, <hi>viſible Saints,</hi> it came not from the Doctor, but M. <hi>Nevet</hi> (I will not ſay as <hi>Sexeca</hi> did of <hi>Claudius, Eâ parte, quâ melius loque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur</hi>) although his back was to the Aſſembly all the while.</p>

As if, if they were not there to be catechized by him, they muſt be no where. 'Tis true, the Gentleman that ſtood up is a knowing man, too know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be of your ignorant opinions; The greater your fault, that knowing him to be ſuch, you ſhould ſo miſreport him. As if there were any knowing Gentleman, that knew not how to anſwer M. <hi>Powell.</hi> When M. <hi>Powell</hi> had uncivilly, unjuſtly branded all the Doctors Pariſhioners with ſcandall and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it was very ſeaſonable and neceſſary, for ſo knowing a man to let the company know he was ſenſible of the oblo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, and to ſtand up in his own and his neighbours juſt vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Powell</hi> deſired leave to ask him a Queſtion. You ſay right; but you ſhould have told the Reader all in an exact Narrative: And therefore have added M. <hi>Powell</hi> deſired of the Doctor leave to ask his Pariſhioner a Queſtion. It ſhould ſeem by this addreſſe, that M. <hi>Powell</hi> thought the Doctor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed unto himſelf ſuch peremptory command and power over his charge, as M. <hi>Powell</hi> himſelf doth over his ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118105:11"/>
Congregation, that no man is to ask them a queſtion, nor they to anſwer without his leave: The Jeſuites mode right, <hi>Nihil ſine licentia Superiorum.</hi> But the Doctor pretends to no ſuch Priviledge; He is amongſt them (as you know who) as one that ſerveth. And therefore replied; He might do that without his leave.</p>
                  <p>But the gentleman himſelf well knowing his own liberty, told M. <hi>Powell</hi> his own leave ſhould be granted before it could be expected he ſhould anſwer his Queſtion; but for that time he freely gave it. M. <hi>Powell</hi> there upon asked him, How is the Image of Chriſt wrought in the ſoul? The Gentleman anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red inſtantly without prompting, Inwardly by the Spirit, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the Word. M. <hi>Powell</hi> had nothing to ſay againſt the anſwer: And being out without asking any more leave, ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another Queſtion, and that you have hit upon; What is the Image of Chriſt in the ſoul? Whereunto the Gentleman beginning, an anſwer was immediatly interrupted by M. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,</hi> crying out ſcoffingly and without cauſe, Look how they prompt him: The Gentleman replied, he neither had nor needed any ſuch help to anſwer M. <hi>Powell</hi> or any of his aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants: to which aſſertion divers Miniſters and Scholars there preſent then gave their ſuffrage and publike teſtimony. And the Moderator in particular told M. <hi>Powell</hi> very truly, that the Gentleman had beſtowed more time in the Univerſity and the waies of ſtudy, knowledge and learning, then he or any of his aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Gentleman beleeving M. <hi>Powell</hi> by his uncivill ſcoffe, unwilling to receive an anſwer, offered none afterward di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to that Queſtion: But conceiving himſelf to have a fair right to retaliate in the way of queſtioning, ſpecially conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his firſt condeſcention to M. <hi>Powell,</hi> he asked him (the fitteſt way to anſwer ſuch a Queſtioniſt) and that very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to the argument in hand, Whether there were no ſcandalous perſons amongſt them? M. <hi>Powell</hi> anſwered, none. The Gentleman again asked, What, no Adulterers? M. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell</hi> made no anſwer, nor any for him; but a ſtander by, ſaid, yea, adulterers and buggerers too. The company underſtood his meaning without ſaying any more. For all the Countrey ringeth of it. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Goals and publike Records of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Counties of <hi>Denbigh, Montgomery,</hi> and <hi>Merrion</hi>

are the ground and evidences of this paſſage: Whereof I need ſay no more, I would there were not ſo much of truth in thus much. But as for the Gentlemen, however theſe men value his knowledge, I am ſure they are indebted to his charity. For I have heard him heartily wiſh, they could as eaſily wipe off from their Churches the foul blot of theſe horrible and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous waies of propagation of the Goſpel, as he ſhall the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of ignorance in the particular wherewith this falſe Narrative endeavous to aſperſe him.</p>

                  <speaker>Animad.</speaker>
                  <p>It fell out, I mean, this inſtance, very opportunely, M. <hi>Powell</hi> had wanted an argument elſe. To ſuch as it is the Doctor anſwered. 1. For matter of fact, he knew nothing of it: he was himſelf at the interring of the body, and he never heard nor knew of any ſinging either before or after. Neither did he ever give any countenance to ſuch needleſſe ſinging by the way. 2. For the charge it ſelf, Singing of Pſalms is neither ſcandalous nor ſuperſtitious, neither do the Papiſts uſe ſuch ſinging; There is a great deal of difference between <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms and <hi>Dirgo</hi>'s Trentals, and the like: And a vaſt difference between the intention in Singing in the Reformed Churches, and the Popiſh Funerals. It is the opinion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or uſe that formally make the ſuperſtition, Singing of Pſalms is a ſpirituall duty or exerciſe; and the meer prefence of a dead Corps is no <hi>Superſede as</hi> unto it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the conſequence or force of the Argument, I ſhall deſire the Reader to obſerve it. A few of the Doctor's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners did ſing Pſalms coming to bury a dead corps, <hi>July</hi> 23, 1652. Therefore they were ſuperſtitious and ſcandalous that elected him or approved of his election, <hi>Mar.</hi> 20, 1633. Except M. <hi>Powell</hi> prove this wilde conſequence, his new Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument brought him by good intelligence that morning freſh and faſting, will ſtand him in no ſtead at all for the invalida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Doctor's Election by thoſe of whom the moſt or greater part are Saints in heaven. And he conceiveth himſelf bound in charity to think ſo of them. And M. <hi>Powel</hi> with all his Holineſſe is able to produce no colour of evidence to the contrary.</p>

                  <p>Upon this they were aſhamed: Then the Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſtood up to help: He propounded this Queſtion, Whether they might not be Saints, though they ſung before a dead corps? Unto which M. <hi>Powell</hi> anſwered, It was againſt the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>

Let the world judge by the whole ſtory who had the cauſe to be aſhamed. And though M. <hi>Powel</hi> thought himſelf facete in popping the Moderator in the mouth with the Directory, yet every one that hath any underſtanding may diſcern that it doth not reach at all unto the demand or queſtion. The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners were in ill caſe, if every thing they do againſt the Directory muſt preſently unſaint them; And the moderator, and the Doctor in as bad condition, if every thing that's done in their Pariſhes unwitting to them, must preſently make null their Election and Calling, becauſe it is againſt the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>

                  <p>So he paſt to the third particular in the Syllogiſm, That he was not rightly ordained. M. <hi>Powell</hi> urged a Syllogiſme to try how they were inſtructed about Ordination, <hi>thus,</hi> They who are ordained according to the Word of God are ordained by Apostles or Evangliſts: But you are not ſo ordained, <hi>Ergo.</hi> The Doctor did adde, or by their ſucceſſors.</p>

                  <p>If they had not been better inſtructed before they came there, they might have returned as wiſe as they came for any thing of Divinity or other ſciences that was to be learned from the opponents; for they want a great deal of inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The Doctor did adde, You are ſtill too ſhort of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe you profeſſe. You ſhould have ſaid, If you be a ſcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſpecially: The Doctor diſtinguiſhed of the Apoſtles conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered either in their Perſons, or their Office, Commiſſion, and Succeſſor. If M. <hi>Powel</hi> meant it of the Apoſtles in their Perſons, The Doctor denied the <hi>major</hi> Propoſition, If of them in their office and ſucceſſors, he denied the <hi>minor.</hi> As for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, as ſuch never any writer ſaid that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with the Power of Ordination, And if you be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, there were proofs given of the neceſſity of ſucceſſion,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118105:12"/>
and continuance of a power to ordain. But M. <hi>Powell</hi> never offered to make any proof of either of the Premiſes.</p>

                  <p>Some there were about Succeſſion of Apoſtles: But for ſucceſſion of Evangeliſts, the Doctor and his friends, I beleeve, never heard of any to continue in the Church. What the paſſages were you do not tell us: Nor will I trouble my head with recollecting them. If any of them had been ſuch, as might but ſeemingly be conſerved for the advantage of your of your cauſe and glory of the day on your part, all men may preſume, you would not have concealed them. And ſince you have paſſed them over in ſilence, let them lie dead for me. I am confident the Doctor never conceived he could any way improve his credit by diſputing with ſuch as you. And I know his Chriſtian temper ſo well, that he deſtreth no mans diſgrace.</p>

The matter is not great. It was time to call for an end of the diſputation, when after three hours wrangling it was ſcarce begun. For neither of the Queſtions propoſed were hitherto diſputed of, but wholly declined: Only the Doctor and his charge were brought upon the ſtage, or to a popular bar to be arraigned before an ignorant multitude, or at leaſt made marks for their mighty and ſharp arrows, even bitter words. But, God be thanked, you do not finde any enormous crimes laid to any of their charge: and for any thing yet appeareth, they may all be as good Saints, as the beſt of the New Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations.

                  <p>Nay, ſaid M. <hi>Powell</hi> we have ſaid nothing for our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, Gifted men, Separation, we deſire you to ſtay. As for the Miniſters it was declared how they were gifted, elected, approved.</p>

                  <p>Truly ye had ſaid as much as comes to nothing all the while. And nothing can be remembred, that you ſay was declared for the Miniſters. All I underſtood was what M. <hi>Powell</hi> declared for himſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> In the way of his Calling. He had ſomewhat from the Biſhop; afterward he received Impoſition of hands with faſting and prayer by a Presbytery in <hi>London</hi> (So M. <hi>Powel</hi> is an Epiſcopall Presbyter as well as the Doctor, and there is ſome hopes they may agree in time, when this youthfull heat is a little over) By them he was ſent to the Aſſembly of Divines for approbation (By your favour, if it were ſo, the courſe was a little prepoſterous. For exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and approbation ſhould regularly go before Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.) And laſtly allowed he was by the Parliament. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor took his word for his own ſtory. As for any other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, how they were gifted, elected, approved, there was not a word ſpoken, as either I or any of my acquaintance that were preſent can remember. Whereby the reader may obſerve how M. <hi>Powell</hi> declined wholly both parts of his firſt comparative Queſtion, alledging nothing againſt the Miniſtery he hath ſo ſo long traduced, and for amends making his own in nothing different from it: And in that caſe he might well expect to meet no oppoſition from ſober men.</p>

                  <p>It may be ſo; The Doctor never troubled himſelf to enquire after them, neither who they were, nor yet how gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It may be, you mean, The Smith, Weaver, Capper, Souldier, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are ſent about, and well rewarded, to try what they can propagate. Of them there was no more ſaid in effect but this. M. <hi>Powell</hi> asked, whether it might not be lawfull for a man unordained to preach for triall. It was anſwered that it was: And it was uſual both in the Univerſities, and before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther governours of the Church. Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, I have known a Biſhop, and he is ſtill living, that would not be induced to lay hands on any ſtranger, before he had heard him preach. But then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118105:13"/>
asked Mr. <hi>Powell,</hi> how long they were to be Probation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; how many Sermons would be ſufficient for triall, and who to judge; or to that effect. To which he received no anſwer. The Tradeſmen I now mentioned, have been theſe two or three years upon their triall, as it ſeemeth, and are likely to be longer yet for all I know.</p>

                  <p>Severall Scriptures were urged for Separation, and how they were neceſſitated to ſeparate by reaſon of perſecution and corruption in thoſe times.</p>

                  <p>It is not urging Scriptures that will ſerve the turn (never any Heretick ſo deſperate, but could make a ſhift to do ſo) but proving by Scripture, that vindicateth truths, and makes them credible. You would have the world beleeve you did ſo. But it appeareth partly by your own difference, that it was otherwiſe. For if it had been ſo, it would have bin well worth your labour, to have acquainted the Reader with the particular Texts, how applied to the matter in hand, and how anſwered; which becauſe you have wholly omitted (ſuch is your exactneſſe) give me leave briefly to ſupply.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Scripture urged was, <hi>Num</hi> 16 <hi>v.</hi> 26. or 24. It is not much materiall whether. To which the Doctor anſwered immediately, That that Scripture was nothing at all to the purpoſe which Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> alleadged it for; being a peculiar caſe, wherein the Lord in an extraordinary diſpenſation gave a ſpeciall command to the innocent part of the Congregation to ſeparate from the reſt, to the end he might execute his Juſtice in an exemplary unuſuall way upon the guilty, in that very inſtant. By opening the ſtory, he ſhewed the hainouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the ſin, the greatneſſe of Gods diſpleaſure againſt it, and the extraordinary judgement thereupon: And that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary occaſionall commands of God to that people are not to be drawn into example by us. And for this particular the Jews caſe and Mr. <hi>Powel</hi>'s were in no circumſtance alike. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> ſaid nothing to the contrary, but went on to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture; and that was 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 11. <hi>With ſuch a one no not to eat.</hi> The Dr. being weary of ſtanding in the heat of their impertinencies, ſtaid not to preſſe him to apply the Text, or form his argument out of it; but preſently anſwered, That that Scripture was nothing to their purpoſe of Separation nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:118105:14"/>
as might plainly appear by the ſcope and ſenſe of the whole Chapter; wherein the Apoſtle firſt propoſeth the caſe of the inceſtuous perſon, then blameth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for what they did in that behalf; directeth them to proceed to Cenſure againſt him, to excommunicate him; giveth the uſe and reaſons of his Command, and extendeth the Diſcipline to other ſcandalous offendors alſo, Adulterers, Railers, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, Extortioners, &amp;c. Such alſo are to be excommunicated according to the expreſſe command, v. 13. <hi>Put away the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon from among you.</hi> This Scripture ſpeaketh of the Cenſure of the Church, not of gathering Congregations; of putting away corrupt members from the Church, not of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering a Church of ſeverall Congregations. This being ſaid, Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> made no reply; but went on to a third place of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>2. Tim. 3. 5. <hi>From ſuch turn away.</hi> The Dr. preſently told him, 1. That the relative <hi>ſuch</hi> was to be referred to all the ſorts of ſinners, whereof the foregoing verſes gave a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue (and the Moderator ſaid they were nineteen in number) and deſired to know whom Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> charged to be ſo guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 2. The charge there to <hi>Timothy,</hi> a Governour of the Church, is but <hi>turn away,</hi> which is a ſigne of diſlike or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; a command to ſhew no countenance to ſuch, but reprove them rather. Not to leave his ſtation, and to go and gather a new Church, but (if the force of the word muſt be extended further) to turn ſuch out of the Church, as he was inveſted with power, being a Biſhop, ſo to do. Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, the Doctor ſaid rightly, That the word, <hi>ſuch,</hi> was to be referred to all that went before. And then he went on to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place of Scripture.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 9. The Dr. without looking on any book all the while, told him, that Text anſwered it ſelf by the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Apoſtles caſe and theirs was nothing alike: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle had to do there with hardned, blaſpheming Jews, and idolatrous Heathen, Infidels, that ſet themſelves againſt the Name of Chriſt, and Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, to perſecute it. It was time for him to ſeparate and be gone, when it was not ſafe to ſtay any longer. Then Mr. <hi>Powell</hi> replied, This ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth my Separation, for I was perſecuted (I do not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118105:14"/>
how long ſince). The Doctor anſwered, He was able to ſay nothing to things he knew nothing of heretofore. For the preſent, God be thanked they had no ſuch cauſe to complain. Maſter <hi>Powell</hi> then took occaſion to acquaint the company with an affront a gifted Brother met with lately at <hi>Dolgelly</hi> in <hi>Merionethſhire,</hi> neer thirty miles off: He was violently plucked out of the Pulpit, and his blood drawne. This was news to the moſt part of the company. But ſince I hear, the man was an unordained Tradeſman, ſent forth it ſhould ſeem for triall; and this was part of it. And this is all that was alledged for neceſſity of ſeparation in caſe of perſecution. And this is all the commotion in <hi>Wales,</hi> as I beleeve, ſpoken of in the beginning of the Diurnall. They want ſome pretence to bring the Souldiery againe amongſt us.</p>

                  <speaker>Anim.</speaker>
                  <p>You ſhould have conſidered, that the Doctor and Moderator came not there to oppoſe, but anſwer; and that they had done; and expected either further oppoſition, or liberty to be gone. The Dr. might well be ſilent, being grown ſo hoarſe, that his voice was hardly audible. The Dr. faith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he had a purpoſe to have concluded with a ſhort ſpeech to the company, recollecting the paſſages; but wanting voice to do it, he turned away in ſilence; leaving the Reader now to do it for him.</p>

Speak the truth, or eat theſe words again, or give your ſelves the lye. The time was, when the Commiſſioners for the propagation of the Gospel gave the Doctor this teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>tanquam à tripode</hi> (I meane the Chaire man in the name of the reſt) that he was a man without exception, and ſomewhat more, which is not here ſo pertinent to relate. And for point of difference in judgement, Maſter <hi>Powell</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118105:15"/>
himſelf more then ordinarily charitable, ſaying he was perſwaded that many that diſſented from him in opinion, of ſeverall profeſſions, ſome Papiſts alſo, might be ſaved. What was done by the other party after their departure, it cannot be expected that the Doctor or any of his company ſhould give any accompt. I was told indeed, I cannot ſay how truly, that a young man of Maſter <hi>Powel</hi>'s company drew ſome people after him to the ſide of the Common; and there inveighed againſt Learning and all ſuch as profeſſe it, Doctors and others. It may be, it was not ſo: But if it were, it is no news amongſt them. The Doctor was told beforehand by a knowing friend, what would be the iſſue of this buſineſſe; and he himſelf profeſſed he expected no other, but ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to blaſt his credit, as are here uſed in this Narrative: well knowing that what <hi>Luther</hi> applied unto himſelf, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed every good mans caſe.</p>
