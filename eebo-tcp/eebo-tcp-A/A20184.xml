            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

in that <hi>Sermon</hi> which himſelfe
firſt preached, and afterwardes
cauſed to be publiſhed, <hi>vpon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi>
It might haue been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
that this delicate Age of
ours would ſcarcely haue put on
ſo rough a garment. But the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
cunning of that excellent
Artiſt, had ſo thicke ouerlaced
the ſame with heauenly promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
and comfortable perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
that although at the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying
thereof, it found it ſelfe
inwardly prickt and perturbed;
yet after a little wearing, and by
<pb facs="tcp:18002:3"/>
daily vſe, the ſtraightneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
became both profitable and
pleaſing, and it reioyced not a
little to be ſo happily deceiued.
Behold heere another peece of
Worke, made by the ſame hand,
<hi>A ſhort Treatiſe of Reſtitution:</hi>
Array thy ſelfe likewiſe (good
<hi>Christian</hi>) with this Veſture; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
indeed an Ornament, which
will make the reſt of thy cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
appeare more gracious.
This is the true Touch-ſtone
which tries thy repentance; and
giues thee to God and the world
either a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit.
Be not afraid to vſe it: but
as thou haſt vouchſafed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
of <hi>Repentance,</hi> to weare in
<pb facs="tcp:18002:4"/>
thine heart, and haſt thereby no
doubt (if thou be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
great conſolation; ſo let
this latter, <hi>of Restitution,</hi> be as a
Poſie in thine hand, to thy more
aſſured &amp; greater comfort. This
is the furniture which renders
the gueſt acceptable at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
marriage. If then thou
deſireſt to bee welcome to that
Feaſt, enter thus ſuited. Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as this ſo neceſſary and
<hi>Chriſtianlike</hi> a worke, penned by
ſo ſinguler a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
and ſo much conducting to
eternall bliſſe, hath by Gods
goodnes come vnto my hands:
and conſidering that <hi>Repentance</hi>
is of ſmall force where <hi>Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18002:4"/>
is wanting, as being the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Key which openeth the way
vnto <hi>Remiſsion;</hi> I held my ſelfe
bound in Chriſtian Charity, to
communicate the ſame vnto my
Brethren. Such Talents muſt
not be hid, but put to vſury, that
they may be increaſt with profit.
Praiſe God for the Author of ſo
good a worke; and vſe it to the
rectifying of thine owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that God may be glorified;
which is the accompliſhment of
my deſire. Farewell in the Lord.</p>

If a mans good name cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered,

               <p>If thou findeſt any thing belonging
to an other man, and makeſt not reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution

is meere rapine. For herein
thou haſt performed thy vttermoſt; and
haſt not done more, becauſe thou coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
not. To deny a man that which is
his owne, is all one as if thou hadſt taken
it from him.</p>
               <p>If thou confeſſe thy ſelfe an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

to make reſtitution, thou ſtill detaine
them; thy repentance, howſoeuer thou
makeſt ſhew thereof, is not true, but
<pb facs="tcp:18002:17"/>
fained. But without true repentance
there is no remiſſion: and his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is good indeede, which reſtores

prouided that the Penitent haue
the abilitie to performe it.</p>
               <p>Many account it no ſinne at all, to
detaine an other mans goods if they
chance to finde them: vpon this ground,
That GOD hath ſent them; and
therefore to whome ſhould they reſtore
them? But let ſuch men know, That
it is a ſinne not much differing from
theft, to withhold from the Owner euen
that which they finde.</p>
               <p>He is bound to reſtore the damage, that
another ſuſtaineth, which being therevnto

But he that hereunto is not tyed by his

               <p>A witnes being lawfully examined, and
<pb facs="tcp:18002:17"/>
concealing the truth, or not ſpeaking the

               <p>He that fraudulently occupieth another

in profit ariſing by vſe of another mans

               <p>He that makes a lawfull promiſe, and

               <p>He that taketh any reward to doe euill,

               <p>He that hindreth another in the frée do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

there is no ſetled right thereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

any ſatiſfaction: according to ſundry mens
opinions.</p>
               <p>But others there are of a contrarie

               <p>Things committed contrarie to Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,

               <p>Where two men haue hurt one another

               <p>The ſea-faring man is not bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
thoſe things, that hee caſteth into the

the loſſe both of ſhip and paſſengers.</p>
               <p>Neither is he bound to make Reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
who after long and diligent ſearch for
his Creditor, and not finding him, diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth
his Debt among the poore: if it be
done by authoritie of a Iudge, and not of
too great moment.</p>
               <p>The heire of an executed murderer, is
bound to reſtore the damage ſuſtained by
the heire of the murdred; yea although the

               <p>Debt kept back from a ſpend thrift, and
reſerued either to help him in his extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
or to the vſe of his heires, is not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
to be paid vnto the Prodigal. Some
there are notwithſtanding of a contrarie
opinion, that poſitiuely hold, That it
ought to be reſtored vnto him; and in like
<pb facs="tcp:18002:19"/>
caſe to any other, howſoeuer they abuſe
their owne: as long as his or their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
be not wronged by it.</p>
               <p>He that hath any thing in cuſtody which
is ſtollen from a thiefe, ought to reſtore it
to the right Owner; vnleſſe the feare of
death reſtraine him.</p>
               <p>So much is to be reſtored, as is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
For Reſtitution maketh an euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>Stolne goods bought with an euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
ought to be reſtored: yea although
by Law the ſale may be iuſtified.</p>
               <p>It is not lawfull to detaine any thing
from the Owner, any longer, than till we
finde opportunitie to reſtore it.</p>
               <p>Of three the moſt eſpeciall degrees
of repentance, this of Reſtitution is
the moſt ſupreme: like as in the three
Theologicall vertues, Charitie obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the higheſt place. And this dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
is principally attributed vnto them
<pb facs="tcp:18002:19"/>
aboue the reſt of their aſſociates, in reſpect
of the end.</p>
               <p>For as Faith without Charitie is
dead: ſo Repentance without Reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is a vapour; neither of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to the propoſed end. Suffer not
thy ſelfe therefore to bee carried away,
either by thine owne frailtie, or the
ſuggeſtion of <hi>Sathan,</hi> from performing
this moſt neceſſarie and Chriſtian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
For indeede, as Charitie demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
Faith: ſo Reſtitution makes
Charitie perfect. And how can hee
thinke to bee at peace with GOD, that
makes no ſatiſfaction for wrong doing?
Such mens ſorrow for their ſinne is all
one with that of <hi>Cains,</hi> who in the
guilt of his conſcience confeſſing his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
made it (collaterally) his requeſt,
That no man might kill him. This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death is it which they feare: the
ſpirituall death they reſpect not. Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
I am perſwaded, That with ſuch
men, the old heathen <hi>Sillius</hi> is of far more
credit than any of the holy Writers either
of the old or new Teſtament. His opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
was, that by denying God and his
<pb facs="tcp:18002:20"/>
power hee thriued the better. And can we
iudge otherwiſe of this generation, that
make iniquitie their practiſe, and ſeate
themſelues in the chaire of <hi>Scorners?</hi>
God ſend them better mindes, if they
be not already deliuered ouer into repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
ſenſe, that they may cry God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
and obtaine it, by rendring to euery
man that which is his owne. With ſuch
ſacrifice God is pleaſed, better then with
the fat of bullockes. But now briefely to
conclude: as I firſt intended no long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
ſo I will make a ſhort end.</p>

But in theſe daies, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of other mens goods
hath got ſuch an habit amongſt
the moſt ſort of people, through
the long vſe and practiſe of it:
that it is not onely reputed no

whom Gods holy Spirit touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18002:21"/>
with a true feeling of their
offences in this kinde, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
moueth them to make this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and religious ſatisfaction, are
by thoſe that would ſeeme wiſe
in this point, accounted meere
fooles and of too ſcrupulous a
conſcience. Hence oftentimes it
commeth to paſſe, that not onely
themſelues runne headlong on in
their wicked courſes; but others
alſo by their meanes are drawne
to the ſame vngodlineſſe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt of many friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
excuſes, which carnall men
are wont to alleadge againſt this
ſpirituall counſell of <hi>Restitution;</hi>
there is a politicke ſhame or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
pretended, which of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18002:21"/>
muſt light vpon the partie
reſtoring.</p>
            <p>Now to auoide this ſhame,
which puts ſinne to flight, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth
greatly to the perfecting
of the new Man within vs: they
ſtop their eares at all godly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
and heape one ſinne
vpon another; firſt, doing wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly,
and afterwards taking de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

to theſe kinde of people, is a moſt
vnwelcome gueſt: they may ill
abide to ſee her in the companie
of others; and therefore by no
meanes will entertaine her them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
But let them ſooth their
owne opinions, and ſet light by
Gods iudgements as long as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth

haue in this world before men, of

the leſſe account they make of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
or making amends here;
the greater wil be their horror and
confuſion in the next, &amp; the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

Treatiſe was not framed, as being
a Pearle not to be caſt before ſuch

<hi>Chriſt Ieſu,</hi> it is directed, that are
capable of goodnes through him,
and enabled to bring forth fruits
worthy of amendment of life; that
walke not after the fleſh, but after

know the myſteries of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18002:22"/>
of God, and to walke in
his wayes. In briefe therefore I
addreſſe my ſelfe to you my deare
brethren: exhorting you to ſeale
vp vnto your ſoules and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the aſſurance of the hope that
is in you, by putting off the Old
Man, and putting on the New;
walking before God in holineſſe
and vprightnes of liuing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth
his children: For the
attaining whereof, to the glorie of
God, and the good of his Church;
I thought it very behouefull to
write this ſhort Diſcourſe vppon
<hi>Reſtitution;</hi> which is ſo eſpeciall a

wiſhing from my very heart. That

all men would beware how they
offer wrong, and after offences
paſt to make ſatisfaction: likewiſe
that thoſe which ſuffer wrong,
would not be carried headlong to
