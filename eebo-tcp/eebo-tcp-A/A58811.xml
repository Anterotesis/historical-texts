            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THough I esteem my self as
much as <hi>I</hi> deserve, and perhaps
a little more, yet <hi>I</hi> thank God
<hi>I</hi> was never yet so partial to my self, or
fond of my own Conceptions, as to
think the Publication of them an Act
of Charity, either to the world, or to
the Bookseller; and as for this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<hi>I</hi> assure you, had not you had a
<pb facs="tcp:98050:3"/>
better opinion of it then <hi>I; I</hi> should
have been so charitabl as to have kept
it within doors, and not to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it to the open Air, in which <hi>I</hi>
have known many wiser discourses to
have gotten their bane; but <hi>I</hi> shall not
be so unmannerly as to controul your
opinion, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> yet I doubt had not been
so favourable to me, had not your
Judgments been bribed by your Zeal
to the Protestant Religion, against the
Adversary whereof this discourse was
designed, perhaps the Protestant Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who is unacquainted with the
transactions of the last 600 years, may
think <hi>I</hi> have been too severe upon the
<hi>Roman</hi> Religion, charging it with
such bloudy Principles, and Practises:
to which <hi>I</hi> shall say no more then this;
that if <hi>I</hi> have falsified its Character, or
represented it fouler than it is: let me
<pb facs="tcp:98050:3"/>
indure the shame, and punishment of
a common Calumniator; but if I have
drawn it according to its own natural
Features, and Complexions; it is not
my fault that it appears deformed, and
if it be as bad as 'tis represented, it
makes invectives enough against it
self, and carries its Satyrs in its own
bosom: But what I have said of it is
all matter of Fact, which I have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the testimony of their own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
who cannot be supposed to be
false witnesses against themselves, and
if, after this, any one should be so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
as to suspect me of forgery;
let him peruse the Martyrologies
of the six last Centuries, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them with the bloodiest of all the
ten Pesecutions: and I doubt not but
he will be of my opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> that
<hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Dioclesian</hi> were but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:98050:4"/>
Persecutors, and Bunglers in cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty
compared with the infallible Cut-throats
of the Apostolical Chair.</p>
            <p>Having thus accounted for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty
of this discourse; I have no more
to say for it, but only this; that howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it may succeed, it was well intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if it prove any way instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
to alay the un-Christian heats, and
Animosities among us, to promote
the peace of the Church, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Protestant Religion, I
have my design: and though <hi>I</hi> should
be defeated in this, it will be some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to me, that <hi>I</hi> have honour'd
my self before the world by this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress,

            <head>A Sermon Preached before the Right
Honorable the LORD MAYOR and
Court of Aldermen, Novemb. 1673.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Luke 9. 56.</bibl>
               <q>For the son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but
to save them.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the glory of the Christian Religion, that it
hath conquered the World, and triumphed over
all that opposed it, without any other weapon but
its own victorious Beauty, and reasonableness: had
it been Proclaimed by the mouths of Canon, or march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
like <hi>Paracelsus</hi> his Daemon, upon the pummel of
the Sword: it had been Rivalled by sundry successful
Impostures; and the Alcheron it self would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
Victories with it: but in this it hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence
of all the Religions that ever were, that it
atchieved its Conquest without Scrib or Sword,
without the aid of Worldly Force, or Policy: that by
its own native Light, it Vanquished the Ignorance and
Prejudice of the World; and by pure dint of Reason,
subdued mens minds to its Impire: for 'twas not by
Racks and Tortures, that it Converted Infidels, &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Hereticks; but by Reason, and Miracles; and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98050:5"/>
till it began to be sophisticated with temporal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests,
and designs, it taught its followers only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
but not to inflict Persecutions: for this was their
language in the purer Ages, <hi>Non est Religionis, cogere
Religionem, quae suscipi debet sponte, non vi,</hi> as <hi>Tertull.</hi>
expresses it. Religion presseth no man to her service,
and disdains to have any Followers, but Volunteers;
but when once its Followers began to bend it to their
interest, and make it the Solicitor of their temporal
designs, to break into Parties, and imbarque their own
Reputation, and in the success of those disputable Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
that distinguished them, then according as they
had the luck to succeed in their Disputes, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Emperors, they began to solicit, and arm the
temporal power against their Adversaries; in which
bad practice, they imitated those, whom in all other
things they did condemn; namely the <hi>Arrians</hi> the
<hi>Circumcellians,</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi> who were the first
Christians that either perswaded, or practised persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and yet for a long while so abhorrent it was
from the temper of Christians, that <hi>Vrsatus,</hi> and <hi>Ithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
two otherwise Catholick Bishops, for perswading
<hi>Maximus</hi> to destroy the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> were branded
by their Brethren with an infamous Character, and
sharply reproved by the good Bishop of <hi>Trevers,</hi> who
plainly tells them,<note place="margin">Sulp. Sev. Hist. lib. p. 152.</note> 
               <hi>Satis, superque suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
ut Episcopali sententia haeretico Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati
Ecclesijs pellerentur: novum est, &amp;
inauditum nefas: ut causam Ecclesiae Judex seculi judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caret:</hi>
It is sufficient that Heriticks be banished by the
Church as Out-laws, from the Communion of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans:
but it is a now and unheard of wickedness, that a
Cause of Religion should be judged and punished at a
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98050:5"/>
secular Tribunal; and yet this was above 370 years
after Christ: but as the Churches fortunes grew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and her Sons grew worse, and some of her Fathers
worst of all: so Persecution and Tyranny prevailed in
Christendom, till at last it was baptized, into the name
of Zeal, and enthroned among the graces of Religion:
for if we look into the History of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church,
we shall find Persecution first Preached from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Chair: the Popes whereof growing great, and
proud, and impatient of contradiction, began first to
murmure against the Tollerations of the Novatians,
which being a great eye-sore to those haughty Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates,
as soon as they had gotten power into their
hands, they rooted them out by Force and Violence,
but yet they had not so far abandoned all their natural
sense of mercy and goodness, as to proceed to blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
till the Divine Right of Fire and Faggot was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
by St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> that rabbid and furious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiary,
by whose instigation the <hi>Albigenses</hi> were
wasted by a dreadful War, and 180 of them burnt to
death, because they would not abjure their Religion:
which horrid butchery was acted by the
Commission of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third,<note place="margin">Antinin. pars 3. Tit. 19. cap. 1.</note>
who to encourage it, granted a plenary
pardon and indulgence to the Executioners, and now
like <hi>Lybian</hi> Tygers, having tasted Blood, they thirst
insatiably for more; and instead of Pastors turn
Buttchers to the Flock of Christ, by their repeated
Cruelties, converting that Church into an infamous
Slaughter-house of Christians, which was once so fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
a Seminary of Martyrs; and for these 600 years
bleeding, hath been the only Remedy those Spiritual
Mountebancks have prescribed, to cure the Diseased
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98050:6"/>
Church; and this hath been cryed up as their great
Catholicon; witness the infinite Slaughters they have
acted and instigated in <hi>Italy Bohemia,</hi> the upper and
lower <hi>Germany:</hi> witness the <hi>Spanish</hi> Inquisition, where
the Holy Fathers confute Hereticks with Racks and
Gibbets; witness the <hi>Parisian</hi> Massacre, where our
Religion was consuted only with Skenes, and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
witness the <hi>Marian</hi> days, wherein the <hi>Roman</hi>
Faith was defended so gloriously against all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
with only that Dreadful Text, <hi>Recant or Burn:</hi>
and if all this be not enough, witness that Horrid
<hi>Power Plot,</hi> the Prevention of which we now Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate;
a Villany so Foul and Monstrous, as was
never Parallell'd either in Fiction or History; and
compared with which, the most Tragick Scenes of
Melancholy Poets, and dismal Phantasms of Despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Souls, are but all Comick Tales, Subjects of Sport
and Laughter: a Tragedy so deep and bloody, that
certainly had the most barbarous <hi>Canibal</hi> in <hi>America</hi>
been hired to act it, the very thought of it must have
startled him into an Agony; and he could not but
have relented, considering thus with himself; I am
now giving Fire to a Train, which at one blow will
Ruine a whole Kingdom, tear in pieces its King and
Princes, and scatter their Members in the Air, strew
its Fields with the Limbs and Quarters of its slaughter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Nobles and Gentry, fill its Streets with the Threns
and Lamentations of woful Mothers, the shrieks and
out cryes of desolate Wives &amp; Children, shake its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Temples, and Royal Palaces into ruines, and in one
moment lay all its glory in the dust: and yet <hi>[O tell it
not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askalon!]</hi> All
these Cruelties were designed under the livery of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98050:6"/>
most merciful Jesus, and this Cannibals feast of fellow-Christians
blood prepared to entertain the Father of
Mercies, and the Prince of Love; as if they like the
Heathens Daemons, fed their hungry Nostrils with the
Niderous reeks and steams of humane sacrifices: Thus
by degrees you see Persecution is imbodyed into the
Romish Religion; and when Heresie is the Disease,
Ruine is the only Remedy: A sure one indeed; but
O how heavenly wide of those mild prescriptions of
the great Physician of souls! who being urged by his
own Disciples to revenge himself upon a company of
rude and obstinate Scismaticks, solemnly professes,
that he came not to destroy mens lives, but to save
them. The occasion of which words was an affront
which the <hi>Samaritans</hi> had offered to our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
who being notorious Scismaticks, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemies to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that worshipped at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
refused to entertain our Saviour for one night;
perceiving he was a <hi>Jew,</hi> and so of a contrary Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
to themselves, upon which <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
with great indignation, to see their blessed Master
so unworthily treated, request him, that after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Elias,</hi> they might call for fire from Heaven
to destroy them: but he no way approving their
motion, severely rebukes them for it, and plainly tells
them, that they knew not what spirit they were of; as
much as if he should have said; if you will needs imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
that Legal zelotick spirit <hi>Elias</hi> acted by; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
you pretend, you act not like my Disciples,
whose spirit and genius ought to be more tender and
merciful; and therefore, though these <hi>Samaritans</hi>
are of a different Sect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Religion, and will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
me, nor my Doctrine; yet far be it from me to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98050:7"/>
destroy them; for this is quite contrary both to my
temper, and the design of my coming; which is not
to destroy mens lives, but to save them. So that you
see the plain scope of the words is this; That to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
mens lives upon the score of Religion, is a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
contraty to the Spirit of Christ, and the design
of his Religion. Before I proceed to the proof of
this Proposition, I shall briefly endeavour to state, and
restrain it within its just bounds and limits: and they
are these four.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That it is not to be understood of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
that is in its own nature wicked and immoral:
for if a mans Religion teacheth Vice, or directly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronizeth
it, his Vice is not the less punishable, because
his Religion prompted him to it. Indeed if he keep
his wicked Opinion to himself, it cannot be punished,
because it cannot be known; but if he perswade
others to it, or practise it himself; it becomes matter
of fact, and is as punishable as the crime is it perswades
to: for the great Rules of Virtue and Good Life, are
so clear and perspicuous, that a man cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of them, without being faulty: and therefore if
a man imbrace a wicked Opinion, and act or spread
it, the matter of fact is justly punishable, according to
the proportion of its malignity. And indeed if wicked
actions were to be excused upon the score of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
or Opinion, Religion would be made a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
for all the villanies in the world; and there is
no crime so monstrous, but would make a shift to
shelter it self from punishment under the protection of
Conscience.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> And more particularly, that the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
is not to be understood of such Opinions, as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98050:7"/>
either directly, or in their immediate consequents,
undermine the foundations of Government: for Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
being indispensably necessary to the well-being
of the world, men ought to know that that can
be no good Religion which teacheth Doctrines,
whose consequents destroy it; and therefore its just
and reasonable it should be rooted out, as a dangerous
post, and nuisance to the publick interest; and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of the thing, will justifie the lawfulness of it:
For were Princes bound to tolerate ungovernable
principles, they must be Kings no longer than they
can get leave to reign, from the humour or conscience
of each hot-brained Opinionists; and all their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
must be dependant upon the little capricio's
of every peevish Zealot; the consequents of which
must be the dissolution of Government, and that an
in-let to all disorder and confusion: and therefore
those that under a pretence of Religion propagate
such principles, are justly accountable for all the
consequent inconveniences, and punishable accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Proposition is not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of our practice, but of our Judgements and
Opinions: for every man hath a natural Right, as he
is a Rationable creature, to judg for himself; and to
punish any one for so doing, is the greatest tyranny in
the world; it being an exercise of dominion over the
minds of men, which are subject only to the Empire
of God; but as for our practice, that's liable to the
restraints of humane Laws; and that as well in Sacred,
as in Civil Affairs; they cannot indeed oblige us to
do what God hath forbidden us, because his, being
the supreme Authority, ought to take place against
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98050:8"/>
all the countermands of any inferiour power whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
but then there are a world of things which remain
in a state of indifferency, and are left undetermined
both by the natural, and positive Laws of God: and
these are all liable to the commands and determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of humane Authority, and are the proper mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Civil and Ecclesiastical Laws; to the extent of
whose jurisdiction, there can be no other restraint,
than only the countermand of a Superiour Authority;
and therefore if there be nothing antecedently evil
enjoyned by the Laws, whether Civil, or Ecclesiastical,
we are bound to obey them; and if we do not, we are
justly punishable for our disobedience. Indeed if we
believe the thing enjoyned to be evil, though it be
not, we ought not to do it, in obedience to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
Authority of God, which we believe hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
it: but yet if we mistake, and the thing be
not evil, but in its own nature indifferent, we are just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
punishable for the not doing it, because our
mistake alters not the nature of the thing; if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,
it is a proper object of humane Laws, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we think it so or no, and as such may justly be
imposed; and the imposition being just, our not
obeying it must needs be justly punishable. In this
extremity therefore we have no other redress, but to
seek information, and get our mistaken consciences
better instructed; and if when we have done all, we
cannot alter our Opinion, our meek and patient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
to the penalty, will be our excuse before the
Tribunal of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And lastly, that the Proposition is not to
be understood of our making a publick profession of
our Opinions, so as to disturb the Peace of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98050:8"/>
Church with them, so long as men are humble and
modest in their dissent, and do not go about to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
their Opinions into Factions, and to divide
and rend the Church in the propagation of them, I see
no reason why they should be punished, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for them; but if men openly profess their dissent,
to the prejudice of the publick Peace and Intrest,
and doat so much upon their own conceits, as to
phancy them necessary for all the rest of Mankind,
and consequently go about to vex their neighbours,
provoke their Rulers, and unsetttle the Government
for the propagation of them: if through an inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Zeal for their own notions, they should be
active and industrious to make a Party against the
Church, and withdraw others from her communion,
they are offenders to the publck Peace, and as such
are justly liable to punishment: for they ought to
consider, that unless their Opinion be of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
than the Churches Peace, it ought to vail, and
give way to it, and that there are no Opinions
weighty enough to ballance the Churches Peace,
whose contraries do not undermine Christianity it
self, and utterly defeat the ends of Christian Society:
for everyman is obliged, by vertue of being in Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to do his utmost to preserve the honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trest
of it, and to joyn in all acts of it, so far as they
tend thereunto; and dissent from every thing which
tends to the apparent ruine of that Society. Now the
main end of Christian Society, being the honour of
God, and the salvation of souls: the primary reason
of mens entring into Churches, or Christian Societies,
is to advance these ends, and to joyn in all acts of the
Society they are listed into, so far as they tend to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98050:9"/>
advancement of them; but if any thing be required
of us directly repugnant to these ends, we are bound
to manifest and declare our dissent from them, and if
for so doing we are <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cast out of the particular Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Society; by so doing, and suffering, we preserve
our communion with the Catholick Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians;
but if I am never so much perswaded that such
a practice or Article of the Church is an errour; yet
if it be not such an errour as doth defeat the great
ends of Christian Society, I am bound either to keep
my parswasion to my self, or at least not to disturb
the Peace of the Church in my indeavours to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
it to others; because, next to the honour of
God, and the salvation of souls, the Churches Peace
is to be valued above all things whatsoever; and
therefore is not to be disturbed for the sake of every
little errour, and trifling Opinion: It is sufficient that
we are allowed the liberty of opining, and are not
deprived of our natural right of judging for our
selves; and we ought not to complain, though we
should be restrained by Laws and penalties, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Parties against the Church, and propagating our
little Opinions into Factions; since if we will not
restrain our selves, without such a restriction, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
there should be any Peace among Christian
Societies; every hot-brain'd Opinionist will be
making a Party for himself; and every differing Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
will grow into a Sect; and so there will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
dividing and subdividing, till the Christian
world be crumbled into as many Churches, as there
are Opinions; and as many Opinions as there are
men: for whilst every one is zealously propagating
his little Opinion, no man will let his Brother be quiet:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98050:9"/>
this man will be ready to burst till he hath vented
himself; and the other will be as impatient till he hath
contradicted what he hath said: and whilst both are
thus zealous to proselite each other, neither will be
content with a single conquest; but the publick must
be disturbed, and by the Zeal of the contending Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
rent into infinite Sects and Divisions; so that you
see it is indispensibly necessary, that there should be
some restraint, though not upon mens Opinions, yet
upon their publick profession of them, since without
it, the Church will be inevitably exposed to perpetual
tumults and disturbances. Having thus stated and
bounded the Proposition, you see the plain meaning
of it is this, That it is contrary to the Spirit of Christ,
and the genius of Christianity, to destroy or perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
men for meer Opinions, or errours in Religion:
that it is so, I shall indeavour to prove from these fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Instances.</p>
            <p>I. It is contrary to that tenderness and compassion
which Christianity requireth of us: For our Religion
enjoyns us to sympathize with the miserable; and not
to add afflictions to the afflicted; and therefore falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
being the natural imperfection, and unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of humane understandings, the errours of them
should rather be the subject of our pity, than our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:
for 'tis as much out of our power, not to err,
as not to be sick or die: and we may as reasonably
punish a man for not being immortal, as for not being
infallible: for the seeds of fallibility are sown in the
nature of our understandings, as well as those of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
in the temper of our bodies: and we can no
more avoid being mistaken in all instances than we
can prevent the consumption of our radical moisture:
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98050:10"/>
all we can do is to endeavour not to err: to stand as
fast as we can in the center of Truth; but if when we
have done so, we should reel on either hand towards
the circumference of errour; we have done our duty,
and were not bound not to be mistaken: for no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
can reach a mans conscience, if it be impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;
we cannot be bound to do more than our best;
to have the understanding of an Angel, or to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible;
for these are things that are not within the
sphere of our choice, and therefore are no matters of
Law, or subjects of rewards and punishments: 'Tis
true, errour is many times occasioned by a corrupt
byas in the will; and mens understandings are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
mis-led by their lusts; and then indeed the
errour hath a guilt derived to it from that evil prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
to which it owes its original: but if we see men
honest in their lives, we are bound to think them so
in their errours too; and if their errours be only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
mistakes, what an inhumanity is it to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
them for that which is their misery only, and not
their sin! who but a <hi>Barbarian</hi> would cut a mans
throat, for being poor, or blind, or lame? and is it
not altogether as barbarous, and cruel to destroy a
man for that, which is the poverty, and blindness, and
lameness of his understanding? what is this, but to
lay load upon load; to trample upon the prostrate, and
heap miseries on the miserable? Suppose that a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
education, different Books and company, have
cast thy Brothers understanding into a different
figure from thine; is it reasonable that therefore thou
shouldest persecute and destroy him? or rather is it
not as unreasonable, as if thou shouldest cut off his
head, because he hath a dimple upon his chin, or a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98050:10"/>
mould on his cheeks, or some line in his face that
renders him unlike thee? suppose he hath the ill luck
to believe some Proposition, which to you and I seems
wild, absurd and unreasonable, must we presently beat
out his Opinion with his brains, because the poor soul
was so unfortunate as to be mis-led by education, and
imposed upon by Authority and Custom, which we
see do so often cheat the honestest minds; and like a
mighty whirlpool, having once sucked a man in, do
keep his head under water, and make it almost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for him to emerge, or recover himself? How
can such a piece of cruelty, do ye think, consist with
the tenderness and compassion which our Religion
enjoyns.</p>
            <p>II. It is destructive of the union and harmony
among Christians, which the Christian Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
for certainly the design of Christianity is not
to reconcile mens notions, or to beget in the world
an universal harmony in systems of orthodox Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which considering the frame of humane nature,
the infinite variety of mens ages and complexions,
and the different sizes of our understandings, would
be, I doubt, as vain a project, as to attempt to build
a Castle in the Aire nor indeed is it necessary that
men should be all of one Opinion, any more than
that all should be of one humour and temper: for as
in these, Divine Providence hath made a great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,
in which there is both beauty, and convenience:
so perhaps for the same reason it hath contrived va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Opinions, in which if there were an universal
harmony, mankind would be at a loss for subjects of
discourse, and so be deprived of a great part of the
pleasures of conversation. The union therefore
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98050:11"/>
which our Religion doth so studiously design, and
zealously promote, is that of hearts and affections, and
this, I doubt not, might well enough consist with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
Opinions, were they but managed with that
Humility, Modesty, and Charity which becomes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
were we but so modest, as to propose our Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
calmly, or to keep them to our selves; so
humble as not to over-value our own notions, and
fancy them necessary for all the rest of mankind; so
Charitable, as to alow our Brethren a liberty of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining,
and not to Damn and Persecute them, because
their Brains are of a different Figure from ours; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
imagin why difference in Opinions should more
disturb the Church, than difference in Faces; for such
a demeanour one towards another would infallibly
keep our Charity alive, which when all is done, is
the strongest ligament of Christian Society, and the
surest band of the Communion of Saints; for this will
twine and clasp our souls together, and tye us one to
another by the heart strings: But the destroying mens
lives upon the score of their Opinions, is the most
effectual way in the world to supplant Charity. For
how is it possible, considering the passions of humane
nature, that the Persecuted Party should love their
Persecutors, whom they see armed with Fire and Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to destroy them? and when once they hate them (as
they will soon do when they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them) their
passion will immediately provoke their Reason to
damn and censure them, which is the only means that
Persecuted People have a stay to the stomach of their
hungry Vengeance, till they have power, and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to glut it in the blood of their Persecutors:
and if in the revolution of things, the Persecuted
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98050:11"/>
should get above their Persecutors, what can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
but that to preserve themselves, they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
them from whom they can expect nothing
but destruction, should another revolution mount
them uppermost again; and so Christendom will be
made a Cock-pit of Cruelties, and as often as mens
understandings are deceived, and abused; so often
there will be new Executions and Massacres, which
must therefore needs be the more cruel and unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
because they are so Consecrated with a pretence of
Religion: for when Religion, which should be the
Antidote of our Cruelty, proves its greatest Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
it must needs run on the faster into mischief, by
how much that which stopped its course before, drives
it on with the greater violence; so that by Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
men upon the score of Opinion, we do what in
us lies, to banish Charity out of the World; and in the
room of that Love and Union, which our Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns,
to introduce nothing but Rage, Revenge, and
Cruelty; and to make Christendom more Barbarous
th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. It's contrary to that method which Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
prescribes us for the Convincing Deceived, and
Eronious Persons <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for the only Remedy our Holy
Religion prescribes <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Cure of Errour, is Charity,
and Forbearance Piety and Reason; for the sense
and Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is described in these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 24. <hi>The Servants of
the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men; in
meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if
God peradventure will give them Repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
the Truth.</hi> So that unless we can torture
men without striving with them, and meekly instruct
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98050:12"/>
them by cutting their throats, its evident by this
Text, we must either not persecute men, or quit the
title of being the servants of God. So also the same
Apostle in <hi>Gal. 6. 1. Brethren, if any man be overtaken
with an errour, ye that are spiritual restore such a one
in the spirit of meekness.</hi> And sure there is some dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between destroying, and restoring a man; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the halter, and the spirit of meekness. 'Tis true
indeed, the procedure of the Gospel was more severe
and rigorous against wicked and obstinate Hereticks;
but then it was not for their Opinions barely: but for
the wickedness of their Opinions, and obstinate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance
in them, to the disturbance of the Churches
Peace; both which I have shewed you are excepted
cases: but yet as the Gospel was a great deal tenderer
of making Hereticks, than the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is; so
was it also a great deal gentler in punishing them; for
its utmost severity against them was excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which at the worst did not destroy mens souls;
but only consigned them to that sad portion they had
deserved, and should have received independantly
from the Churches censure; but the primary design
of it was to scare them into a lober mind; which if it
obtained, it proceeded no further <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that in its own
nature it was medicinal; and though it was a distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and uneasie potion, by reason it gave the Devil
possession of their bodies, to torture and afflict them;
yet in it self 'twas holesome, and restorative, and did
no man hurt, unless he would himself; but if he
would be obstinate in his wickedness, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he felt the woful effects of it, he might thank him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
for all that followed, it being his own obstinacy
that actuated the Judgement, and gave a sting to it.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98050:12"/>
but to destroy a mans life is as strange a way to cure
him of his Errors, as cutting off his head is to cure
him of the Toothach; for the only way to reduce
him, is to perswade his understanding, which we shall
hardly do by beating out his Brains; 'tis true indeed,
corporal punishments may make a man dissemble his
Opinion, and profess contrary to his Conscience and
Judgement; but they have no more Vertue in them
to inform his Conscience, or rectifie his Judgement
than syllogisms, or demonstrations have, to cure him
of the Stone or Strangury, and therefore what ever he
may pretend, he cannot think his Opinion truer or
falser, because you threaten to wrack and torture
him for it, for such premisses can infer, no conclusion
but only that of his life, so whilst you attempt by
such rough arguments to force him into your Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
you may perhaps vanquish his Courage, but
you will never alter his Judgement; and if you make
him a Hypocrite, and terrifie him into a Profession of
what he doth not believe; instead of erecting a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe
to God, you shall but build a Monument for the
Devil: And as Persecution is a bad remedy for Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
so 'tis a worse Antidote against it; for if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
Ecclesiastical history you will find, that Fire and
Faggot hath made more Hereticks, than it ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed,
witness the <hi>Priscillianists,</hi> who as <hi>Sulpitius</hi>
tells us, were so far from being suppressed by the
death of <hi>Priscillian,</hi> that they were more confirmed
by it, and grew much more numerous; and it is the
complaint of one of the <hi>Italian</hi> Inquisitors, that he
had found after 40 years experience,<note place="margin">Ger. Busdrag. Epist. ad C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdid. Pisar.</note>
wherein they had destroyed above
100000 Hereticks; they were so far
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98050:13"/>
from being suppressed or weakened, that they were
much more strengthened and encreased. For there
is a popular pitty that follows all persons in misery,
which breeds likeness of affection, and that very often
likeness in Opinion; and so much the rather, because
he that Persecutes another for his Opinion, gives the
multitude reason to suspect, that that is the best argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he can urge against it: whereas on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he that dies for his Opinion, and seals it with his
Blood, confirms it with the most popular argument in
the world; for although [as one says] laying a wager
be an argument of confidence, rather then of truth; yet
when a man stakes his life and soul, it argues at least,
that he is resigned, and Honest, and Charitable, and
Noble; and this among weak people will more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
his Opinion then reason, and demonstration:
So by persecuting of Error, we do what in us lyes to
Canonize it; and by Crowning of it wth the glory
of Martyrdom; we take an effectual course to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the number of its Voterys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IV.</hi> And lastly, It is contrary to that care, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
regard of Truth, which Christianity injoyns us;
for in many instances there is so near a resemblance
between Truth and Error, that our purblind reason
can hardly distinguish between them; and therefore
if Error were left to the Persecutions of such fallible
creatures as we, Truth would be exposed to inevitable
danger; for if you set a blind man to weed your Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
you must expect that sometimes he will pull up
flowers instead of weeds: and if we that are so prone
to err, should be authorized to root up Error, 'twould
be impossible but we should sometimes mistake, and
root up Truth instead of Error; and therefore our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98050:13"/>
Saviour considering this, hath reserved that power in
his own hands, as you may see at large in <hi>Matth. 13.
24.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Another Parable put he forth unto them, saying,
The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man that
soweth good seed in his field, and while men slept, his
enemy came and sowed tares among his wheat, and went
away:</hi> upon which this mans servants ask him, in the
28 <hi>verse,</hi> if they should go and gather up the tares; to
which he answers him, <hi>nay, lest while ye gather up the
tares, ye root up also the wheat with them: let both
grow together until the Harvest.</hi> By the field here, all
men agree, we are to understand the Church, and by
the seed sown in it, that of the pure and sound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of Religion; so that all the difficulty of the
Parable, lyes in understanding what is meant by the
tares, and what by the not gathering the tares: By the
the tares, must be meant either persons of wicked lives,
or of false and evil Opinions; and by the not gathering
these tares, must be understood, either the not cutting
them off by the Temporal sword, or the not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating,
and cutting them off by the Spiritual
sword; but by the tares, cannot be meant persons of
wicked lives, for then the Text would forbid the
punishment of evil doers; by not gathering the tares,
cannot be meant the not cutting them off by the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
sword, for then the Text would forbid the Church
to excommunicate either wicked livers, or obstinate
Hereticks: And therefore of necessity by the tares,
must be meant persons of evil Opinions; and by the
not gathering them, the not destroying them by the
Temporal sword, and this Interpretation is very much
favoured, by the reason that is given of the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
least ye also root up the wheat with them; as if
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98050:14"/>
he should have said, as for external wickednesses, I
freely leave them to the lash of humane Judicatures;
the rectitude or obliquity of them being far more
discernable, then of inward speculations, and Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but I will by no means trust you with the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Errors; least through interest, passion, or
mistake, you should exterminate the Truth with it,
for you being so fallible, and apt to err, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
but sometimes you must miss the mark; mistake
the wheat for tares, and hit the Truth, though you
aime at Error. Having thus shewed you how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it is to the spirit, and genius of Christianity, to
destroy mens lives, upon the score of mere Opinion,
or Religion; I shall now conclude what I have said,
with one inference from the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Use,</hi> From hence I infer, the Antichristian tyranny of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath fleshed her self with so
many slaughters, and dyed her Garments so deep in the
blood of Christians, upon no other score, but only
their differing from her, in some (at least) disputable,
and harmless Opinions; because upon her bare word
they could not believe propositions, which to them
seemed contrary to sense, and reason, and Scripture
and their Faith had not stomach enough, to digest
the most fulsome absurdities and swallow the grossest
contradictions: Blessed Jesu! that ever a Church
pretending to be thy Spouse, should be so forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of thy mercies, as to spill the blood of so many
thousands of Christians, upon no other account,
but because they could not believe her absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such a Philosophers Stone, as to turn attrition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
effectual Repentance; and a few words of a Priest,
such a powerful charm, as to conjure a man to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in an instant: and because thou hast made holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98050:14"/>
the sole condition of eternal life, durst not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon confraternities, stations, and priviledge-Altars,
<hi>Agnus Dei</hi>'s, little offices, amulets, and such
like hallowed baubles, because they could not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
Images, and pray to God, and Saints in the same
form of words, and durst not run from Scripture, to
uncertain traditions, and from ancient traditions, unto
new pretences; from reasonable services, into blind
devotions; from believing the necessity of inward
acts of piety, and devotion, into a dangerous tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of resting upon the <hi>Opus Operatum,</hi> the meer
numbring of so many Beads, and saying of so many
prayers! that ever Christians should be destroyed by
Christians, for not believing all those monstrous ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities,
which transubstantiation implies, that
Christs body may be in a thousand places at the same
time; that it may stay in a place while it is going from
it, be both in, and out of the same place, in the same
moment; that it may come from Heaven to Earth,
and yet never stir out of Heaven, nor be any where
in the way between; that his whole body is in each
crumb of each consecrated wafer, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being lessened, all its parts are crouded up into
one single attom, and lye all within the compass of a
Pin's head, though it be 4 foot long; that though it be
whole and entire in every crumb, and there be 10000
of these crumbs in 10000 distant places; yet doth it
not multiply into 10000 bodies, but still remains one
and the same: now what greater tyranny can there
be, than to destroy and massacre men for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
such a mass of palpable contradictions? and
yet for these, and such like causes it is that <hi>Rome</hi> hath
so often washed her barbarous hands in Protestant
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98050:15"/>
blood; imbroiled the Christian world, and by the
terrour of her awful thunder-bolts, scared Subjects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Rebellion against their lawful Soveraigns, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigns
into persecution of their natural Subjects: of
the truth of which I could give you a thousand forein
instances; but in complyance with the time and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
I shall rather chuse to confine my self at home:
to destroy mens lives upon the score of Religion, was
a practice never known in <hi>England,</hi> till the time of
<hi>Henry</hi> the 4th; who being an Usurper, and so liable to
many enemies, both forein and domestick; sought to
endear the Pope to him, who was then moderator of
Christendom, by sending him, as a token of his love
and duty, the blood of his enemies: and for many
years after this was the yearly sacrifice our <hi>English</hi>
Monarks were fain to offer up to the <hi>Roman</hi> Idol; and
whensoever through their own weakness, they either
feared, or were forced to flatter him; they had no
other way to appease the angry Demon, but by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their children to pass through the fire to him, and
glutting his thirsty vengeance with their blood: but
when afterwards our <hi>English</hi> Monarchs threw off the
<hi>Roman</hi> yoak, and would no longer be the Popes
Leeches; he immediately issueth out his Bulls, and
excommunications to alarum their subjects into a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against them: for immediately upon Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s coming to the Throne, Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the 4th.
refuseth to acknowledge her, pretending this Crown
to be a fee of the Papacy, and that therefore it was
audaciously done of her, to assume it without his
leave; and because she would not turn out immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
when her great Landlord had given her such
fair warning, Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the 5th. takes out a Writ of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98050:15"/>
Ejectment, issueth out his Bull, and deposeth her; in
which he thus expresserh himself, <hi>Volumus, &amp; jubemus
ut adversus Elizabetham Angliae Reginam subditi arma
capessant;</hi> it is our will and command that the Subjects
of <hi>England</hi> take up Arms against their Queen: upon
which followed the Northern Rebellion, and sundry
private attempts of the Papists, to murder her: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 15th. having two Bastards to
provide for, one of his own, and another of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
he bestowed the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> upon the
one, and that of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the other; but neither
of these prevailing, <hi>Sixtus</hi> the 5th. curses her afresh,
and publishes a crusade against her; and bequeaths
the whole right of her Dominions to <hi>Philip</hi> the 2d.
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but when neither the Popes bounty,
nor the blessings of his successors, nor the <hi>Spanish</hi> Arms,
nor <hi>Italian</hi> Arts, could prevail against God's providence,
which till the end of her daies pitched its tents about
her. Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8th. seeing there was no other
remedy, resolved to let her go like a Heretick as she
was, and to take more care that another Heretick
might not succeed her; for which end he sent over
two Breves into <hi>England;</hi> one to the Clergy, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to the Laity; commanding them not to suffer any
but a Catholick, though never so near in blood to
succeed her; the design of which was to exclude King
<hi>James,</hi> who was the sole Heir apparent to the Crown;
upon which the Papists indeavoured to their utmost,
to prevent his coming in, and afterwards to throw him
out again; and when neither took effect, at last they
resolve to send him to Heaven with a vengeance, by a
blow of Gun-powder; which was a villany so black
and odious, that the Romanists themselves do blush
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98050:16"/>
to own it: And indeed, were it not so apparent from
the confessions of the Traitors themselves; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
the Jesuits to be their Conspirators, that
egged them on by their pernicious counsels; swore
them to secresie by the holy Trinity, and gave them
the Sacrament upon it, that they should neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
themseves from, nor discover it to others with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
common consent: I say, were it not for these, and
a thousand other notorious circumstances, one
would have thought it impossible such a hellish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
could ever have been acted under the wing and
patronage of the best Religion that ever was: but he
that shall consider the bloody principles with which
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church hath sophisticated Christianity,
must needs confess that there is no wickedness so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,
of which her Religion will not make her capable;
for 'tis decreed by the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, that in case
any Prince be a favourer of Hereticks, the Pope shall
discharge his Subjects from their allegiance, and give
away his Kingdom to some Catholick, who upon
rooting out those Hereticks, shall possess it without
contradiction: and 'tis the general Doctrine of her
most celebrated Divines, that the Pope hath power to
depose Kings at his pleasure; and this Father <hi>Parsons</hi>
determines to be a point of Faith, to believe it is in
the Popes power to depose Heretical Princes; and
that subjects are upon their being declared heretical,
thereby absolved from all duty of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to him;<note place="margin">

look into the Histories of these last 600
years,<note place="margin">De Reg. Inst. l. 1. c. 6.</note> we shall find their practice hath
made a bloody Comment on their Doctrines; for in
those days when Excommunications from <hi>Rome</hi> were so
terrible, and all things shrunk at the flash of those
Thunders; it was the ordinary Recreation of those
insolent Prelates, to play at Foot-ball with the Crowns
of Princes, and trample on the Necks of Emperors:

found by woful experience, who were abandoned of

Empires, defamed as Hereticks, and chased like Raskals.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98050:17"/>
These goodly Mirrours one would think were suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to warn all Christian Princes to shake off the Yoak

               </gap>ny woful Examples, there
should remain any doubt of the Tyrannick Cruelties
of <hi>Rome,</hi> let us Remember that pair of Royal Sacrifices
the two last <hi>Henry's</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> both barbarously mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by the Popes Executioners: the First by the
hand of a Fryar,<note place="margin">Orat. <hi>Sixt.</hi> 5th. Prited at <hi>Paris</hi> 1589.</note> whose Villany was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the <hi>5th</hi> in an
Oration to his Cardinals; wherein he
compares the Fact with the Incarnation
and Resurrection of Christ: and the Fryars Virtue and
Courage, and servent Love to God, to that of <hi>Judith,</hi>
and <hi>Eliazar,</hi> in the <hi>Maccabees.</hi> Blessed God! what
wickedness will these men stick at the head of whose
Religion Cannonizeth Regicide, and Christians mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a meritorious Virtue? and why should the Papists
be ashamed to own the <hi>Powder Treason,</hi> [which though
it may compare with the blackest Inte<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>gues of Hell,
and was foul enough to bring the Devil himself into

bloody Religion? But 'tis an old Maxim of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Politicks, never to own an unsuccessful Villany; and
without doubt had not the <hi>Parisian</hi> Massacre taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
in which 30000 Protestants were slaughtered in
one night, the Papists would have as loudly disclaimed
that, as now they do the <hi>Powder Treason:</hi> but it being
successful, the news of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> as their own <hi>Thua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
tells us,<note place="margin">Thuan. Hist. <hi>lib.</hi> 53.</note> was welcomed with Publick
Festivals, bonfires, and Tryumphs; the
Pope himself congratulating the Inhumane
cruelty of the <hi>French</hi> King, commending the Faith of
those bloudy Wretches, whose hands were imbrewed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:98050:17"/>
in the Slaughter, and distributing his Paternal Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings
among them: And without all controversie had
<hi>Faux</hi> and <hi>Catesby</hi> been but as successful as they, their
Faith had been as much praised, and their Persons as
much blessed; and the <hi>Fifth of November</hi> had been as
high a Festival in the <hi>Roman</hi> Calender, as it is now in
the <hi>English.</hi> Thus if you trace the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion in
all her late Progresses, you will find that her way hath
lead all along through a wilderness of Confusion, and
a Red Sea of Blood: and though now she exerciseth
less Cruelties in the World, than formerly; yet her
Will is the same, her Principles the same, her Docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Cutting Throats the same, though blessed be
God her Power and Interest is abated: For now a days,
Princes are grown too stout to kiss his Holiness's Toe,
to hold his Stirrup, and run like Lacquies at his heels:
Those Golden Days are gone, and he that was wont
to Command, is fain to Intreat his own Children;
and as an Ingenious Author hath observed, whilst
Princes can stand upon their own legs, they may goe
their own pace, as fast and as slow as they please; but
should any misfortune throw them upon all four, we
shall soon see his Holiness get up and Ride them what
pace he pleases: and being bestrid by such a furious
<hi>Jehu,</hi> to be sure they will want neither Whip nor Spur
to make them as swift to shed blood as ever. For thus at
present, the <hi>French</hi> King may allow his <hi>Hugonots</hi> what
liberty he pleases, and his Holiness is fain to sit still,
and be silent; being kept in aw by that Puissant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch,
whose Cannon Bullets, are grown too strong
for his Thunder-bolts: But the Case was otherwise
with <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>9th,</hi> who being weakened by Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and impoverished by civil Broils, was in a manner
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:98050:18"/>
necessitated to that Infamous Butchery at <hi>Paris,</hi> to appease
the Pope, and prevent the Excommunication he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
him, unless he speedily destroyed the <hi>Hugonots</hi> with
Fire and Sword: And indeed the Pope is bound both
by their Councels, and Canons to destroy Hereticks, if
he can; and which is all one, to Excommunicate their
Favourers: for this is decreed in the <hi>4th Lateran</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
that all Hereticks should be Excommunicated, and
then delivered up to the lash of the Secular Powers:
but if the Prince, or Secular Power being Required,
and Admonished by the Church, do not endeavour to
their utmost, to exterminate, and destroy these Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
he shall be presently Excommunicated by the
Metropolitan or Arch-Bishop; and if within a year he
doth not amend, his obstinacy shall be signifyed to the
Pope, <hi>Vt ex tunc ipse Vasallos ab ejus fidelitate denuntiet

Fire and Sword.</hi> Was not this a precious Vicar, do you
think, thus to doom men to slaughter, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
his own unreasonable dictates, before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Oracles of God himself? And yet these Bulls
of the Popes, with the rest of their <hi>Decretals, Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagants</hi>
and <hi>Clementines,</hi> are all inserted in the body
of the Canon Law of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> aud so are
made as good and current Popery as ever was coyned
in the Councel of <hi>Trent:</hi> and now, after all this, me
thinks 'tis impossible we should be so besorted, as to
trust to the cruel courtesies of <hi>Rome,</hi> whose Religion
breaths nothing but blood and slaughter. The
cry indeed of the Roman Factors among us, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Toleration, and liberty of Conscience;
and since the Laws have proscribed them for
their Treasonous Practices, and for swearing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Vassals to the Pope, whose countermands
(if they are faithful to their own Principles) must
evacuate all their obligations to their natural Prince;
What Tragical Exclamations do they make against
Persecution? as if they meant to have the mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poly
of it, that no body might persecute but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and though in the Popish Dominions, they are
as fell and rabbid as so many <hi>Lybean</hi> Tygers, yet no
sooner do they set foot upon the English shores, but
as if there were an Inchantment in the soil, the Wolves
turn Sheep immediately, or at least disguise themselves
in Sheeps cloathing: but if ever these sweet and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Gentlemen get into the Saddle again, we shall
soon find them in another note, and Persecution will
be zeal again, and Racks and Gibbets Catholick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
and there will be no way to illuminate the
understandings of us Hereticks, like the light of a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:98050:19"/>
Fagget: For how can we expect it should be
otherwise, when we reflect upon what is past, when
the <hi>Marian</hi> days are yet within our prospect? and 'tis
not half an Age ago since <hi>Ireland</hi> swam in Protestant
blood, which was spilt by the instigation of some of
these fawning Hypocrites, who now declaim forsooth
for liberty of conscience, and defie persecution and all
its works: But this pretence, its evident, is only a
coppy of their countenances, and without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
the bottom of their design is only to perswade
us to let them grow till they are strong enough to cut
our throats; for 'tis the subtilty of these Harpys never
to show their talons till they have their prey within
their reach: but if what they pretend were Real, Why
do they not allow what they plead for, and indulg
that liberty to dissenters abroad, which here they
crave for themselves? Why do they not as much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
against the Spanish Inquision, which hath been
confirmed by so many Bulls of their own Popes, as
they do against the English Laws, and condemn the
barbarous cruelties of the one, as well as the milder se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities
of the other! for till they do so, we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to believe that 'tis not against Persecution they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
but against being persecuted. But in the mean
time, how can we expect that they should be merciful
to our bodies, whose Religion damns our souls? or
that if ever they get uppermost, [which God prevent:]
they that are so uncharitable now, as to shut us out of
Heaven; should be so charitable then, as not to drive
us out of the world! For this is a Maxim founded
upon the experience of all Ages, That that Religion
which damns us when it is weak, will burn us when it
is able.</p>

Wherefore, since God in his mercy hath delivered
us from the Romish Tyranny; let us with thankful
hearts extoll and praise his goodness, and take heed
for the future, least by our divisions, or apostacies we
return again unto that yoak of bondage; and since the
Emissaries of <hi>Rome</hi> are now so busily pursuing their old
Maxim, <hi>Divide, &amp; Impera,</hi> and blowing the coals of
our divisions, in hope at last to warm their hands at
our flames; O that we would now study the ways of
peace, and reconciliation! and not like the miserable
Jews, fall out among our selves, while the <hi>Roman</hi> is
at our Gates; for all the time we are contending in
the Ship, our Enemy is boring a hole in the bottom;
and while we are fomenting our unhappy differences,
and tearing our own wounds wider, the Priest and
Jesuit are at work in our Doublets; who ever since
their Gunpowder-Treason was defeated, have been
strewing trains of Wild-fire among our selves, to make
us our own Executioners, and blow us up by our own
hands: For what else hath been their business among
us, but only to raise sects and factions, and sow dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
and Divisions in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
they know is the only Bulwork of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion

yet easily do. Would we but once lay aside our unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
passions, and prejudices, and study mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliances,
and prefer Religion before a Faction, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
some little Punctilioes to the soberer, and more
governable Dissenters: These things if they might
obtain amongst us, would yet undoubtedly secure us
against all the attempts of our Adversaries, and Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their most hopeful design; desperate, and unseasable:
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:98050:20"/>
but if we will be deaf to all the Arguments which our
common Interests, and dangers suggest to us; if we
will still squander into Sects and Parties, and nothing
will serve our turns but the Ruine of that poor Church
which for so many years hath been the Shelter, and
Sanctuary of the Protestant Religion: The time may
come perhaps, when we may dearly repent of our own
Follies, and remember, with tears in our eyes, that we
had once an opportunity to be happy. Let me therefore
beseech you, even by all that love you bear to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Religion, to your own safety, and to the lives,
and souls of your Posterity; to lay aside all Faction,
Bitterness, and Animosity; lest by your unchristian
Divisions, you open the Flood-gates of Popery on your
selves, and out a gap to let in the <hi>Stygian Lake</hi> of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
Idolatry, Superstition, and Blood: which
God of his Infinite Mercy avert. To whom be Honor,
and Glory, and Power, and Dominion, <hi>For ever.</hi>
