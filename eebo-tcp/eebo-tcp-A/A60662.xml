            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE intention of a Preface is to inform the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of something, which the Book it self cannot tell him of; and this matter relates for the most part, either to the Authors of the Work, or the Matter of the Book: Now this following Work has had many Authors, some of which are of great Antiquity and Veneration, and their Works are valuable, for that they are (some of them) the first things which were written in the World.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The first Book of <hi>Practical Physick,</hi> is (for the most part of it,) my own, deduced from a large Series of Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: The Author of which, was only the Translator and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

This <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> (who was also the Author of the Divine <hi>Pymander</hi>) lived, as some suppose, a long time before <hi>Moses:</hi> He received his Name of <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> i. e. <hi>Mercurius ter Maximus,</hi> The thrice greatest Intelligencer, because he was the first Intelligencer, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated knowledge to Mankind, by writing.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is reported to have been King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> without doubt was an <hi>Egyptian;</hi> and if you believe some <hi>Jews,</hi> even their <hi>

                     <hi>Work,</hi> for that it is by all confest to be originally written in the <hi>Hebrew Tongue,</hi> which he would not have done, had he not been an <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but rather in his <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Language.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But whether he was <hi>Moses</hi> or not, it is certain, he was an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> even as <hi>Moses</hi> himself also was; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the Age, it may be supposed (without much Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie) that he lived much about <hi>Moses's</hi> time; if he was not <hi>Moses,</hi> but another <hi>Egyptian,</hi> it is more than probable that he was King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> for as <hi>Franciscus Flussas</hi> thinks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chief <hi>Philosopher,</hi> he was according to the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Customs, preferred to be chief of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> and from thence to be the <hi>Chief Governour,</hi> or <hi>King.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. And as <hi>Paracelsus</hi> and <hi>Nollius</hi> say, He was called, <hi>Ter Maximus,</hi> for having a perfect and exact knowledge of all things contained in the World, (as this <hi>Aureus,</hi> or <hi>Golden Tractate,</hi> and his <hi>Divine Pymander</hi> witness) which things be divided into three Kingdoms, <hi>Mineral, Vegetable,</hi> and <hi>Animal;</hi> in the knowledge and understanding of which three be excelled, and transmitted to Posterity (tho in an <hi>AEnigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi> stile) the description of the <hi>Philosophers Quintessence.</hi> or <hi>Universal Elixir,</hi> which he made as the Receptacle of all Caelestial and Terrestial Virtues.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This <hi>Great Secret</hi> he discoursed, and delivered in the following work, part of which is also said to be found ingraved upon a <hi>Smaragdine Table,</hi> in the Valley of <hi>Ebron. Johannes Functius</hi> in his Chronology says, he lived in <hi>Moses</hi> his time, Twenty one Years before the Law was given in the Wilderness that of <hi>Suidas</hi> seems to confirm it, who says, <hi>Credo Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium Trismigistum sapientem Egyptium floruiffe ante Pharaonem.</hi> But this of <hi>Suidas</hi> may be applyed to several Ages, for that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was the General Name of many of their Kings: Or, possibly it was intended for some of those times, before the name of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was given to their su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Governours; which if so, must be more than 400 years before <hi>Moses;</hi> yea, before <hi>Abraham's</hi> descent into <hi>Egypt.</hi>

8. In this Book our <hi>Hermes</hi> gives you to understand, that he had the <hi>Great Secret</hi> of the <hi>Philosophick Work;</hi> and without doubt, if God ever appeared in any Man, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in him, as is evident both from this Book, and his <hi>Pyman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> In which Works he has communicated the sum of the Abyss, and the Divine knowledge to all posterity, whereby he has demonstrated himself to be not only an inspired <hi>Divine,</hi> but also a deep <hi>Philosopher;</hi> obtaining his Wisdom rather from <hi>God,</hi> than from <hi>Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. As for some of the next <hi>Authors,</hi> there is not much of their History extant, <hi>Kalid</hi> is reported to be a <hi>Persian King;</hi> and <hi>Geber,</hi> an <hi>Arabian King;</hi> without doubt, both of them were throughly learned in the Mysteries of Nature, but chiefly in this <hi>Philosophick Art. Artefius</hi> was a <hi>Jew,</hi> of whom it is reported, he lived a thousand Years; how truly, I will not say; himself affirms it, and very wise Men, such as <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celsus, Pontanus,</hi> and others seem to give Credit to it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Flammel</hi> was a <hi>French Man,</hi> and originally a poor Scrivener, yet left so great Monuments behind him as must convince the most incredulous that he knew the Secret, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed such mighty Works at his own proper Costs and Charges, as the most opulent Prince in <hi>Europe</hi> can never do the like. I know a Gentleman who went to view these mighty Buildings, and their Records: The Archives and Governors of those places, he told me, own the matter of fact, but deny the Means; say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Flammel</hi> was a very Pious Man, and went a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage to St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Gallicia,</hi> for a Reward of which Piety, the Holy Saint bestowed that vast Treasure upon him by way of Miracle; thereby denying the power of Art, by which it was effected, to establish it in a Miracle for a Confirmation of the <hi>Romish Church.</hi>

                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Roger Bachon,</hi> or <hi>Bacon,</hi> was born <hi>Anno 1215.</hi> near <hi>Ilchester</hi> a great Town in <hi>Somerset shire,</hi> of an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably Family: He was brought up in the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he made an incredible Progress in the <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences:</hi> He applied himself to <hi>Philosophy,</hi> and the
<pb facs="tcp:65913:6"/>
search of <hi>Natures Secrets,</hi> one of his Tutors being <hi>Edmund</hi> Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and became a <hi>Franciscan Fryar</hi> in a Convent at <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12. He wholly laid himself out in a diligent search of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the knowledge of the <hi>Tongues</hi> and <hi>Arts;</hi> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with many Great and Learned Men, expending some Thousands of Pounds in trying Experiments, most of which were supposed to be those of the <hi>Philosophers Stone:</hi> Nor did he bestow his cost or time in vain; for 'tis believed he attained to the knowledge of the Secret he sought after.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. By this means he did such great things in Nature, and such Wonders, that not only the Ignorant, but also some Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men reputed him to be <hi>Magician,</hi> or <hi>Conjurer,</hi> saying, <hi>He made a Brazen Head, which speak, by the help of the Devil:</hi> Such was the Ingratitude of that Age, that he was Persecuted by the very Men of his own Order, and Religion: For being Accused of <hi>Magick</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> Pope <hi>Nicholas IV.</hi> (who disliked, or understood not his Learning) cast him into Prison, and kept him close Prisoner many Years.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. He wrote many Books upon several <hi>Sciences,</hi> as <hi>Grammar, Logick, Geometry, Cosmography, Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, Astrology, Musick, Ethicks, Physicks, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>physicks, Perspective, Opticks, Divinity, History, Physick, Chymistry,</hi> and <hi>Alchymy:</hi> How many Books be wrote is uncertain; 'tis to be doubted all are not in being, and what have out-lived the injury of time, many of them are difficult to be procured, as yet lying hid in Manuscript. As he was an <hi>Universal Scholar,</hi> so he wrote well in all <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> and <hi>Johannes Balaeus, de Scriptoribus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae,</hi> gives us the Titles of above an Hundred Books which he had wrote in all the choilest and most useful <hi>Sciences,</hi> of which, these we have here made <hi>English,</hi> are two of them, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. He was the greatest <hi>Critick</hi> of his Age, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vehemently of the Ignorance, and Ingratitude of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempories, there being many created then, <hi>Arte ulla, Artium</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. For the reason therefore of his Learning it was, that he was Accused of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and upon Malicious Pretences, they took from him his Books and Writings, long before Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> cast him into Prison; for which cause he complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Pope <hi>Clement IV.</hi> his Friend, saying, <hi>The Priests and Fryars have kept me starving in close Prison, nor would they suffer any one to come at me.</hi> And some Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant fellows, that would have been accounted Learned Men, when they could not understand his Books, condemned them as Books of the <hi>Black Art.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. <hi>Leland</hi> saith, <hi>He wrote many Books, but that it was as easie to gather the scattered Leaves of the Sybils, as to Collect but the Titles of them:</hi> For which, and his siding with <hi>Grosthead,</hi> in opposing the <hi>Pope,</hi> and some other <hi>Heresies,</hi> as they called them, he was Accused of <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> and by the said Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> seized, and kept close Prisoner as aforesaid; in which Prison, some say, he died for Grief, or with his hard Usage, which was in the 78th. Year of his Age, in the Year of Our Lord, 1292. and was Buried in the <hi>Franciscans</hi> Church, in <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                  <p n="20">20. We come now to the matter of the Book: As to the first Book, we say it is a Practical Discourse upon some princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Diseases, deduced from the Fountain of Experience it self: wherein we have delivered a new Hypothesis, concerning the Generation of Sand, Gravel and Stones in Humane Bodies, and now brought to light purely by Reason, and Mechanical Operations: The thing as it is noval, it is rational, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt is possible to be improved to many singular advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, if a Prudent Man has it under his consideration.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The Works of <hi>Hermes</hi> we Translated with what care and circumspection we could: The First Book was in the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy divided only into Seven Chapters; we for more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent reading have divided it into Thirteen, to which, as a Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> added the <hi>Smaragdine Table.</hi> The <hi>Latin</hi> was barbarous and uncouth, scarcely intelligible, and done out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Languages,</hi> when Learning was at its lowest ebb; so that it may easily be believed, a free, natural, and true Version, would have been difficult to be made by the best of <hi>Scholars,</hi> who had been unacquainted with <hi>Chymical Learning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. As it was one of the first of Writings, and wrote in the first of times, so its Method seems to be rude, the Language obscure, and the Connection of the Discourse not natural; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was designed, in respect to the subject matter; or was
<pb facs="tcp:65913:7"/>
Accidental, as being written in the Infancy of the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the knowledge of Logical method and reasoning was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, I shall leave to others to determine.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. This I am confident of, it contains the substance of the <hi>Philosophick Learning,</hi> the root of the matter, the true Process of the great <hi>Elixir,</hi> but clouded with <hi>AEnigmatical Discourses,;</hi> yet not so absolutely obscured, but that in some places he seems to unvail the truth, and expose the Secret; as they who seriously Contemplate the 12th and 13th Chapters, will easily perceive. I have heard several Great, and Learned Men say, that they received a greater light into the <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Work,</hi> from these Discourses of <hi>Hermes</hi> (tho' seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly rude and unpolished) than from all the Writings in the World, how speciously soever they were composed.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. For this reason sake, we essayed to write a Comment upon his first Book, or, explicate the meaning of the <hi>Ancient Hermes;</hi> 1. From the Analogy of Principles. 2. From the natural reason of things. 3. From manifold Experiments. 4. From the Universal Consent, and Sentiments of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> being compared: So that we cannot say, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is so much ours, as that we have deduced it by a Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Argumentation out of the many, and Voluminous writings of the Ancients, and others, the most Learned in this Science.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. I determined at first an Explication of the second Book of <hi>Hermes;</hi> but the work swelling so big, my daily business in my Profession, and other manifold Avocations, have diverted that intention: If what I have done in the first be acceptable and approved, I shall be contented, and it will incourage me to a second Essay of this kind. However this socond Book, as it is shorter, so it is plainer, and in many places, may be its own Comment. In <hi>Chap. 18. Sect. 13.</hi> he speaks plainly, <hi>Now know</hi> (says he) <hi>that it is our Water which extracts the hidden Tincture; behold the Example and understand it, if you have once brought the Body into Ashes, you have Operated rightly.</hi> In the <hi>Water</hi> and the <hi>Ashes</hi> is the depth of the Mystery.</p>

26. The Book of <hi>Kalid,</hi> seems to be of great Antiquity, and has many Excellent things in order to this great Work, yet needs an Explanation, and unlocking, which I had attempted, but meeting with a Key, (which was a Writing found in a Coffin upon the Brest of a Religious Man) which seemed to fit the Wards of this Lock, (as being a Process derived from the same Principles) I desisted from my own thoughts, and have given you that instead of them.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. As to <hi>Geber,</hi> I am not ignorant, that it was some Years since published in <hi>English</hi> by another hand, who has no ways answered my Intention, neither as to the Translation, nor the method of the Work. As to the Translation it was very mean, and in some places false; for instance, see the <hi>Latin Copy</hi> Printed at <hi>Basil, Anno 1572. pag. 765. calce Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitis 29.</hi> at these words, <hi>Lunam Amalgamatam cum Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curio,</hi> &amp;c. and compare them with the said <hi>English Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Printed <hi>Anno 1678. page 300.</hi> and with our Version in this work, <hi>Chap. 45. Sect. 29.</hi> so will you easily see the difference.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. As to the method of the Work, (tho' it was <hi>Geber's</hi> own) we wholly dislike and decline it for several Reasons which we have gathered out of the Author, for in <hi>Chap. 13.</hi> of his Investigation of Perfection, he says, That <hi>all the words are true, which are now by us written in our Volumes, as found out by Experiment and Reason; but the things experimented which we have seen with our Eyes, and handled with our Hands, we have writ in our Sum of Perfection; therefore studiously peruse our Books, and collect our dispersed Intention, which we have described in divers places, that it might not be exposed to Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Ignorant Men.</hi> So that he who would understand him, must make a Collection of like things together, without which the matter will never be understood, or accomplished, for which reason, I rather chose to common place him, than to deliver him in his own order.</p>
                  <p n="29">
                     <pb facs="tcp:65913:8"/>
29. <hi>Again in the Preface of his Sum of Perfection, he says,</hi> And what we have diminished in other Books, we have sufficiently made up in this Book, and supplyed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of them very briefly; and what we absconded in one part, we have made up in another in this our Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, that the compleatment may be apparent to the Wise; <hi>so that it appears even from this, that he wrote nothing of the matter in any continued order. And in the same place he affirms,</hi> That he who in himself knows not Natural Principles, is very remote from our Art, because he has not a true root whereon to found his intention: And therefore, (<hi>says he</hi>) labour studiously in our Volumes, and ponder them often in your mind.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. <hi>And in the last Chapter of his Sum of Perfection, he has these words.</hi> But that the Malitious may not Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate us, we declare, That we have not treated of this our Science with a continued Series of Discourse, but have dispersed it in divers Chapters; and this was done, because if we had wrote it in a continued Series of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the Evil Man, as well as the Good, would have unworthily usurped it; therefore we have concealed it in some places, and speak it more openly in others, not under an <hi>AEnigma,</hi> but in plain Language. Let not therefore the Industrious Artist despair, for if he seeks it, he may find the same, but he who follows Books on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will very slowly attain the knowledge of this most Excellent Art.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>In his Invention of Verity,</hi> Par. 3. cap. 13. <hi>he says,</hi> Wonder not that we have dispersed the special things pertinent to this Operation in divers Volumes, seeing we endeavour to hide our Art from Evil Men: <hi>And in</hi> Par. 4. Cap. 21. <hi>he further says,</hi> Considerately ruminate upon what we have taught in our Sum of Perfection, for our purpose was not in one only Volume to demonstrate all things, but that Book should declare Book, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the same.</p>

32. Now to manifest, that he treated not of things in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect order, see <hi>Chap. 12.</hi> of the Invention of Perfection, <hi>sub calce,</hi> where he has these Words, <hi>Our Stone is no other than a Fruitful Spirit, and Living Water, which we have named the Dry Water:</hi> Here he desists and gives over the Discourse, and leaves it interrupted till he comes to the first Chapter of the Third Part of the Sum of Perfectian, where he goes on and continues the Discourse in these words. <hi>We now signifie to you, that the Natural Principles in the Work of Nature, are a Fruitful Spirit, and Living Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which we have also named the Dry Water;</hi> and so continues the Discourse of it: These two Places, or Discourses, we have joyned; or connected together in this our Translation, <hi>Lib. 2. Cap. 37. Sect. 18.</hi> that you may see the full of what he intends concerning it.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. In his Sum of Perfection, <hi>Lib. 2. Cap. 8.</hi> towards the end of the Chapter, he speaks of the Separation of an Earthy Substance from its compound, which in the root of Nature is united to a Metal, which is done either by Elevation, or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: The way of doing it he has not taught in the place ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But in a great many Chapters distant in the second Part of the said second Book of the Sum of Persection, of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of <hi>Venus,</hi> he orderly goes on and Explicates the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, saying, <hi>The way of the Preparation of</hi> Venus <hi>is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold; one is by Elevation, another is without Elevati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the way by Elevation is, that</hi> Tutia <hi>be taken (with which</hi> Venus <hi>well agrees) and that it be ingeniously uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therewith.</hi> These places in our Translation, <hi>Lib. 2. Cap. 45. Sect. 11, 12, 13, &amp; 14.</hi> we have laid together and united.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. These are a taste of the many scores if not hundreds of places, which in <hi>Geber</hi> himself are designedly interrupted; by which means the Mystery is hid, and the Method of operating, and understanding of the Secret, so obscured, that without a great deal of Study, searching, comparing of places, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ending and beginnings of things together, it would be
<pb facs="tcp:65913:9"/>
almost impossible to apprehend what he intends; for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it was, that we went on, not in an orderly and succinct Translation but rather compendiously to common place him; by which means, you have all things relating to one subject or matter laid together, and brought under one and the same head, which in the Author himself are possibly dispersed asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into more than ten, fifteen, or twenty places of this Book.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. These things being said, we have only to inform you concerning this work, that this our composition, is really <hi>Geber</hi> himself, without any addition whatsoever. Here is every sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and individual process contained in the whole book; nor any thing diminished which concerned the knowledge and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Art; but that we have (for brèvity sake) left some things out, 'tis true; as all his Prefaces, and prefatory Discourses, contentions and disputes about the reality of this Art tautologies and often repetitions of things (which was necessary in his interrupted method) which to have incerted, as they would have been of no use or profit, so they would need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly have swelled this work to an unreasonabla bulk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it would have been not only more chargable to the buyer, but more unpleasant and tedious to the Reader.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. In <hi>Geber</hi> also there were many cuts or figures of Furna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were holy omitted and left out in the afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned English Translation; these to our work we have added, curiously cut in Copper; with quotations upon each figure or furnace, shewing to what Place, Book, Chapter, and Section they belong.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. <hi>Flammel</hi> we have also now translated, and claused into Chapters and Sections, to which we have added his sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of Philosophy, which was never prented with him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in any Language: To his work we have also added his Hieroglyphicks neatly cut in Copper, with quotations also upon each Hieroglyphick, shewing to what Book, Chapter, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction they have a reference, or belong.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. <hi>Artefius</hi> (whom we have named <hi>Longaevus,</hi>) we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so claused or composed into Chapters and Sections, which it was
<pb facs="tcp:65913:10"/>
never divided into before in any Language; and because the Author is a Rarity to be met with, we have withal added the Latin Version for the sakes of such ingenious Persons who are cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in things of this nature: Next to <hi>Hermes,</hi> he is the most celebrated or famed Author, of whom, and which work, we have many things to say, but that we are prevented by the Epistle of the most excellent <hi>John Pontanus,</hi> prefixed before the Book, and to which we refer you.</p>
                  <p n="39">39. The first book of <hi>Roger Bachon,</hi> called <hi>Radix Mundi,</hi> we had in manuscript out of the Library of a learned man, and our particular friend, a Doctor of Physick, who set a great value upon it, and not undeservedly; his <hi>Speculum Alchymiae</hi> is a translation out of that Copy in the <hi>Theatrum Chymicum,</hi> vol. 2. page 409. a discourse scarcely inferior to any thing extant, and of great estimation among the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. <hi>Riply</hi> we have published from a Manuscript, not from the printed Copy, yet we carefully compared it with that which was printed, and supplyed it out of that with some thing which the written one wanted; as on the contrary, our written Copy had some things in it, which the printed one had not, as in particular, the first Chapter, which is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the Arch-bishop of <hi>York;</hi> so that by the help of both together we have published one compleat.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. And to this work we also added the last Chapter, <hi>viz. Chap. 73. lib. 3.</hi> which is an Extract of <hi>Ripleys</hi> Philosophick Axioms in the <hi>Theatrum Chymicum, Vol. 2. page 116.</hi> In our written Copy, (which without doubt was Ancient) there were several Annotations in the Margent, referring to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts of the work, (the Additions of an unknown Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) These, because they seemed to be excellent, and very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the Explication of our Author, we have inserted in the body of the Work, in the very place where they are to be read, putting them into Sections, and numbring them with rest; but to distinguish them from the Authors own work, we have caused them to be printed in a different character,
<pb facs="tcp:65913:10"/>
to wit, in the Italick, and every where included them between [] two Crochets.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. We have wrote an Appendix to our first book of Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Physick, containing a short practical method for the Cure of all Diseases; it is but a small thing, not above six or seven sheets of Paper, and only design'd as an abstract to help the Memory; this we had published now in this work, had it not swelled so big; but sinse the magnitude of this has prevented it, we intend, for the benefit it may be to the publick, and the sakes of such as desire it, to publish it alone by it self, with all the speed that may be.</p>
                  <p n="43">43. These Things being said, I shall now give the Reader an Account (since several have desired it of me) of my Books; what are already published, and what are now in hand in the Press, to be made publick as soon as may be. Those already published are the following Ten:</p>

Phylaxa Medicinae,</hi> a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet of choice Medicines, so many as are enough to Absolve the whole practice of Physick in Two Parts: The first is already Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; the other is in hand with, and will soon be published. 8. <hi>Horae Mathematicae,</hi> the Soul of <hi>Astrology,</hi> containing that Art in all its Parts, large <hi>Octavo. 9.

                  </p>
                  <p n="45">45. Those now in Hand, and to be published with what speed may be, are the following four 11. <hi>Seplasium,</hi> the English Physitian, or Drugists Shop opened containing the Names. Natures, Kinds, Qualities, Growth, Virtues, Uses, and Goodness (whether Medicinal or Mechanical) of all sorts of Drugs sold in the Drugists Shops; together with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Preparations, Purifications, Properties, and various Uses of <hi>Common-Salt, Salt-Peter, Pot-Ashes, Soap, Gun-Powder,</hi> and <hi>Glass:</hi> a Laborous work, and the first of this kind extant in the World. <hi>Octavo. 12. Pharmacopaeia Bateana,</hi> Translated into English, with a large comment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Medicine, shewing the Judgments and Opinions of all the most Learned Men, upon each particular Medicament, in <hi>Octavo. 13. Officina Chymica,</hi> The Chymical Shop, or Apothecaries Hall, shewing the Composition; Preparation, Virtues, Use, Doses, and Dangers of all the things contained there in. A Great work, and comprehending the who'e Art of Chymistry, as it is now Practised, in <hi>Octavo. 14. Botonologia</hi> or a compleat English Herbal in III. Books; containing. I. English Herbs and Plants. II. English Trees and Shrubs. III. Exoticks, or Out Landish Drugs, so many as we use in Physick.

The Virtues and various ways of Using, in <hi>Folio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="46">46. Of these Four last Books, the <hi>Seplasium</hi> will be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, in two or three Months after the publication of this Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Physick. The <hi>Pharmacopaeia Bateana,</hi> is nearly half Printed already. The <hi>Officinia Chymica,</hi> is also in a good forwardness. And the <hi>Botonology</hi> or Herbal is hastning with
<pb facs="tcp:65913:11"/>
all the possible Dilligence and Care that may be. The Cuts are the greatest part of them done, but being all performed but by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one Hand, it makes it so much the longer and more tedious.</p>
                  <p n="47">47. In the mean time I cannot but complain of an abuse put upon me by one <hi>John Hollier</hi> who pretends to Publish and Sell my <hi>Family Pills,</hi> under my Name, Effigies, and Seal, in most places of this Kingdom, without my Priviledge, Order, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, or Consent, to my great Prejudice and Damage. For this Reason, I have made it my Business in part, to make some Improvements and Alterations of the Medicine, for the advantage thereof, of which <hi>Hollier</hi> nor any Man else knows any thing, neither as to the Names, Numbers or Natures, nor to the Preparation, Parts, or proportion of any thing contained therein.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. And by Reason of this Alteration, they neither Vomit, nor make Sick, or Grieve the Bowels in the least; but work more nimbly, and pleasantly than formerly, and without any the least danger, being fitted against the most Stubborn and Rebellious Diseases, which scarcely any other Remedy can cure or help So that I modestly affirm, that one Box of these <hi>Pills,</hi> thus impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and Advanced in Virtue and Goodness, are worth Five Boxes, (for all that I know Ten) of those which <hi>Hollier</hi> or any else Make and Sell without my Order or Advice. And from henceforth, they are only to be had thus rightly Prepared by my own Hand, at my House in <hi>London,</hi> or where else I shall appoint.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. The World is also desired to take Notice, that the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement</hi> which <hi>Hollier</hi> or some of his Accomplices, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put at the end of one of my late Published Books, entitled, <hi>Select Physical and Chyrurgical Observations;</hi> Printed for <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Passenger</hi> on <hi>London-Bridge</hi> (while I was absent in the <hi>West-Indies</hi>) is a base unworthy, and Malicious Libel, Designedly done to wrong me; for that I left large quantities of all sorts of my Medicines behind me with my Wife, to be Sold in my absence: nordid I ever give <hi>Hollier</hi> leave, Order, or Directions to do the same, much less to Publish that Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:65913:12"/>
                     <hi>Advertisement,</hi> which now being returned to <hi>England,</hi> I am necessitated in my own Defence, here to signifie and declare to the whole World.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. <hi>Lastly,</hi> As to the Great and Philosophick Work, it is my Opinion and Belief, that there is such a thing in Nature; I know the Matter of Fact to be true, tho the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it is as yet hid from me: I have been Eye witness of so much, as is able to convince any Man endued with Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Faculties; that there is a possibility of the Transmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Metalls; yet for all these things will not advise any Man Ignorant of the Power of Nature, and the way of her Operation, to attempt the work; lest erring in the Foundation, he should suffer loss, and blame me. Without doubt it is the Gift of God, and he that attains it, must patiently wait the moving of the Waters; when the destinated Angels moves the waters of the Pool, then is the time to immorge the Leprous Metal, and free it from all impurities.</p>

                  <p n="1">I. IT is an Excellent Balsam differing from that of <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>Tolu,</hi> but no ways inferiour in Virtues and Excellency, as the several Experiments lately made of it by several Learned Physicians in the curing of Diseases, have given sufficient proof of: It is without doubt the most precious of all natural Balsams, by reason of its great Virtues, and admirable Odour, excelling all others, even the most fragrant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It eases all manner of Pains in any part of the Body, coming of Cold or Wind, chiefly pains of the Stomach, Indigestion, and want of Appetite, corroborating and strengthning of it after a wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. It cures all Ulcers of the Brest and Lungs, Reins, Bladder or Womb, inward bruises, spitting of Blood, and such like, helps short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of breath, Coughs, Consumptions, Wheesings Hoarsness, Asthma's. and other Diseases of those parts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is good against the falling Sickness, Apoplexy, Convulsions, Palsies, Lethargy, Tremblings, old Head-aches, Megrims, Vertigo's, and other cold and moist Diseases of the Head, Brain, and Nerves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inwardly taken as after directed, and outwardly anointed upon the part. It strengthens the Brain, helps the Memory, comforts the Nerves, and fortifies all the Senses both internal and external, beyond any other natural Balsam.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It kills Worms whether in old or young, cures Ruptures, altho' of many years standing; dissolves soft stones, and expells them, as also Sand, Gravel, or Slime, or any other thing which may obstruct the Urine, or stop its passages; so that it is believed there is scarcely a better Remedy for that purpose upon Earth; for it gives ease in the most vehement pain, and being constantly taken for some time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the Cure.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It eases all Colick pains. Gripings, Wind in the Stomach or Bowels, and perfectly cures all Fluxes, bloody Fluxes, Excoriations, and such other like Distempers of the Guts. It cures deasness, pain and noise in the Ears to a wonder, a drop or two being put in, and stopt in with a little Cotton dipt in the same.</p>

6. It provokes the Terms in Women, being taken from 20 to 40 drops or more in a glass of White-wine, (as anon directed) Morning and Night for a Week together: it is said to cure barrenness, promote Conception, and cause easie delivery to Women in Travel, and in a great measure prevents or takes away those after-pains, being taken to the quantity aforenamed in a glass of Juniper-water.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It heals all manner of green Wounds, rotten Ulcers, Fistula's, new or old running sores in any part of the body, as also punctures or hurts of the Nerves and Tendons, Aches, pains, lameness, weakness of the Limbs or Joynts, being dropt into the wound or puncture, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise applied thereon with Lint, a Tent, or Leather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and bound up, and not stirred in 24 hours, it commonly cures at 4 or 5 times dressing, sometimes at 2 or 3 times, and sometimes at the first dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, be the wound deep, contused, or large.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is an assured Remedy to cure the Palsie (if not inveterate) Trembling, Gout, or any weakness of the Nerves and Joynts coming of a cold and moist cause, by anointing the afflicted parts therewith, and taking of it inwardly, as shall be immediately directed; for it does gently, and by degrees (as it were) carry off the morbifick Cause and matter almost to a Miracel.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This marvellous Balsam opens all obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, being taken Morning and Evening for a Month together in a little Syrup, or other convenient Vehicle: It is held for a great Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and has many other singular Virtues not here necessary to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, lest we should prejudice its worth and Excellency.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>The way and manner of taking it.</hi> In diseases of the Head, Brain, and Nerves, give it in Rosemary, or Juniper-water, or in Canary: For the Stone, and other Diseases of the Reins and Bladder, you may give in Rhenish-wine: For the Colick and Diseases of the Bowels, you may give it in Juniper or Cardamum-water: For Palsies and weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Nerves and Joynts, you may give it in some Antiparalitick Wine: First grind or mix it with a little of the yolk of an Egg, to open its body, and then mix it with the Liquor you would give it in.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. If the sick cannot take it so, it may be made up into Pills with some fit Powder, as of Zedoary, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, Bay-berries, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebs, Winter-cherries, or what the Physician shall think more fit, and so gilded; for by this means it will be taken without nauseating; you may give the Balsam from half a Dram to two Drams, according to Age and Strength; and it may be given Morning and Night for a Month, two, or three together.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And it is certain that this Balsam is one of the greatest speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks in the cure of the Palsie, Scurvy and Gout that is, transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all other Medicaments; but it ought to be constantly given in a due Dose, and with those Advantages that it may not loath the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;
<pb facs="tcp:65913:17"/>
so taken, it performs more than any other Balsam: It cleanses the whole body of all Impurities, mundifies the whole mass of Blood, heals all inward Bruises, Wounds, Ulcers, or Excoriations, whether in the Bowels or Lungs, restoring decayed Nature, and carrying off all its Faeculencies by Urine and Stool.</p>

In Tertians, do it after the third or fourth Fit: In Quotidians, you may tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry longer: In Quartans, scarcely before the thirtieth Day. And in this case we may fly to Antimonial and Mercurial Medicines, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if of long continuance. For as the Matter lies in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places, so chiefly in the Mesentery, whence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be fetcht, the Cure seldom succeeds as it ought to do. If the Disease va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish not upon Purging, I always give my Volatile Laudanum before the Fit. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

                     <p>IT is not only more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, but more painful, by reason of the violent divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the <hi>Immature Foetus;</hi> whence it is that many Dye, and such as escape, it is not without dangerous Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes, vehement Pains, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is not unlike to unripe Fruit, which is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cully pulled off the Tree; whereas was it full ripe, it would drop of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, whether it was ripe or no, which is the true cause of a mature or timely Birth. The danger is the more if the <hi>Foetus</hi> be in the sixth, seventh, or eighth Month, and the Woman be of a weakly Constitution; for that healthy Women never miscarry without eminent Danger.</p>

                     <p>This is evident, for that some Women have their Terms all the time of their going with Child; and I have known some that have had them from the third Month to the last, after they had been stopt 3 Months, without danger; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Midwifes ought to be very discreet in making Judgment: For though a Woman with Child may void much Blood by the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65913:34"/>
Womb, yet it may be no Miscarriage, but either be a natural Flux, as it is to some Women, or only fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shew a Danger, which ought by proper Means to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. Therefore Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifes ought diligently to examine the Matter exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, whether it be Blood or Flesh, or Seed or Faetus, which by washing it in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will easily be discerned; and Judgment may be made accordingly, whether there be an Abortion or no.</p>

                     <p n="1">I. IF want of Appetite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a cold Cause, or cold Flegm affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Ventricle or Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, 'twill be necessary to give a proper Vomit, and then such things as may heat and corroborate it.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. A Vomit evacuating Flegm, and cold and watery Humours. Take our <hi>Pulvis Argenteum</hi> 10. grains, mix it with the Pulp of a rosted Apple, and give it in the Morning fasting; drinking warm Broth or Posset-drink after it. The third day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the same Dose.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Then to warm, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and restore the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65913:36"/>
Take our <hi>Tinctura Stomachica,</hi> from half a Spoonful to a Spoonful in a draught of Ale or Wine, Morning, Noon, and Night, a quarter of an Hour or more before eating; it does Wonders, and restores the Appetite, tho lost for many Months: I have proved it many Hundreds of times for these Twenty five or Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty six Years together. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Salt Meats are also good, because they iritate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the languid Faculties of the Stomach; Salts also have an inciding and attenuating Virtue: and next to these such things as have a volatile heat and sharpness, as <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard seed, Onions, Garlick, Leeks, Shellots,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. When Flegm disaffects the Ventricle, that is, tough, thick, and viscous, whereby the Appetite seems to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most destroyed, it will be necessary that you use Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of another Nature, <hi>viz.</hi> such as are acid, sharp, and cutting, for that these things not only separate the offending Matter from the Tunicles of the Stomach; but also prevent Putrefaction, and the Generation of the like for the future.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. For this purpose <hi>Spirit of Vitriol</hi> is most commended by some, and 'tis doubtless a good Medicine, but ought to be cautiously used to dry Bodies, lest it induces a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. But in fuller and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster Bodies it is not only safe, but very profitable, more especially, if the <hi>Anorexia,</hi> or want of Appetite, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from Choler, Yellow or Green, abounding in the Stomach.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. In this case I commend my <hi>Spiritus Aperiens,</hi> and <hi>Syrupus Diasulphuriis</hi> (see them in my <hi>Phylaxa Med. Lib.</hi> I. <hi>Cap.</hi> 14. <hi>Sect.</hi> I. and <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 36. <hi>Sect.</hi> I. given the first to 30. 40. 50. or 60. or more Drops in a Glass of Ale: the other in all the drink the Sick drinks, to a Spoonful, more or less, as they can Affect it, and to take it assidiously for ten, Fifteen, or Tweny, days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: they are Medecines that seldom fail of their effects, and are beyond my Commendation. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

IX. I always adjust the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments for cure accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Causes: where there is an exceeding Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Stomach, my <hi>Tinctura Absinthij</hi> is beyond compare, so also <hi>Elixir pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatis sine Acido:</hi> To these things, add our <hi>Aqua Bezo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artica,</hi> and <hi>Tinctura Corallorum Composita,</hi> given in Wine.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. If the want of Appetite is restored by taking Acids, it is a Sign that the Acid Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour in the Stomach is Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid, debile and weak; but if not, or it rather is hurt by it, it is a sign that it is too Rampant and Vigorous and therefore Alcalies as <hi>Tincture of Tartar, Volatile Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack,</hi> or our <hi>Spirit. Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asthmaticus</hi> ought to be given, and other like Volatile Salts: <hi>Bezoar Mineral</hi> in our <hi>Syrup. Volatilis</hi> is of good use in this case. <hi>Salmon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">XI. The loss of Appetite, which arises from decay of Strength, or old Age, is seldom or never cured, unless it proceed from a Cold cause, in which case <hi>Volatile Sulphurs,</hi> and <hi>Spirituous</hi> Things are proper, but things that dry too much must be cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously given: The Stomach may be Anointed with Oyl of Mace: or you may use this: Take Balsam of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber one Ounce: common Oyl, I dram: mix them.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. If there be neither Sickness, nor weakness, nor old Age present, and yet the Person complains that he never comes to his Food with a Stomach, or eats with an Appetite; the only way to restore such an one, is to let him fast till he is a hungry, for long want of Victualsand emptiness insuch always breeds an Appetite.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. In Women, especially such as have Gross Bodies, want of Appetite is cured (if not with Child) by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Emeticks and Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks. For the first of these I commend our <hi>Cartharticum Argenteum,</hi> given to a dram, in a Glass of Ale: For the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either our Family Pills, or our Family Powder, both of which may be taken 2, or 3, or 4 times, with due intervals. <hi>Salmon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. If it happens in a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man with Child, all or most of the Preceeding Courses must be avoided, and other
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65913:37"/>
Courses taken. The juices of <hi>Oranges</hi> and <hi>Lemons</hi> with white Sugar may be daily taken for some time: so also Canary made acid with juice of Limons: and if heat also abounds; a Decoction of Tamerinds sweetned, alone, or mixt: A Syrup or Infusion of Rheubarb, is of good use.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. Want of Appetite in Consumptive People is of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Consequence: some commend as the best thing <hi>Elixir Proprietatis</hi> given in wine: it may be good for a little Season, but long it must not be taken, left it also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Consumption. The best thing which I have found by my large experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is Our <hi>Tinctura Stoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chica</hi> given to a spoonsul, 2. or 3. times a day in a large draught of new Milk: And altho the ingredients thereof heat Violently, yet by reason they are of thin Substance and parts, their heat is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discussed, and so do no harm. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

IN many people here in <hi>England</hi> there is a loss of the use of their Limbs, the most part caused by taking great Colds; and sometimes it is the effect of the Palsie: the like may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the <hi>West Indies;</hi> but though in those hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries it is possible to proceed from such a Cause, yet it is oftner, and more generally known to proeeed from the Belly-Ach, and that kind of Belly-Ach, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from dryness and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiveness of Body.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If it proceeds from tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Cold, though Sudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficks are commonly used yet they ought rather to be used after a Legitimate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and clensing the Body: let the Sick first take <hi>our-Pilùlae Mirables</hi> from a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to a dram. And repeat the same for 2. or three times with due Intervalls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each Purging, as of two or three days or more, as they are in Age and strength.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. After sufficient purging and cleansing the Body, let the Patient sweat well with new <hi>London-treacle,</hi> for 3. or 4. times or oftner as you see occasion; and be very cautious that the Sick takes no Cold again: and in the time of sweating, Frictions ought to be used to the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Limb, with course Cloths: that as by the <hi>Diaphoresis,</hi> the nervous juice becomes depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and clean; so also by the rubbing the natural Spirits may be called back again.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. After Sweating the weak Limbs are to be bathed <hi>alternatim</hi> with <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Amber</hi> and <hi>Powers of Juniper;</hi> and in strong ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bust Bodies, and where the Skin is very thick, with <hi>Oyl of Amber</hi> pure and simple, for some few daies; and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65913:38"/>
then afterwards with <hi>Powers of Amber,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. If it be caused from a Palsie; there ought to be some gentle Purging, but with such things as more particularly carry off the cold, glutinous, and clamy Humour, which has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon the Nerves; among which our <hi>Vinum Catharticum</hi> is none of the meanest: if it be a strong Man, and in the flower of his years, you may, with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, give the former <hi>Pilulae Mirabiles;</hi> if he complains of a fulness and heaviness in his Stomach, give him One Two, or Three Doses of our <hi>Impetus Mineralis,</hi> and you shall find a wonder succeed.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. But during all this, you must sweat oftentimes, and powerfully by giving our <hi>Vinum Catharticum</hi> inwardly, and provoking the Sweat with Spirit of Wine, in <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Chair, if you have such a one, using Frictions withal, as before directed.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Outwardly let the paralytick Limbs be well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed, Morning and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, with this following Oyntment, <hi>Take Chymical</hi> Oyl of Rosemary and Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds, of each an ounce: Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Sal Armoniac in fine Powder half an ounce; Palm Oyl half a pound; mix them for use: <hi>Rub it well in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a good Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Inwardly, let the Sick take every morning this: <hi>Take our new</hi> London <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, Volatile Sal Armoniack,</hi> ana <hi>Five grains; mix it with pulp of Figgs,</hi> and give it: an hour after the taking of it give this: <hi>Take our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Cosmeticus half an ounce, Powers of Rosemary half a drachm, Spiritus Antiastmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> Twenty Drops mix, and give it in a Glass of Sack, or Ale; and give the same at Night, continuing this course for a month together.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. But when it proceeds from the dry Belly Ach, as for the most part it does in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing method is necessary to be pursued: First, Give the following Clyster, <hi>R.</hi> Chicken Broth a pint, Honey or Salt, half an ounce; <hi>Tinctura Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> One Ounce, (or instead thereof, boil two ounces of the Pulp of the bitter Gourd in the Broth) then exhibit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65913:38"/>
the clear Liquor warm, if it comes away without any ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent effect, repeat it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. Then purge with our <hi>Pilulae Mirabiles,</hi> two, three, four, or six times, as need requires, with intervals be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween each Purge; but for poor People, who cannot go to the charge of these Pills, or if they be not to be had, use this: <hi>Take a large quantity of Peach Leaves bruised, viz. about fourty hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls; Pulp of the bitter Gourd Six ounces; boil all in a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of Water to two Quarts, strain and sweeten with Sugar and Honey:</hi> Dose from half a pint to a pint, according to Age and Strength: This Purge, at due intervals, is to be repeated three, four, five, or six times, as you see need.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. This done the Bowels, and all the pained Parts and lamed Limbs, are to be <hi>bathed with</hi> Powers of Amber <hi>Morning and Evening; or with</hi> Oyl of Turpentine two ounces, mixed with Hogs-lard Eight Ounces.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. Lastly, In the loss of the use of Limbs, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what cause soever, this following Drink must be constantly used and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, without which a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Cure cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: <hi>Take Juniper Berries well bruised, Seeds and all Four Ounces; Fountain Water a Gallon; boil all to Three Quarts or Five Pints: strain out the clear, and put to it of Spirit of Wine Four Ounces; sweeten with White Sugar,</hi> and drink it as your ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Drink. This Dyet will seldom or never fail the desired end, which is to restore the Sick to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect use of their Limbs, and without which it can scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65913:40"/>
with two Ounces of Oyl of sweet Almonds, in fat Chicken Broth, and eased the Patient of his pain. We in the <hi>West-India's</hi> in this case, where the Constipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is great, give a strong Decoction of the bitter Gourd, or bitter Squash made in Water, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually does the Cure at once, if given in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Disease: Pulp of Colocynthis here will do the same. In the <hi>West-India's</hi> (where Peach-Trees are plentlful) the Disease is Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by taking three or four times Syrup of Peaches; or by taking a very strong De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction made of the bruised Leaves of the Peach-Tree. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

                     <p n="10">X. <hi>In a vehement Cholick, with Obstruction of the Courses,</hi> I gave the following things. 1. I Purged the Sick well with my Pilulae Mirabiles thrice. 2. I gave the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Powder. Take Livers and Galls of Eeles, dry them

                     <p n="12">XII. <hi>A Clyster against the Cholick.</hi> Take Decoction of Juniper Berries a Pint, Spiritus Aureus one Ounce, Aqua Benedicta four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Oyl of Olive two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; mix them; this works in a small time; but which is admirable, even before it works the pain ceases. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

                     <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Another Clyster for the same.</hi> Take Decoction of Dates, made in Mutton-Broth a Pint, Vinum Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum five Ounces, mix for a Clyster; it gives ease al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in an Instant, and brings away the morbifick Cause or Matter after a wonderful manner. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

                     <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Rondeletius</hi> saith that <hi>Castoreum</hi> and <hi>Euphorbium</hi> are of good use, if the pain be constant and stir not from its place; yea, he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimates them not only as a present, but as the ultimate Remedy: If you take six, eight, or ten Grains of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor in Wine, and drink a little after it, it will quickly Cure: And five or six Gr. of <hi>Emphorbium</hi> may be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and taken (the clear Infusion) in the same quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and manner.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. <hi>If the pain be in the upper part of the Belly, above the Navel,</hi> Clysters seldom do any good; for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reach the Morbifick or offending Matter; yet sometimes, even in these cases, when the pain is very violent, and the Humours crude, Clysters may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but they ought to be made of strong Attractives,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65913:41"/>
such as the afore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. <hi>This Clyster has done much good.</hi> Take fat Broth a Pint; Aloes dissolved two Drachms, Turpentine one Ounce and a half, or two Ounces: Truly it is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament not to be despised, I remember once above (all the rest of the times I used it) I recovered a young La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy even from the Jaws of Death with it: The Sick had been three daies and three Nights tortured with incessant Pain: Clysters of most kinds had been given by an Apothecary, by the Prescript of a Physitian: moreover, there had been given previous to those, Aromatick Bolus's, bitter De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, and lastly Opiates, but all in vain; nor could the Opiates do any good, for that they constipated the Bowels much more, which were before costive, and so rendered the disease, to all appearance, uncurable, so void of true Medical Sense or Knowledge, were those Men of great names, which had been before concern'd with her: In short, they neither gave her any Ease, nor made her go to Stool; so that what with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish and Pain, she was given over and lay for dead. In this state and Condition, a Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then present, moved that I might be sent for, which was accordingly done, when I came thither, I viewed my Patient, no appearance of Life could be discerned, so that I had but small encouragement to act; however, being entreated by her grieved Parents, I was perswaded, even for their satisfaction. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary was sent for, and gave me an account of all that was done; I could not forbear blaming the Physitians, for acting so preposterously, against the rules of Art, as to prescribe Opiates in a Cholick, with a strong constipation of the Bowels: The Apothecary could no waies take their part, but was of my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But the business was now, what was most fit to be done; nothing could be given by the Mouth, for her Teeth seemed to be
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65913:41"/>
set; I immediately bethought of the former Clyster, which was presently given, and in half an hour came away, with many hardned Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after which, the Sick was discerned to breath: I caused the same Clyster to be administred again, and all the Region of the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domen,</hi> to be bathed very well with <hi>Powrs of Amber,</hi> and a Flannel moistned with the same, to be laid hot over the afflicted Parts. The Clyster stayed Two Hours with the Sick, and then came away with more hardned Excrements; after which she opened her Eyes, and seemed to move her self; and in about six hours time speak. The first Clyster was given about Ten in the Morning, the second before Eleven: About Eight at Night I prescribed this, <hi>Take Mutton Broth three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a pint, Aqua Benedicta three Ounces, Venice Turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine two Ounces, Oyl one Ounce, mix and make a Clyster.</hi> She confessed she had great Ease before this was exhibited; but after she had received this last, she confess'd she was in perfect Ease; it came away from her, in about an hour and quarters time: After which, I first gently purged her with a Dose of my <hi>Family Pills;</hi> then with two Doses of my <hi>Pilulae Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabiles</hi> (but withal giving her respite to recover Strength) after which she constantly took my <hi>Spiritus Anticolicus,</hi> in all her Drink, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came perfectly well. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

                     <p n="17">XVII. <hi>A Cholick proceeding from Gravel, obstructed in the Reins;</hi> It was plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be an Obstruction of the Reins, because the Sick could not make Water. I prescribed the last of the afore-going Clysters, which was repeated three times, once every day; and the Patient, by this means alone, was perfectly cured: And this might possibly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the <hi>Balsamick</hi> and <hi>Diuretick</hi> Particles of the Turpentine, being received into the Lacteal Veins, whereby it was mixed with the Lacteal Juice, and so entred into the mass of Blood, and was circulated
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65913:42"/>
with it; whereby, altering its Crasis, it opened the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the Passages, and so provoked Urine; for alwaies after the Clysters, the Sick made a very large quantity of Urine. This thing I have many times experienced. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>

                     <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>In some Patients the best Clysters do little good;</hi> and by I know not what hidden cause, the Pain, in a day or two, or three, returns again, as bad as ever, or worse: these, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>suppositories,</hi> have not only found present Ease, but the Cure has succeeded, as if it had been done by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment. <hi>Take Honey One Ounce, boiled to a thickness, that it may be wrought with ones Finger; then add in Powder Sal Gem two Scruples, Troches Alhaudal half an Ounce, and with distilled Oyl of Wax, ten drops, make and form a Suppository,</hi> which let be put up in the Paroxysm.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. <hi>Whether the Cholick comes from Choler or Vitreous Flegm, sharp and emollent Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, are of excellent Use:</hi> And sometimes Clysters made only of Oyl, on of Oyl three parts, Turpentine one part, have saved the Life of a Patient.

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of an Hysterick Cholick.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. IN describing this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, and prescribing a method of Precepts for the Cure thereof, I cannot follow any Author, nor have I met with any thing yet extant, which has yet given me any satisfaction: The florid Discourses of some upon this Subject, seem to me rather an excursive sound of Words and Noise, than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65913:48"/>
any thing of substantial Reasons; and truly in some sort, are rather Deviations from the Truth, than either Illustrations of the nature of the Disease, or sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuments in order to its cure.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. The very name of the Distemper imports the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Quality thereof; it being a Pain excited from a distemper or disturbance of the Womb, or some parts adjacent to it; in all my Observations of Diseases of that part, there has seem'd something to indicate a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Nerves of the <hi>Mesentery,</hi> if not some Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease actually residing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and that which induces me so much the more to this Opinion, is a vehement Cholick excited (as 'tis thought) from that which is vulgarly called a distemper of the Womb.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. But if I should descend to the exact discussion of Hysterick Diseases, I am apt to think that in many of those cases, where the Womb is so much blamed, it is not concerned at all, but is rather from Convulsions, or distemper of the <hi>Mesente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> for that I have known several Men (though not so commonly as among Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, because not so subject to such Passions) in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream manner afficted with such as are commonly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Hysterick Fits.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. If a Cholick be excited in Persons not subject to Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterick Fits (and such we shall call them, as oft as we have occasion to make use of their name, because of the vulgar acceptation) it cannot be an Hysterick Cholick, but that of the simple kind, of which we have largely treated in the former Chapter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall say nothing here.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. But if in Persons sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Hysterick Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, upon the exciting of the Hysterick Fit, a Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick be induced, this is that which we intend here, and whose Symptoms, Causes, Prognosticks, and Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cure, we design in this Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65913:48"/>
VI. It is easily known by the difference afore-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned from an ordinary Cholick, yet there is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause, than what simp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causes Hysterick Fits, <hi>viz.</hi> a sharp, phlegmatick, or clammy Matter, lodged in the nervous foldings of the <hi>Mesentery</hi> and Bowels: more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Sick for the most part complains of a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pain at Stomach, for some-time before hand, with a weight and heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and many times there is a Costiveness of Body preceding it; and if the Patient is plethorick, or full of Blood, there is sometimes a bleeding at Nose; or in heavy, melancholly, and unpleasant Bodies, a Flux of the <hi>Haemorrhoids;</hi> if these precede not, the Patient complains of Vertigo, or a pain in the Head, a dull pain or heaviness in one of the sides, either right or left, and a dimness of Sight, with an unwillingness to stir, and move up and down, to which add, for the most part, a sadness and deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedness of Mind, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Foolishness.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The Nature of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper is such, that it makes the Bowels sore, and all the Region of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> is as if it were beaten with Sticks; and if it continues long, so that the Sick cannot get Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, it so enervates the whole Body, that it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes away the Strength in general, but in many (as in a certain Gentlewoman, not long since my Patient,) it takes away the use of the Limbs also; in some the Arms, in some the Legs, in others the Arm and Leg on one side, and in othersome all the Limbs together; so that the Patients are made wholly incapable of helping themselves. Now this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference proceeds from the strength of the Disease, and the matter causing it, and the and Plicatures, or Ramifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Nerves, hurt by the same; and in some Persons, the extremity of the Cause is so vehement, that it causes foolishness and alienation of Mind, with a strong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly.</p>
                     <p n="8">
                        <pb n="60" facs="tcp:65913:49"/>
VIII. The nere Cause appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to belodg'd in the <hi>Muscles</hi> of the <hi>Bowels</hi> and <hi>Mesentery,</hi> where sharp Salt, join'd with an acid Phlegm, being dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and put into a fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon the <hi>hysterick Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxism,</hi> causes this vehement pain: For by reason of the Collision of the neurotick Spirits justling one another in their passages, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid. Sals pricking the most sensible Fibres of the Nerves with their vitriolick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, causing a vehement an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish; and the distention of the Nerves and musculous Passages, where the said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Juices are lodged, this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most invincible Cholick is exeited, which, <hi>Proteus-like,</hi> is so various in its appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that we cannot here in few words describe it.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The remote cause is to be known from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the six Non natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and other Accidents of Nature intervening, the which we shall here pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and leave to the more exquisite Consideration of philosophick Minds.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. As to the Progno sticks, this we have to say, That if the Disease has been of long continuance, and in ancient People, it will be of difficult cure; the older and the longer the Disease has been, so much the more difficult. If the Limbs have lost their use, 'tis very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that the Sick recovers. If a Palsie be induced the Sick is incurable; so if any contraction of the Nerves, with loss of the use of any Limb: The same also if the Patient is become foolish, or there be a very great alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Mind, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it be not recent, but of long continuance. But if there be no loss of the use of Limbs, or it only returns by long intervals; if it be recent, &amp; the Patient young, strong, vigorous, and lively; If they can eat freely, and sleep well, there is all the possible signs of recovery; and so much the better and easier if in a Woman not with Child, or in a Body not scorbutick.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:65913:49"/>
XI. The <hi>Indicationes Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rativae</hi> are these: Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions must be opened, hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterick Vapours or Fumes must be quieted, the acid Salts and Juices must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, the peccant or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Mater must be evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated or removed: And last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the parts weakned must be corroborated and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, and the scorbutick Taint (if any be) destroyed.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. In respect to opening of Obstrucrtions, we must consider whether the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution be hot or cold; for accordingly different Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines must be used. Those things which open Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in hot Bodies, create them in cold, <hi>&amp; e contrario.</hi> If therefore, by the exube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant symptoms, you perceive the Constitution to be hot, these following things are fit to be used, <hi>viz. Spirits of Sulphur and Nitre, Spiritus Aperiens, &amp; Antiasthmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Spirttus Anticolicus Sal nitri, Tartari nitratum, &amp; Nitri Vitriolatum, Sal Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacum Volatile, Syrupus Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticus,</hi> being given in a convenient Vehicle, and in a proper Dose; all which you may see in my <hi>Phylaxa Medicinae.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. But if it be in a cold habit of Body, then you will find these following things good: <hi>Take Juice of Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage two Pound, Sugar as much, make it into a Syrup by boiling,</hi> which strain through <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> his Sleeve; Dose three spoonfuls every morning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, and at night going to bed. Or this: <hi>Take Juices of Fennel, Germander, Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, Brooklime, Watercresses,</hi> ana <hi>four Ounces, Sugar twenty Pound; make it into a Syrup, which clarifie with Whites of Eggs:</hi> Give it in the same manner and Dose with the former: Or these Juices may be mixt with new Ale, bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up with a little white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and a Clove slit put into each Bottle, and so drank. In this case also <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura Martis given in clarified Juice of Plantin, mixt with an equal quantity of Conary,</hi> is of good use. Also <hi>Potestates Carui, Juniperi, Lithontriptici, &amp; Pulegii,</hi> may be daily given in all their drink.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="62" facs="tcp:65913:50"/>
XIV. To quiet the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and turbulent motion of the Spirit, and hysterick fumes, these following things are fit to be done: First, the Stomach, and whole Region of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> are to be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with <hi>Powers of Amber,</hi> or <hi>Pennyroyal,</hi> or both, and a hot Flannel dipt in the same, laid over them. Secondly, the Nostrils are to be often touched with <hi>Postestates Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu Cervi;</hi> and the Sick should keep a Bottle always about them to swell to, or at least a Bottle of <hi>Volatile Sal Armoniack,</hi> mixt with some few drops of <hi>Oil of Pennyroyal,</hi> or <hi>Savin.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, our <hi>Tinctura Hysterica</hi> should be at convenient times given in a little Wine or Ale. Or this: <hi>Take Tinctura Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterica one Ounce, Guttae Vitae half au Ounce; mix them;</hi> of which sixty drops may be given at a time, every night going to bed; and, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity require it, every morning fasting. But if the Sick be troubled with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiveness of Body, this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing is of more excellent use: <hi>Take of our Extract of Aloes one Scruple, Castor in Powder half a Scruple, of our Volatile Laudanum three or four Grains; mix them,</hi> for one Dose, to be given every night going to bed. These things thus used, will not fail you expectations.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. The third intention of Cure, is, to sweeten the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid Salts and Juices of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; for which purpose there is certainly nothing more powerful and admirable, than our <hi>Spiritus Universalis,</hi> (which see in our <hi>Phyl. Medic. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.) given twice a day, or as often as the Sick drinks in all their Ale or Beer: Or instead of this, <hi>Volatile Sal Armoniack,</hi> add six or eight Grains, in all their Liquor aforesaid. Some possibly may prescribe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of <hi>Pearl, Coral, Amber, Crabs Eyes,</hi> &amp;c. but these things (though after a very long using may do some good, yet) being fixt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies, do not so immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into the Mass of Blood, and are therefore to be laid aside, where the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things can be had, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as this Disease pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65913:50"/>
the whole Mass of Blood and Humours, and the wholy habit of the body.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. But more effectually to answer both the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of Cure at <hi>Sect.</hi> 12. and 13. aforegoing, and this third present, this following Composition is most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent: <hi>Take Venice or Strasburgh Turpentine two Ounces, Angelis Mineralis, Bezoarticum Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale,</hi> ana <hi>enough to make the Turpentine up into Pills:</hi> Dose one Dram, or a Dram and half; and in some cases two Drams. It is a most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Medicament for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses intended, and not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be valued; and so much the more especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it be given in a scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butick habit of Body, and where the Sick has lost the use of their Limbs.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. The fourth Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is to evacuate the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bisick Cause, or peccant Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which you may most compleatly accomplish with my <hi>Pilulae Mirabiles,</hi> for they (given from one Scruple to half a Dram) wounderfully carry off the offending mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and draw it away even from the most remote parts of the Body: Or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of them, you may use my <hi>Family Pills</hi> (those which are made according to my last designation, by which they are much improved in their Virtues and Goodness, which can be only had of me, and such as have them from my hand, not from <hi>Hollier,</hi> or his Accomplices, for that he knows neither the Names, Number, or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Preparation, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, as they are now prepared by me: So that I modestly affirm, one Box of this Preparation is really worth three Boxes, for all that I know ten, of any of those made and sold without my order or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.) These Family-Pills may be given, three, four, five, or six in number, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Age and Strength. If the Patient cannot take Pills, they may purge with <hi>Vinum Catharticum,</hi> (see it in my <hi>Phylaxa Medic. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 44.) one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent things in the World,</p>
                     <p n="18">
                        <pb n="64" facs="tcp:65913:51"/>
XVIII. The fifth and last Indication is <hi>Vital,</hi> or to strengthen and restore the hurt and weakned parts, which is done both by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals and Externals: For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals I propose chiefly <hi>our Tincture of Kermes,</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in a Glass of Wine, or other convenient Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle half a spoonful at a time morning and night. To this purpose serves our <hi>Tinctura Antimonii, tinctura Corallorum,</hi> (which are no mean things) given in the same manner; as also our <hi>Potestates Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> given to twenty, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or forty drops in Ale. Outwardly you may bathe the <hi>Stomach, Abdomen, and Back,</hi> with the same; and now and then to comfort the Bowels, give this Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster: <hi>Take Venice Turpentine one Ounce, Yelk of one Egg; grind them well together in a Mortar till they are well mixt; then add to them Chicken-Broth, choice Canary, of each half a Pint, of our Aqua Bezoartica an Ounce; mix, and exhibit warm.</hi> Salmon.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of an APOSTEME.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. AN Abscess or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme, is an Aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Matter in a mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous or fleshy part, with an intention to break out; the Precursor of which, is always Pain and inflamation: And it is for the most part known by tumour or swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the part, with great heat and continual pain.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If therefore pain seize any part of the Body, and there be a suspicion that Matter is gathered there; if the Sick sweats, or there be a natural <hi>Diaphoresis,</hi> especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally about the Face, and the pain yet continue, you may certainly conclude, that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is gathered together in the part, though the Colour thereof be not changed; and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65913:51"/>
therefore in its due season it must be opened, that the congregated Matter may be let out.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. I remember once I was sent for to a little Boy, about ten years of Age, who at play had hurt his Leg: The Child complained ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently, and almost always cried out, yet no great ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earance of an Aposteme: There was no outward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloring, or inflammation, or scarcely any appearance of a Tumor; but at length a small general swelling over the whole Leg, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement pricking pain was only in one particular part thereof: I applied Matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or Ripeners, which made the general Tumor more apparent; but the pain equally continued, and the Colour of the Skin was the same as formerly, or as that of the other Leg, without any protuberance, or place pointing out, where it ought to be open'd. When I thought it was time to open it, I did it with an Incision-knife, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very place of the pain, which was about three Inches, or more, below the Knee, on the outside of the Leg; after opening of it, the Child had immediately ease; and I took out of the <hi>Aposteme,</hi> of well-digested Matter, about three quarters of a Pint, at several times: And then I cured it after the general method of healing Apostemes. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

And for this Reason it is, That <hi>Buboes</hi> (in the <hi>Plague,</hi> or a <hi>Pestilential Fever</hi>) when they appear, we ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten their ripening with so much vehemency, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are forced to open them before they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ripe, lest the poiso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Matter should revert inwardly, and its malign Fumes, strike to the Heart, and smite the vital Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. But again on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, too much haste ought not to be made to open an Aposteme, before it be throughly ripe, (except in malign Diseases, as aforesaid, and where the hazard of Life, for that Cause is very great, or a Mortification is beginning,) lest a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the part (from the Crudity of the Humour, not yet turn'd into <hi>Pus</hi>) should ensue, or a violent Fever, with sometimes Convulsions; for that such an untimely Operation, does indeed much more excite the pain than the Tumor it self, and causes a new conflux of Humors.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. But beside the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reasons, for a hasty ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Abscess, these following also conclude it: I. Where the heat of the part is languid or weak, and the Sick wants sleep. 2. Where it is evident, there is is a very great plenty of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which Nature cannot dispose of. 3. When the Matter is seated deep, thick, and wide at bottom. 4. When it is adjacent to a principal Member, which may be in danger of being hurt or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the malign Fumes thereof. 5. If it be on or near the Joints, lest the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roding Humor, thus detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, should seize upon, or eat the Ligaments. 6. If it be in a glandulous part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are more subject to putrefaction, and the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them hurts but little. 7. Lastly, If it be upon Bones, Nerves, or Tendons, as in <hi>Whitoles</hi> and <hi>Fellons,</hi> which happen to the Nails and Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends, where for want of seasonable opening, the Bone is many times putrified and corrupted, to the losing sometimes of a Joint, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65913:52"/>
of two. So <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> advises, concerning an Abscess upon the <hi>Perinaeum:</hi> When (saith he) any such little Tumour shall begin, cut it forthwith, while it is yet unripe, lest the suppuration should reach to the <hi>Intesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Rectum,</hi> or Arst Gut.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. When therefore an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation with pain is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and that it appears, the Tumor will apostemate, it is necessary to apply Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives, to bring it to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete maturation or ripeness: Such as this: <hi>Take Yolks of Eggs, Honey, Oil Olive,</hi> ana <hi>two Ounces, Pulp of Figs, Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> ana <hi>three Ounces; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thridate four Ounces, Pouder of Aron-Roots, enough to bring it to the consistency of a Pultise,</hi> which renew twice a day: Or this, which is stronger: <hi>Take Basilicon minus, Ox Gall, Black Sope, soft Hens dung,</hi> ana <hi>two Ounces; Onions, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, Leeks,</hi> ana <hi>an Ounce and half; Mithridate, Gum-Elemi,</hi> ana <hi>an Ounce; Saffron half an Ounce; Pouder of the Roots of Aron and Briony, of the Leaves of Dittany and Rue,</hi> ana <hi>enough to make it into the consistency of a Pultise.</hi> It will bring it to maturation in a short time.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. But if you would have the Maturative much stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as in those cases where Life is in imminent danger, as in the Plague, and other malign, poisonous, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifactive Distempers, you must add to the Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Salt of Tartar, Nitre, Quicklime, Pouders of Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an roots, Ranunculus, Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrum, Hellebore, and Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed,</hi> with other things of like kind, which you must apply, and renew it every twelve hours.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. The Abscess being now brought to ripeness, or a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of opening <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>; the next thing to be considered, is, the best way of doing that operation. It is done either by a potential Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or an Actual, or the Knife.</p>
                     <p n="11">
                        <hi>XI. Celsus,</hi> lib. 7. cap. 2. <hi>saith,</hi> If the malady be deep, it is to be considered whether that place be nervous, or no:
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65913:53"/>
If it be without Nerves, the Actual Cautery, as a red-hot Iron is to be chosen; <hi>(because it strengthens the parts it touches;)</hi> but if Nerves be near, the Actual Cautery, or Fire, is not proper, <hi>for that it is certainly (according to</hi> Hippocrates) <hi>an Enemy to the Nerves:</hi> In this case, you ought to use the Incision-knife, or Lancet.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. It remains then to be determined in other cases, whether the potential Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or the Knife is best; or if each at some times are best, which that best is. We will consider, from <hi>Barbet,</hi> the Conveniencies and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonience of each: <hi>First,</hi> As to the potential Cautery, it has these Convenieneies in it: 1. That it does not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright a faint-hearted Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. 2. Nor does it cause very much pain, especially if you use the famed Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or these times, <hi>viz, Dutch Soap mixed with Quick-lime,</hi> which eats deep enough to the Flesh, and much more gentle than the Holoserick Cautery of <hi>Paraeus:</hi> Yet these Inconveniences are apt to attend it: I. It corrodes sometimes much deeper and farther about than is needful, by reason of its spreading, notwithstanding the defen sative. 2. It is some hours; before it perfectly does the operation; which, if the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor be maligant, will not permit of it. 3. The Eschar does not presently fall off, so that if you would have the Matter brought forth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, you must use the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision-knife or Lancet, for all that; nor is it possible to avoid these Inconveniencies.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As to the Knife, it has these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; 1. That most Patients are afraid of it. 2. That it is supposed to cause much pain; but the fear is prevented by not speaking of it; and the pain is of no great moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more in name, than in power: yet it has these Conveniences withal. 1. By the Knife, or Lancet, you may make the Apertion as long, and as deep, as you please, or the Aposteme requires. 2. You very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come at the Matter,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65913:53"/>
whereby it is evacuated, and the Patient eased. 3. The remaining Matter, not yet digested, will be more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maturated, by external applications, assisted with Internals. 4. There will not be a long continued gleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which often attends Tumours, or Apostems up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Glandules) being opened with <hi>Cathereticks.</hi> For Apostems behind the Ears, in the Neck, Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and Groins, arise from hardned Glandules, fill'd with preter-natural Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: These Glands are covered with a proper Coat, which being hurt, a gleeting necessarily follows; for the Tunicles being broken or opened, the Glandule can neither preserve it self, nor its Humour, but a gleeting will continue so long, 'till the hole in the Tunicle is cured, or the whole Kernel is vanished and consumed.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. The Aposteme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened, you must not let all the Matter (if it be much) out at once; for there would be a too great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spending of the Spirits at one time: But for the asswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the pain, you must let out only some part of it; and afterwards make the evacuation by degrees; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the remaining concocted <hi>Pus</hi> helps to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that which is yet unripe, if any be; as also to keep the natural heat of the part, to cut, deterge, soften, and dissolve all the Reliques of the Aposteme, beyond the power of any Topick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine whatsoever.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. When all the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is evacuated at once, it often causes a fainting or swooning, from the excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great loss of Spirits; the remaining undigested Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter oftentimes grows so hard and scirrhous, that the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect becomes incurable, to which Resolvents or Emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lients are applied in vain; the first consuming what is thin, leaving the remainder hard like a Stone; the latter, wanting strength and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating force, to divide the Matter into its smallest Particles: Nor can this be done by any thing but the <hi>Pus</hi> it self, which is both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:65913:54"/>
and continuous, with the remaining undigested Humor, being the nearest efficient, and of the same Species, and therefore only and alone able to cut, atte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, and prepare the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Matter.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. Therefore, as soon as the Skin grows soft with the Matter in it, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme is to be opened, and, if the Patient be not fearful, with the Lancet or Knife, that such other proper Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy as Nature requires may be applied, lest the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Matter should corrupt other parts or Vessels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; and the Incision or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertive ought to be so large, as the nature of the part, and magnitude of the Aposteme require: Which if it be skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done, afflicts both less and a shorter time than a Cautery; and immediately also brings the desired help, without any prejudice to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, the Skin being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cut in a right line; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a Caustick will ('spight of all prevention) extend it self both lengthways &amp; breadth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; whence many times arises cruel pains, and great inflammation, both in the parts immediate, and those adjacent to the Caustick, and so leave a large Eschar; which is not only long in falling off, but the part laid bare, is slowly and with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty restored.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. Moreover, Tumors which keep the native Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Flesh and Skin, and but slowly maturate, sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom grow copped or rise much; (as in our Example of an Aposteme in the Leg, at <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. aforegoing;) and therefore you must not wait for a head before you open it.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. If you open an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posteme near some internal Cavity, as the Breast, or Abdomen, you must whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reject Injections made with a Syringe, left some part of it should enter into the Cavity, where it might not only cause grievous Symptoms, but also prove the death of the Sick.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. Apostems in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munctories, Throat, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65913:54"/>
behind the Ears, ought to be opened rather too soon, than to stay for a full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation; not only because ill Symptoms many times succeed, but Life it self is lost: Of which <hi>Fabricius Hildanus</hi> gives you some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, which are worth noting.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. A certain Woman in this City had an Aposteme on her left side, near the Reins of her Back, so that when ripe, it covered partly the Side, partly the Back, and partly the Hip, being as large as an ordinary Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny-loaf. This had been twelve or fourteen Weeks a gathering; several Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Chyrurgions were entertained, and many things were done without any profit to the Patient; nor indeed could they all tell what the Disease was. At length the Aposteme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently manifested it self; they were then consulted about opening of it, but none of them was willing to do it, they all fearing her immediate death. At length I was sent for, to view it; it was a great and wonderful Tumor, and not without apparent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and danger; yet it was my Opinion it should be opened, (for as the Proverb is, <hi>While there is Life, there may be hope;</hi>) the Patient consented to it, and I did it: There was near two Quarts of digested Matter gathered together; (for the timerousness of the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Chyrurgions had kept it too long from being opened) this Matter I eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated by degrees; I took out almost a Pint at the first, (giving the Sick immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a Dram, or two, of my <hi>Aqua Bezoartica,</hi> to support her Spirits,) and in about five or six Days time, the whole substance of the <hi>Pus</hi> was evacuated. And finding that it had made no inroads into the cavity of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> I soon clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Ulcer, and in less than six Weeks time left the Patient perfectly well.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. Hence it is to be observed, That though an Aposteme may sometimes
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65913:55"/>
happen to be in a dangerous place, and withal, through either the neglect, timerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or unskilfulness of the Artist, the Apertion has been too long deferr'd, whereby apparent danger is imminent; yet the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Physician should pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently put on so much Courage, as to leave nothing unattempted towards the saving of the Sick, so long as there is Life, and the case only doubtful.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. Some Authors say, That Abscesses, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemes may be discussed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are suppurated; two Exmaples of which <hi>

Where one <hi>Pomeret</hi> cured a suppurated Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme in his Daughter, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eight years of Age. The Aposteme was (saith he) on the out-side of her nether law, on the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side of her Face, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated. He, (from the Authority of <hi>Guido,</hi> who saith, That suppurated Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemes, are sometimes eured by discussion, and from the Experiment of <hi>Paraens,</hi> who also averrs, that he had cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a suppurated Aposteme, with crude Mercury, mix'd with Diapalma Emplaster, which discussed the same,) he, I say, in imitation of them, <hi>mixed a Dram of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, with an Ounco of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palma,</hi> and applied it to the said suppurated Tumor, and within four days he affirms it was perfectly discussed. He also saith, that he did the same thing again on the same Daughter, who having an <hi>Oedematous or Flegmatick Tumor suppurated</hi> upon the Region of her Lions, as big as the palm of one's Hand, it was discust within a few days by the same Plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster. But in order to the performance of this, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, 1. That the suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Matter be small in quantity. 2. That it be thin and serous. 3. That it be near the Skin, and not in any deep part. 4. That it be in a soft-fleshed, strong and youthful Body. 5. That it also be in the Summer sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the year.</p>
                     <p n="23">XXIII. These are great Authorities, and so much as
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65913:55"/>
they may do upon their own score, may force a kind of belief: But a Mind exercised with Reason, and desirous of Truth, can hardly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, besides the hazard and danger that may follow after such an Operation; for where think you must that mass of Putrefaction go, if it be discust? The whole substance of it cannot pass through the pores of the Skin; if any thing, only the thin and watery part can pass: The thick putrified Matter, if it dissolves, must revert either into the Blood or solid Substance of the Flesh, or both; which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but corrupt the Body, and fill it full of ill Humors springing from such a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Seed of Diseases, whence Tettars, Ringworms, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew Scruf, Leprosie, King's Evil, Scurvy, Pains, Aches, Lameness, even an Army of attendent Diseases will pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly succeed. So that if the thing may be possible, I scarce think it prudent to attempt such a Work. Nor does it yet appear by all that these Men have said, that any such thing has been done, for the Tumors not being opened, their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might deceive them; and they may take that for granted, which never was: A very admirable Example of this kind I could instance, of a pretty large Aposteme (as it was thought) by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Physicians and Chyrur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, my self being present there also: The Man had been in much pain, but now was pretty easie: The Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeons were for opening of it, as judging it to be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purated; but the Patient's being easie would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; he only kept it cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a <hi>Diapalma Plaster,</hi> and in a Months time, the Tumor was discust, and the Sick well. Now I am of Opinion, that here was no suppurated Aposteme. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from the aforesaid Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of those learned Men, this may be noted: 1. That a Mercurial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaster applied to several sorts of Tumors, may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding useful, more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they be not suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. 2. That it is possible the wisest Artist may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by appearances in

Diseases of this kind, where the insides of Things are not seen into, though many times they may judge right. <hi>Salmon.</hi>

Moreover, The declension of the <hi>Fibres</hi> are heedfully to be observed in opening an Aposteme, that you may not cut cross them: For, as <hi>Rolfincius</hi> observed, an ignorant Barber opening an Aposteme on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, did it cross-ways: 'Tis true, the Ulcer was cured; but the Patient was ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deprived of the benefit of his Eyes, except when he pasted up his Eyebrows with Plasters.</p>
                     <p n="25">XXV. If pain seize any part of the Body, and you fear that Matter is gathered there; if the Sick sweats, and the pain continue, 'tis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively to be concluded; and though the colour of the part be not changed, yet it must be opened to let out the Matter; which if it be but little, it may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and without any prejudice, run all out at once, which is ready to run with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pressing; and pressing indeed is to be avoided, (because it many times does hurt,) unless the <hi>Pus</hi> or Matter be lodg'd in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote place from the Orifice.</p>
                     <p n="26">XXVI. In opening of an Aposteme upon the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks, you must be careful not to cut the great Nerve which lies under, or lay it bare, lest it be hurt by cold; for thereby it will leave the Thigh for ever after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbed.</p>
                     <p n="27">XXVII. <hi>Sylvius</hi> saith, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all things which move or promote the excretion of Matter, antimonial Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are most to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended: For (saith he) I have often observed, that they have a Virtue to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all Evils brought on the Body by Matter, and to hinder the production of new: Because Antimony is not less serviceable to the purification of Man's Body, than it is to that of Gold, if it be rightfully prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and administred. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonium Diaphoreticum,</hi> more especially <hi>Bezoar Minerale</hi>)

'T <hi>Is certain, That every Thrush has its rise from a morbifick Acid;</hi> and that is the true Reason they are so frequent in Children; and in Children, rather than in those of riper Age; and this is first caused either from ill Milk in the Nurse, spoiling the Stomach of the Child, or from a natural Weakness of the part, and sharpness of Humors there; which curdling the Milk, breeds or encreases the acid Humor so much, 'till it comes to that acidity, as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode the Skin; so that the Mouth and parts adjacent, seem as if it was a part scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and in some, as if it was scalded, and the Skin rubb'd off.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <hi>The first thing therefore to be considered in the Cure, is to absorb the acid Humor, and that with all the speed that may be:</hi> For the soreness of the Mouth, though it be bad enough, yet is not that which indicates the greatest danger; inasmuch as the acid Humor may be carried down into the Bowels, and do the same thing there, at least cause gripings, sharp prickings of the Bowels, and sometimes a vehement Flux, if not a bloody Flux; which does not always go alone, but are many times atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65913:57"/>
with dire Symptoms, as Convulsions, Fevers, and the like.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>It is also to be noted, That where this acid Matter or Spirit extravagantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in little ones, by reason of the softness and ductileness of the parts, the said acid penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and through a thousand Intricacies acscending up to the Brain,</hi> being volatilized by the infant-heat and subtilty of the Spirits, it strikes upon the Ventricles of the Brain, and seizing as it were upon the Substance of the Brain, contaminating all the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits with its acidity, it forthwith causes an <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie:</hi> And this is the true ground of this Disease, which so often and so much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts Children, which might easily be preyented in the beginning, were but care timely taken to depress the acid, and sweeten the juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nile Juices.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>The next thing is, to expel the Excrements or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter contaminated with the acid:</hi> We must not only correct or absorb the acid Humor, but the Matter affected therewith must be expelled; for otherwise it will lie both in the Bowels and Vessels, and there corrupt or grow sowre again; and indeed it easily resumes its former state.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. <hi>The acid is corrected with Alcalies, and such indeed are best, which may best, and with most ease and the least danger, be given to Children:</hi> Such are impalpable Pouders of <hi>Crabs Eyes, Pearls, Corral, Salt of Tartar, Lapis Haema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titis, Antimonium Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum, Bezoar Minerale, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar of Antimony;</hi> which last being levigated into sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Powder, is a most abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute thing. Out of these things you may make the following Prescriptions, or the like.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Take impalpable Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Crabs Eyes, from one Scruple to half an Ounce; Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of Poppies two Drams; mix for a Dose. <hi>Or this:</hi> Take Bezoarticum Minerale one Scruple; Syrup of Poppies or of Planiane, enough to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lax it for one Dose. <hi>Or this:</hi> Take Antimenium <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Or this: <hi>Take Bezoar Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rale, Cinnabar of Antimony in impalpable Pounder,</hi> ana <hi>fifteen Grains; mix for a Dose.</hi> And some of these things are to be taken Morning and Night for four or five days. These Doses are for elder Persons; but if for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you must diminish the Dose accordingly, Ex. Gr. <hi>Take Bezoar Minerale four Grains, Cinnabar of Antimony eight Grains; mix for a Dose.</hi> Or this: <hi>Take Salt of Tartar eight Grains, Cinnabar of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony six Grains; mix them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>To carry off the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick Matter, the vulgar Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians commonly purge Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with Syrup of</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chory with Rheubarb; <hi>and it may do indifferent well:</hi> But Purges which cool the Body are here to be chosen. <hi>Take Manna half an Ounce, Extract of Cassia one Dram; mix for a Dose:</hi> Or the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> may be made into a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup with Water, and the <hi>Cassia</hi> dissolved therein: Or <hi>two or three Drams of Cassia, with two or three drops of Oil of Anniseeds,</hi> may be given dissolved in Milk. Or this: <hi>Take Sena from half a Dram to a Dram, Liquorice bruised half a Dram, Anniseeds one Scruple bruised; infuse twelve hours in a gentle heat in two Ounces, or better, of Water; strain out, and sweeten with Manna.</hi> Or this: <hi>Take Sena, Liquorice bruised half a Dram; Anniseeds, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raways,</hi> ana <hi>ten Grains; infuse as before in Water two Ounces for twelve hours; strain and dissolve therein Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia extracted from half a Dram to a Dram,</hi> and give it for a Dose. But if it be to be given to one of riper years, you must double, treble, or quadruple the Dose accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Age and Strength.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Fat and oily Things take off the edge of the acid; but</hi> Opiates <hi>do it much better:</hi> For this purpose <hi>you may give from ten to fifteen or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drops of my Guttae Vitae,</hi> in any thing the Child drinks, at bed-time; I have found it very prevalent. It not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blunts the points of the

acid, and dulls the edge of the sharp Homor, but gives Nature rest and ease, 'till she can recruit her self again; as also it puts a present stop to the flux of the Humor to the sore or raw parts: Elder Persons may take my <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Volatile, from three to six Grains,</hi> beginning with the smaller Dose first. They that cannot swallow a Pill, <hi>may take ten or twelve Grains of my new</hi> London <hi>Treacle, in any fit Vehicle.</hi> These things thicken the fluid acid, so that it cannot approach with that violence to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seased parts.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. <hi>But whereas</hi> Opiates <hi>strangely disagree with some People, my</hi> Tinctura ad Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrhos <hi>answers all the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of sweetening and stopping the flux of the said Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour;</hi> and it may be given even to Children with a world of safety and securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from half a Dram to one or two, in any proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which the Child will take.

And in those of ripe years, it is a most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing, if given from two Scruples to a Dram, in Broth, or some such-like.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. <hi>Sylvius de le Boe</hi> saith, <hi>be prefers a metallick or mineral Sulphur fixt above all;</hi> in comparison of which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65913:59"/>
(saith he) that I have hitherto tried, does so kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, certainly, speedily, and safely restrain those vicious effervescencies: But what those Sulphurs are, or how (in his sense) to be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, he has no-where told us. I am well satisfied, that the <hi>Sulphur of Antimony,</hi> if well made, is a most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable thing: But then it must be given to Men, and not to Infants. Truly, I cannot tell whether it may safely be given to Children in any Dose whatsoever, or no, especially as it is now made. There is a <hi>Sulphur of Antimony</hi> that I know, which may be so prepared, as it may be given to little ones without danger, but that is no where to be sold that I can tell of.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Among the rest of the ordinary Remedies</hi> Lac Sulphuris <hi>is no mean thing;</hi> and it may be given to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as well as to elder Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, with a very great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Topicks must be also used to the mouth, throat, and afflicted parts;</hi> among which, elder Persons may use this: <hi>Take white Vitriol, Roch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum one Scruple, Plantane or Spring-water four Ounces; mix, dissolve, and sweeten with Sugar, for a Gargarism.</hi> But Children, to whom it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so easily be used, must have <hi>the juice of baked Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps</hi> to wash withal, or swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low down; or <hi>the juice of Parsneps baked with Milk.</hi> These things are Balsams in their kind; and besides their healing Property, have a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of sweetning and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the edge of the acid.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. <hi>Moreover, you may if you please, sweeten these Juices with Honey, or Syrup of Roses; both which still contribute to the healing of the sore and raw mouth:</hi> And if the Child has discretion enough, it ought to hold the same in its mouth for some time: And to these things you may add <hi>Syrups of Violets, Jujubes, Liquorice, Lettuce, juice of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slane,</hi> &amp;c, for that they all blunt (as it were) the edge of the sharp Humor, and withal contribute to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

XVI. <hi>But that which is more observable and remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, (but only for Persons of ripe years,) is, the use of</hi> Spirit of Wine, <hi>or</hi> pure Brandy; for that only held in the mouth, (and sometimes Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with,) for two or three minutes at a time, and that four or five times a day, and then spit out, certainly heals and cures the afflicted parts to a miracle. And though it may smart much at first, it is vehement but for a while, <hi>viz.</hi> for the first two or three times using of it, afterwards it is easier, and at length the parts are, as it were, pleased and refreshed with the use thereof; and in the end it perfectly heals them: And this it does not do only from its <hi>balsamick Property,</hi> but also as it is an <hi>Alcaly,</hi> and absorbs the acid in the Ulcer.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. Sylvius <hi>commends the Yolk of an Egg, mixt with a little Rose-water and Sugar; for that it draws to it the acid Humour that hurts the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach;</hi> and so by degrees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of a QUINSEY.</head>
                     <p n="1">I. A <hi>Quinsey is an Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Muscles of the Jaws and Throat, which being swelled, do stop and contract the passages of Breathing and Swallowing:</hi> This Inflammation possesses both <hi>Pharynx</hi> and <hi>Larynx:</hi> The <hi>Pharynx</hi> or <hi>Fauces,</hi> is the hinder and lower part of the Mouth, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seen, unless the Mouth be opened wide, and the Tongue held down, being the beginning of the Mouth of the Gullet, (and by some for that Reason is called the Throat:) Its substance is fleshy, performing its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive motion by <hi>strait Fibres,</hi> and its expulsive by such as are <hi>Orbicular;</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains two Bones, the <hi>Os Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oides,</hi> and the <hi>Lambdoides:</hi> It has also four <hi>Cartilages;</hi> two somewhat great, long, and round, in the Belly of the <hi>Os Hyoides,</hi> and two les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, adjacent to the Horns thereof; as also, four pair of <hi>Muscles.</hi> The <hi>Larynx</hi> is the head, or upper part of the Wind-pipe, situate in the Neck, and that in the middle thereof, being but one in Number, that there might be but one Voice, of a roundish Figure, that it might be hollow for the Voices sake, which is strait in Youth, whereby the Voice is shrill, but larger in elder Persons, whereby the Voice is bigger, and more gross, and contains seven pair of <hi>Muscles,</hi> five <hi>Grisles: Veins</hi> from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Jugular; Arteries</hi> from the larger branch of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotides,</hi> or sleepy Arteries and Nerves, from the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current</hi> Branch of the <hi>Par Vagum,</hi> which help on the motion of the <hi>Muscles;</hi> as also <hi>Membranes</hi> contiguous with, and continued from the Membranes of the <hi>Trachea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:65913:61"/>
II. <hi>I thought it absolutely necessary to give a small De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the Parts, which this Disease possesses;</hi> for that their Anatomical Structure being understood, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease is made something the more intelligible to the Mind; wherein the danger of it lies, (which is always great) the extremity of the Torment, (almost unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressible,) and some Light is added to the ways and means of Curing, which ought to be as speedy and hasty, as the Disease is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and exquisite.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. <hi>A Quinsey is also said to be two-fold,</hi> viz. <hi>either True, or Bastard:</hi> The True is when the Muscles, and other parts of the Throat and Jaws, are not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and swelled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but the outward parts of the Neck are swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led outwardly also, which is always accompanied with a Fever: The Bastard is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an outward Swelling of the Throat, Tumifying and Inflaming the Muscles there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and parts adjacent there to, but ever without a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. <hi>Almost all Authors say, That it is always caused of Blood; and some, That it is caused of Blood mixt with other Humours;</hi> But Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence has taught us, That it is only a Flux of Humours to the Parts, which filling them with their Passages, puts the Life into peril: And this is eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in such as are opened, or where they break, the Matter flowing forth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrating that it is only the product of conflucting Humours of divers kinds, raised for the most part from Cold taken, which putting the said Humours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fermentation and Flux, in a febritick habit of body, send them up to the Throat, and parts thereabouts, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if there be also a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural weakness of those parts attending.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Physicians, for the most part, begin this Cure with Blood-letting; and if ever Blood-letting be reasonable and necessary to be done, it ought
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65913:61"/>
                        <hi>to be done here;</hi> because, (though by that operation you cannot empty the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter congregated, yet) by drawing a pretty quantity of Blood away you will in some measure empty the said parts of the sanguinous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour appendent thereto, and probably take away the imminent danger and peril of Life, which in this Disease is so usual. By this means a revulsion being made, the afflux of Humours to the part affected, is in some measure stopt.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. <hi>For as in other Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Blood is let, not in respect of that Matter which has already caused an Aposteme in the part, but for preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on's sake, in respect to the Matter yet flowing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the Inflammation:</hi> And so here they prescribe <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> in the beginning, lest the Inflammation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually increasing (before other Remedies could be seasonably applied) by the continual afflux of Humors, a present Suffocation should emerge.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. <hi>But if the Tumor be not very great, or while the Sich can yet indifferently swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, it is good to make other Evacuations;</hi> and the Sick may now the better bear them, because the great danger in this Disease pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not so much from the weakness of the Body, as the oppression and hurt of a singular part. Now the Question is, Whether this Evacuation ought to be by Vomit, or by Stool, or by both.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Some are for Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, others are against it; for that, as they say, it draws the Humours still upwards to the Throat. To which we Answer,</hi> That a Vomit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly draws the Humors into the Stomach, and does no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than expel them by the Throat: And if the Humours from most of the adjacent parts congregate in the Stomach, ('tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether they be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or sent,) 'tis possible the <hi>Fauces,</hi> and parts adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent to them, may in some manner be emptied by this
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65913:62"/>
kind of revulsion or deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (chuse you whether:) But this is to be considered, that this kind of operation ought to be only in such as easily Vomit, and are not naturally averse to it, and while yet the Passages are so wide, as indifferently to let the Matter pass through. If otherwise, you will cause a Suffocation instead of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuation, and kill the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient instead of Curing.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. <hi>Among many others, I remember two special Examples of Cures of a Quinsey, which I did by Vomiting.</hi> In <hi>the first,</hi> it so effectually evacuated the Matter, that the Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation abated immediately, and the Tumor disappeared, and wholly went away, without any other operation, or intention of Cure: In <hi>the other,</hi> by reason of the straining of the parts, and violence of Vomiting, the Tumor (being come to ripeness) broke in the very act of Vomiting, and the Patient had an immediate relief; the remaining part of the Cure being done af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of a common Ulcer.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. <hi>But Evacutions by Stool, may much better and safer be performed;</hi> and though many times Purging does not wholly do the Cure, yet it for the most part evites the Peril, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal matter in this Cure; for that Nature it self would perform the work alone, if Suffocation did not prevent it.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. <hi>In this case it may be demanded, that if Purging be necessary, What kinds of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges those are which ought to be used in this case:</hi> To which I Answer; Such as are strong and violent, that a sufficient derivation may be made downwards: For if you Purge, and it be so weakly as not to derive the Matter, you do nothing: You are to remember that the danger of Life is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and therefore that it is necessary, by violence and force to draw back the peccant Matter.</p>

                     <p n="14">XIV. <hi>I care not greatly if I relate a History of this kind, done by a Mountebank in this City:</hi> A young Man having an exquisite Quinsey, sent for this Man; who coming to view him, and looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throat, and not knowing or apprehending what his Disease was; but mistaking in his Judgment, and thinking it to be the <hi>Pox,</hi> gave him a lusty Dose of <hi>Turbith Mineral, in a Dram of Mithridate:</hi> This (the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being beforehand in Flux, and filling those parts) in fifteen or sixteen hours time, put him into a severe Flux, and in less than twenty four hours, put him out of the peril of Death; for he spit out the Cause of the Disease, and fluxing twenty two or

Had he truly known the Disease, it must have been accounted a very bold and rash attempt, and not, with safety, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured; but as as it fell out, it proved very fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and succesful; for though the Sick had a great deal of trouble and pain, yet he did very well at last.

                     <p n="16">XVI. <hi>In giving inward Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, you ought to let them be in the form of a Potion, not of a Pill or Bolus,</hi> because of the difficulty of swallowing; and if the Sick should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to vomiting, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the force, the strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Passage, and solid Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Medicine, it might hazard strangling.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. <hi>If you bleed the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, you may purge him the day following, (net waiting for the Coction of Humors, because the Disease admits of no Truoe;</hi>) yea, if it be very violent, you ought to purge even the same day. <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> saith with gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; (but it is like a great many more of that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Mistakes;) I say, it must be with strong, and such as may divert power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully downwards; (for this Experience has taught me, and I have saved many Lives by it; whereas had I trifled with gentle Things, my sick Patients had been infallibly
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:65913:63"/>
lost.) To these Things you may add emollient and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick Clysters, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much derive and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Cure.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>When the Aposteme is come to ripeness, it would be well that Nature would break it alone; if not, to save Life, it ought to be opened. Barbet</hi> tells us of a Quinsey which he cured by opening the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steme: It was a Woman; her Tonsils were so swelled, that she could not swallow at all, but threw whatever she took out at her Nostrils: He let her Blood, used Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplasms and Gargarisms; and the fourth day as he was searching the part with a Probe, saw that the Abscess was ripe: he resolved to treat her somewhat roughly; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving her any warning, he brake it with the same Probe; upon which, when she was cured, she laugh'd, and commended his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. <hi>If the Aposteme be in no hopes of sudden breaking, to save Life, opening the Throat may be attempted;</hi> which is called <hi>Laryngotomy:</hi> It is sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom put in practise for fear of Disgrace, if the Patient should die soon after the Operation is ended. For if in a dangerous Quinsey where the Lungs are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed with Humors, or the <hi>Pleura</hi> is afflicted, or those Parts be any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, in these cases, it is for the most part done in vain, and only gives occati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reproach.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. <hi>The Operation is thus performed:</hi> Put the Patient into a Chair with his head leaning back, as much as he well can; let a Servant, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind him, take up the Skin on each side of the sorepart of the Neck; then let the Artist cut the Skin lengthways, with the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles under it, just against the <hi>Aspera Arteria,</hi> not far from the pit of the Throat, and with a broad Lancet let him make a Section, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle space, between the third and fourth Cartilaginous Ring, taking diligent care that the Cartilages them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be not hurt: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made a hole, he must
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:65913:64"/>
put in a Silver Pipe, not over long, nor to touch the back part of the Wind-Pipe, for then it would cause con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual coughing. By this way the Breath goes and comes to the Lungs, 'till the Inflammation is either dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed, or comes to Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and a passage for breathing by the mouth be restored, which usually comes to pass in three or four days. Then the Pipe may be taken away, and the Wound cured after the ordinary way, which will quickly be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. When the Aposteme comes to Suppuration, that it either breaks of its own accord, or is opened by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, you must take care that the Corruption fall not upon the Lungs, nor into the Stomach, for fear of some other Disease; but it must carefully be cast up at the mouth; and then a Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism of Hydromel, or Wine and Honey of Roses, must be used to cleanse the parts.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. Galen, <hi>and his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctators, use cold and astringent Gargarisms, in all sorts of Quinseys, contrary to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of</hi> Hippocrates, <hi>who prescribes Gargarisms actually hot:</hi> The former causes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and speedy suffocation, if the congregated Matter be from Phlegm which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses Repercussives: And Humours extravasated, stic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Flesh, whilst thick cannot flow; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are to be made Fluxile with hot Remedies. If one taken with a Quinsey, do (saith <hi>Wallaeus</hi>) in the beginning of the Disease, gargle with Spirit of Wine, all Inflammations will cease in about three hours time.</p>
                     <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>There has been a great noise made in the World about the use of a Swallow's Nest, but the Virtue truly lies in the Dung which is found in the Nest:</hi> And because the Dung is full of nitrous Salt, 'tis possible it may have a specifick Virtue against this Disease; and though it is sharp, yet it is withal dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutient, and therefore may be proper where the Disease arises from thick Phlegm. The Tincture of it may be
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:65913:64"/>
made with Wine, or Spirit of Wine and Water, and a Gargarism made thereof to be used four, five, or six times a day hot.</p>
                     <p n="24">XXIV. <hi>Scultetus</hi> commends this highly in the beginning of any Quinsey whatsoever: Take Plantane Water three Ounces; sharp Wine-Vinegar one Ounce; Sugar two Drams; Saffron in Pouder half a Dram; mix and make a Gargarism, <hi>to be often used.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="25">XXV. Platerus <hi>commends the Juice of Tree Ivy; swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed slowly from three Drams, to half an Ounce;</hi> for that it both digests and repels. <hi>Sennertus</hi> saith, that the Decoction of the inner Rind of the Hazle, or of the Barberry-wood, is excellent: So also a Decoction of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der flowers and Leaves, with Jews-Ears, sweetned with Honey of Roses for a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garism: An Infusion of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stard-seed in Wine, is also an approved thing.</p>
                     <p n="26">XXVI. Outwardly Things also ought to be applied to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ripening; such as this: Take of our Antidote one Ounce; Hens Dung, Turpentine, Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, <hi>ana</hi> one Dram; mix them, and apply it hot. <hi>Or this:</hi> Take a roasted or baked Turnep split in balves; moisten it well with Balsam of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and apply them on both sides the Jaws warm. <hi>But the old Remedy, you know, is</hi> Album Graecum, <hi>dried, pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and mixed with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; to be applied as a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taplasm outwardly, and to besmear the parts withal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="27">XXVII. Some affirm, that the Ashes of an Owl, (burne in an earthen Pot,) being blown into the Throat, are a specifick against a Quinsie, softning it to admiration, and breaking of it. <hi>Others commend, as a great Secret, this:</hi> Take Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre half an Ounce; Cream of Tartar one Ounce; white Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar two Ounces; make each into a fine Pouder, and mix them; <hi>which put upon the Part, leisurely to dissolve there; or make a Garga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rism therewith, with this following Water:</hi> Take Juice of Housleek one Pound, Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack half an Ounce; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:65913:65"/>
and filter through brown Paper.</p>
                     <p n="28">XXVIII. <hi>I commend this following, as a thing I have had great Experience of: Take Wine half a Pint; Tinctura Stomachica a spoonful; mix, and give it for a draught.</hi> It dissipates the Inflammation, and by its heat it discusses the Tumor at three or four times using, provided it be used at the beginning: If used afterwards, it does good, either discussing the swelling or hastning the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turation; it is certainly one of the best of Remedies in this kind; but at first, it seems to set on fire the whole Mouth and Throat, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is more moderate.</p>
                     <p n="29">XXIX. <hi>Among the number of the rest of the Things which I cannot enough commend,</hi> our <hi>Spiritus Anticolicus</hi> has place: In Extremity, the Parts ought to be smeared or moistened with it (with a Rag) alone; or you may mix a spoonful of it with three, four, five, or six spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls of Wine, and gargle with it often warm, <hi>viz.</hi> five or six times a day.</p>
                     <p n="30">XXX. When a Quinsey is in beginning, the only thing, and truly the best of Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, is, to take about one ounce of our <hi>Spiritus Cosme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> in a Glass of Sack; this given two or three times, is indeed an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Remedy; for it not only discusses or dissipates the Tumor, but it brings on a most necessary Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoresis, by which not only the afflux of new Matter is prevented, but the Disease and all its Relicks perfectly cast off.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">I. YOu ought to consider whether there be a perfect deafness, or a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of hearing only: If the deafness be perfect, so that the Patient can hear no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, no not the very beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Drums, nor the noise of Guns, or Cannon, the <hi>Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panum,</hi> or Drum of the Ear, may be supposed to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and therefore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease to be incurable: In this case you ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing; for you will reap nothing but Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace: But if with much ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, hollowing, or making a noise, the Patient can hear you, there is hopes, and you may hopefully make a trial.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If Deafness is either attended, or begun, with Pain, it is either through a sharp Vapour, or Matter, offending the Part: In this case, according to the Rule of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> Sect. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> 48. <hi>you ought to evacuate by vomit: For Diseases</hi> (as he saith in another place) <hi>are to be discharged by the part next to them; and to be drawn out by that part that has a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage nearest to them. In Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro de Affectibus,</hi> he advises, <hi>That if pain arises in the Ears, to wash in much hot water, and apply a fomentation to the Ears, that the Phlegm may be attenuated, and the pain eased;</hi> but if it cease not yet, an emetick Potion is then best to be used.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. There are many kinds of Vomits prescribed by Physicians, as the <hi>Vinum Benedictum, Vinum Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niale, Aqua Benedict a Rulands,</hi> and a great many more of that kind, which, without doubt, may be profitably given: But there is no Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, which I ever met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, has out done, nay, scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65913:66"/>
equalled my <hi>Caetharticum Argenteum,</hi> which may be given from two Scruples to a Dram, in a little Posset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink, or Ale; or in place thereof, you may give from four to six Grains, of <hi>our Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petus Mineralis,</hi> in a little Conserve or Syrup, taking a large quantity of warm Broth after it.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Now this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood when the seat of the Phlegm, and cause of the Pain is above; but if it lies lower, or <hi>vomiting</hi> does no good, cooling things must be dropt in, and that actually cold, as <hi>Juice of Plantane, Fumitory,</hi> and the like; and a Potion or Pills must be given that purge downwards: Our <hi>Vinum Catharticum</hi> is here of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent use, if you give a Poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if the Sick loaths a Potion, and you desire to use Pills, <hi>our Pilulae Mirabiles,</hi> are admirable, given from twenty Grains to half a Dram: If any thing can be said to exceed them, it is the <hi>Pilula Lunaris,</hi> given to six Grains; which I have several times given with success, even in this case, See these Medicines in my <hi>Phylaxa Med. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 59, 61, 62.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. You ought also to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, whether the Pain and Deafness proceeds from a hot or cold cause, though what proceeds only from those simple Intemperatures, seldom lasts long; yet you ought to have some respect to them, because hot Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in a hot Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment influence the Body, as cold Medicines in a cold Temperament chill it, and so make the Disease worse.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Though <hi>Opiates</hi> are accounted ill in a Deafness, yet if the Pain attending be very acute or sharp, there will be a necessity to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with the Ill, for the Good that may ensue: And this is an Observation wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of remarking, That though Opiates are apt (if not to cause deafness, yet) to confirm or continue it, those ill effects seldom last much longer than the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Medicine: I have known some Patients
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65913:66"/>
of mine, who being a little deaf afore-hand, upon libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally taking of <hi>Opiates,</hi> have had their deafness seemingly very much augmented, yet upon the giving over the use of the same, have had their Hearing return again to satisfaction, and that with the advantage of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acuteness; whereby it appears that <hi>Opiates</hi> do no essential injury to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of Hearing.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. If any Matter runs from the Ear, looking like the Matter of an Ulcer, you must be cautious how you use Repellers, lest the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter strikes inward, or be driven to the Brain; (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by endangering an Apople<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy,) or part of the Matter be dried and hardened in the cavity of the Ear, whereby not only greater Dangers may ensue, but at least the hazard of an incurable Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And the same thing is to be understood in a critical Evacuation, or where the Matter is thick and tough, or there be an Aposteme breeding.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. If the Pain and Deafness proceeds from a cold Cause, you may inject Juice of Onions into the Ear, or Goats or Sheeps Urine. Or this: <hi>Take Juice of Onions three Ounces, Spirit of Wine one Ounce; mix them,</hi> and drop it into the Ear, or inject it with a Syringe. Or this: <hi>Take Boys Urine new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made two Ounces, Spirit of Wine one Ounce, in which six Grains of Camphire is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; mix,</hi> and inject it. These are excellent Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in a cold Cause, and seldom fail, at least of giving ease.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. But if a hot Cause be present, though things absolutely cold may be given, yet hot things must positively be forborn; and things of an equal tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are to be administred, such as these following: <hi>Take choice Canary four Ounces; Spirit of Wine one Ounce; Nitre in Pouder two Drams; mix,</hi> and drop it into the Ear. Or this: <hi>Take Juice of Plantane two Ounces; Juice of Purslane one Ounce; Juice</hi>
                        <pb n="96" facs="tcp:65913:67"/>
of Lettisce half an Ounce; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine an Ounce and half; mix them. <hi>Or this:</hi> Take Juice of Cucumbers two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Spirit of Wine one Ounce; mix them, <hi>to be dropt into the Ear.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="10">X. If with the Deafness and Pain, there seems to be an Apostemation, <hi>Faventinus</hi> his Cataplasm of <hi>roasted or baked Onions,</hi> are usual to be applied. Or you may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this: <hi>Take Pulp of roasted Onions, Mithridate,</hi> ana <hi>an Ounce; Saffron in Powder one Scruple; Spirit of Wine Gut. Thirty; mix,</hi> and apply it hot to the Ear. If it proceeds from a cold cause, it will warm and comfort the part, and hasten the Maturation of the Aposteme, if any be: If it proceeds from a hot Cause, it will open the pores of the parts adjacent, and cause a discussion of the Pain, and thin Matter offending. Or you may apply this: <hi>Talk Pulp of roasted or baked Onions two Ounces; our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> half an Ounce; Powers of Amber forty drops; mix, and apply it:</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="11">XI. In a Deafness, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with vehement Pain, so as the Patient can take no rest, it is good to carry off the Matter with proper Medicines. I commonly give in this case some Doses of my <hi>Family-Pills:</hi> But if the Pain be extream indeed, then two or three Doses of my <hi>Pilulae Mirabiles,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as occasion requires, repeat the Dose five or six times, for they insensibly melt and dissolve the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter causing the Pain, or make it fluid and movable; and then carry it off by stool: But withal Topicks ought to be applied in the mean season, to dispose the Matter in some measure to a Cure; such as this: <hi>Take Mithridate, or our Antidote, one Ounce; Balsam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur half a Dram; mix, and apply it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="12">XII. If the Ear once runs, you must promote the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, which may be done with Externals, after this manner: <hi>Take of our Antidote one Ounce; Balsam de Chili two Drams; Balsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum</hi>
                        <pb n="97" facs="tcp:65913:67"/>
                        <hi>Arthriticum one Dram; mix, and apply it.</hi> You may also inject this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, which very much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes the Hearing: <hi>Take Venice Turpentine half an Ounce; Yelk of one Egg; grind them together in a Brass Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar very well; then add new Canary eight Ounces; Spirit of Wine two Ounces; mix for an injection.</hi> In the mean sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son let the sick be well pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with our <hi>Vinum Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum,</hi> at least five or six times; I have found it to be a Specifick in this case, and does that which an hundred seeming greater Medicines will not touch or come near.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. I remember I had once a Patient, who had a Deafness, accompanied with so vehement Pain, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Remedies, whether inwards, or Topicks would do no good; and all Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuations by internal means, rather augmented the Pain; I was at length forced to give a Dose of my <hi>Volatile Laudanum;</hi> the sick began with three Grains, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, it gradually 'till it came to seven Grains: This brought upon the Patient a large <hi>Diaphoresis,</hi> upon which they had some ease in a day or two's time, and in five or six days perfect ease; but the Deafness seemed to be greater: The Ear was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with Spirit of Wine twice a day; and in about a Weeks time after the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over the <hi>Opiate,</hi> the Hearing perfectly returned, which had been in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner lost for seven or eight Months before. After all, I purged the Patient with two or three Doses of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Pills.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. I had a Patient, a Woman about fifty years of Age, who had been very deaf for above a year, and at times very much afflicted with Pains in her Ears: I cured her in about six Weeks time, by continually droping into her Ears, four or five times a day, our <hi>Guttae Vitae;</hi> and sometimes likewise gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her about fifty or sixty drops of it inwardly, in a Glass of Wine, at night go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed.</p>

XV. If an Inflammation be present, it may be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by putting into the Ear Vinegar, mixt or ground with Oil: And though Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar alone would put the Part (especially nervous Parts) to pain, by its Acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, yet mixt or ground with Oil, and in a small quantity, it becomes harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, and eases the Pain, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the heat and fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the bilious Humor.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. An ancient Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, having a noise and ringing in her Ears, and sometimes a little pain, was cured by dropping into them once or twice a day, our <hi>Aqua Bezoartica,</hi> and stopping them with Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton dipt in the same; it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipated the flatulent Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offending, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the weakned Nerves.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. Where Deafness is joined with vehement pain, and no Internals nor Topicks have yet been able to do good, there is a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to apply Visicatories; for by this means a great quantity of the acid Humor, causing the Pain, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating the approximate Juices, inducing the Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will be taken in a great measure away; and that is done many times with one Blister, which forty Purges and Vomits would not so well accomplish; the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of which, (having often tried this means,) I could not but commend to the Consideration of Artists.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. Whatever Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines you put into the Ear, be sure they be warm, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less some great occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the contrary,) but not very hot; because the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temperature of the Ear is cold and dry: And be sure you put no new Medicine in, 'till they are cleansed from the filth of the former: The Sick ought to lie on the contrary side; and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicament put in, ought not to exceed four or five drops at a time. The less unctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the Medicament is, so much the better; for when it is gotten into the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of the Ear, it comes not easily out again: Things
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:65913:68"/>
more subtil and spirituous, are much to be preferred in this case, because they do their Work, and then go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in Vapor.</p>
                     <p n="19">XIX. Dropping in Things into the Ears may do, but syringing is much better, provided it be done with a fit Instrument, and a skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Hand: You ought not to syringe violently, but lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely; lest by such a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the <hi>Tympanum</hi> should be broke, which would cause an incurable Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Moreover, you ought to be very careful how you apply Topicks, 'till Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals are premised, though the afflux of the evil Humors be first abated.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. The passage of the Ear being very sensible, you must be careful that you use not sharp Things; yet <hi>Wallaeus</hi> boldly attempted the use of <hi>Unguentum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And <hi>Petrus Johannes Faber</hi> saith, That <hi>Nitre dissolved in strong Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and often dropped into the Ears, quickly cures any ringing or noise in them.</p>
                     <p n="21">XXI. <hi>Galen</hi> advises <hi>Opium</hi> dissolved to be put into the Ear; and <hi>Paulus</hi> dissolves it in Milk for that purpose: But these may be dangerous. If an <hi>Opiate</hi> be required, there is nothing better of that kind, than our <hi>Guttae Vitae,</hi> or <hi>Spiritus Anodynus;</hi> for by reason of the heat of the Spirit, and other Things joined with the <hi>Opium,</hi> the <hi>Optate</hi> can do no hurt; whereas otherwise it might stupifie, and much encrease the Deafness, and may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Instruments of Hearing. However, <hi>Opiates</hi> of any kind must be given, if the Sick be in danger of death by the Pain; because the saving of the Life of a Patient, is much greater than the Hurt, should it be a total and perpetual Deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                     <p n="22">XXII. If 'tis certain there is an Aposteme, Authors say, You may use Juice of Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, 'tis much commended;

but 'tis scarcely safe, because 'tis very hot and corrosive. If the Bone that is covered with the thin Membrane, be comes carious after such Suppuration, you must often drop into the Ear <hi>Spirit of Wine mixt with Honey of Roses. Marcellus</hi> saith, That <hi>Cows Milk two Ounces mixt with Honey one Ounce,</hi> being dropt into the Ear, and the Ear stopt presently with Wool or Cotton will won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully heal the Ulcer, yea, though it were cance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>

                     <p n="25">XXV. A Deafness which had been of many years con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, I cured with <hi>the Powers of Anniseedss</hi> drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them into the Ear; but I purg'd the Patient four times with my <hi>Pilulae Mirabiles;</hi> and <hi>drew several Blisters,</hi> both behind the Ears, and on other Places adjacent thereto.</p>
                     <p n="26">XXVI. A poor Man had lost his Hearing, (as some thought by the Pox) falling into an Empericks hand, he cured him by fluxing him with the following Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine: <hi>Take Turbith Mineral eight Grains; Mithridate one Dram; mix for a Dose.</hi> It raised an effectual Flux, which continued twenty four Days; after which, the Patient heard as well as ever he did in all his life. Some may wonder at the Success, because that some have

wholly lost their Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or had it mightily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved by this kind of Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

                     <p n="1">I. A <hi>Bubo</hi> is a Swelling of the Glandules, whether in the Throat, Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, or Groin; and they proceed either (1.) simply from the afflux of Humours caused by Cold, or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matter; (2.) Or are complicate with Poyson and Venom, as in the Plague or Pestilence, and <hi>French</hi> Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. If it be a <hi>simple Bubo,</hi> and indeed let it arise from what Cause soever, whether <hi>simple</hi> or <hi>complicate,</hi> (if there be any hope of its breaking) you must wholly desist from Purging and Vomiting, for those Operations destroy the End of the <hi>Bubo,</hi> since Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thrustsout the offending Matter by those Emuncto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and the nature of Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and Purging is to draw from the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Centre, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Bubo</hi> is hindred from rising, and coming to its perfection: In all these Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses Natures End in thrusting forth the <hi>Bubo</hi> ought to be promoted, which is best done by a sudorisick means, inwardly given, and strong Attractives and Suppuratives mixed outwardly.</p>

                        <pb n="102" facs="tcp:65913:70"/>
III. In order to this end you may give some few Gr. of our <hi>Laudanum Volatile,</hi> or our <hi>Guttae Vitae;</hi> or if for some particular Reasons <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates</hi> are not to be given, the <hi>Diaphoresis</hi> is to be promoted with <hi>Antimonium Diaphoreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> or <hi>Bezoar Minerale;</hi> or with some more powerful Medicine, as is <hi>Mercurius Sudorificus,</hi> or our <hi>Angelus Mineralis,</hi> or <hi>Angelick Pills;</hi> or you may compound some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing after this manner: Take <hi>of our New</hi> London <hi>Treacle twelve Grains, Bezoar Mineralis sixteen Grains; mix for a Dose.</hi> Or this: Take <hi>of our Antidote one Scruple, Antimonium Diaphoreticum twenty five Grains;</hi> mix for a Dose, giving often one Ounce of our <hi>Aqua Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoartica.</hi> The Patient is to be covered down warm in his naked Bed, and he ought to Sweat, as long as he can well endure it, or 'till Faintness; after which let him cool gradually, or by degrees. Where Opiates are wholly useless, give this: Take <hi>Bezoarticum Minerale one Scruple, Juice of Alkermes enough to mix it into a soft Bolus</hi> for a Dose.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. In the mean Season Topical Remedies are not to be omitted, such as this, <hi>Take Pulp of roasted Onions, Mithridate, Turpentine, soft Soap, soft Hens Dung, of each half an Ounce; Oyl of Amber two Drams, Salt ground fine one Dram; mix for a Cataplasm.</hi> Or this: <hi>Take Pulp of roasted Garlick, Balsam of Sulphur, Turpentine, Yolks of Eggs, Pidgeons Dung,</hi> ana <hi>half an Ounce; Oyl of Anniseeds two Drams; mix for a Cataplasm.</hi> Or this: Take <hi>Pulp of Aron Roots baked, Balsam of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, soft Soap, Pepper in fine Powder, Turpentine,</hi> ana <hi>half an Ounce; soft Soot six Drams, Oyl of Scorpions two Drams; Oyl of Juniper-berries one Dram; mix for a Cataplasm:</hi> These are to be applied, and renewed every twelve hours.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The general Rule is, That if the <hi>Bubo</hi> is not like to be disperst, then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Suppuration; but if it be Venomous, chiefly Pestilential, you ought to use all your endeavours to
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:65913:70"/>
draw it out; for that, if it should revert, and the Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son strike inwards, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient would be almost infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly lost: And in other <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes,</hi> not Venomous, if they be not brought out, it has been observed that after a little time, it happens that a new <hi>Bubo</hi> rises, either in the same, or some other part.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. In a Venereal <hi>Bubo,</hi> where there is no danger of Death, you ought to observe Natures motions; for if she thrusts forth the <hi>Bubo</hi> power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, you ought to promote the Suppuration; but if it comes forth weakly, or looks not as if it would break, 'tis possible it may be carried off another way, more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the Patient.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Moreover, in the <hi>Plague</hi> it self, where some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Buboes</hi> will yield to no Remedies, they must at last be left to Nature, especially if they create the Patient little or no trouble in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor much pain, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger Life. In this case it is not necessary to open those Tumors, for that Nature in some length of time can best digest them, whereas on the contrary, the hazard of an Incurable Ulcer may be run by unseasonable and violent opening of it; but these things ought to be considered with great Judgment and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as the nature of the thing requires; for 'tis the poor Patient that must pay for all, who, if the Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an mistakes, pays no less than his Life.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. I cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess my dissent from the Learned <hi>Sylvius de le Boe,</hi> where he saith, That Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential <hi>Buboes</hi> should, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, be discussed, otherwise be brought to Ripening and Suppuration: We say, on the contrary, that if possible they ought to be maturated or broken, and only left to Nature, or be discussed, when there is not Matter enough to promote the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration. Maturation is much more safe in a Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence than discussion, and indeed in all other cases, it is much better; however, Violence is not to be done,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:65913:71"/>
against the general tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the morbifick Matter.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. The Cure (saith he) is to be performed by the same Medicines, wherewith the Swellings of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>globated Glandules are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cured, and always with respect to the Pestilential Poison, for which cause sake <hi>Treacle, Mithridate,</hi> and such like, which are good for it, ought ever to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to other things: To this purpose Distilled <hi>Oil of Harts-horn, Ox-horns, Rams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horns, and Goats-horns,</hi> and other things which have a Volatile Oily Salt, may be mixt with common Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. It is observed, That <hi>Unguentum Martiatum, mixt with</hi> Venice <hi>Treacle,</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent to discuss or disperse, but that <hi>Diachylum cum Gum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> promotes Suppuration. And unless the violence of the pain be urgent, you ought not to promote Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the <hi>Bubo.</hi> As soon as the <hi>Bubo</hi> is Suppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, the opening must be hastened, either with a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knife, or some breaking Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; but the Pen-knife, or Incision-knife, is to be preferred.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. After the <hi>Bubo</hi> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, apply <hi>Balsamum Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phuris Terebinthinatum, &amp; Anisatum,</hi> with <hi>Unguentum Basilicon,</hi> or our <hi>Balsamum Amicum,</hi> and <hi>Andromachus Treacle;</hi> for by this means the Ulcer will be quickly cleansed, and the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely and happily healed; more especially if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a little <hi>Diapompholigos,</hi> or some such like, to hasten the Cicatrice.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. The aforesaid <hi>Sylvius</hi> disallows of Blistering, (tho' he allows of Cupping and Scarrifying,) from which, he saith, he could never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what good could be expected: On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Skilful <hi>Barbet,</hi> at the first clapt on (upon a Pestilential <hi>Bubo</hi>) a <hi>Vesica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> although the Tumor be of no considerable big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, neglecting Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glasses which he therefore rejected, because they cause much pain, and increase the Fever, draw out the good Humors as well as the bad,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:65913:71"/>
and alter the whole Blood more: Within seven or eight hours, or so long time as is necessary for the Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to rise well, it is cut, and <hi>Emplastrum Magneticum Arsenicale</hi> is applied, whose Virtue certainly is such in this case, that a more noble Medicine is not known, as will appear to any one that shall use it.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. The making of the <hi>Arsenical Magnet</hi> we have taught in our <hi>Pharmacopaeia Londinens. Lib. 4. Cap. 11. Sect.</hi> 54. to which I shall refer you. But the <hi>Magnet Plaster</hi> of <hi>Hartman,</hi> which was that which <hi>Barbet</hi> used, is this following: Take <hi>Gum Serapinum, Galbanum, Ammoniacum,</hi> ana <hi>three Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; dissolve in Vinegar of Squills q. s. express through a Linnen Cloth, and by boyling, thicken them: Then take Wax, best Turpentine,</hi> ana <hi>four Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Pouder of the Arsenical Magnet three Ounces, Oyl of Amber two Ounces; mix the Wax and Turpentine with a gentle heat, remove it from the Fire, and stir it well, to bring it to the consistency of an Ointment, to which add the Gums afore prepared, with the Arsenical Pouder, and Oil of Amber, which mix well by much stirring, then make it up into Rolls, and keep it in Bladders anointed with Oil of Scorpions, for use.</hi> This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers nothing in the number of Ingredients from that of <hi>Angelus Sala's,</hi> save only he adds to the Composition, washed <hi>Earth of Vitriol</hi> one Ounce: That of <hi>Hofman's</hi> is thus made. Take <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniacum, Galbanum, Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penum,</hi> ana <hi>three Ounces, Wax, Turpentine,</hi> ana <hi>two Ounces and a half, Arsenical Magnet one Ounce and a half, Roots of Aron half an Ounce; dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve in distilled Vinegar, boyl, and make an Emplaster.</hi> This latter may be used to Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticks and strong People, but for the more delicate and tender, the former is the better.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Barbet</hi> saith, That he has experienced these good Qualities in the said magnetick Emplaster, that if it be applied to a hard Skin, it produces not the least Eschar, and in the mean
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:65913:72"/>
time draws out the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Humours, so egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, that a <hi>Bubo,</hi> as big as a large Wallnut, is some times taken away in four or five Days times: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this does not always succeed so quickly, a Vesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory is first to he applied, that the Humors may the sooner be evacuated; and because that in robust Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies it will produce no Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char, a Blister ought there to be used, that not only the <hi>Cuticula,</hi> but some part of the Skin also may be corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded first. But in Children, Ladies, and thin Skinn'd People, it will make an Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>char, or raise a Scab of it self, without any Blistering afore-hand: This Scab is the true Seat of the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Poyson, wherefore it is found pretty thick, and the Skin only superficially corroded; which is a thing worthy to be considered, and may possibly be the reason why it is sooner sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated than any other Scabs raised by Art; for in thirty, or thirty six Hours it has fallen off by the help only of a Spatula, without any precedent Scarification. It may be used without any, or with but a very little pain, if to the Anti-pestilential Plaster you add a little <hi>Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licon,</hi> or <hi>Treacle.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. This Ointment fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing excellently promotes the falling off of the Eschar. Take <hi>Honey, Goose-grease, Turpentine, Gum Elemi,</hi> ana <hi>one Ounce; Soot six Drams, Yolks of two Eggs, Mithridate four Drams, Oyl of Scorpions enough to make an Ointment.</hi> If when the Scab is fallen the Tumor be not enough abated, you may raise a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, yea, a third, with the said Magnetical Arsenical Emplaster, and then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as before. Lastly, heal up the Ulcer with <hi>Emplaster de minio,</hi> or some other heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drying Plaster; but make not too much haste to heal it, lest the poisonous Humor, not yet wholly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacuated, should cause either a new Disease, or Death.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. Buboes arising from a Venereal Cause, have the Pocky virulency affecting the Spermatick Vessels,

                     </head>
                     <p n="1">I. THE <hi>Cachexia</hi> is the very same Disease which Physicians call a <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophlegmatia,</hi> and is the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner, or rather the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a <hi>Dropsie,</hi> and called by some a <hi>white Dropsie:</hi> It is a Lazy Disposition and Habit of Body, with Pursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, uneasiness of motion, and sometimes shortness of Breath, with difficulty of Breathing, coldness, soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and smoothness of the Skin, with other concurrent Symptomes arising from Obstructions of the Liver, or Spleen, with the <hi>Mesera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> and other <hi>Viscera.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">II. It can never be said to be incurable, because it is properly but the beginning of another Disease, and seems to be only a cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Juice, shed abroad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole Skin and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Flesh, arising in part from Obstructions, as aforesaid, in part from a <hi>Discrasie,</hi> or weakness of the substance of the Blood, so declining in its Strength, as not to have ability to carry its <hi>Serum</hi> along with it to the Emulgent Arteries, to be evacuated in its ordinary course by Urine.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. It is caused either by too frequent and long giving of <hi>Hydragogues,</hi> which by vehement drawing away of the watry Humour, so mightily weaken the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Blood, that it is left so thick, and its gru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous parts so compact or congelated, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generated <hi>Serum</hi> cannot easily mix with it, to make it of one Substance or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency, whereby in its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage through the Veins and Arteries, lying in a separate state from the other parts of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:65913:74"/>
the Blood, it soaks (as it were) through the Vessels, and makes the habit of the Body cold and watry: Or, from <hi>Obstructions,</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, whereby the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes not only vitiated, but also has time to let its se rous parts pass through the Pores and Plicatures of the Vessels, to the Flesh and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal habit of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. That there is no <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thory</hi> in a <hi>Cachexia</hi> is certain; and nothing is more certain than that there is a <hi>Cacochy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> and therefore care must be taken not only to open the present Obstructions, but also to depurate the Blood, and alter the habit of its Substance: If it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from taking too great a quantity of <hi>Hydragogues,</hi> you must give Strengthners, which are partly <hi>Sudorifick,</hi> that as well as to make the Blood stronger, they may so open the Pores of the Body, as to cause a trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of the superfluous Humidities which infest the Flesh and Skin through them; for which purpose this following mixture is of good use: Take <hi>of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote, Bezoar Minerale,</hi> ana <hi>fifteen Grains; mix and make a Bolus,</hi> to be given at Night going to Bed, and let the Sick sweat gently upon it. This ought to be given every day, or every other day, for four or five times, in which space I have never known it fail to cure.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. In the other case, the chief business is to open the appendent <hi>Obstructions,</hi> and remove the <hi>Discrasie</hi> of the Blood. Many prescribe Blood-letting in this, but in my Opinion, that must be very pernicious, because it still diminishes the Strength of the Sick, which is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too much weakned, and exhausts the Spirits now wasted and flagging. In this case bitter Herbs by many are prescribed, and the <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Decoction</hi> has been found of good use. <hi>Half a Pint of the Juice of Centory</hi> given Morning and Evening for a Week together, has cured to a wonder.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. But because the squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Stomachs of several,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:65913:75"/>
cannot be prevailed with to take such bitter and nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Doses; and because in others the Obstructions are so obdurate, that none of those ordinary, Remedies, nor yet any thing prepared from Vegetables will do any good, we must have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Things that are more powerful, and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature, which shall have power to pierce to the most inward recesses of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Of this kind are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters; but such espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as proceed from an Iron Mine, of which the Sick ought to drink liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for some Weeks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those Waters being repleat with a <hi>ferrous Vitriol,</hi> both powerfully open, and also sweeten, which is one of the chief Intentions of Cure.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. Now because many can neither spare time to go to the Wells, or by living remote, cannot well compass to get thither, we shall here prescribe other Remedies, which no Place can fail of affording: <hi>Take Filings of Iron, white Tartar in Pouder</hi> ana; <hi>make them into a Mass with Water, which put into an earthen glased Vessel, or wooden Bowl; put it in a warm place till it is dry: Powder it again, and moisten with Water, and and dry again, repeating this five or six times.</hi> This <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Iron, may be made up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pills with a little Diacassia:</hi> Or, if the Sick cannot take Pills, you may make a Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of it with White-Wine, by digesting the White-Wine upon it for five or six Weeks. And although pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly a Tincture may be made in much lesser time, yet the longer the White-Wine stands upon the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (were it a year, or more,) the better it is: <hi>Take of the Rust aforesaid, eight Ounces; White-Wine two Quarts; digest five or six Weeks, as aforesaid; then decant the Tincture, and upon the</hi> Faeces <hi>put more Wine, repeating this Work so long, till no more Tincture will arise:</hi> Dose from a spoonful, to three or four. This Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture you may if you please boil into a Syrup with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. If you be in the Country where <hi>Tartar</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:65913:75"/>
be gotten: it may do, if you only take Scales of Iron from the Smith's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and put into White-Wine: The Wine alone will in time, being in a warm digestion, extract a most admirable Tincture for the purpose aforesaid; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neither in appearance nor effects will it be much infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the former: <hi>Take Scales of Iron four Pound; White-Wine a Gallon; mix, digest warm, for two or three Months, or more, shaking the Glass once a day; and keep it for use upon the faeces:</hi> Dose from one spoonful to three or four, in the Morning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting. Now here is to be noted, that the Sick ought to lie in their warm Bed, two or three hours after ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it; or if up, to walk up and down, or use some stirring Exercise, for two or three hours following.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. If the <hi>Cachexy</hi> be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with vehement pain, in any particular Part or Limb, bleeding with Lee ches is of admirable use; I remember (once more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially) I had a cachectick Person in cure, who had so vehement Pain in his Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he could not lift his Hand to his Head: I set a dozen Leeches to his Shoulder, and he was cured of his Pain at once: This method I have pursued se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times with good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. And sometimes where Leeches could not be gotten, I have profitably applied Vesicatories, which have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly answered expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: Yet this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That though they often are, and may freely enough be applied to the Legs, yet it is something dangerous to do it in a Dro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>psie, lest they should bring an afflux of Humors upon the Part, so great, as to cause a Gangrene; which yet a prudent Physician, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving this Caution, may easily avoid.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. In a <hi>Cachexia</hi> in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where there is a great Obstruction of the Terms, you ought not to provoke them, 'till you have opened Obstructions of other Parts cleared the passages, and prepared the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:65913:76"/>
For Nature dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges not the Blood by the Veins of the Womb, 'till the Crudities be in a great measure consumed, and the Blood has recovered its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heat, Life, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor: And Crudities being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the Body restored, what natural Evacuations were suppressed, will return of their own accord.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. I once had a cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical Patient, who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had the Pox, but had been well of that Disease some years; but fearing there should be yet some Relicks of it, desired I should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Cure, as if it had been the Pox; nor could I prevail with the Man to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any other Cure: At length I fumed him with the following Troches: <hi>Take artificial Cinnabar six Drams; Myrrh, Amber, Mastick, Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banum, Cloves, Nutmegs,</hi> ana <hi>half an Ounce, Mercurius Dulcis two Drams, with Spirit of Wine; make thirty two Troches, for eight Fumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations.</hi> I fumed him three or four times, and took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all his swelling, without any sensible fluxing; and he became perfectly well. But one thing which was very remarkable in this Cure, was, That an old Pain of the Spleen, which he had been troubled withal for twenty two or twenty three years, was totally and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly removed, and much of the Disease went away by Urine.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. A confirm'd <hi>Cachexy</hi> is without danger, and may be cured in short time by Sudorificks only; the Cause principally proceeding from a Debility of the Blood and noble Parts, charged either with too great Acidities, or an aqueous Matter, which is sent into the Habit of the Body: For this purpose, a Tincture of the opening <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or the <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> it self is profitably given; and <hi>Grulingius</hi> saith, for this purpose it excels all other Remedies, because it strengthens so powerfully: For internal Sudorificks, (which may also absorb the Acid) we commend <hi>Bezoar</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:65913:76"/>
                        <hi>Mineral, from six to sixteen Gr. our Angelus Mineralis from six to twelve Grains; Pilulae Angelicae from one to two Scruples; or a Decoction of Guaiacum,</hi> after the usual manner, the Patient being in a Stove or Bed.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Barbet</hi> saith, that the watery Matter is first gathered in the Face and Limbs; and if the tumid Parts be prest with your Finger, that they are not so full as in a true Dropsie; and that the cause of it is from the lymphatick Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels being compressed, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, or some other way obstructed, whereby the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Motion of the <hi>Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> is himdred, and so thrust into the fleshy and skinny Parts. But all this we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not concede unto; nor do we believe that ever the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture of the lymphatick Vessels were, or can be the Cause thereof, but this pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may be sometimes a Cause, the two great thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Lympha,</hi> and the weakness or laxness of the Vessels containing it, whereby it has an emission through their Pores, and Plicatures into the fleshy Substance of the Body.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. If the Sick be of a <hi>cholerick habit</hi> of Body, if they sweat, (in a Stove, Chair, or Bagnio,) it ought to be with a gentle heat: If they be <hi>melancholly,</hi> the heat must be greater; but if <hi>phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> the heat must be most intense, that the Humors may be melted, and the preternatural Gelly dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; without which, it can never pass away by sweat: And this is of use chiefly in Virgins, where the Disease proceeds from Grief, drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cold Water, eating un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Fruit, or other hetro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene Things: But in hot Constitutions, and such as have been used to eat and drink hot Things, (whereby the Liver is made exceeding hot and dry, and much Choler abounds in the first and second Region, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Veins of the Liver, Spleen, and Mesentery, and in the greater Veins and Arteries,) Baths are much more proper than Stoves, and such-like, because they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:65913:77"/>
moisten; whereas a dry sweat irritates the Atribi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious Humor.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. Being come out of the Bath, you may anoint the Belly, Feet, Legs, and other swoln Parts, with the following Unguent: <hi>Take tops of Elder, Dwarf-Elder, Doves-foot, musked Cranes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bill, Mustard, Rocket, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil,</hi> ana <hi>two Ounces; Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oil one Pound; boil well, strain out by pressing; then add di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled Oils of Amber, Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeds, and Juniper,</hi> ana <hi>three Drams; mix them,</hi> to anoint withal, and inwardly give a Dram or two, or more, of our <hi>Aqua Bezoartica,</hi> or good <hi>Cinamon-Water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Catharticks</hi> are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by most to be of evil consequence, being gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to <hi>cachectick</hi> Persons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they hurt the Liver, and weaken the Ferment of the <hi>Viscera:</hi> This is true, it they be often or long given, as we noted at <hi>Sect.</hi> 3. above, for they destroy the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, the <hi>

                     <p n="1">1. AS this is a Disease with which many are afflicted, so it is of as hard and difficult Cure, for which variety of Medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are instituted. The cause of which is this: That those things which do some good and cure them to boot, yet do others no good at all, and sometimes make them worse; for which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sake, we shall make it it our Business here to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine variety of Authors, and hear what they all say.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. It is a Disease like the Colick; but it is distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed from it, because in the Stone, the pain continues <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> in one place; and in the beginning the Urine is clear, but afterwards of a troubled Substance, bringing forth with it at length Gravel, Stones, and such-like; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the Colick the Pain is different, or in different Parts, afflicting for the most part the Colon; and in the beginning the Urine is of a troubled Substance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards more clear.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. How Gravel (which is the Progenerator of the Stone) is bred, there is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Opinions: <hi>Spigelius,</hi> by his Discourse, seems to believe it to be bred in the Veins; for he saith, That he has found the Blood in the Veins full of small Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and if so, it is natural for it to descend with the Substance of the Blood, into the emulgent Arteries, and from thence with the <hi>Serum</hi> to the Reins and Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. But by what Artifice Gravel is generated, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:65913:78"/>
Question: II care not greatly if I relate to you a singular Observation which I made whilst I was in the West-Indies. In those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, for clearing of Ground, the People commonly lay all the Wood on heaps, and burn it: I did the like of Wood growing upon a very sandy piece of Land, the Substance of the Earth (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its upper Crust) being a pure white Sand. I had very white and soft Ashes, not inferiour in softness to our finest Wheat-flour, or white Starch, in which not the least appearance of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or Sand could be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by any means. Of these Ashes I had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to make a <hi>Lixivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> sometimes for Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition sake by boiling. The <hi>Lixivum</hi> being decanted, and the Ashes cast away, I had the curiosity to view, and by an exact scrutiny, found them to be nothing but pure white Sand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of the small and soft particles of Ashes, which before the elixiviating of them, made them feel like pure, fine, and soft Wheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flour. This I did, 'tis pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, an hundred times, and always produced the same Sand: From whence I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced these things: 1. That those Trees, (which in those Countries are mostly of a mighty bigness, chiefly Pine, Oaks, Hickeries, and such<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, (Herbs, Plants, and the like,) growing upon such sandy ground, have all their Nourishment and Substance from that Sand, whether white, red, yellow, or of what Colour soever. 2. That by the plastick Virtue of the Plant, the Substance of the said Sand is dissolved and fitted for the Norishment of the same Plant. 3. That the said Sand is dissolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a moist Humor, and it may be resinous or glutinous, or aqucous, consonant to the Nature of the same Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; the same kind of Sand which produces an <hi>Oak,</hi> makes also a <hi>Pine, Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, Ash,</hi> or other Plant, growing upon the same: For if they were not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated or produced of Sand, (the Earth being scarcely any thing else, ten or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:65913:79"/>
Foot deep, in those Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,) Of what other Matter can they be made? 4. That an <hi>Analysis</hi> being made by burning and elixiviation, the whole Substance of the Plant (in a manner) resumes its <hi>prima Materia,</hi> or first Matter again, converting its Body into Sand, and not into any other Principle. 5. That the Extremity and Violence of the Fire, has not power to destroy the <hi>Idea</hi> of the prime Cause; but it still retains the same through all Vicissitudes and Changes, even of the strongest Fire it self.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. I. made also another Observation, of the same kind of Trees, Herbs, and Plants, growing upon the same kind of Land, from their rotting: Great Pine-Trees, four or five Foot in Diametre, and others, being rotted upon the Ground, although the rotten Wood at first become only light and chaffie, then a Slime and Mud; yet that Slime or Mud, and Rottenness, gra dually converted from that brown, dark, or black Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and soft, clammy, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillaginous and rotten Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, into a pure white Sand, no ways unlike to the first Substance, or that of which they were primarily generated; all which things might clearly be discerned in many of them, according to the differing Degrees and Times of Rotting or Putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, as Nature had been several Years in performing that Work and Operation: Those which were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of white Sand, reverted into white Sand again; those of red Sand, into red Sand, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Out of what has been said, it clearly appears, that Things by resolution natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally return into the Matter of which they were first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated; so that according to the Food, and the Place or Matter that Food was generated from, being again resolved in Man's Body, is the Production of Juices, Humors, Blood, Flesh, and other Substances of the same. So true and faithful is the Work of GOD in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse, that as He cannot
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:65913:79"/>
deny Himself, so neither can the Things He causes to be produced, lose their first <hi>Ideas</hi> and <hi>Potentialities,</hi> though they never so often change their <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances,</hi> but will after a long race or course of Vicis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situdes and Alterations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their first Matter again.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. And thus the first Cause of the Stone is to be sought into farther, than the Parts in which it is genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or the natural Spirits possessing the same; though I do not deny what <hi>Rive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> says upon the point, but that there may be a petrifactive Spirit, which may be assisting in that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: Both which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, may be the Reason that some People may be troubled with this Disease, and some not.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Gravel subsiding does not nocessarily indicate the Stone, but sometimes the material Cause only thereof, (for multitudes of People that are perpetually free from the Stone, do many times make much Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,) yet possibly it may si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie a Disposition to that Disease: For if Gravel, which used constantly to come away, is afterwards suppressed, and Pain is felt, the Urine being clear and thin, there is great danger that the Gravel may concrete into a Stone; and when it is made again with Pain and Stranguary, it is a sign there is a Stone generated.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. Gravel which is bred in the Veins, comes away with the Urine, and is mixt with the Sediment; but what is bred in the Kidneys, Ureters, and Bladder, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently resides, as the Urine is made: Authors say, it proceeds from adustion of the Humors; bred in the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Veins,</hi> and sticks to the sides of the Pot, nor does it sink to the bottom, as that which comes from the <hi>Reins;</hi> it also breaks by rubbing with ones Fingers, and appears of a more <hi>saline Substance,</hi> whereas the other neither yields to the Fingers, nor can it easily be dissolved. This Gravel of a <hi>saline Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65913:80"/>
is dissolved in warm Urine, and appears not whilst it is yet hot, but the Urine being cold, it coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and sticks to the sides of the Chamber-pot, or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinal, not much unlike <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar</hi> in a Cask of <hi>Wine,</hi> or which is dissolved in hot Water; which cooling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, sticks to the sides of a Vessel; so that the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this Gravel and Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, seem to be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. And this possibly may in a great measure proceed from the same Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> from drinking <hi>Wine,</hi> especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>new Wine,</hi> not sufficiently enough freed from its <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> the which is evident in all those Countries which abound with, and drink much <hi>Wine,</hi> in which the <hi>Stone</hi> and <hi>Gout,</hi> from those <hi>tartarous Concretions,</hi> are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry familiar and common.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. Now why <hi>Wine</hi> should (by much drinking of it) cause those Diseases, is apparent from its <hi>tartarous</hi> or <hi>petrefactive</hi> quality; and why <hi>Wine</hi> should breed or have such plenty of <hi>Tartar,</hi> is also as clear from the Principle before-named, at <hi>Sect.</hi> 6. deduced from the two foregoing Observations at <hi>Sect.</hi> 4, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. for that Vines generally delight and grow in <hi>sandy Ground,</hi> and upon the <hi>sandy sides</hi> of Hills, and in many places upon <hi>meer Rocks</hi> themselves, out of whose sole Substance, not only the Body of the Wine, but also its Leaves and Fruit, are wholly made, and by the plastick Virtue of the Plant formed; so that it is no wonder, for a Liquor formed out of the Substance of a Rock, or out of Stones and Gravel, being resolved, to revert into its first Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples again, and where it can reside, or dwell, and have a home, to breed that Matter of which it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. And this your great <hi>Claret-Drinkers,</hi> sufficiently afflicted with <hi>Gout,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> and sometimes <hi>with both,</hi> can, by sad Experience, tell; for that <hi>Red,</hi> or <hi>Claret Wine</hi> abounds with <hi>Tartar,</hi> much more than other <hi>Wine</hi> does, as the very Vessels contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it sufficiently witness.</p>
                     <p n="12">
                        <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65913:80"/>
XII. You ought to avoid purging in the height of the <hi>Paroxysm,</hi> or till the pain is somewhat asswaged; for even a strong Cathartick, being given whilst the Pain is violent, will many times not purge at all; because the Parts only mindful of the Pain, feel not the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartick force at all; or at leastwise they so contract themselves, as not anywise to assist the Medicine.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. In remedies for the Stone we are to consider, 1. What Things give ease and relief in the <hi>Paroxysm.</hi> 2. What Things open the Passages, so as to make way for the Water. 3. What Things cleanse the Parts of Sand and Gravel. 4. What Things naturally or by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident dissolve sandy and stony Concretions. 5. What kinds of Purges are most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in this case.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV: The first of these is done by Opiates, and Things a-kin to them; but their Matter and Composition, and way and manner of Exhibition, remains to be enquired into. They are given in Liquids, or in a more solid Body: As also either by the Mouth, or by the Fundament, or by the Urinary passage.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. The Matter of which they are made, is <hi>Opium,</hi> or Things of like Nature with it, as <hi>Purslane, Lettise, Night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shade, Stramonium,</hi> &amp;c. As for Preparations made of <hi>Opium,</hi> there are scarcely any better than what we have invented; such as are, 1. Our <hi>Guttae Vitae,</hi> which may be given from twenty Drops to one hundred; and in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to two hundred, or a full spoonful. 2. Our <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus Anodynus</hi> in like Dose and manner. 3. Our <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus</hi> from one Scruple to two Drams, or more. 4. Our <hi>Theriaca Londinensis</hi> from half a Scruple to two Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; and in extremity of Torture to one Dram. 5. Our <hi>Volatile Laudanum</hi> from two Grains to six or eight, or to ten or twelve, or more, if gradually given, and inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. I remember once
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:65913:81"/>
I knew a Gentlewoman, which had lain about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days in extream Torture, and continually crying out for Death, making in all that time little or no Water: She sent for a Dram of <hi>Crude Opium,</hi> resolving upon a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ease: She had it, and took it unknown to any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her; She fell into a Sleep for about twenty four Hours, then waked in ease, and freely and plentifully made Water; nor was she ever after troubled with any more <hi>Paroxysms.</hi> Though this succeeded well, yet such bold attempts are not practicable; I here only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded this matter of Fact, for the Gentlemen of our Art to contemplate the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the thing, and to consider how far a man may warrantably goe in extremity, or where the case seems desperate.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. We have also other preparations of <hi>Opium,</hi> which we have found extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effecting, as 1. Our <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctura Opii Sulphurata.</hi> 2. Our <hi>Elixir Opiatum.</hi> 3. And our <hi>Eaudanum Volatile cum Aloe.</hi> The first of these we often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give to those who na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally disaffect <hi>Opium,</hi> and all other kind of <hi>Opiates;</hi> for by reason of the Acid, the <hi>Opiatick</hi> is so corrected, that it never disaffects the Stomach, nor alters its Tone, as the other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it do. The <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Elixir</hi> is a Stomatick, and of good use where Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is present: And where there is a constipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Bowels, my <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum Volatile,</hi> with Aloes, is of singular use; and the effects are more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, for that the <hi>Aloes,</hi> though joyned with the <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates,</hi> yet seem not to lose any part of their Cathartick force, and in some Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions the Medicine works more, than if the Aloes were given alone.</p>
                     <p n="17">XVII. A Tincture drawn out of the Seeds of <hi>Stramo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> or out of the Leaves carefully dried, gives pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent ease: So the inspissate Juice of the Leaves, given from ten Grains to one Scruple, made up into the form of a Pill or Bolus.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:65913:81"/>
                        <hi>Crato</hi> commends the Juice of Purslane, being inspissated and made into Pills, and given to the quantity of a Dram, he says it does won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>Syrup of the Juice of Lettice</hi> is also of good use, being given to three or four Spoonfuls; it may be thus made. Take <hi>Juice of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice two Pound, white Sugar as much; mix, boyl, clarifie, and make a Syrup; the Syrup being made and cold, add thereto Spirit of Wine a Quart.</hi> It is a thing not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.</p>
                     <p n="18">XVIII. But if the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be tolerable, 'twill be much better to give such things as have an apperitive Virtue and Power, which may gently open or purge, or evacuate; because by emptying, the parts will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more Lax, and so the easier submit to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening Medicine: This I commend as a thing fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar for both Intentions. Take <hi>Juice or Decoction of Speed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well eight Ounces, choice Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na two Ounces; mix for a Dose. It opens and purges gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Asses Milk</hi> is likewise commended for People troubled with the Stone, for that it exceeds all sorts of Milk in serosity and subtilty: If the Sick be Costive, let it be sweetned with <hi>Manna,</hi> for <hi>Manna</hi> has a peculiar property, both of opening the Urinary Passages, and giving ease, whereby the Matter offending is the more fit to be carried off. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have commended <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels Milk,</hi> and not without a shew of Reason, as being good against the Dropsie, because they Feed upon <hi>Spurge, Widdow-wail, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunculus,</hi> and such like strong, fiery, and cathartick Herbs, whereby their Milk acquires a Purgative Faculty, and the <hi>Serum</hi> becomes detersive. But some Authors will have all Milk to breed the Stone, because it is caseous; but this is Error; For why should the solid Substance of Milk breed the Stone more than other solid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances Except there be a real petrifactive property in it, which none ever yet could prove: And truly in this I think <hi>Galen</hi> was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the wrong: I am
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:65913:82"/>
clearly of the contrary O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion; for the curdy part of Milk is only Nutritive, and the greatest part of it dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves in the Stomach into a chylous Juice, (God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Himself seeing it the best and most innocent Nourishment, even for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes as soon as they are Born; And who dares to doubt His Wisdom?) whilst the oily and serous parts of it cool, moisten, open, cleanse, and make slippery the Passages.</p>
                     <p n="20">XIX. Now things are said to open, rather in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their <hi>emollient, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuating, and discussive Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,</hi> than to their <hi>Diuretick,</hi> because there are many things-which powerfully o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Obstructions, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke not Urine at all; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which are most <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Herbs</hi> and Plants, which open by a <hi>Specifick Virtue,</hi> as Centory, Wormwood, Hops, Gentian, Carduus, Camo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil: and <hi>Carminatives,</hi> which do it by a <hi>discussive</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, such are Angelica, Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thernwood, Parsly, Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, Anniseed, Cuminseed, <hi>all the sorts of Pepper, Cloves, Nutmegs, Fennelseeds, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, Carotseeds,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Emollients</hi> which do it by their <hi>softning and making slippery;</hi> such are Oil Olive, Mallows, Marshmallows, Lillies, Spinage, boiled O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Garlick, Leeks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the true, great, and chief of all Openers is <hi>Iron,</hi> and the aperitive Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thereof, which do that in a Day, which none of the others will do in a Month; for which purpose I commend my <hi>Tinctura Martis,</hi> as one of the most famous things in the World; to which may be added <hi>Tinctura ad Chlorosin,</hi> an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved thing for opening the most obdurate Obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                     <p n="20">XX. The Matter being prepared, the next thing is to cleanse the Vessels and Passages of slime, filth, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, sand, or gravel, which does, or may obstruct the Passages of the Urine; and this is properly done with <hi>Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;</hi> of which kind of Medicaments Authors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably abound: We shall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:65913:82"/>
not here tell you all that has been said upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but rather give you an Abstract of the choicest and most approved Experiments of that kind. Take <hi>of our Tinctura Stomachica two Dra. Juice of Garlick one Dram, White or Rhenish-wine, six Ounces; mix for a Draught:</hi> I have often proved it with good success: Or this. <hi>Take Juice of Onions two Ounces, Juice of Hydropiper half an Ounce, White or Rhenish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine eight Ounces; mix for a Draught.</hi> I gave this to one in extremity, a Woman, that had not made Water in eight or nine Days, it made her make Water, and gave her ease in less than an hour. Take <hi>Onions four Ounces, bruise them, Anniseeds, Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> ana <hi>two Drams, bruised. Infuse them all Night in White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine; then squeeze forth the Wine, and let the Sick drink it;</hi> it is a singular Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

But the usual way of using the Stone is to wear it as a Jewel, being tied to the Wrist or Arm, or hung a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Neck or Hip. I once knew a Lady which experimented the truth of this; as long as the Stone was tied to the brawn of her Arm she had ease, and voided much Gravel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually upon making Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but as soon as the Stone was removed, the Gravel stopt, and the pains retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and that she might be sure this was the effect of the Stone, she oftentimes laid it by for experiment sake, and the stoppage and pains in some few Hours would return upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it off; and again, upon the putting it on, she would have as sensible ease, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of passage as before.</p>

XLIII. <hi>Paracelsus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Spirit of Salt, and Spirit of Juniper; as also Spirit and Tincture of Nitre, Salt, and Antimony. <hi>Willis</hi> commends several Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks whose Basis is a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt; and several like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise whose Basis is an alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisate Salt; some also whose Basis is an acid Salt. <hi>Sylvius</hi> says the Stone must either be dissolved, or expelled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dissolved. For dissolving, he proposes <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> giving ten or twelve Drops of it in Decoction of Grass-Root. All Stones (says he) that I have yet found, are dissolved in <hi>acid Spirit of Nitre;</hi> whence I conceive, that none can conclude that the coagulation of Stones can proceed from an acid, but, on the contrary, from something opposite to it. The virtue of generating Stones (says he) lies in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere Things, upon which account they give Glutinosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and toughness to Fluids; to which if (fixt) earthy and volatile saline Parts be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, something not unlike the Stone (he should have said by help of a petrifactive Gass or Spirit) is generated. Now this coagulated Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere, is infringed by the sharp Acid of the <hi>Spirit of Nitre.</hi> And therefore when the Rudiments and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of a Stone are laying, we must, besides volatile oily Salts, use Things that dissolve the Stone, amongst which, we deservedly ascrbe the first place to <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> seeing in it Stones are so easily and so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly dissolved; and it may be given in Beer, Ale, Wine-Broth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to make them a little sharp, and so to be used for some considerable time.</p>
                     <p n="44">XLIV. To this of <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> the learned <hi>Deckers</hi> makes something of answer: The <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> (saith he) being put upon the Stone poudered, and set upon a little Fire dissolves it: First it turns it into a tough, and then into a watery Matter; but the Mischef is, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence in outward and inward means is not the same; or at least the <hi>Spirit of Nitre</hi> does not answer

Expectation. And <hi>Fr. Hof-man</hi> says, you should rather give Things which confist of an abstersive Virtue, from a volatile Alcalie and Acid, that by their gentle sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, do incide and cleanse the filth of the urinary Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, as also by their sweet fragrancy affecting of the Reins, do hinder the faecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Ferment, and so prevent all occasion of the Stone.</p>
                     <p n="45">XLV. <hi>Diureticks</hi> are of two kinds; the one Aperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the other Incisive: Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritive draw the Matter to the Kidnies; and therefore if these be affected, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry suspicious, because we draw the Matter to the part affected: But Incisives carry not the Matter to the Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, but only by Inciding, Subtilize; and so the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being made subtil, passes the Reins. Hence it is (and I ever use it with success) that if in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning I give Spirit of Vitriol to break the Stone, or cut the gross Humor, I quickly see a happy Issue. And the Spirit of Vitriol, though it be Diuretick, yet it only incides; upon which Subti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilation, while the Matter passes out, the Urine appears more copious, and is truly a Diuretick by accident; not that it carries ought to the Reins, but because the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when it has no hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, finds an easie passage. And that is attempted in vain, after the third or fourth day, which may be done the first; without which, the Pain is prolonged three or four Days, to the great damage of the Patient; for then we must stay for uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Evacuation, which in this case is not necessary in the beginning, but may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be done, when the Pain is over. <hi>Panarolus, Pent.

But because every one has not the liberty or conveniency of going to the Wells at <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> or other Springs coming off of Iron or vitriolick Mines, we shall here shew a Way of making those Waters artificially, to perform the same Intention, which is thus done: 1. <hi>Take fair Spring-water six Quarts; Salt, Vitriol, or Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals of Mars one Dram; mix, dissolve and filter through brown Paper, so have you a Water in Virtue and Effects, like that which runs off from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Iron-Mines.</hi> 2.

                     <p n="55">LV. Experience has for a long time taught us, that strong Diureticks must be used with much caution, for that they many times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Pain, force the Stone into narrow Passages, excoriate the urinary Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and many times cause pissing of Blood, which cause often times Faintings, Swoonings, Convulsions, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilepsies, and the like. In

this case Lenient, or Emolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Clysters are of singular use; for by their discussive property, they melt or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Humors, clear the urinary Passages, making way for Urine and Gravel. A certain Physician had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of this in his own Person, who being in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Torment, had ease by taking three Emollient Clysters in one day, the Gravel being loosned, and the thick viscous Matter joyned with it, being brought away with the Urine for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days together, that thence-forth he never fell again into any such pain.</p>

Out of the Fit (saith the same excellent Man) we must endeavour to extirpate the Coagulator, and withal, we must always have regard to the Stomach, therefore Stomatick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines will be good: some say there is nothing better, either for the cure or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the Stone than this following Antinephri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick:

Some Physicians commend a Vomit, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to expel the tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Matter before it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived either to the Reins or Bladder; some give it in the Fit, because Nature seems to shew the way by their reaching to Vomit. This I found true by Experience, in a certain Lady, a Patient of mine, who had lain Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid fifteen or sixteen Weeks of this Disease; and though many things were admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred, nothing did good 'till I gave her a Vomit, which was <hi>Salt of Vitriol</hi> one Dram, which gave her six Vomits; and this I repeated for five days together, it made a great revulsion, and had so wonderful an effect, that in fourteen or twenty Days she was restored to her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Health; and though through the extremity of the pain she had Convulsion Fits, and many returns of them in a day; (so that she was given over for dead,) yet after the first Emetick Dose those Fits ceased, and her Pains wonderfully dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; the force of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick being over, I then administred <hi>Antinephriticks</hi> and <hi>Stomaticks,</hi> such as <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Juniper, Salt of Amber, Ens Veneris,</hi> my Tinctura Stomachica, Syrup of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, with some other things of like nature.

                     <p n="1">I. BEfore we come abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, it is necessary to discuss the Point, VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der can be broken by Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, or not? That it may be broken many Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians do affirm, and bring in proof thereof their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences: The reason they render for it is, That Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines may do it, acting by their tenuity, acidity, aspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and their diuretick force: Or, that there is a <hi>dissolving Salt,</hi> as well as a <hi>coagulating One,</hi> which Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues are not to be denied to Herbs, Plants, Metals, Stones, and minerals. <hi>AEtius, Lib.</hi> 2. tells us how <hi>Philagarius</hi> cured the Stone in the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with <hi>Goats-blood</hi> and a <hi>Hedge-Sparrow</hi> mixt together. <hi>Laurembergius</hi> cured one of a great Stone by the use of <hi>Millepedes.</hi> A Jesuite at <hi>Rome</hi> cured a Printer's Son of the Stone with <hi>Millepedes</hi> rightly prepared. <hi>Turrianus</hi> in <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro, Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Pag.</hi> 262: saith, He broke a Stone, which was design'd to be cut, by giving a little Pouder of <hi>Crystial</hi> to drink, or the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluble substance thereof, <hi>viz</hi> Calcin'd in a Potter's For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace at least nine times, and quenched in Nettle-water, to be reduced to a Calx, then put into a Cellar to melt <hi>per deliquium. Rhasis, Lib.</hi> 9. saith, He cured a Stone in the Bladder of long standing with his Pills. <hi>Horatius Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> and his Father, with some others, cured several
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:65913:96"/>
with the same Medicine. <hi>Johannes Prevotius</hi> saith, the Stone in the Bladder is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a Plaster of white Onions boiled, and applied to the bottom of the Belly. <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Avicenna, Dioscorides,</hi> and others are of the same Opinion. And <hi>the Author of this Work</hi> knew one who was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be cut of the Stone, by taking Diureticks, was perfectly cured, of which <hi>Horse Raddish</hi> was chief, was perfectly cured; so that for more than twenty five years since, he has not been trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with it. And it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that a thousand more of these Examples may be urged.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. To all these Things we answer, 1. That all these Examples, and thousands more of the like, can be no Rule to conclude the thing; because all the same Things have been used with all care and circumspection to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where the success has not been answerable. 2. That it is probable that the Stones dissolv'd by the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Medicaments, and such other like, might be only sandy, gritty Concretions, friable, and easily broken; whereas we say, had the Stone been great, and hard like a Flint, the Event would not have succeeded. 3. We can bring also the Opinion &amp; Experience of many great Physicians to the contrary: <hi>Hartman</hi> is of Opinion the Stone in the Bladder, if it be confirmed, and already come to some magnitude, is scarcely cured by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way than by cutting. <hi>Barbet</hi> saith a crumbling Stone is seldom, a hard Stone can never be wasted away, or cured by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. <hi>Guarinonius</hi> saith, that scarce ever any one saw the Stone broken by Medicines. I could name multitudes of others of this Opinion; but these may suffice. And truly daily Experience, to our Grief, and the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of miserable Patients, are as demonstrable and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refutable Arguments of the Impossibility of Cure by Medicines without cutting: Though <hi>Wincleras, in Misc. curios. An.</hi> 76. <hi>Obser.</hi> 102. saith, he broke the Stone in the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:65913:96"/>
Bladder of a Boy 12 old, and brought it away peace-meal by this Medicine: <hi>Take pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Violet=Seed half an Ounce; Waters of Strawberries, Rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barrow, Winter=Cherries,</hi> ana q. s. <hi>make an Emulsion, to which add Goats Blood two pound; Hog=Lice prepared one Dram; Species Lithontriptice half a Dram; Spirit of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine one Scruple; mix them:</hi> Dose two spoonfulfs often given, which made it come away in pieces: Probably this might be such a soft crumbling Stone as <hi>Barbet</hi> speaks of. I have made trial two or three several times, and the Experiment succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not; possibly the Stones might be of a flinty Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and therefore the Experiment not to be despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The last I tried it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without success, was cut of the Stone; which being extracted, weighed three Ounces, and some odd Grains, and was of a hard and marble=like substance.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. Moreover, when it is to be considered, that the distance of Place is far, and the ways by which the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines pass many: and that if they <hi>be strong,</hi> they carry large quantities of Matter from the whole Body to the Bladder, and do more hurt by their acrimony and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, in scowring off the <hi>Lenter, Mucus,</hi> or <hi>slimy Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which usually sticks to the Stone, and serves it for a Bed; whereby the Stone is made sharper and harder, and thereby raises more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense pains than before: But if they <hi>be weak,</hi> they lose their Virtue before they come at the urinary Passages and Bladder, whereby they do little or no good at all. I say, all these things being conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they still confirm me in my Opinion, That if a Stone be large, and of a flin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Marble-like hardness, or substance, there is no Cure for the same by Medicines, but by the Hand only of the Operator.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. Sometimes also we are deceived, and think there is a Stone, when indeed there is none; as is recorded concerning a <hi>Noble-Man,</hi> who after he had been tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:65913:97"/>
with pain and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in making Water, the <hi>Physicians</hi> and <hi>Chyrurgions</hi> doubted whether there was a Stone, or no; having used Medicines to no purpose, he was cut for the Stone, as is usual, and was eased of his pain; yet they found no Stone, but a <hi>fungous</hi> Flesh in the <hi>neck</hi> of the <hi>Bladder,</hi> which by degrees was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by convenient Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. A like Example to this, I can relate of a Patient of mine, <hi>viz.</hi> Mr. S — not long since one of the <hi>Shreiffs</hi> of the City of <hi>London;</hi> who having been for some Months troubled with Pain and Obstruction of Urine, with most other symptoms of the Stone, it was belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not only by my self, but by some others, to be the <hi>Stone:</hi> He also for a long time pissed Blood, and made bloody Urine, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I helpt him of, though it often returned again. He was a strong, lusty, and well-look'd Man, and for all that could be seen, might have lived many years. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his Country-House, at <hi>T</hi> —, he was afresh taken ill, (as himself, and we all thought, with the <hi>Stone:</hi>) He immediately came home for <hi>London,</hi> and sent for me as soon as ever I came into his Company, I saw Death in his face; he took me by the hand, held me, engaged my Company for that day, or 'till night; and withal (as one sensible his End was near) told me, he knew he had not long to be here, and therefore pray'd me to stay with him as long as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: I could not deny the Request of so worthy and good a Man; however, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter four or five hours stay with him, he dismist me; and prayed me. I would come to him the next day, and sit with him; which I did five or six hours: He pray'd me I would not leave him, for that it was the last trouble he should put me to; yet being late, dismist me again of his own accord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging my Company again. Going to see him the next day, he was insensible, and knew me not, lying, as we supposed by his great groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in dreadful pain, and under the Agony of Death;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:65913:97"/>
by the force of which Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xysm, he surrendred his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Breath. He was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately opened by — An excellent Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgion of this City, nothing was found amiss in his whole Body, save the Lungs on his lest side grew to his Ribs; all the <hi>Viscera</hi> were sound and firm; nor was there any <hi>Stone</hi> in either <hi>Reins</hi> or <hi>Bladder:</hi> At last opening the <hi>Bladder,</hi> we found a <hi>Fungus</hi> or <hi>Polypus</hi> of Flesh, growing to the bottom of the <hi>Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> and hanging down to the Neck, being as near as I could guess about six In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches long, and an Inch and half Diameter, which gave a total suppression of Urine at time of Death: It was this <hi>Polypus</hi> or <hi>Fungus</hi> which bled, and almost continually made him make bloody U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, by which at length he was something emaciated; and withal, it had begun, or was in part mortified, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Death ensued. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this to shew how easie it is for the best and wisest Men (for there was several skilful; learned, and worthy Persons, in Consultation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Gentleman,) to be deceived; and how easie it is for us (notwithstanding all our Knowledge, Skill, and Experience) to err and be mistaken; and when we think we do for the better, even then, to do for the worse? Though I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude concerning this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, That if we had truly known what his malady had been, it had been absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible for the most skilful Artist, or wisest Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician. to have cured him, or saved his Life.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. Some are against the using of <hi>Lapis Spongiae Lyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, calcin'd Egg-shells,</hi> and such-like, because 'tis thought they may hurt the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parts: But this is not so; for as <hi>Sennertus</hi> urges, their Efficacy does much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon their saline Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits which get into the Stone, and dissolve it into Atoms, just as Metals and Minerals are dissolved in <hi>Aqua-fortis;</hi> and Coral, Pearl, and the like, <hi>in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:</hi> For which Reason, the use of such Medicines are not to be neglected,</p>

                        <pb n="158" facs="tcp:65913:98"/>
VI. Universals having been premised, we must come to the use of Diureticks, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever some Physicians have said to the contrary; and such Things are to be used which may be able to cleanse and open the Reins, but to extend their force to the Bladder also, that so (if the Stone is too big to be avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of its own accord the natural way) it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the neck of the Bladder, and so be either forced out, or taken out by the help of Instruments, and the Hand of a skilful Artist. 'Tis true, that some Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans (as <hi>Avicenna</hi> for one) forbid the use of Diureticks, by reason they take away the <hi>skinny Coat</hi> from off the <hi>Stone,</hi> thereby causing more vehement pain; yet if we respect the Cure, <hi>viz.</hi> of expelling a <hi>Stone</hi> which is but small, (and possibly may come forth of its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, by the help of Diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, through the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural passage,) Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks must be used, and those which are of the strongest kind also; not only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its future growth, but in order to the expelling of it through the <hi>neck</hi> of the Bladder and <hi>Urethra.</hi>

they open Obstructions, and resolve all tartarous Matter, which breeds the Stone and Gravel, but also dissolves a soft and porus Stone if bred, and then brings it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

IX. I have found much good in this following, for bringing away <hi>Sand, Gravel,</hi> or any <hi>mucous Matter</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing the Urine: <hi>Take</hi> Strasburg <hi>Turpentine two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Oleum Petroleum one Ounce; Oleum Anisii, Bacca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Juniperi,</hi> ana <hi>half an Ounce; Millepedes prepared, Earth-worms prepared, pure Salt of Tartar, volatile Sal-Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack</hi> ana <hi>three Drams; mix them:</hi> Dose from six Drops to twelve, or more; in a Glass of Ale, Wine, or Mead. Sometimes I prepared it thus: <hi>Take</hi> Strasburg <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine two Ounces; Oleum Petroleum one Ounce; Oil of Limons, Caraways, sweet Fen nel-seed,</hi> ana <hi>half an Ounce; Crabs Eyes, Goats Blood pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, volatile Sal-Armoniack, volatile Salt of Amber,</hi> ana <hi>three Drams; strong Tincture of Thebian Opium, made with the best rectified Spirit of Wine, an ounce and half; mix them;</hi> Dose from ten Drops, to twenty, thirty, or more, according to age and strength in any proper Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. This is a thing I have often experienced with good success: <hi>Take of our Spiritus Universalis two Pound; brui sed Onions, eight Ounces; Parsley bruised four Ounces; digest twenty four hours, strain out by pressing, then pass it through a Filter;</hi> Dose from half a spoonful, to a spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or more, in a Glass of Ale, Mead, Wine, or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sley, or Arsmart-water. Or thus: <hi>Take common Spirit of Wine a Quart; bruised Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Aniseeds, Parsley roots,</hi> ana <hi>six Ounces; mix, digest three days; strain, filter, and keep it for Use:</hi> Dose three or four spoonsuls in any fit Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle.</p>
                     <p n="11">XI. <hi>Laurenbergius, Riveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others, mightily commend this, as a thing almost infallible: <hi>Take pure Salt of Tartar one Ounce; Parsley-water a Quart; mix, dissolve, and filter it two or three times through brown Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that it may become clear; then put into it the fresh out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Rind of Orange peels, so much as to colour it of a Citron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour,</hi> (viz. <hi>about two Ounces;</hi>)
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:65913:99"/>
                        <hi>after three days, decant the clear, and keep it for Use:</hi> The Dose is a spoonfull, or more, in half a Pint of White or Rhenish-Wine, or Wine in which Mustard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seed, or Horse-Radish-root has been infused.</p>
                     <p n="12">XII. This is commended by some for to expel the Stone in the Bladder: <hi>Take Millepedes prepared, Bedugar, or Sponge of the Briar bush, seeds of purple Violets,</hi> ana <hi>one Ounce; Species Lithontripticae two Drams; mix them, make a Pouder;</hi> Dose two Drams, in ten Ounces of a Diure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Decoction, mixt with two Drams of Spirit of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niper. It was given at five in the Morning for some time; and a little after, a great quantity of reddish Urine came away, with flakes like Scales of Fishes, which was the Coat or Crust loosned from a larger Stone; and by the continual use thereof, the Sick was freed from his Disease.</p>
                     <p n="13">XIII. This has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of: <hi>Take a Hare with young, calcine it to Ashes; these Ashes mix with an equal quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Sugar:</hi> Dose two Drams in any convenient Vehicle, as <hi>Syrupus Nephriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> mixt with a Glass of White or Rhenish-Wine: But <hi>Arnoldus de Villa nova</hi> took a <hi>Hare, and fill'd the Bolly with the skin, Saxafrage, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, Lapis Lyncis, Lapis Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicus, Lapis Spongiae, Cink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foil, and golden Rod, and then calcin'd it;</hi> of which he gave a spoonful in a Glass of Wine every day; it broke (says he) and forced away the Stone in the Reins and Bladder.</p>
                     <p n="14">XIV. I have often given this following Medicine with incredible success: <hi>Take</hi> Strasburg <hi>Turpentine two Oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Hercules noster half an Ounce; Bezoar Minerale, Crabs Eyes, Millepedes prepared,</hi> ana q. s. <hi>mix, and make Pills:</hi> Dose two Drams twice a day, drinking after it the following mixture: <hi>Take Rbenish-Wine eight Ounces; Syrupus Nephriticus an Ounce; Potestates Litbontripticae fifteen Drops, mix for a Draught.</hi> This I have also proved with good Success: <hi>Take Balsam</hi>
                        <pb n="162" facs="tcp:65913:100"/>
of <hi>Peru</hi> half a Dram; Oils of Nard and Mastich, <hi>ana</hi> ten Drops; Oil of Juniper six Drops; Lapis Judaicus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Crabs Eyes fifteen Grains: mix, and give it in White or Rhenish-Wine, or a Decoction of Millet.</p>
                     <p n="15">XV. If by these, or some of the Medicines mentioned in the former Chapter, the Sick receives no benefit, you must come to manual ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; how that is to be performed, whether by the <hi>Apparatus minor</hi> or <hi>major,</hi> we have taught in <hi>our Synopsis Medicinae, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. <hi>Sect.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 8. to which we shall refer you. But there is another way of taking out the Stone, which is thus: <hi>The Artist puts his Finger up the</hi> Anus, <hi>and moves the Stone to the fore-part of the Belly, and then by a hole cut in the</hi> Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus Rectus, <hi>according to the Duct of the Fibres, above the</hi> Os Pubis, <hi>he takes out the Stone by the help of the</hi> Lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillium, <hi>or a pair of Forceps.</hi> The Operation being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this way, a dripping of the Urine need never be feared, and besides, a larger space is allowed to take out the Stone in. However, this Operations is not without its danger, besides the trouble; for if the Lips of the Wound made in the <hi>Bladder,</hi> be not united to the Muscles of the <hi>Abdomen,,</hi> an Exulcera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Bladder</hi> follows; which both makes much pain, and creates an Ulcer more incurable than the Stone it self. <hi>Roussetus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends cutting in the <hi>Groin,</hi> especially for Children; and is approved by <hi>Hildanus,</hi> in larger Stones, which cannot be brought to the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> it being there taken out with less pain and danger of an Hemorrhage. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the <hi>Bladder</hi> is not extraordinary, because it has <hi>fleshy Fibres;</hi> by the help whereof, and the innate heat, the Wound is the more easily cured.</p>
                     <p n="16">XVI. Some inject by a <hi>Catheter</hi> into the <hi>Bladder,</hi> thinking thereby to break the Stone, for that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are not altered in their passage, nor lose any thing of their Virtue, as those do which are given by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:65913:100"/>
the mouth, but reach the Stone immediately. I have injected Opiates with good success for giving ease. If the Liquors be sharp, they ought to be such, that brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Stone, they may not hurt the Bladder; as Waters made of the Ashes of Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions, Parsley-roots, Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holm, Crabs Eyes, Pellitory of the Wall, Pigeons dung, <hi>&amp;c. Baverius</hi> injects <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leum</hi> in which <hi>Lapis Lyncis</hi> has been boiled and strained forth, embrocating at the same time with a Decoction of Mallows. He says it wonderfully breaks the Stone in the Bladder. Or you may inject with this: Take a small Lixivium of Pot-Ashes one Pound; crude Opium two Drams; mix, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest twenty four hours; then strain out the Liquor for use.</p>

                     <p n="1">I.

                        <hi>squeeze</hi> it through <hi>Leather</hi> several times: If you cannot get <hi>Spanish Quicksilver,</hi> take the purest and best you can get, whose Goodness you may try, by evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a little of it away in a silver-spoon; if it flys away, leaving a yellow or white <hi>Spot</hi> at bottom, it will serve; but if it leaves a black or green <hi>Spot,</hi> it is naught for this Work.</p>
                     <p n="3">III.

                           <hi>I. HERMES:</hi> Even <hi>Hermes</hi> himself saith, I have not in a very long Age, ceased to try Experiments, nor have I spared any Labour of mind: But I obtained the knowledge of this Art, by the Inspiration of the Living God only, who esteeming. me his Servant worthy, did reveal and open the Secret to me.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> There are three things which are certainly most necessary to the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of this knowledge. I. An Unwearied Study. 2. A Continued Experience. 3. And the Divine Blessing going along with all. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out these, it is not probable any Man can attain the knowledge of this Secret.
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:65913:110"/>
There must be a diligent Study, and a serious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the Soul, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this thing: Then these things thus meditated on, must, by experience, be brought to ocular demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration; nor, if you miss many times, must you be weary with trying. Lastly, you must all along attend the Blessing of God for his assistance: 'Tis that Eternal Spirit of God which goes through, and pierces all things, which generates, and preserves that which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated: His Spirit of heat decocts, and coagulates that which is thin, rarifies that which is too thick, warms the cold; and raises up to life that which has been dead and buried.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>Hermes.</hi> Who has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to, or bestowed upon rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creatures, the power and faculties of truly judging and determining, not forsaking any, so as to give them an occasion to cease searching after the Truth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> 'Tis true, that <hi>Adam</hi> before the Fall was adorned with the fulness of light and knowledge above all other Creatures, shining like <hi>Sol</hi> among the Stars; but after his Fall, that prime perfection was much eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and he was drove out of the Garden, into a Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness among the Beasts which perish; yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a promise of Restaurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and remission of his Transgression, by one Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sacrifice, through the diffluence and power of whose Spirit, Man is put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a possibility of attaining a measure of the true and perfect knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding even in this life.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Hermes.</hi> For my part, I had never discovered any thing of this matter, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it to any one, had not the fear of the Judgments of God, or the hazard of the Damnation of my Soul for such a Concealment prevailed with me. It is a debt I am willing to pay to the Just; as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Just has liberally bestowed. it upon me.</p>

                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> That is, reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them so as that the Sons of Art might understand them, not to the Profane and Unworthy, and Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers: For the <hi>Oracle of Truth</hi> himself has long since told us, <hi>It is not fit to give the Childrens Bread to Dogs;</hi> though they may eat of the Crumbs which fall from the Masters Table. Some Men the Scriptures of Truth have compared to Dogs, yea, Greedy Dogs, Wolves, Foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to sit at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and feed of the Divine repast; 'Tis a Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which is the Law of God, which deserves the Divine Vengeance for a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: And such indeed is the revealing of forbidden Secrets to such to whom they do not belong. And saith <hi>Raimand Lully, Thou shalt reserve and keep that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, which is proper only to God to reveal, and thou dost justly conceal those things, whose revelation belongs to his Honour; otherwise thou shalt be condemned in the Great day, as a Traytor to the Majesty of God, nor shall thy Treason be forgiven thee.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>Hermes.</hi> Now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, O ye Children of Wisdom, that the knowledge of the four Elements of the Ancient Philosophers, was not Corporally, nor Imprudently sought into: Which are through patience to be attained, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their kind, which through their own operation are hidden or obscured. You can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, except the matter be compounded, because it cannot be perfected, unless first the various Colours are throughly accomplished.</p>

and Wisely. Thus the Principles of Art are said to be four Elements, <hi>Earth, Water, Air, Fire,</hi> as <hi>Hermes</hi> indigitates, but what these are in a Spiritual sense, the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> knows not, which the same <hi>Hermes</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets in another place, the <hi>Soul, Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> and which <hi>Paracelsus</hi> calls <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury.</hi> Others make but two, as the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Patient; Mascu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> and <hi>Feminine; Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury:</hi> Others but one only, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Aqua Philosophica:</hi> There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Names by which this Matter is called, but the Subject, or <hi>Prima mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> is one only: because it is, as it were, the Cardinal hinge upon which all the rest turn, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers explicate to be their <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, the middle, and the end of the Work, and without which, whoever labours, labours in vain; and yet it will do nothing without it be compounded, because it cannot be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without its colours are throughly accomplished: The Body and the Soul; or the Salt and the Sulphur, cannot be united in their most minute parts, without the help of the Spirit which is <hi>Mercury. Luna</hi> and <hi>Sol</hi> cannot procreate without the help of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which extracts the <hi>Semen</hi> from both the Bodies, and in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Earth, as its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Vessel, digests and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it. Therefore <hi>Mercury</hi> does nothing of its self, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept something be added to it by which it may be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified.</p>

                           <hi>V. Harmes.</hi> Know then, that the Division which was made upon the water by the Ancient Philosophers, is that which separates it, or converts it into four other substances; one into two, and three to one; the third part of which is color, or has tincture, to wit, the coagulating humour or moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, but the second and third Waters are the Weights of the Wise.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> This Water to be divided, is the same with the four Elements before spoken of, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Aqua</hi>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> He Essays to explicate the proportions of the Philosophick Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, under various Names; for that which he calls the <hi>Humidity, the Southern Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Anima solis, Seyre Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinum, Auripigment, the Vine of the Philosophers,</hi> and <hi>their Wine,</hi> have no other signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but that the <hi>Aqua Mercurii</hi> should be seven times distilled, which after the eighth Distillation, the <hi>Compositum,</hi> by the force of the fire, is converted into Ashes, or a most subtil pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which by reason of its purity and perfection resists the fire: neither wonder that eight parts and three ounces are equivalent, for by the former Section, the one part is divided into two, to each of them, there is added three parts, which are the true and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Proportions, called by <hi>Hermes,</hi> the Weights of the Wise.</p>

                           <hi>VII. Hermes.</hi> Understand then the operation.

This is
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:65913:112"/>
then the beginning and the end.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> Here <hi>Hermes</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludicates the Philosophick Work by a most familiar Example of the <hi>Phases</hi> of <hi>Luna;</hi> and so it is, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Process in this Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick Work, exactly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swering to that Parallel in Heaven. Some divide the Operation of the Stone into two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the former and the latter. The former <hi>Hermes</hi> explicates by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Decoction,</hi> which does diminish the matter, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves it, as it were destroys it; but being thus Dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Corrupted, it is through Regeneration (by the Medium of perfection) restored again. This done, then follows the latter part of the Operation, by means of which the Virtue and Power of the Stone is made wonderful, brought to its highest perfection, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied (as it were) <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> In these few words of <hi>Hermes,</hi> are comprehended the whole Work, and in them it is plainly laid open from the beginning to the end. In a word, it is like the Husbandman Sowing his Seed in the Ground, which must first Die, be Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Putrefied, before it can be possest of a new Life, by which it must arise and yeild its Hundred Fold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease: the first Life, the first Birth, the first Body, must Die, and give place to the second.</p>

                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> There are said to be three Species of Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1.

                           <hi>i. e. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity,</hi> or the Ripening and perfecting heat. Now which of these it is, that <hi>Hermes</hi> speaks of is the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The first, and the third differ in this. The first is an external Fiery Heat. The latter an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Natural Heat. In my Opinion both are to be admitted. The Natural Heat Internal, is the Cause of Generation and without that, the External Heat can do nothing: Hence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Heat to be two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. <hi>External</hi> to excite. 2. Internal to perfect, both which ought to be made <hi>in humido:</hi> for all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is naturally made <hi>in Calido Humido,</hi> in a moist Heat, which <hi>Hermes</hi> calls <hi>Ignem Humidum:</hi> as if he should say the Fire is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, which you must use, <hi>viz.</hi> External and Internal. He seems to make his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction double, 1. In the time of Augmentation. 2. In the Ultimate perfection or Maturity, and so long this Fire is to be continued, till the Radix does appear, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Seed of Metals. The same method that Nature takes in Generating Herbs and Plants, she takes in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating Metals, whose Seed is extracted by the help of Art, which Seed is only and truly the Philosophers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, in which all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are resolved into their first principles, and in which is imprest the Character or Power of Transmutation. They all err who think to reduce Metals only into Crude Mercury, and not into their Radix, as <hi>Hermes</hi> speaks, <hi>viz.</hi> into their Seeds, which is the first Matter living in Metals: and from thence Nature ever goes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, never back-ward till

                           <hi>IV. Hermes.</hi> Take (my Son) the Flying Bird, and Dround it Flying; then divide, separate, or cleanse it from its Filth, which keeps it in Death; expel it, and put it away from it, that it may be made Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and answer thee, not by Flying in the Regions above, but truly by forbearing to Flie.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> In this our Art are two Principles which spring from one Root, and which are the subject of our Stone, <hi>viz.</hi> Argent Vive, and Sulphur; of which, the one is Volatile and superior, the other fixt and below, from the Conjunction of which often repeated, is made the true and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical sublimation and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. And that is the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation when the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Tinging Spirit, and takes from it its Volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; this is done by frequent Reiterations, till a Calx of perpetual duration is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and will remain for ever in the Fire: But in the very beginning of this work the substance of the Stone, which in it self is most fixed, by a Spirit not fixed or Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile, as Sea Water, <hi>acetum radicatum,</hi> and such like, is to be made Volatile. And by this means it will be more fit to be cleansed of its Filth,

or Rust, which in metals is a most certain sign of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> That is, the fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body is to be lifted up by sublimation, and to be so often repeated, till the Volatile is made fixed, or fixed with it: But this is not to be done hastily, or all at once, but by little and little, and by degrees. Lest by too great a haste you break the Vessel, or come to some other hurt. God himself, <hi>made all things in Number, Weight, and Measure;</hi> that is, in due and just proportion, as well in respect of <hi>Time</hi> as <hi>Matter.</hi> If you proceed wisely in this Case, you will receive the fulness of your expectations.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> The shadow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways goes along with the Body, walking in the Sun. Now that a clearer Light may appear through the Body, without any shadow, the Body must be opened, made thin, and dissolved; which is the Patient, by the Spirit or Sun-Beams, which are the Agent, the living Fire, by whose Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it is brought to a Calx, and the Corruptible part is Burnt up and destroyed, or made fit to be separated.</p>

                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> That is Our Magnesia, which is sown in our Philosophick Earth, is to be Corrupted or Putrefied; and then to be Digested, Coagulated, Sublimated, Incerated, and Fixed. This Magnesia, or Redness is thus made pure by separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then it becomes Dissolved, Digested, Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, Sublimed, Incera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Fixed, and Ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, being first lift up into the highest Heavens, and then Buried again in the deepest Earth, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it may arise, and in the same have a Habitation, and be fixt for ever. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the Spirit; the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the Soul or Tincture; and the Earth is the Body. Now the Spirit is the Life of the Soul, as the Body is the Clothing or Habitation thereof: so that the Body is a substance, fixed, dry, and containing both the Spirit and the Soul. The Spirit Penetrates the Body; the Body fixes the Spirit; the Soul conjoyned, Tinges of its own Color, whether it is White or Red.</p>

                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> Convert the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and you shall have what you seek. The Earth which is Cold and Dry, agrees with the Water in one quality, which is cold. The Air which is Hot and Moist, participates with the Fire which is Hot and dry; and consequently the Earth with the Fire, because of its Driness. The Earth is the only true and first Element of the Stone, which by a Philosophical Calcination is to be Burnt up, and Rarifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, afterwards to be Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in a Moist place into a Ponderous Water: This by Sublimation is made more subtil and converted into Fire.

This Mixtion of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is not Corporeal, but Spiritual; not with Hands done, but the work of the Metalline <hi>Archeus</hi> or Spirit, which you ought well to know, and then you will not long err from the Truth.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> A Dialogue between <hi>Hermes</hi> and his Son.</head>
                        <p n="1">
                           <hi>I. HERMES.</hi> Know thou my Son, that the fat of our Earth is Sulphur; that Sulphur is Auripigment, Siretz, or Colcothar, of which Auripigment, Sulphurs, and such like, some are more vile or mean than others, in which there is a difference or diversity. Of this kind also is the Fat of Glewy substances; to wit, of Hair, Nails, Hoofs, and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur it self; Oyl of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Brain or Marrow, which is Auripigment. Of the same kind also is the Cats or Lyons Claw, which is Sirezt: The Fat of the White Bodies, and the Fat of the two Oriental Argent Vives, which Sulphurs are caught hold of, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Bodies.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> All these are only Various Names, by which the Philosophers call the one thing, and under which they Cloud it. But the most Acute <hi>Ripley</hi> saith, <hi>it is Argent Vive, but not the Vulgar, that without which nothing that exists, is able to be.</hi> If therefore, there be nothing under the Sun, in which this Argent Vive is not, Our <hi>Hermes</hi> has not done absurdly, to call it by these Names; tho' possibly there may be some one thing, which may contain more of it, that which is more pure, also generous, and more ripe or perfectly digested, than all the other things besides. Authors say, it is chieflly found in the Roots of Metals, which Roots are in the Air, and the Tops of the Mountains. It behoves you therefore, to have a perfect and solid knowledge of this Argent Vive, before you attempt any thing in this Art. And this is to be Communicated only to the Faithful Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Science. Be diligent with your whole
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:65913:120"/>
mind, consider, think, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, volve and revolve, meditate and reason with your self concerning it, and through the Divine Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, you will certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge there of.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <hi>II. Hermes.</hi> I say more, that this Sulphur does Tinge and Fix; and is contained and held by the Conjunctions of the Tinctures. Fats also Tinge, but withal they fly away, in the Body which is contained, which is a Conjunction of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives only with Sulphurs and Aluminous Bodies, which also contain and hold the Fugitive Matter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> He distinguisheth here between the true and Philosophick Tincture, and the Fictitious or Sophisticate. The true is made of a Fixt and Incombustible Sulphur, for which Cause also, the Bodies are rendred fixt and Incombustible: for every Transmutation is made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the nature of the thing Transmuting, and not of the thing to be Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; it is needful therefore, that you make choice of the best Sulphur for this Work. The Vulgar is For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, for that it is deficient, Blackens, and Corrupts, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving also a double superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> an Inflamable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and an Earthly Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culency. Therefore you must find out another, which is a simple Fire, and Living, and is able to Revivifie Dead Bodies, to bring them to the highest perfection, and to perfect them with the ultimate maturity. Such a Sulphur saith <hi>Avieenna</hi> is not to be found upon Earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Bodies of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna.</hi> In <hi>Sol</hi> indeeed is the highest of Perfection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is more digested and decocted; when therefore, the Tincture is prepared with this Sulphur, down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, in the Bottom of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurity, it is carried <hi>Grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi> up for the highest Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with the greatest splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of spirituality, so that any Body whatsoever being melted with the Fire, it Tinges, and so firmly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to it, that it cannot for ever be any more sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated therefrom. But the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:65913:120"/>
Sophisticate Tincture which is made from the middle Minerals, from burning Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Arsenical, Alumin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and such like, are not able to defend either Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, upon which they are projected, nor yet their own proper substance from the violence of Fire, but toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Bodies they flie away, and by the force of Fire Vanish into Air.</p>

                           <hi>III. Hermes.</hi> The order, method, managment and dis position of the Matter sought after by the Philosophers, is but one, in Our Egg. Now this in the Hens Egg, is in no wise to be found. But lest so much of the Divine Wisdom, as is seen in a Hens Egg, should be distinguished; we make in imitation thereof, a Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum from the four Elements, joyntly fitted and compacted together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> The Descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Philosophick Egg is various, which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers divide into four parts, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the four Elements. 1. <hi>Putamen,</hi> the Shell, which they make the Earth. 2. <hi>Albumen,</hi> the White, which is Water. 3. <hi>Pellicula,</hi> the Skin, which is Air. 4. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi> the Yolk, which is Fire. Some make only three parts thereof. 1. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellus,</hi> the Sulphur. 2. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bumen,</hi> the Mercury. 3. <hi>Putamen,</hi> the Salt. Some again will have <hi>the Yolk</hi> to signifie <hi>Mars, Sol,</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> and <hi>the White, Saturn, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter; Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Luna:</hi> and <hi>the Shell,</hi> the <hi>Firmament,</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Combustible Ashes:</hi> but to speak plainly, the <hi>Shell</hi> represents the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophick Glass; wherein the <hi>Skin,</hi> the <hi>White,</hi> the <hi>Tread,</hi> and the <hi>Yolk,</hi> answer to the four Elements: <hi>Fire Air, Water</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi> Or rather the <hi>Tread, Yolk,</hi> and <hi>White,</hi> to the three pure principles, <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Spirit, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> that is, <hi>Fixity, Tincture,</hi> and <hi>Subsistence.</hi>

                           <hi>IV. Hermes.</hi> Now in a Hens Egg, there is the greatest help that may be, for herein is a nearness of the Matters in their Natures: a spirituality, and gathering, and joyning

together of the Elements, and the Earth which is Gold in its Nature:</p>

                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> The <hi>Ovum Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophorum,</hi> or our Mercury has in it self whatever is necessary thereto: We call it Our Mercury because it is reduced into one pure Homogene Body, where is 1. A Propinquity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as Earth, Water, Air, and Fire; or Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury. 2. A Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, which is the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculty, the hidden Work-Master which brings the Stone to perfection. 3. A gathering together of the Elements, for that the Earth is made Water, and Air, and Fire, by Sublimation, and they are made Earth again; which Earth is Gold in its inward principle or Nature.</p>

                           <hi>V. Hermes.</hi> The Son saith to him, the Sulphurs which are convenient or fit for Our Work, are they Coelestial or Terrestial, Heavenly or Earthly? To whom <hi>Hermes</hi> answers: some of them are Heavenly, and some are from the Earth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> This is a short Dialogue between the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, <hi>Hermes</hi> makes answer to his Son, concerning the Sulphurs, that they are not of one or the same kind, but that some are of a Heavenly, and some are of an Earthly Nature, yet he confesses both to be Sulphurs: by the Heavenly is meant the Solar Sulphur; and by the Earthly, the Sulphur of <hi>Luna.</hi> For <hi>Sol</hi> is a Body Masculine, hot, fixt, red, and incombustible, which perfects <hi>Luna,</hi> who is Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine, Cold, Volatile, White, and Combustible, exalting her to his own Glory and Splendor.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <hi>VI. Hermes.</hi> The Son saith, Father, I think the Heart in the Superiors to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note Heaven; in the Inferiors, the Earth. To whom <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes</hi> saith: It is not so, the Masculine truly is the Heaven of the Feminine: and the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine the Earth of the Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> The Heaven is

the Masculine of the Earth; and Earth is the Feminine of the Heaven: <hi>Heaven</hi> or <hi>Sol</hi> which is pure, fixt, and incombustible Sulphur, is the generating Seed; and Mercury which is the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Earth, is the Womb, or Feminine principle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Seed, in which the Seed is keept, nourished, digested and brought to the Birth or Perfection: Even that in which it obtains, Spirit, Blood, and Flesh, <hi>viz.</hi> Fixity, Tincture, and Substance. The Earth or Mercury is the subject or receptacle of all the Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial Radiations.</p>

                           <hi>VII. Hermes.</hi> The Son saith, Father, which of these is more worthy, one than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whether is the Heaven or the Earth? The Father an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers: Both want the help of one another; but a Medium is proposed by precepts. But if thou shalt say, that Wisdom or the Wise Man does Rule or Command among all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; to this <hi>Hermes:</hi> The indifferent or ordinary things are better with them, because every Nature delights; or desires to be joyned in Society with its own kind. We find even in Wisdom it self, that equal things are joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon.</hi> If by a Magical Matrimony, the Heavens and the Earth are Conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, neither seems to be more worthy; for as the Earth cannot Generate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Heavens, so neither can the Heavenly Influences multiply themselves without the Earth: But there is a mean proposed, which he explicates in the following Paragraph, which is the making the one equal with the other, <hi>viz.</hi> by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth a new Off-spring out of both, which shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede <hi>Sol</hi> himself in perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, because it is more than perfect, and able to make the imperfect Bodies or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals perfect, which <hi>Sol</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self cannot do, and is also able to make the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies more than perfect, by multiplying their Tincture a thousand times more than what they had Originally by Nature, which is performed <hi>by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi>
                           <pb n="204" facs="tcp:65913:122"/>
saith <hi>Hermes,</hi> that is, <hi>by Art.</hi> And since every Nature Delights to be joyned with its own kind, you must be sure to joyn Metalline Bodies only with Metalline Principles, for Water joyned with Water cannot be separated, no more can Silver being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Silver, or Gold with Gold, that is to say, their Seed.</p>

                           <hi>VIII. Hermes.</hi> The Son saith; But what is the mean among them?

and Oyl, or Sulphur, is so little, that we want fit Words to express it, but it is like the Spirit to the Soul, which are inseparable. But this is to be understood, that of Sulphurs, such only are to be chosen, which are the more near in their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; the Sulphurs of Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are to be taken; not those of Vegetables or Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals: and of Minerals, that which is drawn from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury or Quick-Silver, Gold and Silver, which is to be Purified and exalted by some Power or Principle, which is without length, breadth, or thickness, <hi>viz.</hi> Incorporeal, and yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all those proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in it: without form or shape; yet comprehending under its formless being, the highest and most exact of Beauties; this is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Fire of the Mineral Sulphur.

The Salt of that Mercury is the Philosophick Earth, which is to be Dryed or Drained, Ploughed up, Manured and Cultivated; and the Sulphur thereof is the Internal Tincture, which Transmutes; but it is the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or living Principle which gives the Permanency or Fixity, and without which all Bodies whatsoever would fall to Dust and Ashes; that is it which ties the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Atoms of every thing together. In Sulphur, there is a Volatile Body, but a Fixing Spirit, and a Rubine Soul which tinges: This Body in the Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is cast away, and only the Spirit and Soul, which are without Parts, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, without length, breadth, or thickness, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out substance or corporeity are retained, and Conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Mercury of the Philosophers by the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of Salt, in which Salt lies the depth of the whole Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. This Salt is Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Mineral and Animal, from whence the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were wont to say, that their Stone was Threefold, according to that Ternary of Generations. In this Salt there is a Corporeity joyned whith a Soul and a Spirit, that is with a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Mercury spiritual, which are the Chains which tie all the Particles of the Body together. All these must be Cut in Pieces, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and divided, in the beginning of the Work, which is done by joyning of the three together; this is a Mystery which only the true Philosophers and Sons of Doctrine can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand. You must joyn Body to Body, Soul to Soul, and Spirit to Spirit, by which means you will make the separation; because the Soul will joyn with Soul, yet the Soul of the one will not joyn with the Body of the other, but separate.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Salmon. It is the most pretious,</hi> because it is the Fountain of all Treasures, <hi>but cast forth upon a Dunghil,</hi> because it is found in the Putrefaction of the Matters, which is filthy and stinks like a Dunghil; and so tho' it be most dear being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, yet it is most Vile, as being found amongst the most Vile things, in the midst of Corruption and defilements. Our Stone is Composed of a double Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive: The first of which Argent Vive's is Vile and Abject, and found in all places, in the Dunghil, in the High-way, in Plains, in Mountains and in Vallies, and without which Man, is not able to live one Moment of an hour; for it enlivens all things, both Animals and Vegetables, even Herbs, Plants, and Trees stand in need thereof; it preserves all things from Corruption, and every Mineral without exception. But would you know what it is; it is not Gold nor Silver, nor Gems, nor pretious Stones, these are things of great Price, and therefore not to be enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated among those things, which are Vile and Mean. What is it then? It is <hi>Salt,</hi> but not the Vulgar Salt, with which Food is Drest, altho' that has one of the Qualities of this our Stone, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; but it is <hi>Sal Petrae,</hi> Salt of the Rock, of the Rock I say, by which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Mercury is transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the best and most perfect of Metals, and the Flint into the most hard A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant: but few will believe this, but such whom Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience and true Philosophy has taught, how it is found in all things, and by what Artifice it may be extracted out of them. This is that which without doubt our Author as under a Veil, calls Auripigment. And this is
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:65913:128"/>
enough to be said concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Argent Vive, that it is Vile and most Vile. But the other which he calls Oriental Argent Vive of <hi>Magnesia,</hi> is most Valuable and Pretious; this is not spoke of Vulgar <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> nor of the Vulgar <hi>Magnesia.</hi> But by this Argent Vive, he means the humidity of the Mixture, which is the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Humidity of our Stone. By <hi>Magnesia,</hi> he understands the Total Mixion, or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum,</hi> from which this Humidity is extracted, and which Moisture is called our Argent Vive; which Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity does indeed run in the Fire and in the same does dissolve the whole <hi>Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> and also congeal it, makes it grow Black, makes it grow White, and also makes it grow Red, and in the end compleatly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects it; and it is that which does all in all, being a most pretious Treasure to such as know it, and possess it. This <hi>Magnesia</hi> is the Power and Virtue of our Stone, which like an Universal Magnet draws all things to their Center, whether in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior or inferior Worlds. And the greater part of this Secret Arcanum lies ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this pretious <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> than in the former Vile Argent Vive: of which, tho the Philosophers have va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously hid it under Clouds and Veils, we have here said enough.</p>

It is not Gold, except it be first Silver. Our Gold is the Tincture, or Soul, or Nourisher of the Work, without which it can never be done: nor is it made Silver, unless it be first Mercury: so that our <hi>Sol</hi> seems to appear with 3 Faces; first Black, which is the Putrefaction of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury. 2.

end; and be frustrate of your Expectations, losing all your cost and time; as is seen in the Levening of Bread; if you trouble the Mass of Meal and Water too soon, it will not be Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened: If it lies too long, it will be over done; so in our Work, if you be too hasty, you will perform nothing at all: If too long, and with too Violent a Fire, you will hazard the breaking of your Vessel, and by an over Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latility, frustrate the fixity of your Medicine: The making of <hi>Cheese</hi> is Famous, for almost every Housewife can tell you how easie it is to ruin or spoil all, (how good soever your Milk and Rennet may be,) if you be unskilful in the Art: If the Milk be too hot, or too cold, or the Rennet be too much or too little, or the <hi>Coagu lum</hi> lies too short a time, or too long, you may spoil your <hi>Cheese,</hi> and miss the Perfection, or Goodness, which therein you seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. These are Familiar ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and need no farther exposition. The Matter therefore is, first by our Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment corrupted, and brought into a blackness by Death, but not such a blackness, out of which it cannot be recovered; but so that in the Course of the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the Mass of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection may pass through the mutation or changes of all the Colors.

But some understand hereby, the Separation of the four Elements, and this doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less is the thing if it be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a Spagyrick, and not Vulgar Separation. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Appellation of Fire, the two other are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, <hi>viz.</hi> Air and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for the Fire cannot want or subsist without Air, nor is the Air without Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for Air is made of Water by the Mediation of the Fire, by which it is forced to Ascend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But as to the Earth, it partly Ascends and is made Volatile, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remains fixed below. By separating the Earth

from the Fire, some will have it, that he would have the Thick to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Thin, not the Thin from the Thick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Earth is thicker than the Fire.

The Internal is proper to the substance or Matter, and Naturally dwells within it, which you must prudently stir up and Excite. The External is either Violent, or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated in four several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. The Violent is that with which some things are Calcined, others Sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, others (as Metalls) Liquified or Melted.

It is resembled to a grain of VVheat, which unless it Dies, it brings forth no Fruit; but if it Die, and is Putrefied, passing through Death and Putrefaction or Dissolution, to Life and Heaven, there by perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Nature, it is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profitable.

                           <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> The Enterance into the Work, beginning with Argent Vive.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. <hi>HERMES</hi> the Wise saith, if you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a third part of your Camels, [<hi>viz. of the swift or Volatile Matter, or that which must bear the Bur then,</hi>] and Consume the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining two thirds, you have attained to the thing desired; you have perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the Work.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. In like manner you must be careful of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive; for the black Matter does Whiten the Flesh, and the Work is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Fire of the Wise.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And the Work is to be performed by a Spiritual Water, in which the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is washed away; and by that Instrument, in which the Foundation of the Work is laid, and in that time and moment, in which the Clouds appear.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Now that Water, in or by which the blackness is washed away, is the Sweat
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:65913:423"/>
or Moisture of the Sun, and Childrens Urine, [i. e. <hi>the Virgins Water.</hi>] The thing which I tell you is sufficient for you to know.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. In like manner, take the Water of the Water, [<hi>Mercury of Mercury,</hi>] and with it cleanse and purifie the Wind, Fume, or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, and Abolish the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Understand what this signifies, and rejoyce therein.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Also in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, take the blackness and Conjoyn it; then have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the White, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn the Red; so will you go through the thing desired, and come to the end of the Work.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. It is also to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it is the Fire-Stone which Governs the Matter or Work, by the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of God: Boyl it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a gentle Fire, Night and Day, lest the Water should be separated from it; even till it becomes of a Golden Color: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand well what I say.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. That also which Congeals, does Dissolve; and that which does Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, does in like manner make Red.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. I have made plain to you the nearest way, that you may be easie and satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Understand therefore these things, and Meditate upon them; and you shall certainly attain to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Work.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. It is also to be noted, that as Sol is among the Stars; so is Gold among the other Metalline Bodies: For as the Light of the Sun, is joyned to the Lights, and contains the Fruit of this Operation; so in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Gold: Meditate upon these Words, and by the Permission of God you may find it out.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> The Nature of the Medicine, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Metals.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. <hi>HERMES</hi> Moreover saith, he that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly takes in this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, it Kills him: but he that inwardly drinks it in, it makes him to Live and rejoyce. Understand what this means.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And as for this cause sake, this Water is said to be Divine, so it is said to be the greatest Poyson: and it is preferred before all other things, by so much as that without it nothing of the Work can be done.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. It is also called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, for that it cannot be mixed or joyned with any filth or defiled thing: and this Water of our Stone puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and cleanses the Natures of the Metals, and washes away their defoedations or defilements.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And as <hi>Sol</hi> Acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bodies, so also does this Water upon the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Stone: Yea, it pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates and sinks through it, and is constant, fixed, and perfect.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. This indeed is seen in <hi>Sol;</hi> but it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that the Work may be made through all the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Planets: as first from <hi>Saturn,</hi> then from <hi>Jupiter, Mars, Venus, Mercury,</hi> and lastly from <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The first is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Saturn;</hi> to wit, to cause <hi>Sol</hi> to putrefie, or bring the Body to putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is done in the space of 40 days and nights. The second is the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which is to grind or break the matter, and in 12 days and nights to Imbue or moisten it,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:65913:424"/>
which is called the Regiment of Tin.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The third is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Mars,</hi> which is to induce Death or black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or to separate the Spirit from the Body, by which it is said to be changed. The fourth is the government of <hi>Sol,</hi> which is to Work away the Blackness and Poyson; and is indeed to make it White.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The fifth is the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is to joyn the moist to the dry, and the hot to the cold, and to Unite them together in one: This is the Dominion of Brass or Copper, [<hi>or the the making of the matter of a changeable Yellow.</hi>] The sixth is the government of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> which is to burn, and is called the Dominion of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The seventh is the government of <hi>Luna,</hi> which is to Decoct or Boyl, and make Hot, and so to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the matter, [<hi>with the fixed Citrine Tincture</hi>] in 25 days: and this is the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Silver. See here, I have gone with you through the whole Work; take heed therefore lest you err.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. AND know that the White Body is made with the Whiteness; and its Ferment is that which you already know: Whiten there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Body, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what I say.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Also in like manner you are to note; that the Stone sought after, has not its like or equal in the whole Earth. It is both outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and inwardly of a Citrine Golden Color; but when

it is altered or changed, it is made a Body dark and black, like burnt Coals.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Now the Color of the Spirit taken from it is White, and the substance thereof is Liquid as Water; but the Color of the Soul thereof is Red.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But the Soul and the Spirit thereof is returned to it again, and it doth Live and Rejoyce, and its Light and Glory returns again; and you shall see it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and Triumph: And that which was even now Dead, shall have Conquered Death, and then it shall Live, and arise from the Dead, and Live as it were for ever.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Happy and Blessed therefore is he in whose Power the disposition of this Matter is, who Kills and makes Alive, and is Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent over all for ever.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. I therefore advise you, not to do any thing in this work, till you get an understanding thereof: For if you be Ignorant and void of true Knowledge, you will err in whatsoever you do, you will wholly Labour in Vain, and your work will Perish.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. So that thus mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in your Operation, you blame presently your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors (the Philosophers) and think that they have erred, or taught you wrong, when it is only your Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and none under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of their words.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. This then know and understand, that the <hi>Day,</hi> is the Nativity or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of the Light; but the <hi>Night,</hi> the Nativity or bringing forth of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Sol</hi> also is the Light of the Day; and <hi>Luna</hi> the Light of the Night; which God Created to govern the World.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. But <hi>Luna</hi> does receive her Light of the <hi>Sun</hi> by Combustion, and is dilated or enlarged therewith: and by so much as <hi>she</hi> receives
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:65913:425"/>
of the Light of the <hi>Sun,</hi> or does contain in <hi>her,</hi> of his Light; by so much does the Nature of <hi>Sol</hi> bear Rule over the Nature of <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">XI. If therefore you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template what I say, and Meditate upon my Words, you will find that I have spoken the Truth; and you will understand the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, of all that I have said, and the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole Matter.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Know then, that the Spirit, is enfolded or circumscribed, within (as it were) its Marble House or Walls: Open therefore the Passages that the Dead Spirit may go out, and be cast forth from our Bodies: then it will become beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, which is only a Work or undertaking of Wisdom.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Sow therefore [O God] thy Wisdom in our Hearts, and Root out the corrupt Principles which lodge therein, and leads us in the way of thy Saints, by which our Spirits and Souls may be Purified.

You are also to note, what Alums and Salts are, which flow from Bodies: if you put the Medicines [<hi>or Matters of the Medicine</hi>] in a just or true proportion, you shall not fear to err; but if you mistake the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you must add or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish, according as you see it tends to the emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or performing of the Work, lest a Deluge should
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:65913:426"/>
come and overflow all, drowning the Regions, and overturning the Trees by the Roots.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And tho the Matter be unknown, yet consider these things, how, or after what manner these two Colors are distinguished, or diversified, by their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours: look into the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Sugar, which is one kind of sweet Juice; and into the sweetness of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which is yet more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense or inward.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Except you make the Bodies spiritual and impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, you know not how to putrefie <hi>Ixir,</hi> or proceed on in the Work; nor how the three Volatile Matters or Principles, fight one against another; and how they fail not, each in their turns, to devour one another, till of two being left, one, only remains.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Be careful also, how you increase your Fire (tho it is not to be very small when you dry up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) and take heed that you burn not the Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if the Vessel breaks, it will be with a mighty <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> or force.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And unless the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Stone, prove ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical one to another, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and fight with, and strive to destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you shall never attain to the thing you seek after.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. If you mix your Calx with Auripigment, and not in a mean or due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the splendor and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Operation will not succeed; but if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose a medium, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect will immediately follow.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Now know, that it is our Water, which extracts the hidden Tincture. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Example and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it; if you have once brought the Body into Ashes, you have operated rightly.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. And the blood (which is in the Philosophick Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) of the animated Body, is the Earth of the Wise, to wit, the permanent or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during perfection.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XIX.</hi> That the Beginning of this Work is in the Blackness and Darkness: and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning the Body with the Soul.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. NOW it is that which is dead, which you ought to vivisie or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live; and that which is sick, which ought to be cured: It is the White which is to be rubified; the Black which is to be purified; and the Cold which is to be made hot.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It is God himself who does create, and inspire or give life, and replenishes Nature with his Power, that it might follow and imitate his Wisdom, and act as an Instrument subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to him.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Iron is our Gold; and Brass or Copper is our Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; Argent Vive is our Glory; Tin is our Silver; Blackness is our Whiteness; and the Whitness is our Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. From hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears necessary, that we should have a Body purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodies; and a Water subliming Water. Our Stone which is a Vessel of Fire, is made of Fire; and is converted into the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And if you would walk in the true way, you must persue it in the evident or visible Blackness: for (saith our Stone) it is that which is hidden within, which does make me white; and the same thing which makes me White, makes me also Red.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Conceal this thing from Men, like as a word which is yet in thy Mouth, which no Man understands;
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:65913:427"/>
and as the Fire, Light, or Sight, which is in thine Eye: I will not tell it plainly to thee thy self, left by thy words thou conveyest my Breath to another, to thine own damage: This is the caution I give thee.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Now know that this our Work, is made [<hi>or compounded</hi>] of two Figures [<hi>or Substances</hi>] the one of which wants the White Rust [<hi>Ceruse</hi>] and the other the Redish Rust [<hi>Crocus</hi>] Our Matters also are searsed thro our Sieves or Searses, made of pure or clean Rinds, and a most blessed Wood.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. You are also to take notice, that the Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone of the Philosophers sought after, wants Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but it has quantity. It behoves you therefore, to support and nourish it on every side, and to continue it as in the middle.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. You must also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oyn the Body with the Soul, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="10">X. I also tell you, that its habitation or dwelling place, is posited in the Bowels of the Earth, for without Earth it cannot be perfected: Also, its habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is posited in the Bowels of the Fire, nor without Fire can it be perfected, which is the perfection of our Art.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Again, Except you mix with the White the Red, and presently bring or reduce the same into a perfect Water, it will tinge nothing; for it never tinges any thing Red, but that which is White: and while the Work is now perfecting, add them to the light of the Sun, and it will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated <hi>Regimine Marino,</hi> as we have already declared: and by this conjunction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, your Stone will attain

                        <p n="12">XII. Thus have you a dry Fire which does tinge: an Air or Vapour, which fixes and chains the Volatile Matter, binding the Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in Fetters; and also whitens, expelling the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from Bodies; and a fixed Earth, also receiving the Tincture.</p>

                        <p n="2">II. If you understand how a Resurrection is ac complished, <hi>i. e.</hi> how the living [<hi>Principle or Spirit</hi>] comes forth from the dead [<hi>Matter or Substance</hi>] how that is made apparent which was hidden, and how Strength is drawn forth through Weakness; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Ignorant how to compleat and perfect this Work.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. How Manifest and Clear are the Words of the Wise, yet so as the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life and Principal is still hidden; you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand them not perfectly by their Expressions.</p>
                        <p n="4">IIII. Two Bodies equally taken from the Earth, grind, in the Oyl of the Decocted Matter, and in the Milk of the White Volatile: Now mighty and wonderful are the powers and force of these Bodies, which are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestowed upon you, through this whole Science, which you shall possess, and therewith a long and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Life.</p>

V. Take by force the most Intense Wisdom, from whence you must draw forth the Eternal [<hi>perpetual or fixed</hi>] Life of the Stone, till your Stone is congealed, and its dulness is vanished; so will you accomplish the Life thereof sought after.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Give therefore of this Life sufficienly to your Matter, and it will morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it [<hi>or bring it to putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi>] but repleat your Earth, and it shall make it to live [<hi>Spring, Bud, Grow, Germinate.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Plant this Tree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Stone, that it may not be in danger of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of Winds, that the Volatile Iufluences or Bird of Heaven, may fall upon it, and by virtue thereof, its Branches may bring forth much Fruit; from thence Wisdom does arise.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Take this Volatile Bird, cut off its Head with a fiery Sword, then strip it of its Feathers or Wings, undo its Joynts, and boil it upon Coals, till it is made, or becomes of one only Color.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Then put the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom, or Poyson to it, so much as is enough to bury or cover it; govern it now with a gentle Fire, till your Matter is mortified or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefied; which done, grind it with White Water, and manage it rightly.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. For we bought two Black — [<hi>Crows</hi>] and we put them into a <hi>Paropsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> or Crucible [<hi>or Cupel</hi>] which we had by us, and Eggs or Silver Gobbets came out, White as Salt, these we tinged with our Saffron: of them we sold publickly two hundred times, with which we have been made Rich, and our Treasures are multiplied.</p>

                        <p n="12">XII. Now you must note, that there are two Stones of the Wise, found in the Shores of the Rivers, in the Arms of the Mountains, in the Bowels of the Floods, and in the back parts of the Kings House, which by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement may be brought forth, Male and Female.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. By these being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and made complex [<hi>or perfectly united into one consimiliar substance</hi>] you will be made wiser [<hi>you will see the reason of the Operation, and the end of the Work</hi>] Blessed God, how great and how wonderful a thing is this.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. A certain Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher dreamed, that the Kings Messenger came to a certain <hi>Podagrick,</hi> and the <hi>Podagrick</hi> desired that he might go with him; to whom the Messenger an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, since thou hast the Gout, how canst thou go with me, for thou canst not walk.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. To whom the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagrick</hi> answered, Thou knowest that in the Root of this Mountain, there is a certain Tabernacle, bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me then thither, leave there the burthen, so shall I be presently freed or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from my Gout.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Then said he to me, thou art not able to touch the foot thereof: but going back, he took him up and placed him in the Tabernacle, the foot of which, the Messenger said, he was not able to touch: And waking from his Dream, he saw nothing. Behold the Similitude.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. Another also saw in a Dream, wherein it was said, if any one truly should sit down by the way, and should ask you, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:65913:429"/>
you would think fit to do this thing, would you do it? He answered, I know not; the other said, thar he should lie or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with his Mother in the middle of the Earth; then awaking, he saw nothing. Consider well this simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> Of the Difficulties of this Art.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THanks be given to God, the Creator of all things, who hath made us, renewed us, taught us, and given us knowledge and understanding; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he should keep us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve us, and direct us, we should wander out of the right way, as having no Guide or Teacher: Nor can we know any thing in this World, unless he teach us, who is the begining of all things, and the Wisdom it self, his power and goodness, it is, with which he over-shadows his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. He directs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs whom he pleases, and by his long-suffering, and tender Mercies, brings
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:65913:162"/>
them back into the way of Righteousness. For he has sent his Angels [<hi>or Spirit</hi>] into the dark places, and made plain the Ways, and with his loving kindness re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenishes such as love him.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Know then my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that this Magistery of our Secret Stone, and this Valuable Art, is a secret of the Secrets of God, which he has hidden with his own People; not revealing it to any, but to such, who as Sons faithfully have deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, who have known his Goodness, and Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. If you would request any Earthly thing at the Hand of God, the Secret of this Magistery is more to be desired, than any thing else. For the Wise Men, who have perfected the knowledge thereof, have not been wholly plain, but speaking of it, have partly concealed it, and partly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it: And in this very thing, I have found the preceeding Philosophers to agree, in all their so much valued Books.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Know therefore, that <hi>Musa,</hi> my own Disciple, (more valuable to me than any other) having diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly studied their Books, and laboured much in the Work of this Magistery, was much perplexed, not knowing the Natures of things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereto: Whereupon he humbly begged at my Hands, my Explanation thereof, and my Directions therein.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But I gave him no other Answer, Than that he should read over the Philosophers Books, and therein to seek that which he desired of me: Going his way, he read above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Books, as he found, or could get them, the true Books of the Secret of the Great Philosophers: But by them he could not attain the knowledge of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery which he desired, tho continually studying it, for the space of a Year, for which reason, he was as one astonished, and much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in mind.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="286" facs="tcp:65913:432"/>
VII. If then <hi>Musa</hi> my Scholar, (who has deserved to be accounted among the Philosophers) has thus fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the knowledge of this Mistery; what may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from the Ignorant and Unlearned, who under stand not the Natures of things, nor apprehend whereof they consist?</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Now when I saw this in my most dear and chosen Disciple, moved with Piety and Love to him, by the Will also and Appointment of God, I wrote this my Book near the time of my Death, in which, tho' I have preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted many things which the Philosophers before me have mentioned in their Books; yet have I handled some things which they have concealed, and could not be prevailed withal to reveal or discover.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Yea, I have explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and laid open certain things, which they hid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der AEnigmatical and dark Expressions; and this my Book I have Named, <hi>The Secrets of Alchymie,</hi> for that I have revealed in it, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is necessary to the knowledge of this Learning, in a Language befiting the matter, and to your sence and understanding.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. I have taught four Magisteries far greater and better than the other Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have done, of which number, The one is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Elixir, another Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal: The other two are Mineral Elixirs; but not <hi>the one Mineral,</hi> whose Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is to wash, cleanse, or purifie those which they call the Bodies. And another is to make Gold of <hi>Azot vive;</hi> whose Composition or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is according to the Natural Generation in the Mines, or in the Heart and Bowels of the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And these four Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisteries or Works, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have discoursed of, in their Books of the Composition thereof, but they are wanting in many things, nor would they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shew the Operation of it
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:65913:432"/>
in their Books: And when by chance any one found it out, yet could he not throughly understand it; than which nothing was more grievous to him.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. I will therefore in this Work declare it, toge ther with the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how to make it, but if you read me, learn to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand Geometrical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that so you may rightly frame your Forna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, not exceeding the mean, either in greatness or smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; with all you must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the proportion of your Fire, and the form of the Vessel fit for your Work.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Also you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, what is the ground work and beginning of the Magistery; which is as the Seed and Womb to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are shaped in the Womb, and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Fabrick, Increase and Nourishment. For if the <hi>prima materia</hi> of our Magistery is not conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently managed, the Work will be spoiled, and you will not find that which you seek after, nor shall you bring your Work to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. For where the cause of Generation is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the root of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and heat it self, your labour will be lost, and the Work come to nothing. The same also will happen, if you mistake in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion or weight; for if that be not right, to wit, the proportion of the parts compounding, the matter compounded missing of its just temperature will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, and so you shall reap no fruit, the which I will shew you by an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. See you not that in Soap, (with which Cloaths are washt clean and white) that it has its virtue and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty by reason of the just proportion of its Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, which spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in length and breadth, and because of which they agree to the same end; by which it appears, that the

                           <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of the four principal Operations, Solution, Congelation, Albification and Rubification.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. BEgining now to speak of the <hi>Great Work,</hi> which they call <hi>Alchymie</hi>) I shall open the matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out concealing ought, or keeping back any thing, save that which is not fit to be declared: We say then, that the great work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains four Operations, <hi>viz.</hi> to Dissolve, to Congeal, to make White, and to make Red.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. There are four quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities partakers together; of which, two are partakers between themselves; so also have the other two a cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between themselves. And either of these double quantities, has another quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity partaker with them, which is greater than these two.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. I understand by these quantities, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the Natures, and weight of the Medicines,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:65913:164"/>
which are in order dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and congealed, wherein neither addition, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution have any place. But these two, <hi>viz.</hi> Solution and Congelation, are in one O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, and make but one Work, and that before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; but after Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition those Operations be divers.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And this Solution and Congelation which we have spoken of, are the solution of the Body, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation of the Spirit, which two, have indeed but one Operation, for the Spirits are not congealed, except the Bodies be dissolved; as also the Bodies are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, unless the Spirit be congealed. And when the Soul and the Body are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, each of them works its Companion into its own likeness and pro perty.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. As for Example. When Water is put to Earth, it strives to dissolve the Earth, by its virtue, property, and moisture, making it softer than it was before, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be like it self, for the Water was more thin than the Earth. And thus does the Soul work in the Body, and after the same manner is the Water thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with the Earth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes like the Earth in thickness, for the Earth was more thick than the Water.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Know also, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the solution of the Body, and the congelation of the Spirit, there is no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of time, nor diversity of work, as though the one should be without the other; as there is no difference of time in the conjunction of the Earth and Water, that the one might be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the other by its operation. But they have both one instant, and one fact; and one and the same work performs both at once, before Composition.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. I say, before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, lest he that should read my Book, and hear the terms of Solution and Congelation. should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it to be the Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

                        <p n="8">VIII.

XII. But 'tis true, that unless there be a compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Stone can never be brought to light: There must be a separation of the parts of the Compound, which separation is in order also to a conjunction. I tell you again, that the Spirit will not dwell with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, nor enter into it, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in it, until the Body be made subtil and thin as the Spirit is.</p>

We call the Clay when it is white <hi>Yarit,</hi> that is Silver: But when it is red, we name it <hi>Temeynch,</hi> that is Gold: Whiteness is that which tinges Copper, and makes it <hi>Yarit:</hi> And it is redness which tinges <hi>Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, i. e.</hi> Silver, and makes it <hi>Temeynch,</hi> or Gold.</p>

Every one of these <hi>Aludels</hi> must have a Furnace fit for them, which must have a similitude and figure fit for the Work. <hi>Mezleme</hi> and some other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, have named all these things in their Books, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner and form thereof.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And herein the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers agree together in their Writings; concealing the matter under Symbols,

III. And Corruption is in conjunction with Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Generation is retained with Generation, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration conquereth with Generation.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Now for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of these things, the Philosophers have in their Books taught us how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct, and how decoction is to be made in the matter of our Magistery: This is that which generates, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges them from their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Colours, into other Substances and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. If you err not in the begining you may happily attain the end: But you ought to consider the seed of the Farth whereon we live, how the heat of the Sun works in it, till the Seed is impregnated with its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and Virtues, and made to spring, till it grows up to ripeness: This is the first change or transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. After this, Men and other Creatures feed upon it; and Nature, by the heat that is innate in Man, chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges it again, into Flesh, Blood, and Bones.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Now like to this is the Operation or Work of our Magistery, the Seed whereof, (as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers say) is such, that its progress and perfection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sifts in the fire, which is the cause of its Life and Death.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Nor is there any thing which comes between the Body and the Spirit, but the fire; nor is there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing mingled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but the fire which brings the Magistery to its perfection; this is the truth which I have told you, and I have both seen and done it.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. NOW except you subtilize the Body till it becomes water, it will not corrupt and putrefie, nor can it congeal the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive Souls when the fire touches them; for the fire is that which by its force and spirit congeals and unites them.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. In like manner the Philosophers commanded to dissolve the Bodies, to the end that the heat might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their Bowels, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts: So we return to dissolve these Bodies, and congeal them after their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, with that thing which comes near to it, till all the things mixed together by an apt and fit commixtion, in proportional quantities, are firmly conjoyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Wherefore we joyn Fire and Water, Earth and Air together, mixing the thick with the thin, and the thin with the thick, so as they may abide together, and their Natures may be changed the one into the other, and made like, and one thing in the compound which before were sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Because that part which generates or fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, bestows its virtue upon the subtil and thin, which is the Air; for like cleaves to its like, and is a part of the Generation, from whence it receives power to move and ascend upwards.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Cold has power over the thick matter, because it has lost its heat, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is gone out of it; and the driness appears upon it.

                        <p n="6">VI. Now when the thick body has lost its heat and moisture, and that the cold and dryness has power over it; and that their parts have mixed themselves, by being first divided, and that there is no moisture left to joyn the parts divided, the parts withdraw themselves.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And then the part which is contrary to cold, by reason it has continued, and sent its heat and deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the cold parts of the Earth, having power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and exercising such dominion over the coldness which was hidden in the said thick Body; <hi>that,</hi> by virtue of its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative power, changes the thick cold Body, and makes it become subtil and hot, and then strives to dry it up again by its heat.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. But afterwards, the subtil part, (which causes the <hi>Natures</hi> to ascend) when it has lost its Occidental heat, and waxes cold, then the <hi>Natures</hi> are changed, and become thick, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to the center, where the earthly Natures are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, which were subtilized, and converted in their generation, and imbibed in them.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. And so the moisture joyneth together the parts divided: But the Earth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to dry up that moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, compassing it about, and hindering it for going out; by means whereof, that which before lay hid, does now appear; nor can the moisture be separated, but is held fast, and firmly retained by dryness.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. In like manner we see, that whatsoever is in the World, is held or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by or with its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, as heat with cold, and dryness with moisture: thus when each of them has besieged its Companion, the thin is mixed with the thick, and those things are

Then it strives to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve and subtilize by its heat and moisture, which is the Soul; and the Body labours to enclose, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the hot and moist Soul in its cold and dry sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.

                        <p n="4">IV. Afterwards return it back to the first <hi>Natures</hi> which ascended from it, and purifie them likewise from uncleanness, black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and contrariety.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And reiterate these Works upon them so often, till they be subtilized, puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:65913:170"/>
and made thin, which when you have done, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der up thanks and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments to the most Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Know then that this Work is but one, and it produceth one Stone, into which <hi>Garib</hi> shall not enter, <hi>i. e.</hi> any strange or foreign thing. The Philosopher works with this, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from proceeds a Medicine which gives perfection.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Nothing must be mingled herewith, either in part or whole: And this Stone is to be found at all times, and in every place, and about every Man; the search whereof is yet diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to him that seeks it, wheresoever he be.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. This Stone is vile, black, and stinking; it costs nothing; it must be taken alone, it is somewhat hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and is called the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the World, because it rises up, like things that bud forth; this is the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation and appearance of it, to them that seek truly after it.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Take it therefore, and work it as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher has told you in the the Book, where he speaks of it after this manner. <hi>Take the Stone and no Stone, or that which is not a Stone, neither of the nature of a Stone; it is a Stone whose Mine is in the top of the Mountains.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">
                           <hi>X. By which the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher understands Animals, or living Creatures; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he said,</hi> Son, go to the Mountains of <hi>India,</hi> and to its Caves, and take thence precious Stones, which will melt in the water, when they are put into it.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. This Water is that which is taken from other Mountains and hollow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; they are Stones and no Stones, but we call them so, for the resemblance they have to Stones.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. And you must know that the Roots of their Mines are in the Air, and their Tops in the Earth; and they make a noise when they are taken out of their
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:65913:440"/>
places, and the noise is very great. Make use of them very suddenly, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they will quickly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish away.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXX.</hi> Of the Commixtion of the Elements which were separated.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. NOW you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to commix the Elements, which is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of the whole Work; there can be no commixti on without a Marriage and putrefaction. The <hi>Marriage</hi> is to mingle the thin with the thick: and <hi>Putrefaction</hi> is to rost, grind, water or imbibe so long, till all be mixt together and become one, so that there be no diversity in them, nor sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as in water mixed with water.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Then will the thick strive to retain the thin, and the Soul shall strive with the fire and endeavour to sustain it, then shall the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit suffer it self to be swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by the Bodies, and be poured forth into them: which must needs be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the dissolved body, when it is commixed with the Soul, is also commixed with every part thereof.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And other things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into other things, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their similitude and likeness, and both are changed into one and the same thing: For this cause the Soul must partake with the conveniency, propensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, durability, hardness corporcity and permanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which the body had in its commixtion.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The like also must happen to the spirit in this state or condition of the Soul and Body: For when
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:65913:440"/>
the Spirit shall be commixt with the Soul by alaborious operation, and all its parts with all the parts of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Soul and Body; then shall the Spirit and the said two, be changed into an inseparable substance, whose <hi>natures</hi> are preserved, and their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, agreed and conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfectly together.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Whereby it comes to pass, that when this <hi>Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situm</hi> has met with a body dissolved, and that heat has got hold of it, and that the moisture which was in it is swallowed up in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved body, and has passed into it, [into its most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts,] and united or conjoyned it self with that which was of the nature of moisture, it becomes infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the fire defends it self with it.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Then when the fire would enflame it, it will not suffer the said fire to take hold of it, to wit, to cleave to it, <hi>i. e.</hi> to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit commixt with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: The fire will not abide by it until it be pure.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And in like manner does the Water naturally fly from the Fire, of which when the fire takes hold, it does by little and little eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And thus is the Body the means to retain the Water, and the Water to retain the Oyl, that it might not burn and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume away, and the Oyl to retain the Tincture; which is the absolute matter and cause, to make the colours appear in that, wherein o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there would be neither light nor life.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. This then is the true life and perfection of this great Work, even the work of our Magistery, which we seek after: Be wise and understand, search dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, and through the goodness and permission of God, you shall find what you look for.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXXI.</hi> Of the Solution of the Stone compounded, and Coagulation of the Stone dissolved.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THE Philosophers take great pains in dissolving, that the Body and Soul might the better be incorporated and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for all those things which are together in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, Assation, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, have a certain affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Alliance between themselves.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. So that the fire may hurt or spoil the weaker principle in nature, till it be utterly destroyed and vanish away; and then it turns it self also upon the stronger parts, till it divests the Body of the Soul, and so spoils all.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. But when they are thus dissolved and congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they take one anothers parts, striving in each others mutual defence, as well the great as the small, and they incorporate and joyn them well together, till they be converted and changed into one and the same thing.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. When this is done, the fire takes as much from the Soul as it does from the Body, nor can it hurt the one more than the other, neither more nor less, which is a cause of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. For this reason it is necessary, in teaching the composition of the Elixir, to afford one place for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the solution of simple Bodies and Souls; because Bodies do not enter into Souls, but do rather prevent and hinder them from Sublimation, Fixati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Retention, Commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the like Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:65913:441"/>
except purification go before.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Now understand, that Solution is done by one of these two ways; either by extracting the inward parts of things unto their Superficies (an Example whereof we have in Silver, which seems cold and dry, but being dissolved, so that the inward parts appear out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it is hot and moist:)</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, to reduce it to an accidental moisture which it had not before, to be added to its own natural humidity; by which means its parts are dissolved: and this is likewise called <hi>Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <hi>VIII. But as to Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Philosophers have said,</hi> Congeal in a Bath, with a good Congelation: This, I tell you is Sulphur shining in Darkness a Red Hyacinth, a fiery and deadly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, the Elixir, the which there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, a Lyon, a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror, a Malefactor, a cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sword, a healing Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, which cures all Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Diseases.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <hi>IX. And</hi> Geber <hi>the Son of</hi> Hayen <hi>said,</hi> That all the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of this Magistery are comprehended under these six things. <hi>1.</hi> To make fly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, or sublime. <hi>2.</hi> To melt or liquify. <hi>3.</hi> To ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. <hi>4.</hi> To make white as Marble. <hi>5.</hi> To dissolve. <hi>6.</hi> To congeal.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. To make fly, is to drive away and remove blackness and foulness from the Spirit and Soul; to melt is to make the Body liqnid: To incerate, is properly to subtilize the Body: To whiten, is to melt speedily: To dissolve, is to separate the parts: And to congeal, is to mix, joyn, and fix the Body with the Soul already prepared.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Again, To fly, of ascend, appertains both to Body and Soul: To melt, to incerate; to whiten, and to dissolve, are accidents belonging to the Body: But congelation, or fixation, only belongs to, and is the property of the Soul: Be wise, understand, and learn.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. WHEN it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of <hi>Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan</hi> a <hi>Greek</hi> Philosopher, whether a Stone may be made of a thing which bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? Answered, Yea, <hi>viz.</hi> the two first Stones, to wit, the Stone <hi>Aleali,</hi> and our Stone, which is the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship and Life of him who knows and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ftands it.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But he that is ignorant of it, who has not made, nor knows how it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, supposing it to be no Stone, or apprehends not in his own mind, all the things which I have spoken of it, and yet will attempt to compose it, spends away foolishly his precious time, and loses his Money.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Except he finds out this precious Treasure, he finds indeed nothing, there is no second thing or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that can rise up and take its place, or stand it self instead thereof; there is no other Natures that can triumph over it.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Much heat is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, but with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain temperature: If by this saying, you come to know it, you will reap profit; but if yet you remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, you will lose all your labour.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. It has many singular Properties and Virtues in curing the Infirmities of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and their accidental Diseases, and preserves sound Substances, so that there appears not in them any Heterogenities, or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties: No possibility of the dissolution of their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

                        <p n="7">VII. This is the Life of the Dead, and their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; a Medicine preserving Bodies, cleansing them, and purging away their Superfluities.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. He that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands, let him understand, and he that is ignorant, let him be ignorant still: For this Treasure is not to be bought with Money, and as it cannot be bought, so neither can it be sold.</p>

Afterwards grind it again, and put thereto the like Quantity of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served water as you did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; bury it in very hot Horse dung, and leave it therefore ten days more, take it out again, and you shall find that the Body has already drunk up the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. IF you would be so happy as to obtain the Blessing of the Philos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, as God doth live for ever, so let this verity live with you. Now the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers say, it abides in the Shell, and contains in it self both White and Red, the one is called Masculine, the other Feminine; and they are Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral, the like of which is not found in the World besides.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It has power both A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive and Passive in it, and has also in it a substance dead and living, Spirit and Soul, which, among the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, the Philosophers call the most vile thing: It contains in it self the four Elements which are found in its Skirts, and may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly be bought for a small price.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. It ascends by it self, it waxes black, it descends and waxes white, increases
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:65913:444"/>
and decreases of it self: It is a matter which the Earth brings forth, and descends from Heaven, grows pale and red, is born, dieth, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses again, and afterwards lives for ever.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. By many ways it is brought to its end, but its proper decoction is upon a fire soft, mean, strong, by various degrees augmented, until you are certain it is qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly fixed with the Red in the fire. This is the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers Stone.</p>

Read, and Read a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, so will all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more clear to you: But if hereby you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not the matter, you are withheld by the Chains of Ignorance; for you shall never otherwise know or learn this Art.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. <hi>Hermes</hi> saith, <hi>The Dragon is not killed, but by his Brother and his Sister; not by one of them alone, but by both together:</hi> Note these things: There are three Heads, yet but one Body, one Nature, and one Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: This is sufficient for you if you have a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to understand this Art.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The <hi>Dragon</hi> is not mortified, nor made fixed, but with <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and by no other: In the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Bodies, in the Plains of Mercury, look for it, there this Water is created, and by concourse of these two, and is called by the Philosophers, their perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or fixed Water.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Our Sublimation is to decoct the Bodies with Golden Water, to dissolve, to liquifie, and to sublime them: Our Calcination is to purifie and digest in four ways, and not otherwise, by which many have been deceived in Sublimation.</p>

and all that is perfect, is in that Greenness only, which is in our Latten, or Brass.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. For that Greenness, by our Magistery is in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little time transmuted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most fine Gold: And of this thing we have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, which you may try by the following Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Take burnt, or cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined Brass, and perfectly rubified: Grind it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct it with Water, seaven times, as much every time as it is able to drink, in all the ways of Rubifying and Assating it again.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Then make it to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, and its green color, will be made Red, and as clear as a Hyacinth; and so much redness will descend with it, that it will be able to tinge <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> in some measure, with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry color of Gold; all which we have done and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is indeed a very great Work.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Yet you cannot prepare the Stone by any means, with any green and moist liquor, which is found and brought forth in our Minerals; this blessed might, power, or virtue, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates all things, will not yet cause a vegetation, springing, budding forth, or fruitfulness, unless there be a Green color.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Wherefore the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers call it their Bud, and their Water of Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or Putrefaction; and they say truth herein; for with its water it is putrefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and purified, and wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from its blackness, and made White.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. And afterwards it is made the higheft Red; whereby you may learn and understand, that no true Tincture is made but with our Brass, or Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>

XVII. The Philosophers have spoken of this under many Names, but know certainly, that it is but one matter which does cleave or joyn it self to <hi>Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> and to Bodies, which you shall have the true signs of: Now you must know what <hi>Argent Vive</hi> will <hi>cleave,</hi> or perfectly joyn and unite it self unto.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. That the <hi>Argent Vive</hi> will cleave, joyn, or unite it self to Bodies is false: And they err who think that they understand that place in <hi>Geber</hi> of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> where he saith, <hi>When in searching among other things, you shall not find by our Invention, any matter to be more agreeable to Nature, than</hi> Argent Vive <hi>of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. By <hi>Argent Vive</hi> in this place, is understood <hi>Argent Vive</hi> Philosophical; and it is that <hi>Argent Vive</hi> only which sticks to, and is fixed in, and with the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: The old Philosophers could find no other matter; nor can the Philosophers now, invent any other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or thing, which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with the Bodies, but this Philosophick <hi>Argent Vive</hi> only.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. That common <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> does not stick, or cleave to the Bodies, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by Experience, for if common <hi>Argent Vive</hi> be joyned to the Bodies, it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bides in its proper nature, or flys away, not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to transmute the Body into its own nature and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and therefore does not cleave unto them.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. For this cause, many are deceived in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the vulgar Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver: For our Stone, that is to say, our <hi>Argent Vive</hi> accidental, does exalt it self far above the most fine Gold, and does overcome it, and kill it, and then make it alive again.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. And this <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> is the Father of all the Wonderful things of this our Magistery, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, and is both Spirit
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:65913:446"/>
and Body: This is the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> which <hi>Geher</hi> speaks of, the consideration of which is of moment, for that it is the very matter which does make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. It is a chosen pure substance of <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> but out of what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is chiefly to be drawn, is a thing to be enquired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. To which we say, That it can only be drawn out of that matter in which it is: Consider therefore my Son, and see from whence that Substance is, taking that and nothing else: By no other Principle can you obtain this Magistery.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. Nor could the Philosophers ever find any other matter, which would continually abide the fire, but this only, which is of an Unctuous substance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and incombustible.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. And this matter, when it is prepared as it ought, will transmute, or change all Bodies of a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick substance, which it is rightly projected upon, into the most perfect <hi>Sol,</hi> or the most pure fine Gold; but most easily, and above all other Bodies <hi>Luna.</hi>

Decoct first with Wind or Air, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without Wind, until you have drawn forth the Venom [<hi>or Virtue</hi>] which is called the Soul, out of your matter; this is that which you seek, the everlasting <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> which cures all Diseases.

                           <hi>CHAP. XXXV.</hi> A farther Explication of this matter.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. OUR Medicine is made of 3 things, <hi>viz.</hi> of a Body, Soul, and Spirit. There are two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to wit <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna: Sol</hi> is a Tincture, where with imperfect Bodies are tinged into <hi>Sol;</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> tingeth into <hi>Luna;</hi> for nature brings forth only its like, a Man, a Man, a Horse, a Horse, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. We have named the Bodies which serve to this Work, which of some are called ferment; for as a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle leven levens the whole lump, so <hi>Luna</hi> and <hi>Sol, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Mercury</hi> as their Meal into their Nature and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. If it be demanded, Why <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> having a prefixed Tincture, do not yet tinge imperfect Metals? I Answer: A Child, tho' born of humane kind, acts not the Man; it must first be nourisht and bred up till it comes to Maturity: So is it with Metals also; they cannot shew their power and force, unless they be first reduced from their Terrestreity to a Spirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and nourisht and fed in their Tinctures through heat and humidity.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. For the Spirit is of the same matter and nature with our Medicine: We say our Medicines are of a siery nature, and much sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler, but of themselves, they cannot be subtil nor simple, but must be matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or ripened with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and penetrating things.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Earth of it self is not subtil, but may be made so through moist water, which is dissolving, and makes an

ingress for <hi>Sol,</hi> that it may penetrate the Earth, and with its heat make the Earth subtile; and in this way the Earth must be subtilized so long, till it be as subtil as a Spirit, which then is the Mercury, more dissolving than common water, and apt to dissolve the said Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and that through the heat of fire, to penetrate and subtilize them.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. There are several Spirits, as Mercury, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Orpiment, Arsenick, Antimony, Nitre, Sal-ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, Tutia, Marchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sits, &amp;c. but Mercury is a better Spirit than all others; for being put into the fire they are carried away, and we know not what becomes of them: But <hi>Mercury,</hi> as it is much subtiler, clearer, and penetrative, so it is joyned to the Metals, and changed into them, whereas the others burn and destroy them, making them more gross than they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Now Mercury is of such a subtil nature, that it transmutes Metals into sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and pure substances as it self is, and attracts them to its self: But no Metal can be transmuted by any of the other Spirits, but they burn it to Earth and Ashes: which Mercury it becomes impalpahle, and therefore is called <hi>Argent Vive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. We take nothing else to subtilize Metals, to make them penetrative, or to tinge other Metals: Some call it <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> or a Water, an Acetum, a Poyson, because it destroys imperfect Bodies, dividing them into several parts and forms; our Medicine is made of two things, <hi>viz.</hi> of Body and Spirit: And this is true, that all Metals have but one Root and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. But why cannot this Medicine be made of two compounded together? I Answer: It may be made of all these together; but they must be reduced into a Mercury, which would be difficult of the shortness of Man's Life: Therefore
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:65913:178"/>
we take the next matter, which are the two afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said things, <hi>viz.</hi> Body and Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Some Philosophers say, our Medicine is made of four things, and so it is: For in Metals, and their Spirits are the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Others say true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, That Metals must be turned into <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> Here many Learned and Wise Men err, and loose themselves in this path. Thus far of the matter of which our Medicine is made, or with which it is ioyned: Now of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. The Vessel ought to resemble the Firmament, to enclose and encompass the whole Work: For our Medicine is nothing else but a change of Elements one into another, which is done by the motion of the Firmament; for which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it must needs be round and circular.</p>

XV. Now in order to this Work, there is 1. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. 2. Separation. 3. Sublimation. 4. Fixation, or Congelation. 5. Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. 6. Ingression.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Dissolution</hi> is the changing of a dry thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a moist one, and belongs only to Bodies, as to <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> which serve for our Art: For a Spirit needs not to be dissolved, being a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid thing of it self; but Metals are gross and dry, and of a gross nature, and therefore must be subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. First, Because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they be subtilized through dissolution, they cannot be reduced into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and made to ascend through the Alembick, to be converted into Spirit, whose remaining foeces are reserved for a farther use.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Body and Spirit must be made indivisible and one: For no gross mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter joyns or mixes with a Spirit, unless it be first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized, and reduced into <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> then the one em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces the other insepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. For <hi>Argent Vive</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a thing like it self, rejoyceth in it; and the dissolved Body embraces the Spirit, and suffers it not to fly away, making it to endure the fire; and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces because it has found an equal, <hi>viz.</hi> one like it self, and of the same nature.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. Dissolution is thus done: Take Leaves of <hi>Sol,</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> to which add a good quantity of pure <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury;</hi> putting in the Leaves by little and little, into a Vessel placed in so gentle a heat, that the Mercury may not fume: when all is dissolved, and the Mass feems to be one Homogene body, you have done well: If there be any foeces, or matter undissolved, add more Mercury, till all seems to be melted together.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. Take the matter thus dissolved, set it in <hi>B. M.</hi> for 7 days, then let it cool: and strain all through a Cloth or Skin; if all goes through, the dissolution is
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:65913:179"/>
perfect; if not, you must begin again, and add more <hi>Mercury,</hi> so long till all be dissolved.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. <hi>Separation</hi> is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of a thing into parts, as of pure from impure. We take our dissolved matter, and put it into the smaller Vessel which stands in the Cucurbite, well luting to the Alembick, and seting it in Ashes, continuing the fire for a Week: One part of the Spirit sublimes, which we call the Spirit or Water, and is the subtilest part; the other which is not yet sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, sticks about the Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, and some of it falls as it were to the bottom, which is warm and moist, this we call the Air. And a third part remaining in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the inner Vessel, which is yet grosser, may be called the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. Each of these we put into a Vessel apart; but to the third we put more <hi>Mercury,</hi> and proceed as before, reserving always each principle or Element apart by it self, and thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, till nothing remains in the inner Vessel, but a black pouder, which we call the black Earth, and is the dregs of Metals, and the thing causing the obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Metals cannot be united with the Spirit; this black pouder is of no use.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. Having thus se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the four Elements from the Metals, or divided them, you may demand, What then is the fire, which is one of these four? To which I Answer: That the Fire and the Air are of one nature, and are mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and changed the one into the other; and in the dividing of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they have their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural force and power, as in the whole, so in the parts.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. We call that Air which remained in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Vessel, because it is more hot than moist, cold, or dry: The same under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand of the other Elements. Hence <hi>Plato</hi> saith, <hi>We turned the moist into dry, and the dry we made moist, and we turned</hi>

the Body into Water and Air.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. <hi>Sublimation</hi> is the ascending from below up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the subtil matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising, leaving the gross mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter still below, as he said before in the changing of the Elements: Thus the matter must be subtilized, which is not subtil enough, all which must be done through heat and moisture, <hi>viz.</hi> through Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. You must then take the thing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the greater Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and put it to other fresh <hi>Mercury,</hi> that it may be well dissolved and subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed: set it in <hi>B. M.</hi> for three days as before. We men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not the quantity of <hi>Mercury,</hi> but leave that to your discretion, taking as much as you need, that you may make it fusible, and clear like a Spirit. But you must not take too much of the <hi>Mercury,</hi> lest it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Sea; then you must set it again to sublime, as formerly, and do this Work so often, till you have brought it through the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lembick, and it be very sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, one united thing, clear, pure, and fusible.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. Then we put it again into the inner Vessel, and let it go once more through the Alembick, to see whether any thing be left behind; which if so, to the same we add more <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> till it becomes all one thing; and leaves no more sediment, and be separated from all its Impurity and Superfluity.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. Thus have we made out of two, one only thing, <hi>viz.</hi> out of Body and Spirit, one only congene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous substance, which is a Spirit and light; the Body, which before was heavy and fixed, ascending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, is become light and volatile, and a mere Spirit: Thus have we made a Spirit out of a Body, we must now make a Body out of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is the one thing.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. <hi>Fixation,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation,</hi> is the making the
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:65913:180"/>
flowing and volatile matter fixt, and able to endure the fire; and this is the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit into a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: We before turned the dryness and the Body, into moistness and a Spirit; now we must turn the Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Body, making that which ascended to stay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; that is, we must make it a thing fixed, according to the Sayings of the Philo sophers, reducing each E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement into its contrary, you will find what you seek after, <hi>viz.</hi> making a fixt thing to be volatile, and a volatile fixt; this can only be done through <hi>Congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by which we turn the Spirit into a Body.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. But how is this done? We take a little of the ferment, which is made of our Medicine be it <hi>Luna</hi> or <hi>Sol;</hi> as if you have 10 Ounces of the Medicine, you take but 1 Ounce of the ferment, which must be so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated; and this ferment we amalgamate with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which you had before prepared, the same we put into the Glass Vial with a long Neck, and set it in warm Ashes: Then to the said ferment, add the said Spirit which you drew through the Alembick, so much as may overtop it the height of 2 or 3 Inches; put to it a good fire for 3 days, then will the dissolved Body find its Companion, and they will embrace each other.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. Then the gross ferment, laying hold of the subtil ferment, attracts the same, joyns it self with it, and will not let it go; and the dissolved Body, which is now subtil, keeps the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for that they are of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual subtilty, and like one to another; and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so one and the same thing, that the fire can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to separate them any more.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. By this means you come to make one thing like another; the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becomes the abiding place of the subtil body, and the subtil body the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of the Spirit, that it may not fly away. Then

we make a Fire for a Week, more or less, till we see the matter congealed: which time is longer or shorter, according to the condition of the Vessel, Furnaces, and Fires you make use of.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. When you see the Matter <hi>Coagulated,</hi> put of the abovesaid Matter or Spirit to it, to over top it two or three inches, which digest as before, till it be coagulated also, and thus proceed, till all the Matter or Spirit be congealed. This Secret of the Congelation, the Philosophers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sealed in their Books, none of them that we know of having disclosed it, except only <hi>Larkalix,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed it in many <hi>Chapters;</hi> and also revealed it unto me, without any Reserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Deceipt.</p>
                        <p n="34">XXXIV. <hi>Calcination.</hi> We take the known Matter, and put it into a Vesica, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Head upon it, and luting it well, put it into a Sand Furnace, making a continued great Fire for a Week: then the Volatile ascends into the Alembeck, which we call <hi>Avis Herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis:</hi> that which remains in the bottom of the Glass, is like Ashes or sifted Earth, called, the Philosophers Earth, out of which they make their Foundation, and out of which they make their increase or aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, through heat and moisture.</p>
                        <p n="35">XXXV. This Earth is composed of four Elements, but are not contrary one to another, for their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety is changed to an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unto an homogene and uniform nature: Then we take the moist part, and reserve it a part to a farther use. This Earth, or Ashes, (which is a very fixed thing) we put into a very strong Earthen Pot or Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, to which we lute its Cover, and set it in a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cining Fornace, or Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratory, for 3 days, so that it may be always red hot: Thus we make of a Stone, a white Calx; and of things of an earthy and watery nature, a fiery na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For every Calx is of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:65913:181"/>
a fiery nature, which is hot and dry.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. We have brought things to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire; we must now further subtilize the four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements; we take apart, a small quantity of this Calx, <hi>viz.</hi> a fourth part: The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we set to dissolve with a good quantity of fresh Mercury, even as we had done formerly (in all the Processes of the aforego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paragraphs) and so proceed on from time to time, till it is wholly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
                        <p n="37">XXXVII. Now that you may change the fixt into a Volatile, that is, Fire into Water, know, that that which was of the nature of Fire, is now become the nature of Water; and the fixt thereby is made vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile and very subtil. Take of this water one part, put it to the reserved Calx; and add to it as much of the water, as may over top the <hi>Calx</hi> 2 or 3 Inches, making a fire under it for 3 days; thus it congeals sooner than at first, for <hi>Calx</hi> is hot and dry, and drinks up the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity greedily.</p>
                        <p n="38">XXXVIII. This <hi>Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> must be continued till all be quite congealed; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards you must calcine it as formerly; being quite calcined, it is called the quintessence, because it is of a more subtil nature than fire, and because of the Transmutation formerly made. All this being done our Medicine is finished, and nothing but <hi>Ingression</hi> is wanting, <hi>viz.</hi> that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may have an Ingress in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Imperfect Metals.</p>

                        <p n="40">XL. Seeing then that our Medicine transmutes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Metals into <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and form of the matter out of which it is made; therefore we now a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time say, That this our Medicine is of that nature, that it transmutes or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, converts, divides asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like fire, and is of a more subtil nature than fire, being of the nature of a quintessence as aforesaid, converting Mercury, which is an imperfect substance, into its own nature, turning the grossness of Metal into Dust and Ashes, as you see fire, which does not turn all things into its nature, but that which is homogene with it, turning the hetero gene matter into Ashes.</p>
                        <p n="41">XLI. We have taught how a Body is to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a Spirit; and again how the Spirit is to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Body, <hi>viz.</hi> how the fixed is made volatile, and the volatile fixed again: How the Earth is turned into Water and Air, and the Air into Fire, and the Fire into Earth again: Then the Earth into Fire, and the Fire into Air, and the Air into Water; and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again into Earth. Now the Earth which was of the nature of Fire, is brought to the nature of a quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
                        <p n="42">XLII. Thus we have taught the ways of transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, performed through heat and moisture; mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of a dry a moist thing, and out of a moist a dry one: otherwise Natures which are of several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, or Families, could not be brought to one uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thing, if the one should be turned into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers nature.</p>
                        <p n="43">XLIII. And this is the perfection of the matter according to the advice of the Philosopher: Ascend from the Earth into Heaven
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:65913:182"/>
and descend from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Earth; to the intent to make the body which is Earth, into a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is subtil, and then to reduce that Spirit into a Body again which is gross, changing one Element in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another, as Earth into Water, Water into Air, Air into Fire; and Fire again into Water, and Water in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Fire: and that into a more subtil Nature and quintescence. Thus have you accomplished the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the whole World.</p>
                        <p n="43">XLIII. <hi>Ingression.</hi> Take Sulphur Vive, Melt it in an Earthen Vessel well glazed, and put to it a strong Lye made of Calx vive and Pot Ashes: Boyl gently toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so will an Oyl swim on the top, which take and keep: Having enough of it, mix it with Sand, distil it through an Alembick or Retort, so long till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes incombustible. With this Oyl we imbibe Our Medicine, which will be like Soap, then we distil by an Alembick, and coho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate 3 or 4 times, adding more Oyl to it, if it be not imbibed enough.</p>
                        <p n="45">XLV. Being thus imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, put fire under it, that the moisture may Vanish, and the Medicine be fit and fusible, as the body of Glass. Then take the <hi>Avis Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metis</hi> before reserved, and put it to it Gradatim, till it all becomes perfectly fixt.</p>
                        <p n="46">XLVI. Now according to <hi>Avicen,</hi> it is not possible to convert or transmute Metals, unless they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their first Matter; then by the help of Art they are transmuted into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Metal.

                        <p n="2">2. My Dear Brother, if you intend to follow or study the Art of Alchymie, and work in it, let me give you warning, that you fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not the literal prescripts of <hi>Arnoldus</hi> nor <hi>Raymundus,</hi> nor indeed of most other Philosophers, for in all their Books they have delivered nothing but figuratively; so that Men not only loose their time, but their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney also.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. I my self have stud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died in these Books for more than 30 Years, and never could find out the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret or Mistery by them: But at length, through the goodness of God, I have found out one Tincture, which is good, true, and absolutely certain, and has restored to me my Credit and Reputation.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Now knowing (as I do) how much time you have lost, and what Wealth you have consumed, being touched with it, as a Friend; and in regard of our faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promise to each other in our beginning, to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate each of others For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, I have thought it fit, here to perswade you, not to loose your self any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the Books of the Philosophers, but to put you in the right way, which after long Wanderings I have found out, and now at this present, I on my Death-Bed bequeath you.</p>

V. I advise you to take nothing from it, nor add any thing to it; but to do just as I have set it down, and observe these following directions; so will you suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed and prosper in the work.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. First, Never work with a great Man, lest your life come into danger. 2. Let your Earthen Vessels be well made and strong, lest you lose your Medicine. 3. Learn to know all your Materials, that you be not cheated with that which is sophisticate and nothing worth. 4. Let your Fire be neither stronger nor soster, but what is fit, and just as I have here directed. 5. Let the Bellows and all the other Materials be your own. 6. Let no man come where you Work, and seem Ignorant to all such as shall enquire any thing of you touching the Secret. 7. Learn to know Metals well, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Gold and Silver; and put them not into the Work till they be first purified by your own hands, as fine as may be. 8. Reveal not this Secret to any one, but let this Writing be Buried with you, giving a confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed charge concerning the same to him you Trust. 9. Get a Servant that may be Trusty and Secret, and of a good Spirit, to attend you, but never leave him alone. 10. Lastly, when you have ended the Work, be Kind and Generous, Charitable to the Poor, publick Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and return your Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of Thanks to the Great and most Merciful God, the Giver of all good Things.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Take mineral Quick Silver three pounds (made neither of Lead nor Tin) and cause an Earthen Pot to be made, well burned the first time: glaze it all over except the bottom, the which anoint with hogs Grease, and it will not Glaze. This is done, that the Earth of the Quick Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver may sink to the bottom of the Pot, which it would not do, being glazed, nor become Earth again.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="329" facs="tcp:65913:184"/>
VIII. The Pot must be made a good foot long, of the Fashion of an Urinal, with a Pipe in the midst of it: The Fornace must be made on purpose, that the Pot may go in close to the sides of the Mouth of the Furnace: Set on the Pot a good great Cap or Head, with its Receiver, without Luting of it, give it a good fire of Coals, till the Pot be all on fire and very red; then take the fire out quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and put in the Quick Silver at the Pipe, and then with as much hast as you can, stop it close with Lute.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Then will the Quick Silver by the heat and force it finds, both Break and Work; a part thereof you shall see in the Water, as it were a few drops; and a part will stick to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Pot in black Earth: Now let the Pot cool within the Fornace, as it is, then open it, and you shall find the Quick Silver in it all Black, which you must take out, and wash ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clean, and the Pot also.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. As for the Water which does distil out, put it a side, or cast it away, for it is nothing worth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is all Flegm. Set the Pot into the Fornace again, and make it red hot; put in the Quick Silver lute well the Pipe, and do as you did the first time, and do this so often, until the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury becomes no more black, which will be in ten or eleven times.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Then take it out, and you shall find the Mercury to be without Flegm, but joyned with Earth, of which two Qualities it must be freed, being Enemies to Nature; thus the Quick Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will remain pure, in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor Caelestial like to Azure, which you may know by this sign, <hi>viz.</hi> Take a piece of Iron, heat it red hot, and quench it in this Mercury, and it will become soft and white, like Luna.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Then put the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury into a Retort of Glass, between two Cups, so that it touches neither bottom

nor sides of the Cups, and make a good fire under it, and lay Embers on the top, the better to keep the heat of the fire; and in Forty hours the Mercury will Distil into a slimy Water (hanging together) which will neither wet your Hands, nor any other thing, but Metals only.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. This is the true <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; the true Spirit so many have sought for, and which has been desired of all Wise Men, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Essence, Quintessence, Powers, Spirit, Substance, Water,</hi> and <hi>Mixture of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and by many other the like Names, without strange things, and without offence to any Man.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Save well this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Liquor or Water, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scured by all Philosophers, for without it you can do no good or perfect Work: Let all other things go, and keep this only; for any one that sees this Water, if he has any Practice or Knowledge, will hold to it, for it is Precious and worth a Treasure.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. Now resteth to make the <hi>Soul,</hi> which is the perfection of the <hi>Red,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which you can neither make <hi>Sol</hi> nor <hi>Luna,</hi> which shall be Pure and Perfect: With this Spirit you may make things Apparent and Fair, yea, most True and Perfect; all Philosophers affirm that the <hi>Soul</hi> is the substance, whichsustains and preserves the <hi>Body,</hi> making it Perfect as long as it is in it.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Our <hi>Body</hi> must have a <hi>Soul,</hi> otherwise it would neither move nor work; for which reason you must consider and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that all Metals are compounded of Mercury and Sulphur, Matter and Form; Mercury is the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Sulphur is the Form. According to the pureness of Mercury and Sulphur, such is the Influence they assume.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. Thus Sol is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of most pure fine Mercury, and a pure red
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:65913:185"/>
Sulphur, by the Influence of the Sun; and Luna is made of a pure fine Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and a pure white Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur by the Influence of the Moon.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Thence it is that Luna is more pure than the other five Metals, which have need of cleansing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleansed, they need but onely the pure Sulphur, with the help of Sol and Luna. <hi>Sulphur</hi> is the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and the other Metals; their other parts are gross matters of Sulphur and Mercury.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. Husband-Men know many times more than we do: They when they reap their Corn growing on the Earth, gather it with the Straw and Ears: The Straw and Ears are the Matter, but the Corn or Grain is the Form or Soul.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. Now when they sow their Corn, then they sow not the Matter, which is the Straw and the Chaff, but the <hi>Corn</hi> or <hi>Grain,</hi> which is the <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Soul:</hi> So if we will reap <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> we must use their <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Soul,</hi> and not the <hi>Matter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. The <hi>Form</hi> or <hi>Soul</hi> is made by Gods help, after this manner. You must make a good Sublimate, that is seven times sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the last time of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you must fublime it with Cinnaber without Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, and it will be a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Quintessence of the Sulphur of that Antimony.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. When this is done, take of the finest Sol one Ounce, or of the finest Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na as much, file it very fine, or else take leaf Gold or Silver; then take of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Sublimate four Ounces; sublime them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the space of Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours; then let it cool again, and mix them all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and sublime again: Do this four times, and the fourth time, it will have a certain Rundle, like unto the Matter of the White Rose, transparent and most clear as any Orient Pearl, weighing about five Ounces.</p>

XXIII. The sublimate will stick to the brims and sides of the Vessel, and in the bottom it will be like good black Pitch, which is the Corruption of Sol and Luna.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. Take the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle aforesaid, and dissolve it in most strong Spirit of Vinegar, two or three times, by puting it into an Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and seting it in B. M. for the space of three daies, every time pouring it into new Spirit of Vinegar, as at the first, till it be quite dissolved: Then distill it by a filter, and save that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the Pot, for it is good to whiten Brass.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV.

                        <p n="26">XXVI. Take an Urinal half a foot high, and take of the firm body five Ounces; of the Soul or Sulphur of Sol or Luna, a quarter of an Ounce; and of the Spirit four Ounces: Put all of them into the Urinal, and put on its head or Cover, with its Receiver well closed or Luted. Distil the Water from it, with a most soft Fire, and there will come off the first time, almost three Ounces.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. Put the Water. on again, without moving the Urinal, and distil it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, until no more liquor will distil, which do 6 or 7 times, and then every thing will be firm. Then set the same Urinal in Horse-dung seven days, and by the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and subtilty of the heat, it will be converted into water.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>PErfection</hi> and <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> of Metalline Bodies, is the Subject of this present discourse; and therefore we treat of things perfecting and corrupting, or destroying, because op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posites set near to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are the more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. That which perfects Imperfect Minerals, is a commixtion of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> in due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by a due and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate decoction in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of clean, inspissate, and fixed Earth, joyned with an incorruptible radical hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, whereby it is brought to a solid, fusible substance, with a conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fire and made maleable.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="336" facs="tcp:65913:188"/>
III. But Imperfect Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are made of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of pure <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> without due proportion, or a due de coction, in the bowels of unclean, not fully inspissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor fixed Earth, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a corrupting humi dity, whereby are brought forth Metals of a porous substance, and though fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not sufficiently, or so perfectly maleable as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Under the first defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, are concluded, <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> each according to their perfection: Under the second <hi>Saturn, Jupiter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> each ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: in which that which is manifest must be hidden, or taken away, and that which is hidden, must be made manifest and brought into operation, which is done by preparing them, by which, their Superstuities will be removed, and their defects, or imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on supplied, and the true perfection inserted into them.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. But the perfect Bodies, as <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> need none of this preparation, yet such a preparation they must have, as may subtilize their parts, and reduce them from a Corporality to a fixed Spirituality, that from thence may be made a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spiritual Body, in order to compleat the <hi>Great Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xir,</hi> whether <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Red.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. In both these, <hi>viz.</hi> the White and Red Elixirs, there is no other thing than <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> of which one cannot act, nor be without the other: It would be a foolish and vain thing to think to make this Great Elixir or Tincture, from any thing, in which it is not, this was never the intention of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, though they speak many things by similitude.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And because all Metalick Bodies are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> pure, or impure, by accident, and not innate in their first nature, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by convenient prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:65913:188"/>
'tis possible to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their impurity; the end of preparation is to take away Superfluities, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defects.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. For we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered the substance of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taline Bodies, perfect and imperfect, to be but one, <hi>viz. Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> which are pure and clean before their commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and by consideration and experience, we found the Corruption of Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies to be by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; but that being pre pared and cleansed from all their Superfluities, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and fugitive Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, we found them of greater brightness, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and purity, than the naturally perfect Metals not prepared, by which consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration we attained to the perfection of this Science.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The Imperfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have accidentally <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous Humidities,</hi> and <hi>a Combustible Sulphureity,</hi> with <hi>a Primary Blackness</hi> in them and corrupting them; to gether with <hi>an Unclean, Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent, Combustible, and very gross Earthiness,</hi> impedeing <hi>Ingress</hi> and <hi>Fusion:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it behoves us with arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial fire; by the help of purified Salts and Vinegars; to remove superfluous acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that the only radical substance of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> may remain; which may indeed be done by various ways and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, according as the <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xir</hi> requires.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. The general way of preparation is this. 1. With fire proportional, the whole superfluous and <hi>Corrupt humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> in its essence must be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated: and the subtil and <hi>burning Sulphureity</hi> removed, and this by <hi>Calcination.</hi> 2. The whole Corrupt sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of their superfluous <hi>burning humidity</hi> and <hi>black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> remaining in their <hi>calx,</hi> must be corroded with the following cleansed Salts and Vinegars, till the <hi>Calx</hi> be <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Red</hi> (according to the nature of the body) and is made clean, and pure from all Superfluity and Corruption: These <hi>Calxe</hi> are cleansed with the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Salts and Vinegars, by grinding, imbibing and washing. 3. The, whole <hi>

                              </gap> Earthiness,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible, gross Faeculency,</hi> must be taken away with the aforesaid things, not having Metallick Fusion, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing and grinding them together with the aforesaid <hi>Calx,</hi> depurated in the aforesaid manner: For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>these in the Fusion or Reduction of the <hi>Calx,</hi> will remain with themselves the said uncleanness and gross Earthiness, the Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining pure.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Being thus cleansed, it is Meliorated thus. First, This Purged and Reduced Body is again Calcined by Fire, with the Salts as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said. Secondly, Then with such of these as are Solutive, it must be Dissolved. For this Water is <hi>Our Stone, and Argent Vive</hi> of Argent Vive, and <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Sulphur, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the Spiritual Body, and subtilized or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated; which is Melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, by confirming the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemental Virtues in it, with other prepared things of its own kind, which, augment the <hi>Colour, Fixion Weight, Purity and Fusion,</hi> with all other things appertaining to the true Elixir.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. The Salts and Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars for this work are thus prepared and cleansed. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt,</hi> and <hi>Salt Gem,</hi> as also <hi>Sal Alcali,</hi> and <hi>Sandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> are cleansed by Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and then casting them into hot water to be Dissolved, which Solution being Filtred is to be coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by a gentle fire, then to be Calcined for a Day and a Night in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate fire, and so kept for use.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> is cleansed, by Grinding it with a preparation of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt cleansed, and then subliming it in an high Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Head, till it ascends all pure: then dissolving it in a Porphyrie in the open Air, if you would have it in a water, or otherwise keeping the sublimate in a Glass close stopt for use.</p>
                        <p n="14">
                           <hi>XIV.</hi> Roch Alums, or
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:65913:189"/>
                           <hi>Factitious, or other Alums,</hi> are cleansed, by putting them in an <hi>Alembick,</hi> and extracting their whole Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, which is of great use in this Art. The <hi>Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> remaining in the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, Dissolve on a Porphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, in a moist place, or in water, and then again extract, and keep it for use.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. <hi>Vitriol</hi> of all kinds is cleansed, by dissolving it in pure Vinegar, then Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling and Coagulating. Or first abstract its Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity over a gentle fire: the <hi>Faeces</hi> Caleine, and Dissolve <hi>per deliquium,</hi> or in their own water, filtre, and Coagulate (or if you please, the water,) and keep it for use.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Vinegars</hi> of what kind or how acute and sharp soever, are cleansed by subtilization, and their Virtues and Effects are Me liorated by Distillation. With these Salts and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negars, the imperfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be prepared, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, meliorated and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized, by the help of the Fire. <hi>Glass and Borax</hi> are pure, and need no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. Out of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Bodies we compose the <hi>Great Elixir,</hi> making One substance of many, yet so permanently fixed, that the strongest or great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est force of Fire cannot hurt it, or make it flie away, which will mix with Metals in Flux, and flow with them, and enter into them, and be permixed with the fixed substance which is in them, and be fixed with that in them which is incombustible; receiving no hurt by any thing which Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cannot be hurt by.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Hence we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Our Stone, to be age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating or Fruitful Spirit and Living water, which we name the <hi>Dry water,</hi> by Natural proportion cleansed and United with such Union, that its principles can never be separated one from another; to which two must be added, a third, (for shortning the work)
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:65913:190"/>
and that is one of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies attenuated, or subtilized.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. The generating or Fruitful Spirit, is White <hi>in Occulto,</hi> and Red and Black on either side, in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of this work: but in <hi>Manifesto,</hi> on both sides tending to Redness. And because the Earthy parts are throughly and in their least particles United with the Airy, Watery, and Fiery, so that in Resolution, no one of them can be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but each with all and every one is dissolved, by reason of the strong Union, which they have with each other in their said least par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, the <hi>Compositum</hi> is made one solid, uniform substance, the same in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Properties, and all other respects as that of Gold.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>SUlphur</hi> is a Fatness of the Earth, thickened by a temperate Decoction in the Mines of the Earth, until it be hardened and made dry, homogeneal, and of an Uniform sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance as to its parts. It cannot be Calcined, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great industry) but with much loss of its substance; nor can it be fixed unless it be first Calcined: but it may be mixed, and its flight in some measure hindred, and its Adustion repressed, and so the more easily Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. By <hi>Sulphur</hi> alone no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done, our work from it alone cannot be perfected, the Magistry would be prolonged even to desperation: but with its Compere [<hi>Arsenick</hi> for the White, and <hi>Antimony</hi> for the Red] a Tincture
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:65913:190"/>
is made, which gives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat weight to every of the Metals, cleanses and exalts them: and it is perfected with our Magistery, without which it performs to us none of these things, but either corrupts or blackens.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. He who knows how to commix and Unite it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micably with Bodies, knows one of the greatest Secrets of Nature, and one way to perfection: for there are many ways to that Elixir or Tincture. Whatsoever Body is Calcin'd with it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives weight: <hi>Copper</hi> from it assumes the likeness of <hi>Sol. Mercury</hi> sublimed with it becomes <hi>Cinnabar.</hi> All Bodies, except <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> are easily Calcin'd with it, but <hi>Sol</hi> most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The less Humidity any body has, the easier it is Calcin'd with <hi>Sulphur;</hi> it Illuminates every body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is Light, <hi>Alum,</hi> or <hi>Salt,</hi> and Tincture. It is difficulty Dissolved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its deficiency of Saline parts, but abounding with Oleaginous. It is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sublimed because of its Spirit, but if it be mixed with <hi>Venus,</hi> and United to it, it makes a wonderful Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olet Colour.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. That Sulphur is a Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earth appears from its easie Liquefaction, and Inflamability, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is inflamed but what is Oleaginous, or melts easily by Heat, but what has such a Nature: yet has it a perfecting mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Nature in it; but this middle substance, is not the cause of the perfection of <hi>Bodies,</hi> or of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> unless it be fixed: 'Tis true, its not easily made to fly; [this he means doubtless of its Spirit or Oyl;] yet it is not perfectly fixed: from whence it is evident, that <hi>Sulphur</hi> is not the whole perfection of the Magistery, but only a part thereof.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. <hi>Sulphur</hi> commixed with Bodies, burns, some more, others less; and some resist its combustion, and some not; by which may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be known the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:65913:191"/>
those Bodies which are wanting in perfection, tho' prepared for the great work. <hi>Sol</hi> is not easily to be burned by <hi>Sulphur:</hi> The next to this is <hi>Jupiter,</hi> then <hi>Luna,</hi> after that <hi>Saturn,</hi> then <hi>Venus,</hi> that is more easily burnt, which is farther distant from the Nature of the <hi>Perfect.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Also from what Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix the imperfect Body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded or was generated, it appears from the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Colours after Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion: Thus <hi>Luna</hi> obtains a black mixt with Azure: <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> a black mixt with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Redness: <hi>Saturn</hi> a dull black, with much Redness and a Livid Colour: <hi>Venus,</hi> a black with a Livid; if it be much burnt, if but a little, a pleasant Violet: <hi>Mars,</hi> a black dull Colour. But if Sulphur be commixt with <hi>Sol,</hi> he obtains an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense <hi>Citrine</hi> Colour.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd with Sulphur, being reduced, return into the Nature of their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Bodies, <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd and reduced, recedes its greater part: <hi>Saturn</hi> has sometimes a greater, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a lesser part destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> are both preserved, by a right and gentle Reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet they rather tend to another Body than their own, as <hi>Saturn</hi> into a dull Coloured [<hi>Regulus</hi> of] <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Jupiter</hi> into a bright Coloured [<hi>Regulus</hi> of] <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony. Venus</hi> is diminished in the Impressions of Fire in her reduction, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ponderous, augmented in weight, soft, of a dull <hi>Citrine</hi> Colour, partaking of blackness: And <hi>Mars</hi> is more diminished in the Impression of the Fire than <hi>Venus;</hi> by which things are found out, the Nature of all Bodies that are alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

Take</hi> the best Green Sulphur Vive, Grind it to a subtil Pouder, Boyl it in <hi>a Lixivium</hi> of Pot-Ashes and Quicklime, gathering from the Superficies its Oyliness, till it appears to be clear. Stir the whole with a Stick, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:65913:191"/>
decant the <hi>Lixivium</hi> with the pure parts of the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> leaving the more gross parts behind: let the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor cool, and pour upon it a fourth part of the quantity, of Spirit of Vinegar; so will a white Pouder precipitate, white as Milk, which dry with a gentle Heat, and keep for use.</p>

                           <hi>X. 2.

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>ARsenick,</hi> is also a fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Earth, as is afore declared of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, having an inflamable substance, and a subtil matter like to Sulphur; but it is diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified from Sulphur in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is easily made a
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:65913:192"/>
Tincture of <hi>Whiteness,</hi> but of <hi>Redness</hi> with great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; whereas Sulphur is easily made a Tincture of Redness, but of Whiteness, most difficultly.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> there is a Citrine and a Red, which are profitable in this art, but the other kinds not so: <hi>Arsenick</hi> is fixed as Sulphur, but the sublimation of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is best from the Calx of Metals: But neither Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur nor <hi>Arsenick,</hi> are the perfective matter of this Work, they not being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat to perfection, though they may be a help to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, as they may be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. The best kinds of <hi>Arsenick,</hi> are the Scissile, the Lucid, and Scaly.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. This Mineral also (like as Sulphur) has a perfecting middle Nature in it, which yet is not the cause of the perfection of Bodies, or of <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> unless it be fixed; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed, this Spirit is an agent of the White Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: What we have said of Sulphur in the former Chapter, at Sect. 5. may be understood here.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Because in <hi>Arsenick</hi> the Radix of its Minera, in the action of Nature, has many inflamable parts of it resolved, therefore the work of its separation is easie, this being the Tincture of Whiteness, as Sulphur is of Redness.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XL.</hi> Of the Alchymie of the Marchasite.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THE Marchasite is sublimed two ways, 1. Without Ignition. 2. With Ignition, because it has a two-fold substance, <hi>viz. One pure Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Argent Vive</hi> mortified. The first is profitable as <hi>Sulphur;</hi> the second as <hi>Argent Vive</hi> mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and moderately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. Therefore we take in this last, because by it we are excused from the former <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and the labour of mortifying it.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The intire way of the sublimation of this Mineral is, by grinding it to pouder, and putting it into an <hi>Aludel,</hi> subliming its Sulphur with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ignition; always and very often removing what is sublimed. Then aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the force of the fire into Ignition of the <hi>Aludel.</hi> The first sublimation must be made in a Vessel of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation, and so long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, till the Sulphur is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated; the process being successively and orderly continued, until it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest that it has lost all its Sulphur.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Which may be known thus: When its whole Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur shall be sublimed, you will see the colour thereof changed into a most pure White, mixt with a very clear, pleasant, and coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine colour: Also you may know it thus: Because if it has any Sulphur in it, it will burn and flame like Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; but what shall be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly sublimed after that sublimate, will neither be inflamed, nor shew any properties of Sulphur, but
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:65913:193"/>
of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> mortified, in the reiteration of sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. You must get a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, strong, well baked Earthen Vessel, about three foot high, but in breadth Diametrically no more than that a hand may commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously enter: The bottom of this Vessel, (which must be made so that it may be separated and conjoyned, must be made after the form of a plain wooden Dish, but very deep, <hi>viz.</hi> from its brim to the bottom about seven or eight Inches; from that place, or moveable bot tom to the head, the Vessel must be very thickly and accurately glazed within: Upon the head of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel must be fitted an <hi>Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> with a wide <hi>Beak</hi> or <hi>Nose:</hi> Joyn the bottom to the middle, with good te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacious lute (the Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site being within that bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom) then set on the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, and place it in a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, where you may give as strong fire, as for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Silver or Copper.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The top of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace must be fixed with a flat Hoop, or Ring of Iron, having a hole in its middle, fitted to the greatness of the Vessel, that the Vessel may stand fast within it: Then lute the junctures in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Vessel and the Fornace, lest the fire pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out there, should hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the adherency of the subliming flowers, leaving only four small holes, which may be opened or shut in the flat Ring or Hoop afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, through which Coals may be put in round about the sides of the Fornace: Likewise four other holes must be left under them, and between their spaces for the putting in of Coals, and six or eight lesser holes, proportionate to the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of ones little finger, which must never be shut, that thereby the fire may burn clear: Let these holes be just below the juncture of the Fornace, with the said Iron Hoop.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. That Fornace is of great heat, the sides of
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:65913:194"/>
which are to the height of two Cubits, and in the midst whereof is a Round, Grate, or Wheel filled full of very many small holes close to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, (wide below or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, but small above, or in the superior part,) and strongly annexed to the Fornace by luting, that the Ashes or Coals may the more freely fall away from them, and the said Grate be continually open for the more free reception of the air, which mightily aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the heat of the fire.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The Vessel is of the asoresaid length, that the Fumes ascending may find a cool place and adhere to the sides, otherwise was it short, the whole Vessels would be almost of an equal heat, whereby the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate would fly away, and be lost. It is also Glased well within, that the Fumes may not peirce its Pores and so be lost; but the Bottom which stands in the Fire is not to be Glazed, for that the Fire would melt it; nor unglazed would the matter go through it, for that the Fire makes it rather to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Now let your Fire be continued under your Vessel, till you know that the whole matter is ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into flowers, which you may prove by putting in a Rod of Earth well burned with a Hole in its end, through a Hole in the Head, about the bigness of ones little Finger, putting it down almost to the middle there, or nigh the matter from whence the sublimate is rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if any thing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends and adheres to the Hole in the Rod, the whole matter is not sublimed, but if not, the sublimation is ended.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. That the <hi>Marchasite</hi> consists of Sulphur and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> it is sufficiently evident; for if it be put into the fire, it is no sooner Red Hot, but it is Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and burns: also if mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Venus,</hi> it gives it the Whiteness of pure Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; so also if mixed with <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and in its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation it yields a Coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

                           <hi>CHAP. XLI.</hi> Of the Alchymie of Magnesia, Tutia, and other Minerals.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THE Sublimation of <hi>Magnesia</hi> and <hi>Tutia is</hi> the same with that of the <hi>Marchasite,</hi> for that they cannot be sublimed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ignition, having the same cause, the same Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and the same Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral method: likewise all imperfect Bodies, are subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the same order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any difference, except that the Bodies of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals must have a more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fire than the <hi>Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, Magnetia</hi> and <hi>Tutia:</hi> nor is there any diversity in Metaline sublimation save, that some need the addition of some other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to make them sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime or rise.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But in the sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Imperfect Metaline Bodies, no great quantity of the Body to be sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must be at once put into the bottom of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, because much Metaline substance, holds the parts faster, and hinders the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liming: also the bottom of the sublimatory should be
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:65913:195"/>
flat, not Concave, that the Body equally and thinly spread upon the bottom, may the more easily su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime in all its parts.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Such Bodies as need the admixtion of other sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, are <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> by reason of the slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their fusion: <hi>Venus</hi> needs <hi>Tutia;</hi> and <hi>Mars Arsenick,</hi> and with these they are easily sublimed, for that they well agree with them. Therefore their sublimation is to be made as in <hi>Tutia,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like things, and to be performed in the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order, as in the former Chapter.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Now <hi>Magnesia</hi> has a more Turbid and Fixed, and less inflamable Sulphur, and a more Earthy and fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> than the <hi>Marchasite,</hi> and therefore the more approximate to the Nature of <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. But <hi>Tutia</hi> is the fume of White Bodies; for the Fume of <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> adhering to the sides of the Fornaces where these Metals are wrought, does the same thing that <hi>Tutia</hi> does: and what a metalick Fume does not, without the admixtion of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Body, neither will this likewise do.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And by reason of its subtilty, it more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the profundity of a Metaline Body, and alters it more than it does its own Body, and adhears more in the Examen, as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience you may find: and whatever Bodies are altered by Sulphur of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive, will also neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be altered by this, because of their Unity in Nature.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. <hi>To prepare Tutia.</hi> Pouder it very fine, and put it into and <hi>Aludel</hi> and by strong Ignition, or help of vehement fire, cause the Flowers to ascend or su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime, so is it prepared for use. It is also dissolved in Spirit of Vinegar, having been first Calcin'd, and so it is also well prepared.</p>

VIII. Also it is certain, that many necessary things for our purpose, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from Imperfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which need yet a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preparation, as first <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse;</hi> which is thus prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Wash it in Spirit of Vinegar, and separate it from its more gross parts; and the Milk coagulate in the Sun, and it is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Spanish White, Tin, Putty, and Minium,</hi> are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by dissolving them in Spirit of Urine, and then filterating and coagulating in the Sun as before.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. <hi>Verdegrise</hi> is dissolved in Spirit of Vinegar, and rubified, being gently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, with the soft heat of a gentle fire; and then it is prepared, and made fit for the Work.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. <hi>Crocus Martis</hi> is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in Spirit of Vinegar, and filtred: This Red Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being congealed, yields an excellent <hi>Crocus</hi> fit for use.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. <hi>AEs Ustum,</hi> or Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per calcin'd, is to be ground to pouder, and washed with Spirit of Vinegar, after the same manner as we taught in the preparation of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruse: So in like manner <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharge</hi> of Gold and Silver: You may also dissolve these things again, and they will be purer: You may also use them either dissolved or congealed; this is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Investigation.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. TO prepare Lead. Set it in a Fornace of Calcination, stirring it while it is in Flux, with an Iron Spatula full of Holes, and drawing off the scum, till it be converted into a most fine pouder: Sift it, and set it in the Fire of Calcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till its fugitive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamable substance be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished: Then take out this Red Calx, imbibe, and grind it often with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt cleansed, Vitriol purified, and most sharp Vinegar, which are the things to be used for the <hi>Red;</hi> but for the <hi>White,</hi> Common Salt, Common Alum, and Vinegar.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Your matter must be often imbibed, dryed, and ground, till by the benefit of the aforesaid things, the uncleanness be totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: Then mix Glass therewith, and cause the pure body to descend, that descending (by means of a vehement heat) the pure body may be reduced.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Calcine it again with pure <hi>Sal Armoniack</hi> (as you do <hi>Jupiter</hi>) and most subtily grind and dissolve it by the way aforesaid, for this is the water of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> proportionally made, which we use in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Red Elixir.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>Lead</hi> is a Metalick Body, livid, earthy, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, mute, partaking of a little Whiteness, with much
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:65913:196"/>
paleness, refusing the Cine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritium, and Cement, easily extensible in all its dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, with small Compres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and very fusible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ignition. Yet some Men say, that Lead in its own Nature, is much appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximated to Gold; these judge of things, not as they are in themselves, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to sense, being void of Reason, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Truth.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. It has much of an Earthy substance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is washed, and by a Lavament converted into <hi>Tin,</hi> by which it appears, that <hi>Tin</hi> is more assimilated to the perfect. It is also by Calcination made <hi>Minium;</hi> and by hanging over the Vapour of Vinegar, it is made <hi>Ceruse.</hi> And tho it is not near to perfection, yet by our Art, we easily convert it into <hi>Silver,</hi> not keeping its Weight in trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation, but acquiring a new Weight, which it ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains by our Magistry. It is also the Tryal of Silver in the <hi>Cupel,</hi> as we shall hereafter shew.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. It differs not from <hi>Tin,</hi> after repeating its Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the reduction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, save, that it has a more uncleansubstance commixed of a more grose Sulphur, and Argent Vive, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur being more burning and adhaesive to the Argent Vive. It has a greater Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which appears by washing of it with Argent Vive; and more Faeculency comes from it by washing than from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and its first Calcination is easier per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed than in Tin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of its Earthiness: and because its foulness is not rectified as in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> by repeated Calcinations, it is a sign of greater impurity in its principles, and in its own Nature.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Its Sulphur is not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from it in fume, but is of a Citrine Colour, of much Yellowness, the like of which is remaining be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low at the bottom, which shews that it has much of a Combustible Sulphur in it, and because the Odour of
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:65913:197"/>
Sulphureity is not removed from it in a short time, it shews that it approaches to the Nature of fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and is Uniformly commixed with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Argent Vive. Therefore when the fume ascends, it ascends with the Sulphur not burning, whose property is to create Citri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And that the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of its not burning Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is more than in Tin, appears for that its whole Colour is changed into <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinity,</hi> in Calcination, but of <hi>Tin</hi> into <hi>White:</hi> Whence the cause appear why <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> in Calcination is more easily changed into a hard Body than <hi>Saturn:</hi> the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sulphureity being more easily removed from <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> than <hi>Saturn,</hi> one of the causes of its softness is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; whence (being Calcined) it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows it must be hardened: but <hi>Saturn,</hi> because it has both the causes of softness strongly conjoyned, <hi>viz.</hi> much burning Sulphur and much Argent Vive, it is not easily hardened.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Bodies having much Argent Vive, have much of Extension, but such as have little Argent Vive, have little Extension. Thus <hi>Jupiter</hi> is more easily and subtily extended than <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Saturn</hi> more easily than <hi>Venus. Venus</hi> more easily than <hi>Mars. Luna</hi> more subtily than <hi>Jupiter.</hi> And <hi>Sol</hi> more subtily than <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">X. The Cause of Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or hardening is fixed Argent Vive, or fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; but the cause of soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is Opposite.

XI. From hence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, That seeing Bodies of greatest perfection, con tain the greatest quantity of <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> Those Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies holding more of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> must needs be more approximate to the perfect — whence it follows, that Bodies of much Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureity, are Bodies of much Corruption.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. From hence it is e vident, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> is near to the <hi>perfect,</hi> seeing it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipates more of <hi>Perfection,</hi> but <hi>Saturn</hi> less; <hi>Venus</hi> yet: less, and <hi>Mars</hi> least of all. And as to the Medicines, compleating them, it is clear, that <hi>Venus</hi> is the most perfective of Medicine; <hi>Mars</hi> less, <hi>Jupiter</hi> yet less; and <hi>Saturn</hi> least of all.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Thus according to the diversity of Bodies, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Medicines are found out: A hard Body, that can endure Ignition re quires one Medicine; but the soft, that abides not Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition another; that one may be softned and attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in its profundity, and equalized in its substance; but the other hardned, and its occult parts inspissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. There are three degrees which the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies, chiefly <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi> must obtain, in order to perfection: First, Cleanness, or Brightness: Secondly, Hardness, or Densness, with Ignition in fusion. Thirdly, Fixation, by taking away their fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive substance.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. They are cleansed (<hi>viz. Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi>) in a threefold manner: 1. By Mundifying. 2. By Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Reduction: 5. By Solution. First, By things purifying they are cleansed two ways, either by reducing them into a <hi>Calx,</hi> or into the Nature of Bodies: reducing into a <hi>Calx,</hi> they are purified ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Salts,</hi> or <hi>Alum,</hi> or Glass: Thus, when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is Calcin'd, put upon its <hi>Calx,</hi> water of <hi>Alums,</hi> or <hi>Salts,</hi> or <hi>Glass</hi> mixed with it, and reduce it to a Body,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:65913:198"/>
which so often reiterate till they look purely clean: For seeing <hi>Alums, Salts,</hi> and <hi>Glass,</hi> are fused with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind of fusion than Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, therefore they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from them, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with themselves the earthy substance, the purity of the Bodies being only left.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Or thus. Let <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter</hi> be filed, and mix therewith Alums, Salts, and Glass, and then redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into a body, and this so often to be repeated till they be well cleansed: They are also cleansed by way of Lavement with <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> of which we have spoken before.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. <hi>The second way of cleansing</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Jupiter, <hi>by Calcination and Reduction</hi> with sufficient fire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are freed from a twofold corrupting sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, 1. One inflamable and fugitive. 2. Another earthy and faeculent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Fire elevates and consumes every fugitive sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. And by reduction the same fire, divides every substance of earth, with its proportion: See Sect. 1, 2, 3. above.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>The third way of cleansing</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Jupiter <hi>by Solution</hi> of their substance, and by reduction of that likewise, which is dissolved from them; for that <hi>solution</hi> reduced makes them more clean, than any other way or kind of preparation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, except that by <hi>Sublimation,</hi> to which this is equivalent.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. TO <hi>prepare</hi> Jupiter. Put it into a fit Vessel, in a Fornace of Calcination, and make a good Fusion, stirring the melted Metal with an Iron Spatula full of holes, drawing off the Scum as it arises, and again stirring the Body, and thus continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till the whole quantity is reduced to Pouder or Ashes. This Pouder sift, and replace it in the Fornace again in the same heat of Fire, stirring it often, for 24 hours, till its whole ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental and superfluous hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity is abolished with all its combustible and corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sulphur. Then often well wash it with common Salt cleansed, and Alum purified, and sharp Vinegar, and dry it in the Sun or Air. Grind it again, washing and drying it; doing this so long till by the acuity of the Salts, Alums, Vinegar, its whole humidity, blackness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness is taken away. This done, add Glass in fine Pouder to it, impaste the whole together, and with a sufficient Fire make it flow in a Crucible with a hole in its bottom, set with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another, so will the pure and clean Body descend, the whole Earthy and Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent substance remaining above with the Glass, Salts, and Alums; in which pure Body is an equal and perfect proportion <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:65913:200"/>
                           <hi>White Sulphur</hi> not burning. Then Calcine this pure Body with pure and clean <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> till it be in weight, equal or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout: being well and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly Calcined, Grind the whole well and long upon a Porphyrie, and set it in the open Air in a Cold moist place; or in a Glass Vessel in a Fornace of Solution, or in Horse-Dung, till the whole be dissolved, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the Salt if need be. This Water ought to be esteemed, for it is what we seek for in the whole.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>Tin</hi> is a Metallick Body, White, Livid, not pure, and a little sounding, partaking of little Earthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, possessing in its Root harshness, softness, easiness of Liquefaction without Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition not abiding the <hi>Cupel</hi> or <hi>Cement,</hi> but extensible un der the Hammer. Therefore <hi>Jupiter</hi> among Bodies dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished from perfection, is in the <hi>Radix</hi> of its Nature of affinity to <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> but more to <hi>Luna,</hi> and less to <hi>Sol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Jupiter,</hi> because it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives much whiteness from the <hi>Radix</hi> of its generation, it whitens all other Bodies which are not White, but it has a fault, that it breaks or makes brittle all other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, except <hi>Saturn</hi> and most pure <hi>Sol: Jupiter</hi> adheres much to <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and therefore does not easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede from them in the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Tryal by the <hi>Cupel.</hi> The Magistery of this Art, gives it a Tincture of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that shines in it with inestimable brightness: It is hardened and cleansed more easily than <hi>Saturn.</hi> He who knows how to take away its Vice of breaking, will suddenly reap the Fruit of his Labour with joy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it agrees so well with <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and will never be separated from them.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. In Calcining <hi>Tin,</hi> a Sulphureous stink arises, from its Sulphur not fixed; and tho it gives no flame, yet it is not fixed, for its not flaming is by reason of the great abundancy of
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:65913:200"/>
its <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Combustion: So that in <hi>Tin</hi> is a two-fold <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and a two-fold <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive:</hi> one Sulphur less fixed, sending forth a stink; the other more fixed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it abides with the <hi>Calx</hi> in the Fire and stinks not.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. there is also a twofold substance of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> in it, one not fixed, and the other sixed: because it makes a Crashing noise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its Calcination, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has been thrice Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that Crashing ceases, which is caused by its fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argent Vive being flown away. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Lead being wash't with Argent Vive, and then melted in a very gentle fire, some part of the <hi>Mercury</hi> will remain with the Lead, and will give to it this stridor, converting the <hi>Lead</hi> into <hi>Tin.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. On the contrary al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, <hi>Tin</hi> may be converted into <hi>Lead:</hi> For by a mani fold repetition of its Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a fire fit for its reduction, it is turned into <hi>Lead;</hi> but especially when by subtraction of its <hi>Scoria,</hi> it is calcin'd with a great fire.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Now after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of these two Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>viz. Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Argent Vive</hi> from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> you will find that it is livid, and weighty as <hi>Lead,</hi> yet partaking of greater white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness than Lead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more pure than Lead: In which is the equality of fixation, of the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding things, <hi>viz. Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> but not the equality of quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, because in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion, the <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> is super-eminent.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Now if there were not in its proper nature a greater quantity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> than of <hi>Sulphur, Argent Vive</hi> would not easily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son it adheres with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>Venus;</hi> but with much greater difficulty to <hi>Mars,</hi> by reason of the small quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein; the sign of which, is the easie fusion of the one, and the difficult fusion of the other.</p>

IX. But the fixation of these two substances re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, approaches nigh to firm fixation, yet is it not absolutely fixed, which is evident from the calcinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its body, and after calcination, the exposing the same to the most strong fire; for by that, division is not made, but the whole substance ascends, yet more purified, from whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the burning Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur in <hi>Tin,</hi> is more easily separated than that in Lead: And, that, because its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting Properties are not radical, but accidental, therefore they are the more easily separated, and its mundification, Induration, and fixation, the more speedy.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And because, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Calcination</hi> and <hi>Reduction,</hi> we found in its fume a <hi>citrinity,</hi> through the great force of fire; we judged, that it contained in its body much <hi>sixed Sulphur:</hi> By these Operations you may find out the Principles of Bodies, and the Properties of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. At Sect. 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. of the former Chapter, we have shewn the farther prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Tin,</hi> which because they are so plainly expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there, are needless to be again repeated here. Yet there are other special Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations which are the following, to wit, <hi>by Calci nation,</hi> by which its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is more hardened, which happens not to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi> Also, <hi>by Alums,</hi> for these properly harden <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter.</hi> Also, <hi>by Conservation</hi> of it in the fire of its Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, for by this it loose its <hi>stridor</hi> or Crashing, and fraction of bodies likewise, the which in like manner happens not to <hi>Saturn.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Calcine <hi>Jupiter</hi> (as <hi>Saturn</hi> at Sect. 21. of the former Chapter with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt purified) and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten its Calx for three days as in Saturn: But see you err not in its Reduction, for that is difficult unless it be made in the Fornace, by <hi>Cineritium</hi> or <hi>Cement;</hi> then it is done with ease. But
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:65913:201"/>
that you may not err, joyn that Body which you would reduce, in equal parts with that by which you make the reduction, and co-unite the divided Calx: But in Tinctures there is another consideration, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer tinging must be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied upon the matter to be tinged, till the Tincture appear in the <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</hi>

                        <p n="1">I. TO prepare <hi>Mars</hi> or Iron. <hi>Calcine it as</hi> Venus <hi>with common Salt cleansed, and let it he washed with pure Vinegar: Being washed, dry it in the Sun, and when dried, grind and imbibe it with new Salt and Vinegar, and put it into the same For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> (as we shall direct in <hi>Venus</hi>) <hi>for</hi> 3 <hi>days.</hi> Esteem and value this Solution, <hi>viz.</hi> The water of fixed Sulphur, wonderfully augmenting the color of the Elixir.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The whole Secret of <hi>Mars</hi> is from the Work of Nature, because it is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talick body, very livid, a little Red, partaking of Whiteness, not pure, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining Ignition, fusible with violent fire, extensive under the Hammer, and sounding much.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. It is hard to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by reason of its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of fusion; which if it be made to flow by a Medicine changing its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is so conjoyned to <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> that it cannot be separated by examen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great Industry; but if prepared, it is conjoyned, and cannot be separated by
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:65913:203"/>
any Artisice, if the nature of that fixation be not chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by it, the defilement of the <hi>Mars</hi> being only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. Therefore it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily a <hi>Tincture of Redness;</hi> but difficultly of <hi>Whiteness.</hi> And when it is conjoyned, it is not altred, nor does it change the colour of the commixtion, but augments it in quantity.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Among all Bodies <hi>Jupiter</hi> is more splendidly, more clearly, more bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and more perfectly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted into a Solar or Lunar Body, than other Bodies, but the Work is of long la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, though easie to be handled: Next to <hi>Jupiter</hi> is <hi>Venus</hi> chosen, of more difficult handling, but of shorter labour than <hi>Jupiter.</hi> Next after <hi>Venus</hi> comes <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> which has a diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perfection in Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is easie to be hand led, but of most tedious labour. Lastly, <hi>Mars</hi> among all the Bodies of least per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, is in <hi>transmutation,</hi> most difficult to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and of exceeding long labour.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult any Bodies are of fusion, the more difficult they are in handling in the Work of <hi>Transmutation:</hi> the easier to be fused, the easier to be handled: and what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of perfections are found in any particular, in the lesser, or middle Works; yet in the Great Work all Bodies are of one perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but not all of a like easie handling or labour.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Hence it appears, that <hi>Mars</hi> or Iron, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of fixed Earthy Sulphur, with fixed earthy <hi>Argent Vive</hi> of a livid white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, the highly fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur predominating, which prohibits fusion: Whence it is evident, that fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur hinders fusion more than fixed <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> But <hi>Sulphur</hi> not fixed, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens fusion more than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> By which the cause of speedy or slow fusion in every body is seen.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. What has more of a fixed Sulphur is harder to
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:65913:204"/>
fuse, than what partakes of a burning fugitive Sulphur; which appears because Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur cannot be fixed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Calcination, and no Calx gives fusion, therefore in all things it, <hi>viz.</hi> fixt Sulphur, must impede the same.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The causes of the corruption of the Metals by fire, are, 1. The inclusion of a burning Sulphur in the profundity of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, diminishing them by Inflammation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminating into <hi>Fume,</hi> whatever fixed <hi>Argent Vive</hi> was in them. 2. A Vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of the Exterior flame, penetrating, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving them, with it self into <hi>Fume,</hi> and the most fixed matter in them. 3. The rarefaction of them by calcination, the flame or fire, penetrating into, and exterminating them. Where all these causes of Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concur, those Bodies must be exceedingly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Where they all concur not, they are by so much the less corrupted.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The causes of the goodness of Bodies, is their abounding with <hi>Argent Vive.</hi> For seeing <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> for no cause of Extermination, will be divided into parts in its composition (because it either with its whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance flies from the fire, or with its whole substance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains permanent in it;) it is necessarily concluded to be a cause of Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Therefore Praised and Blessed be the most Glorious and High God, who created it, and gave it a Substance and Properties, which nothing else in the World does possess besides; that this perfection might be found in it, (by the help of Art) as we have found therein with great power. For it is that which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>Fire,</hi> and by <hi>Fire</hi> cannot be overcome, but in it amicably rests, and rejoyces therein.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. <hi>Mars</hi> is prepared ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with sublimation, or without sublimation, with sublimation we endeavour
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:65913:204"/>
to unite it with <hi>Arsenick</hi> not fixed, as profoundly as we can, that in fusion it may melt with the same; but afterwards it is sublimed in a proper Vessel of sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the which is the best and most perfect of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preparations. <hi>Mars</hi> is also prepared, by <hi>Arsenick</hi> oftentimes sublimed from it, until some quantity of the <hi>Arsenick</hi> it self remain: For if this be reduced, it will flow out white, clean, fusible, and well prepared: <hi>Mars</hi> is also prepared by fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it with <hi>Lead</hi> and <hi>Tutia,</hi> for from these it flows clean and white.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. <hi>To Indurate or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den soft Bodies. Argent Vive</hi> precipitated must be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and the calcin'd Body (which you have a design to harden) dissolved like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise: mix both these solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together, and the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd body mixed with them by frequent imbibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp;c. continually grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, imbibing, calcining and reducing, until it be made hard and fusible with Igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The very same may also be compleatly effected, with the <hi>Calx of Bodies,</hi> and <hi>Tutia,</hi> and <hi>Marchasite,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, dissolved, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed. The more clean these are, the more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly do they change.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. <hi>To soften hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as</hi> Mars, &amp;c. They must be conjoyned and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed often with <hi>Arsenick,</hi> and after sublimation of the <hi>Arsenick,</hi> assated, or calcined with their due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of fire, the measure of which we shall declare in our Discourse of Forna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Lastly, They must be reduced with the force of their proper fire, until in fusion they grow soft, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degree of the hardness of their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. All these alterations are of the first Order, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which our Magistery is not perfected.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Medicines dealbat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Mars, <hi>of the first Order.</hi> That which dealbates it, of the first Order, is that which makes it to flow: The special fusive of it is <hi>Arsenick</hi> of every kind: But
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:65913:205"/>
with whatsoever it is deal bated and fused, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary it be conjoyned and washed with <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> until all its impurity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and it be white and fusible.

                        <p n="15">XV. Or thus: Calcine <hi>Mars,</hi> and wash away from it all its soluble Aluminosity (inferring corruption) by the way of solution, but now mentioned [with <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi>] then let cleansed <hi>Arsenick</hi> be sublimed from it, and reiterate that subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation many times, until some part of the <hi>Arsenick</hi> be fixed therewith.

Lay thin Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Plates</hi> stratum superstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum <hi>with Common Salt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, till the Vessel be full, which cover, firmly Lute, and calcine in a fit Fornace for</hi> 24 <hi>hours: Then take it out, scrape off what is calcined, and repeat the calcination of the Plates with new Salt as before, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the Calcination so often till all the Plates are consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</hi> For the Salt corrodes the superfluous humidity, and combustible sulphurei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and the fire elevates the fugitive and inflamable sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance with due proportion. <hi>This Calx grind to a most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til pouder, wash it with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, till water will come from it free from blackness.</hi> Again, <hi>

                              </gap> it with more Salt and Vinagar, and grind, and then calcine again in an open Vessel for</hi> 3 <hi>days and nights: Take it out, grind it subtily and long, and wash it with Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, till it is cleansed from all uncleanness. This done, dry it in the Sun: Add to it half its weight of</hi> Sal Armoniack, <hi>grinding it long, to an impal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable substance: Then expose it to the Air, or set it in Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung to be dissolved: To what is undissolved add a new, clean</hi> Sal Armoniack; <hi>thus conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing till the whole be made water.</hi> Esteem and value this water, which we call the water of fixed Sulphur, with which the Elixir is tinged to infinity.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. <hi>Venus</hi> is a Metalick Body, livid, pertaking of a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:65913:206"/>
dusky redness, subject to ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, fusible, extensible under the Hammer, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing the Cupel and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is in the profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its substance of the color and essence of Gold, and is hammered being red hot, as Silver and Gold is. It is the medium of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and easily converts it nature to either, being of good conversion, and of little labour.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. It agrees very well with <hi>Tutia,</hi> which citrinizes it with a good yellow, from whence you may reap pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: we need not labour to indurate it, or make it ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitible, therefore it is to be chosen before other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies, in <hi>the lesser and middle Work,</hi> but not in the greater. Yet this has a Vice beyond <hi>Jupiter,</hi> that it easily grows livid, and receives foulness from sharp things, to erradicate which, is not an easie, but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Art.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>Copper</hi> therefore is unclean <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> mixed with <hi>Sulphur</hi> unclean, gross, and fixed, as to its greater part; but as to its lesser part, not fixed, red, and livid, in relation to the whole, not overcoming nor overcome. Its volatile Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is evident from its sulphurous fume, and loss of quantity by frequent fluxing and combustion. Itt fixt Sulphur is evident from its slowness of fusion, and induration of its substance. And that there is an unclean red Sulphur joyned with unclean <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent even to the senses.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. When the fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur comes to fixation by heat of Fire, its parts are subtilized; but that part which is in the aptitude of solution of its substance is dissolved; the sign of which is the exposing it to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of Vinegar, which makes the Aluminosity of its Sulphur flow in its Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies. And being put into a saline liquor, many parts of it are easily dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Ebulition; this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminosity by a saline wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triness, and easie solution, is changed into water: For
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:65913:207"/>
nothing is <hi>watery,</hi> and easily soluble, except <hi>Alum,</hi> and what is of its nature. This understand also of the body os <hi>Iron.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But the blackness in either <hi>Venus</hi> or <hi>Mars,</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Fire, is by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Sulphur not fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (much indeed in <hi>Venus,</hi> but little in <hi>Mars</hi>) and it approaches nigh to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fixed Sulphur. Hence it is evident, that fusion is helped, and partly made by Sulphur not fixed, but hindred from Sulphur fixed. This he certainly knew to be true, who by no art of fusion could make Sulphur to flow after its fixation: But having fixed <hi>Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> by frequently repeating the sublimation thereof, found it apt to admit good fusion.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Hence it is evident that those Bodies are of greater perfection, which contain more of <hi>Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> those of lesser perfection which contain lesser. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore study in all your Works to make <hi>Argent Vive</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the Commixtion. And if you could perfect by <hi>Argent Vive</hi> only, you would have attained to the <hi>highest perfection,</hi> even the <hi>perfection</hi> of that which overcomes the Works of Nature: For you may cleanse it most inwardly, to which purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nature cannot reach.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. This is manifest; for that those Bodies which contain a greater quantity of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> should be of greater perfection, arises from their easie reception of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> into their substance: and we see Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of perfection amicably to embrace each other.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Out of what has been said it is also apparent, that in Bodies there is a two fold sulphureity: One indeed included in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of <hi>Argent Vive.</hi> in the begining of their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: The other superveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from other Accidents. The one of them may be removed with labour; but the other cannot possibly be taken away by any Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sice or Operation of the
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:65913:207"/>
Fire, to which we can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably come, it being so firmly and radically united therein. And this is proved by experiment; for we see the aductible sulphureity to be abolished or destroyed by fire, but the fixed sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureity not so.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Therefore when we say, Bodies are cleansed by Calcination, understand that to be meant of the earthy substance, which is not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to the Radix of their nature: For it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Art, or force of fire, to cleanse or separate what is united, unless the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Now the separation of an earthy substance from its compound, which in the root of nature is united to a Metal, is this: Either it is made by <hi>elevation,</hi> with things <hi>elevating</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and leaving the sulphureity, by reason of its conveniency, with them: of which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are <hi>Tutia</hi> and <hi>Marcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site;</hi> because they are <hi>Fumes,</hi> part of which has a greater quantity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> than of <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. The proof of this you may see, when you joyn those things with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in a strong and sudden fusion, for these Spirits in their flight, carry up the Bodies with them; and therefore you may elevate them with them. Or else, by a Lavation or Commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> as we have already said: For <hi>Argent Vive</hi> holds what is of its own nature, but casts out what is alien or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. <hi>The preparation of Venus.</hi> It is manifold; one by <hi>Elevation,</hi> another <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Elevation.</hi> The way <hi>by Elevation</hi> is, that <hi>Tutia</hi> be taken (with which <hi>Venus</hi> well agrees) and that it be ingeniously united there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with: Then put it into a Vessel of sublimation to be sublimed; and by a most exceeding degree of Fire, its most subtil part will be ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, which will be of most bright splendor. Or,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:65913:208"/>
it may be mixed with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and then elevated by sublimation.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. But without subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it is prepared ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by cleansing things in its <hi>Calx,</hi> or in its <hi>Body:</hi> As by <hi>Tutia, Salts,</hi> and <hi>Alums:</hi> Or, by a Lavament of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> as all other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies are.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. <hi>The Preparation, or Purgation of</hi> Venus, also is two-fold, <hi>viz. one for the White,</hi> and <hi>the other for the red; for the White it is thus.</hi> Take Venus <hi>calcin'd by fire only</hi> (as aforesaid) <hi>ground fine</hi> 1 <hi>pound:</hi> Arsenick <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> 4 <hi>ounces: Grind them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and imbibe the mixture</hi> 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>times with water of</hi> Litharge, <hi>and reduce the whole with</hi> Sal Nitre, <hi>and Oyl of</hi> Tartar, <hi>and you will find the Body of</hi> Venus <hi>white and splendid, and fit for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving its Medicine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. The Preparation for the Red. Take <hi>filings of</hi> Venus 1 <hi>pound,</hi> Sulphur 4 <hi>ounces, grind them together: Or cement, Plates of Copper with</hi> Sulphur, <hi>and so calcine: wash the calcin'd with water of</hi> Salt <hi>and</hi> Alum; <hi>and then with things reducing, reduce it into a body, clean and fit for the reception of the Red Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture.</hi>

                        <p n="19">XIX. <hi>Medicines dealbating Venus, of the first Order.</hi> There is one Medicine for Bodies, and another for <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and of Bodies; one is of the first Order; another of the second; and another of the third: and so likewise the first, second, and third, of <hi>Argent Vive.</hi> Of the Medicine of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the first Order, we say there is one of hard Bodies, and one of soft: of hard Bodies, there is one of <hi>Mars</hi> (of which in the former Chapter) one for <hi>Venus,</hi> of which in this place; and one for <hi>Luna</hi> (of which in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) Of soft Bodies, there is one for <hi>Saturn,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for <hi>Jupiter.</hi> That of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> is the pure dealbation of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but that of <hi>Luna</hi> the rubification of it, with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinity of a pleasing bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which rubification is not given to <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> by Medicines of the first Order: For being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unclean, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt to receive the splendor of redness, before they are fitted with a preparation inducing brightness. There is one Medicine whitening <hi>Venus</hi> by <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and another by <hi>Arsenick.</hi> The Medicine of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is thus made. <hi>First,</hi> Argent Vive <hi>precipitated, is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; then calcined</hi> Venus <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved likewise: These soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are mixed and after they are coagulated, they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected upon the Body of</hi> Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. <hi>Another way by</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive. <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Litharge</hi> are dissolved a part, and the solutions joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together. <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Venus</hi> also is dissolved, and that solution joyned with the former, and then coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted together, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected upon <hi>Venus</hi> whitens it. <hi>Or thus.</hi> A quantity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is sublimed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from its body, till part
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:65913:209"/>
thereof remain with it, with compleat ignition: and this mixture is very often imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and ground with Spirit of Vinegar, that it may the better be mixed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity thereof, then it is assated, or moderately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined, and lastly fresh <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> is in like manner sublimed from it, and the remaining matter again im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, and moderately cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined as before, which work is so often to be repeated, till a large quantity of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> reside in it, with compleat ignition. This is a good dealbation of the first Order.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. <hi>Another way thus. Argent Vive</hi> in its proper na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so often sublimed from <hi>Argent Vive precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> till in it, the same is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and admits good fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This fused matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected upon the Body of <hi>Venus</hi> peculiarly whitens it. <hi>Or thus.</hi> A Solution of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> mixt with a solution of <hi>Litharge,</hi> coagulated, may be projected upon <hi>Venus;</hi> but is indeed better whiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed if <hi>Argent Vive</hi> be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in all the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                        <p n="22">
                           <hi>XXII. The whitening of</hi> Venus <hi>with</hi> Arsenick <hi>of the first Order. Take</hi> Calx of <hi>Venus,</hi> from it sublime <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> by many Repetitions, till it remains therewith and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens it; but if you be not well skilled in the ways of subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the <hi>Arsenick</hi> will not persevere in it without altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Therefore, after the first degree of sublimation, repeat the work in the same manner as in the sublimation of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasite. <hi>Chap. 40. Sect. 2.10. Or thus.</hi> Project <hi>Arsenick</hi> sublimed upon <hi>Luna,</hi> and then the whole upon <hi>Venus,</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>albates it peculiarly: <hi>Or,</hi> first mix <hi>Litharge,</hi> or burnt <hi>Lead,</hi> dissolved with <hi>Luna,</hi> and cast these upon <hi>Arsenick,</hi> and project the whole upon <hi>Venus,</hi> so will it be whitened; <hi>and this is a good dealbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the first Order.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="23">
                           <hi>XXIII. Another way thus.</hi> Upon <hi>Litharge</hi> alone dissolved and reduced, project <hi>Arsenick</hi> sublimed, and the whole upon <hi>Venus</hi> in flux, it whitens the same admirably,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:65913:209"/>
Or thus. <hi>Let</hi> Venus <hi>and</hi> Luna <hi>be commixed, and upon them project any of the above descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed dealbative Medicines:</hi> For <hi>Luna</hi> is more friendly to <hi>Arsenick,</hi> than to any of the other Bodies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore takes away fraction from it; and <hi>Saturn</hi> secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily, and therefore we mix it with them. Also we melt <hi>Arsenick</hi> sublimed, that it may be all in a Lump, which being broken, we project piece after piece upon <hi>Venus:</hi> We do it in <hi>pieces,</hi> rather than in <hi>pouder,</hi> because the <hi>pouder</hi> is more easily inflamed, than a Lump, and so more easily Vanishes, before it can fall fiery hot upon the body.</p>
                        <p n="24">XIV. In like manner, the Redness is taken away from <hi>Venus,</hi> and it is whitened with <hi>Tutia:</hi> But <hi>Tutia</hi> suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces not, because it gives on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Citrine colour; which is yet of affinity to White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Any kind of <hi>Tutia</hi> is calcined and dissolved; and the Calx of <hi>Venus</hi> also: These Solutions are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned, and with them the Body of <hi>Venus</hi> is citrinated. If you be well skill'd in this Work, you will find profit. <hi>Or thus. Take</hi> Marchasite sublimed, <hi>and proceed with it as with</hi> Argent Vive sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>the way is the same, and it whitens well.</hi>

                        <p n="2">II. It is a metalick Body, white, which pure white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, clean, hard, sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, very durable in the Cupel, extensible under the Hammer, and fusible. It is the Tincture of whiteness, hardens Tin by Artifice, and converts it to it self; and being mixed with <hi>Sol,</hi> it breaks not, but in the examination, it perseveres without Artifice.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. He who knows how to subtilize it, and then to inspissate and fix it associa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Gold, brings it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such a State, that it will remain with <hi>Sol</hi> in the Test, and be in no wise separated from it, being put over the fumes of sharp things, as Vinegar A. F. or Salarmoniack, and it will be of a wonderful Caelestine Color: It is a noble Body, but wants of the Nobility of <hi>Sol,</hi> and its <hi>Minera</hi> is found determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; but it has often a <hi>Minera</hi> confused with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies, which Silver is not so Noble. It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise dissolved and Calcin'd with great Labor, and no Profit.</p>

                           <pb n="384" facs="tcp:65913:212"/>
IV. If therefore clean, fixed, Red and clear Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, fall upon the pure substance of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> thereof is made pure Gold; then in like manner, if clean, fixed, white and clear Sulphur, falls upon the substance of <hi>Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> there is made pure Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, if in quantity it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not: yet this has a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity short of the purity of Gold, and a more gross in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spissation than Gold hath; the sign of which is, that its parts are not so condensed, as that it can be equal in Weight with Gold, nor has it so fixed a substance as that; which is known by its diminution in the Fire; and the Sulphur of it, which is neither fixed nor incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible, is the cause of that diminution.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. But it is not impossible or improbable to give Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same, as fixed and not fixed, in the respect of one Body to another: for the Sulphur of <hi>Luna</hi> compared with the Sulphur of <hi>Sol,</hi> is not fixed and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but in respect of the Sulphur of other bodies, it is fixed and not burning.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. <hi>The Citrinating of</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>by medicines of the first Order:</hi> This is that which adheres to it in its profon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and adding color ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by its proper Nature, or by the Artifice of this Magistery. We declare therefore that Medicine which arising from its own root, adhers to it; but there are Artifices by which we make a thing of every kind to adhere with firm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress. But Our Medicine we extract either from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> or a commixture of both: from Sulphur less perfectly; but from <hi>Argent Vive</hi> more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. This Medicine may also be made of certain mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral things, which are not of this kind; as of <hi>Vitrol,</hi> and <hi>Copperas,</hi> (which is called the Gum of Copper.)</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. <hi>The method by</hi> Argent Vive. Take <hi>Argent Vive</hi> precipitated, <hi>viz.</hi> mortified and fixed by precipitation, put it into a Fornace of

Then dissolve a part of</hi> Luna, <hi>mix the Solutions, and coagulate them, and project the coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated matter upon</hi> Luna <hi>in flux, and it will colour it with a peculiar Citrinity. But if</hi> Argent Vive <hi>be in its preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation Red, the aforesaid Administration, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of any thing tinging it, is sufficient for the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its perfection.</hi>

the remainder, and when it is fixed, dissolve what is soluble of it; but what is not soluble, put to be calcined, and again dissolve the calcinate, until a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain what is soluble of it be altogether dissolved.

                        <p n="1">I. PErfect Bodies (as <hi>Sol</hi> is) need no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in relation to their farther perfection; but that they may be more subtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and attenuated, we give you this Preparation. <hi>Take Leaves of fine</hi> Sol, <hi>which lay</hi> stratum superstratum, <hi>with common Salt well prepared, in a Vessel of Calcination: Set it into a Fornace, and calcine well for</hi> 3 <hi>days, until the whole be subtily calcined: Then take it, grind it well, wash it with Vinegar</hi> [<hi>Quaer.</hi> Whether Spirit of Vinegar, or some other acid Spirit?] <hi>and dry it in the Sun: Then grind it well with half its weight of prepared or purified</hi> Sal Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniack, <hi>and set it to be dissolved, until the whole</hi> (by help of the Common Salt, and Sal Armoniack) <hi>is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a most clear water.</hi> This is the pretious ferment for the Red Elixir, and the true Body made spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Gold is a metalick body, citrine, ponderous, mute, fulgid, equally dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the Bowels of the Earth, and very long wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mineral water; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Hammer extensible, fusible, and sustaining the tryal of the Cupel and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. From this definition you may conclude, That nothing is true Gold, unless it has all the Causes and Differences of the definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gold: Yet whatever Metal is radically Citrine, and brings to equality, and cleanses, it makes Gold of it; from whence we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scern, that Copper may be transmuted into Gold by Artisice. For we see in Copper Mines, a certain
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:65913:216"/>
water, which flows out, and carries with it thin scales of Copper, which by a long continued course it washes and cleanses: But after such water ceases to flow, we find these thin scales, with the dry Sand, in 3 years time to be dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with the heat of the Sun; and among those Scales the purest Gold is found. Therefore we judge, that those Scales were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the help of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but equally digested by the heat of the Sun, in the dryness of the Sand, and so brought to perfection.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Also Gold is of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals the most pretious, and it is the Tincture of Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, because it tinges and transforms every Body. It is calcined and dissolved without profit, and is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine rejoycing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Body in Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness. It is most easily broken with <hi>Mercury,</hi> and by the Odour of Lead. There is not any Body that in Act more agrees with it in their substance than <hi>Luna</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but in weight, deafness, and putrescibility, <hi>Saturn,</hi> and in colour <hi>Venus:</hi> But indeed <hi>Venus</hi> in <hi>Potency</hi> is nearer <hi>Luna</hi> than either <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> or <hi>Saturn,</hi> then <hi>Saturn,</hi> lastly <hi>Mars,</hi> Spirits are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so commixed with it, (<hi>viz. Sol</hi>) and by it fixed, but not without great ingenuity and industry, which the sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Artist shall never attain to the knowledge of.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>Of the Nature of</hi> Sol. It is created of the most subtil substance of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and of most absolute fixedness; and of a most small quantity of Sulphur, clean, and of pure redness, fixed, clear, and changed from its own nature, tinging that. And because there happens a diversity in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of that Sulphur, the Citrinity or Yellowness of Gold, must needs have a like Density.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. That Gold is of the most subtil substance of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> is most evident, because <hi>Argent Vive</hi> easily retains it; for <hi>Argent Vive</hi> retains not any thing which is not of its own Nature.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:65913:216"/>
And that it has the clear, and clean substance of that, is manifest by its splendid and Radiant brightness, manifesting it self not only in the Day, but also in the Night. And that it has a fixed substance, void of all burning Sulphureity, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by every Operation in the Fire, for it is neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished, nor inflamed.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And that it is ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sulphur is manifest, for being mixt with <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> it transforms the same into a Red color: And being sublimed with strong Igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Bodies, so that the substance of them ascends, with them it creates a most Yellow color; and that it is yellow, is evident even to the sence it self.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Therefore the most subtil substance of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> brought to Fixation, and the purity of the same, and the most subtil matter of Sulpur, fixed, and not burning, is the whole Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential matter of Gold.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. But in it is found a greater quantity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> than of Sulphur: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Argent Vive</hi> has greater ingress into it. For this cause, whatsoever body you would alter, alter them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this Exemplar, that you may deduce them to the equality thereof. For Gold having a subtil and fixt part, those parts would in its Creation be much condensed; and this was the cause of its great weight. Now by great decoction made by nature, a leisurely and gradual resolution of it was made, together with good inspissation, and its ultimate mixtion, that it might melt in the fire.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. From what has been said, it is evident, that a large quantity of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> is the cause of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but much of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur is the cause of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. And <hi>uniformity</hi> of <hi>substance,</hi> which through the mixtion, is made by a natural decoction, is cause of perfection; but <hi>diversity</hi> of <hi>substance</hi> is the cause of imperfection. Also Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Inspissation,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:65913:217"/>
which is made by a long and temperate decoction, is a cause of perfection, but the contrary, of corruption and imperfection. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if Sulphur shall not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Corruptions must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be inferred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of it, as if it be all, or part of it fixed, or not fixed; all, or part of it adustible, or not adustible; all clean, or half unclean, or it be much or little in quantity, exceeding, or being diminished in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, neither overcoming nor overcome, White or Red, or between both: From all which Diversities, divers Bodies were genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Nature.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. <hi>A Solar Medicine of the Third Order.</hi> It is made by the Additament of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, not burning, by way of fixation, and calcination, prudently and perfectly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, and by manifold repetition of solution, until it be rendered clean: For by the perfect doing of these things, its cleansing by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation will be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Thus. <hi>Reiterate the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation of the not fixed part of the Stone, with this said Sulphur, conjoyning them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Art, till they be first elevated together, and then fixed so, as to abide in the heat of the fire without ascension.</hi> The oftner this Order of compleating the Exuberan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, shall be repeated, the more will the Exuberancy of this Medicine be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and the more its goodness augmented, and the augmentation of the perfection thereof highly multiplyed also.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. <hi>The whole compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Magistery is thus.</hi> By the way of sublimation, the Stone and its Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may most perfectly be cleansed, and then by the Laws of Art, the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive must be fixed in them: And in this order is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the most pretious <hi>Arcanum,</hi> which is above every secret of the Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of this World, and a Treasure inestimable. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose your self by exercise to it, with great industry and labor, and a continued
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:65913:217"/>
Depth of Meditation; for by these you will find it, and not otherwise. And indeed, in the preparation of the Stone, the reiterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goodness of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration upon this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, may with industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wariness, be so far a vailable, as to enable it to change <hi>Argent Vive</hi> into an infinite true Solifick, and Lunifick, without the help of any thing more than its Multiplication.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. The most high God the maker of all things, blessed and Glorious, be praised; who has revealed to us the series and order of all Medicines, with the Experience of them, which through his goodness, and our incessant Labor, we have searched out; which we have seen with our Eyes, and handled with our Hands, even the whole compleatment of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery. But if we have concealed any thing, ye Sons of Learning wonder not; for we have not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from you, but have delivered it in such Language, as that it may be hid from evil Men, and that the unjust and Vile might not know it. But ye Sons of Doctrine, search, and you shall find this most excellent gift of God, which he has reserved for you. Ye Sons of folly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and prophaneness, avoid you the seeking after this Knowledge, it will be Enimical and destructive to you, and precipitate you into the State of Contempt and Misery. This gift of God is absolutely, by the Judgment of the Divine providence, hid from you, and denyed you for ever.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>ARgent Vive,</hi> which is also called <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> is a Viscous Water in the Bowels of the Earth, by most temperate heat United, in a total Union, through its least parts, with the substance of White sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Earth, until the humid be contemperated with the Dry, and the Dry with the humid equally. There fore it easily runs upon a plain Superfices, by reason of its watery humidity, but it adhers not, although it has a Viscous humidity, by reason of the dryness of that which Contemperatesit, and permits it not to adhere.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. This is also as some say, the matter of Metals with Sulphur, and easily adheres to three Minerals, <hi>viz. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Sol,</hi> but to <hi>Luna</hi> more difficulty, and to <hi>Venus</hi> more difficulty than to <hi>Luna;</hi> but to <hi>Mars</hi> in no wise but by Artifice. Hence you may collect a very great Secret. For it is amicable and pleasing to the Metals, and the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of conjoyning Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; and nothing is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merged in <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it is <hi>Sol.</hi> Yet <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn, Luna</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> are dissolved by it, and mixed; and without it, can none of the Metals be gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is fixed, and the Tincture of Redness, of most exuberant perfection. and fulgid splendor; and receeds not from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion, till it is in its own nature. But it is not our Medicine in its Nature, but it may sometimes help in the Case.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. <hi>Of the Sublimation of Argent Vive.</hi> This Work is compleated with its Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restreity
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:65913:219"/>
is highly purified, and its Aquosity wholy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. We remove it not by adustion, because it has none, so the Art of separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting its superfluous Earth is to mix it with things, where with it has not Affinity, and often to reiterate the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation from them. Of this kind is Talck, and the Calx of Egg-shells, and Calx of white Marble, as also Glass in most subtil Pouder, and every kind of Salt prepared, for by these it is cleansed; but by other things having affinity with it, (unless they be bodies of perfection) it is rather Corrupted, because all such things have a Sulphureity, which, ascending with it in Sublimation, corrupt it. And this you may find to be true by Experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, when you sublime it from Tin, or Lead, you find it, after Sublimation, infected with blackness. Therefore its Sublimation is better made by those things which agree not with it; but it would be better, by things with which it does agree, if they had not Sulphureity. Wherefore this Sublimation is better from <hi>Calx,</hi> than from all other things, because that agrees little with it, and has not Sulphureity.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But the way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving its superfluous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quosity, is, that when it is mixed with <hi>Calces,</hi> from which it is to be sublimed, it be well Ground and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixt with them by Imbibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, untill nothing of it appear, and afterwards the Wateriness of Imbibition removed by a most gentle heat of Fire, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, the Aquosity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> receeds with it; yet the Fire must be so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gentle, as that by it, the whole substance of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> ascend not.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Therefore from the manifold reiteration of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition, with Contrition, and gentle Assation, its grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Aquosity is abolished, the residue of which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, by repeating the Sublimation often. And when you see it is most white, excelling Snow in
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:65913:219"/>
its whiteness, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here (as it were dead) to the sides of the Vessell; then again reiterate its Sub limation, without the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, because part of it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres fixed with the Feces, and can never by any Art or Ingenuity be separated from them. Or, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, fix part of it as we shall teach you; and when you have fixed it, then rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Sublimation of the part remaining, that it may likewise be fixed.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Being fixed, reserve it, but first prove it upon Fire: if it flow well, then you have administred suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sublimation; but if not, add to it some small part of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> sublim'd, and reiterate the Sublima tion till your end be accom plished: for if it has a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cid and most white Color, and be porous, then you have well sublimed it; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, not therefore in the preparation of it made by Sublimation, be not negligent, because such as its cleansing shall be, such will be its Perfection, in projecting of it upon any of the imperfect Bodies, and upon its own Body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared.</p>

Yet here note, that some have by it formed <hi>Iron,</hi> some <hi>Lead,</hi> others <hi>Copper,</hi> and others <hi>Tin;</hi> which happened to them through negligence in the Preparation; sometimes of <hi>it alone,</hi> sometimes of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> or of its Compeer <hi>Arsenick,</hi> mix with it.

                           <hi>VIII.</hi> Of the Coagulation of Mercury <hi>Coagulation is the reducing a Liquid body to a solid Substance, by privation of the humidity: and is of Service. 1.</hi> For Indurating Argent Vive, which needs one kind of Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation. <hi>2.</hi> For freeing dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Medicines from their watriness, which requires a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. Argent Vive <hi>is coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated two ways: One by</hi>
                           <pb n="400" facs="tcp:65913:220"/>
washing away its whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate humidity from it: the other by Inspissation, till it be hardned, which is a laborious work. Some thought the Art of its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation was to keep it long in a temperate Fire, who when they thought they had coagulated it, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter removal of it from the Fire, found it to flow as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; whence they judged the work Impossible.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Others,</hi> from natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principles, supposing that every humidity must necessarily by heat of Fire be converted into Dryness, indeavored by Constancy and perseverance, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Conservation of it in the Fire, till some of them converted it, into a <hi>White-Stone;</hi> others into a <hi>Red;</hi> others into a <hi>Citrine;</hi> which neither had <hi>Fusion,</hi> nor Ingress; for which cause they also cast it a way.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. <hi>Others</hi> endeavoured to coagulate it with Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, but effected it not and so were deluded, for that, 1. They either coagulated it not. 2. Or else it was insensibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated. 3. Or the Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation was not in the form of a body: the reason of which things they knew not.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. <hi>Others</hi> compounding Artificial Medicines, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated it in projection; but that was not profitable, because they converted it into an imperfect Body, the cause of which they could not see.

                        <p n="12">XII. Now, as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform, so it is not possible in a short time, by keeping it constantly in a continued Fire to remove its <hi>Aquosity;</hi> so that too much haste was the cause of the first Error. And being of a subtile sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, it receeds from the Fire; therefore excessive Fire, is the cause of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of those Men, from whom it flies</p>
                        <p n="13">

XIII. It is easily mixed with <hi>Sulphur, Arsenick,</hi> and <hi>Marchasite,</hi> by reason of Community in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: therefore it appears to be Coagulated by them, not into the form of a <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> but of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Lead;</hi> for these being fugitive, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it in the Contest of Fire, until it can attain to the nature of a <hi>Body;</hi> but through the Impression of the Fire, they fly with it; and this is the cause of the Error of them who so Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulate.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Also <hi>Argent Vive</hi> has much humidity joyned to it, which cannot possibly be separated from it, but by Violence of Fire warily adhibited, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of it in its own Fire: and they by aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting this its own <hi>Fire,</hi> as far as it can bear, take a way the humidity of <hi>Ar gent Vive,</hi> leaving no part sufficient for <hi>Metalick Fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which being taken away it cannot be Melted, which is the cause of their Error, who coagulate it into a Stone not <hi>fusible.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">XV. In like manner, <hi>Argent Vive</hi> has Sulphureous parts naturally mixt with it; yet some <hi>Argent Vive</hi> has more, some less, which to remove by Artifice is impossible. Now seeing it is the property of Sulphur mixt with <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> to create a <hi>Red</hi> or <hi>Citrine</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor (according to its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) the ablation of that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Made, the property of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is by Fire to give a white Color. This is the cause of the variety of Colors, after its Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation into a Stone. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it has the Earthiness of Sulphur mixt with it, by which all its Coagulations must necessarily be infected. And this the cause of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of those who coagulate it into an imperfect Body.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Therefore it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens from the diversity of the Medicines of its Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that divers bodies are Created in its Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of that likewise,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:65913:221"/>
what is to be coagulated. For if either the Medicine, or that, has a Sulphur not fixed, the body created of it, must needs be soft: but if fixed the body must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be hard. Also, if <hi>White,</hi> White; and if <hi>Red,</hi> Red; and if the Sulphur be remiss from <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Red;</hi> the <hi>Body</hi> likewise must be remiss; and if <hi>Earthy,</hi> the body must be imperfect; if not, not so. Also every <hi>not fixed</hi> Sulphur creates a <hi>Livid body;</hi> but the fixed, as much as in it lies, the Contrary: and the pure substance of it creates a pure body; the not pure, not so.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. Also the same di versity doth in like manner happen in <hi>Argent Vive</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, without the Commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> by reason of the diversity of <hi>Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>preparations</hi> of it in Medicines. Therefore an Illusion happens from the part of the Diversity of the Medicines; so that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Coagulation of it, it is made <hi>Lead,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Tin,</hi> sometimes <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> sometimes <hi>Iron;</hi> which happens by reason of <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> And sometimes <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> or <hi>Gold</hi> is made thence, which must needs proceed from <hi>Purity,</hi> with conside ration of the Colors.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. But <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is Coagulated by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent precipitation of it with Violence, by the force able heat of strong Fire. For the Asperity of Fire ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily removes its <hi>Aquosity,</hi> and this Work is best done by a Vessel of a great length, in the sides of which it may finde place to Coole and Adhere, and (by reason of the Length of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel) to abide, and not fly, till it can again be precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to the <hi>Fiery hottom</hi> of the same; which must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways stand very hot, with great Ignition: and the same precipitation be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till it be totally fixed.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. It is also Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, with long and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant retention in the Fire, in a Glass Vessell, with a very long Neck, and round
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:65913:221"/>
belly, the Orifice of the Neck being kept open, that the humidity may vanish thereby. Also it is coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Medicine conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it, which we will shew anon: which Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is of it, and is that, which most nearly adheres to it, in its profundity; and is commixed throughly in its least parts, before it can fly away. Therefore there is a necessity of collecting that, from things conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to it, or agreeing with the same: Of this kind are all <hi>Bodies,</hi> also <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Arsenick.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="20">XX. But because we see not any of the <hi>Bodies</hi> in its nature to coagulate it; but that it flys from them, how neerly soever they agree together; we have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore considered, that no <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> adheres to it in its inmost parts. Wherefore, that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine must needs be of a more subtil substance, and more liquid fusion than Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals themselves are. Also by Spirits, remaining in their nature, we see not a Coagulation of it to be made, which is firm and stable; but fugitive, and of much infection. Which indeed happens by reason of the flight of the Spirits; but the other from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of the Adustible and Earthy substance of them.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. Hence then it is manifestly evident, that from whatsoever thing the Medicine thereof is extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that must necessarily be of a most subtil and most pure substance, of its own nature adhereing to it; and of liquefaction most easie, and thin as water; and also be fixed against the violence of fire. For this will coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate it, and convert the same either into a <hi>Solar</hi> or <hi>Lunar</hi> nature: Studiously exercise your self upon what we have spoken, and you will find the Mystery out.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. But that you may not blame us, as if we had not sufficiently spoken thereof, we say, that this <hi>Medicine</hi> is extracted from <hi>Metalick Bodies</hi> themselves,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:65913:222"/>
with their <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> prepared: Likewise from <hi>Sulphur</hi> alone, or <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> prepared; and it may be extracted from Bodies only. But from <hi>Argent Vive</hi> alone, it is more easily, and more nearly, and more perfectly found; because nature more amicably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth its proper nature, and in it more rejoyces than in any extraneous nature; and in it is a facility of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of the substance thereof, seeing it already hath a substance subtil in Act. Now the <hi>ways</hi> of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring this Medicine, are by <hi>sublimation,</hi> as is by us sufficiently declared: And the way of fixing it follows. But the way of Coagulating things dissolved, is by a Glass in Sand, with a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate fire, until their aquo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity vanish.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. <hi>The way of fixing Argent Vive,</hi> is the same with the way of fixing <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Arsenick;</hi> and these waies differ not, unless that <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Arsnick</hi> cannot be fixed if their most thin inflamable parts, be not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from them, with the subtil Artifice of divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by this ultimate way of fixation. But <hi>Argent Vive</hi> has not this confideration, therefore in this method, they need a greater heat than <hi>Argent Vive.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they are diversified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause these (<hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>) must be elevated higher by reason of their slowness, than <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> and also because they require a longer time to be fixt in, and a longer Vessel for their fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. <hi>Of the Medicine Coagulating of Argent Vive.</hi> It is taken from such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the matter it self is (<hi>viz.</hi> as we have before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) and that is, because <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> (seeing it is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made to fly, without any Inflamation,) may suddenly adhere to it, in its profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and be conjoyned with it, in its least parts, and likewise inspissate, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it in the fire by its own fixation, until it be better able to sustain the force of Fire, consuming its humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; and convert it by the
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:65913:222"/>
benefit of this, <hi>in a moment,</hi> into true <hi>Solifick</hi> and <hi>Luni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick,</hi> according to that for which the Medicine was prepared.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. But seeing, we find not any thiug more to agree with it, then <hi>That,</hi> which is of its own nature, therefore by reason of this, we judged, that with <hi>That,</hi> the Medicine thereof might be compleated; and we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured by Art to make the Form of the Medicine agreeable to the same, <hi>viz.</hi> That it be prepared in the method and way now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with the instance of long continued labour; by which all the subtil and most pure substance of it, may be rendred perfectly <hi>White in Luna,</hi> but intensly <hi>Citrine in Sol.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. Now this cannot be compleated, so as to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a Citrine Color, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixtion of a Thing tinging it, which is of its own nature. But with this most pure substance of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> the Medicine is perfected by this our Art, which most nearly adheres to <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and is most easily fluxed, and coagulates it, for it converts it into a true <hi>Solifick</hi> and <hi>Lunifick,</hi> with Preparation of that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preceeding.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. <hi>The grand Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is,</hi> from what things this substance of <hi>Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve</hi> may best be extracted? To which we Answer: It must be taken from those things in which it is: But according to Nature, it is as well in <hi>Bodies,</hi> as in <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> it self, seeing they are found to be of one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: In Bodies more <hi>diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultly;</hi> in <hi>Argent Vive</hi> more nigh, or easily, but not more perfectly. Therefore of what kind soever the Medicine is to be, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine of this Pretious Stone, must be as well sought in Bodies, as in the substance of <hi>Argent Vive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. <hi>But as to the Fixing of</hi> Argent Vive, you must know, that it may be done, without being turned into Earth, and likewise fixed with conversion of it
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:65913:223"/>
into Earth. For by hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its <hi>fixation,</hi> which is made by <hi>precipitation,</hi> it is fixed and turned into Earth. Also by the successive <hi>subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of it often repeated, it is fixed likewise, and not changed into Earth, but gives Metallick fusion. This is manifest to, and proved by him who has experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced both fixations thereof, even to the <hi>Consummation of the Work;</hi> both by the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty <hi>precipitation;</hi> and also by the slow, with continually repeated sublimations.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. This therefore is because it has a viscous and dense substance, the sign of which is the grinding of it by Imbibition, and mixtion with other things. For <hi>Viscosity</hi> is manifestly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it, by the much adherency thereof. That it has a <hi>dense substance,</hi> he that has but one Eye, may manifestly see by its aspect, and by poising the vast Weight thereof. For while it is in its own Nature, it exceeds <hi>Gold</hi> in weight, being of a most strong Composition. Whence it is manifest, that it may be <hi>fixed</hi> without consumption of its humidity, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conversion of it into Earth.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. For by reason of the good adherency of parts, and the strength of its mixtion; if the parts of it be any wise inspissate by Fire, it permits it self no farther to be corrupted; nor suffers it self (by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of a furious flame into it) to be elevated into <hi>fume;</hi> because it admits not of Rarefaction, of its self, by reason of its density, and want of Adustion, which is made by combustible sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureity, which it hath not.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. Hence is seen; First, <hi>The Causes of the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of every of the Metals by fire,</hi> which is, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>. From the Inclusion of a burning sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureity in the profundity of their substance, dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing them by Inflamation, and exterminating them also into <hi>fume,</hi> with extream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of whatever <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> is in them of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:65913:223"/>
good Fixation. 2. From a multiplication upon them, of an exterior flame, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, and resolving them with it self into <hi>fume,</hi> of how great fixation soever, that which is in them is. 3. From the Rarefaction of them by Calcination, for that the flame or fire, does then penetrate into, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate them. Therefore if all Causes of <hi>Corruption</hi> concur, such Bodies must needs be exceedingly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: But if not all, the <hi>corruption</hi> is according to the number and proportion of the Causes which remain.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. Secondly, <hi>The Causes of Goodness, and purity of each Metal.</hi> For seeing that <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> for no Causes of Extermination, permits it self to be divided into parts in its compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (because it either with its whole substance receeds from the fire, or with its whole remains permanent in it) there is necessarily observed in it a cause of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: For it is that which overcomes Fire, and by Fire is not overcome, but it ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably rests, rejoycing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, possessing Perfection, as we have found, with an Approximate Potency.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. <hi>Of the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Argent Vive. It is cleansed two ways, either by <hi>sublimation,</hi> of which we have shewed the way al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; or by way of a <hi>Lavament,</hi> of which the way is this. Put <hi>Argent Vive</hi> into a Stone, or Earthen Dish, and pour upon it as much Vinegar, as is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to cover it: Set it over a gentle fire, and let it heat so far, as you may well hold your Fingers in it, and no more. Then stir it about with your Fingers until it be divided into most small Particles, in the similitude of Powder; and continue stirring it, until all the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar be wholly consumed: After which wash away the Earthiness remaining with Vinegar, and cast it away: Repeating this washing so often, till the Earthiness of the <hi>Mercury</hi> is changed into a most perfect Coelestine colour, which is a sign that it is throughly washed.</p>
                        <p n="34">

XXXIV. <hi>Of the Nature of</hi> Argent Vive. There is a necessity of removing its Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities, for it has Causes of Corruption, <hi>viz.</hi> an Earthy substance, and an adusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble watriness without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation. yet some have thought it to have no super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Earth and Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but that is vain, and not true: For we see it to consist of much lividness, and not of whiteness; we see also a black and Fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Earth, to be separated from it, with easie Artifice, by a <hi>Lavation,</hi> as abovesaid. But because we are by that to acquire a two-fold perfe ction, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>To make a Medicine.</hi> 2. <hi>To perfect it.</hi> Therefore we must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily prepare the same by the degrees of a two-fold <hi>purification;</hi> for two clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings of <hi>Mercury,</hi> are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. One by Sublimation for the Medicine, which shall be here shewed: The other by a <hi>Lavament</hi> for coagulation, which we have shewed at <hi>Sect.</hi> 33. above.</p>
                        <p n="35">XXXV. For if we would make a <hi>Medicine</hi> of it, then there is a necessity to cleanse it from the foeculency of its Earthiness by <hi>sublimation,</hi> least it create a livid color in projection; and also to remove its sugitive watri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, lest it make the whole Medicine fugitive in proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and to keep safe the middle substance thereof sor <hi>Medicine;</hi> of which the Property is not to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but to defend from combustion, and not to fly it self, but to make sixed, which is a perfection by manifold Experiences. For we see <hi>Argent Vive</hi> more nearly to adhere to <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and to be more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the same; but next to it <hi>Gold</hi> has place, and after that <hi>Silver.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. Wherefore <hi>bence</hi> it follows, that <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is more friendly to its own nature; but we see other <hi>Bodies</hi> not to have so great conformity to, or unity with it; and therefore we find them in very deed, less to partake of the nature thereof. And whatsoever <hi>Bodies</hi> we see more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:65913:224" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from adustion, those we judge to partake more of the nature of it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is manifest, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> is the perfective and salvative from Adusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is the <hi>Vltimate of Perfection.</hi>

                        <p n="1">I. THERE are two things to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, <hi>viz.</hi> the Principles of this Magistery, and the perfection of the same. The Principles of this Art, are the Ways or Methods, of its Operations, to which the Artist applys himself in the Work of this Magistery: These ways are divers in themselves: As, 1. <hi>Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi> 2. <hi>Descension.</hi> 3. <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation.</hi> 4. <hi>Calcination.</hi> 5. <hi>Solution.</hi> 6. <hi>Coagulation.</hi> 7. <hi>Fixation.</hi> 8. <hi>Ceration.</hi> All which we shall with much plainness declare.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The perfection con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists 1. Of those things, and from the consideration of those things by which it is attained. 2. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of things helping. 3. From the consideration of that thing which lastly perfects. 4. And from that by which it is known, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Magistery was in perfection or not.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="414" facs="tcp:65913:227"/>
III. The consideration of those things by which we attain to the Compleatment of the Work, is the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the Substance manifest, and of manifest Colors, and of the weight in every of the Bodies to be changed, and of those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies that are not changed, from the Radix of their Nature, without that Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and the consideration of those likewise that are changed, in the Radix of their Nature by Artifice: with the consideration of the Principles of Bodies, according as they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found, occult, or manifest; and according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with or without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. For if <hi>Bodies</hi> and their Principles, be not known in the profound or manifest properties of their Natures, both with and without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, what is superfluous, and what is wanting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in them, cannot be known, and our not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those, would of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity hinder us, from ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the perfection of their Transmutation.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The consideration of things helping Perfection, is the consideration of the Nature of those things, which we see adhere to Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies without Artifice, and to make Mutation: And these are, <hi>Marchasite, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesia, Tutia, Antimony,</hi> and <hi>Lapis Lazuli.</hi> And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of those which, without adherency, cleanse Bodies; such are <hi>Salts, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lums, Nitre, Borax, Vitriol,</hi> and other things of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,: And the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Glass of all sorts,</hi> and things cleansing by a like nature.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But the consideration of the thing that perfects, is the consideration of chusing the pure Substance of <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> and it is the Matter, which from the Substance of that, took beginning, and of which it was created. This Matter is not <hi>Argent Vive</hi> in its Nature, nor in its whole Substance, but it is part of it: nor is it now, but when the Stone is made:
<pb facs="tcp:65913:227"/>
for that illustrates and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves from Adustion, which is a signification of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Lastly, The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the thing, or certain Tryal and Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which it is known, whether the Magistery be in Perfection or not; arises from the consideration of 1. <hi>The Cupel.</hi> 2. <hi>Cement.</hi> 3. <hi>Ignition.</hi> 4. <hi>Exposing it to the Vapours of Acid Things.</hi> 5. <hi>Extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi> 6. <hi>Commixtion of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur burning Bodies:</hi> 7. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction after Calcination.</hi> 8. <hi>Susception of</hi> Argent Vive. All which with the former we declare, with their Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses from Experiences, by which you may certainly know, we have not er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. THe cause of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, was to unite Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies with Spirits, (since nothing can possibly be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with a Body but a Spirit.) Or to find some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can contain in its self the nature both of Body and Spirit, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cast upon bodies, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being first purified,) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give not perfect Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, or else totally corrupt, blacken, defile, and burn them, and this according to the diversitie of the same Spirit.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. For <hi>Sulphur, Arsenick</hi> and <hi>Marchasite,</hi> are burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and wholly corrupt: <hi>Tutia</hi> (of every kind) burns not, yet gives an imperfect Color, 1. Because its adust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Sulphureity, which is easily inflamed and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens is not removed. 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its Earthmess is not separated: for Adustion may create a Livid Color, and Earthiness may form it.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="416" facs="tcp:65913:228"/>
III. These things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are constrained to cleanse from their burning Sulphuriety or Unctuosity, and Earthy superfluity, and this can be done by no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice but by Sublimation: for when Fire elvevates, it makes ascend always the more subtile parts, leaving behind the more Gross.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Hence it is manifest that Spirits are cleansed from their Earthiness by Sublimation, which Earthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness impeded Ingress, and gave an impure or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished Color: from which being separated, they are freed from their Impurity, and are made more splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did, more pervious, and more easily to enter and penetrate the density of bodies, with a pure and perfect Tincture.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>Adustion</hi> is also taken away by Sublimation; for <hi>Arsenick</hi> which before Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation was apt to <hi>adustion</hi> after Sublimation, will not be Inflamed, but receeds without Inflamation; the same you may find in Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur. And because in no other things than in <hi>Spirits,</hi> we saw an adherency to <hi>Bodies</hi> with <hi>Alteration,</hi> we were necessitated to make choice of them, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie them by Sublimation.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Sublimation then, is the Elevation of a Dry thing by Fire, with adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency to its Vessel but is done diversly according to the diversity of Spirits to be sublimed: for some are <hi>Sublimed</hi> with strong Igni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, others with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and some again with a remiss heat of Fire.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. <hi>Arsenick,</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> are <hi>Sublimed</hi> with a remiss Fire; for otherwise, having their most subtil parts uniformly mixt and conjoyned with the Gross, their whole substance would ascend black or burnt, without any Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: therefore you must find out the <hi>proportion</hi> of the Fire, and the <hi>Purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> with commixtion of the Feces or Gosser parts, that they may be kept de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:65913:228"/>
and not suffered to ascend.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. In Sublimation a threefold degree of Fire is to be observed. 1. One, so proportioned, as to make to ascend only the <hi>Altered,</hi> more <hi>pure,</hi> and <hi>Livid</hi> parts, till you manifestly see they are cleansed from their Earthly feculency. 2. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother degree is, that what is of the <hi>pure Essence</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Feces, may be sublimed with greater force of Fire, <hi>viz.</hi> with Ignition of the bottom of the Vessel, and of the Feces therein, which you may see with your Eye. 3. The other degree is, <hi>a most weak Fire,</hi> which is to be given to the <hi>Sublimate</hi> without the <hi>Feces,</hi> so that scarcely any thing of it may ascend, but that only which is the most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til part thereof, and which in our work is of no value, for that it is a thing by help of which <hi>Adustion</hi> is made in <hi>Sulphurs.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The whole intention therefore of <hi>Sublimation</hi> is, That 1. The Earthiness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed by a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Fire. 2. And the most subtil and fumous part, which brings <hi>Adustion</hi> with <hi>Corruption,</hi> being cast away, we may have the pure Substance, consisting in Equality, of simple Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon the Fire, and without any <hi>Adustion,</hi> or fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Fire, or Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation thereof.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Now that that which is most subtil is adustive, is evident, for that Fire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to its own nature, all those things which are of affinity to it: it is of affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to every adustible thing; and every thing the more subtil the more adustible, therefore Fire is of most affinity to what is most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. The same is proved by Experience; for <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Arsnick</hi> not sublimed, are most easily inflamed, and of the two, <hi>Sulphur</hi> the more easily: but either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sublimed, are not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly inflamed, but fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and are extenuated without Inflamation, yet
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:65913:229"/>
with a preceeding <hi>Fusion.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Now the proof in the administration of <hi>
                              <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </hi> with their proportion, is, that such Matter be chosen, with which the Spirits to be sublimed may best agree, and wherewith they may be the more intimately mixed: for that Matter with which they are or may be most united, will be more potent in the reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Faeces</hi> of the Matter to be sublimed; the reason of which is evident.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. But the addition of <hi>Foeces</hi> is necessary, because <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Arsenick</hi> to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimed, if they be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with the <hi>Foeces</hi> of some fixed thing, would necessarily ascend with their whole substance not cleansed, which thing we know by experience to be truth: this is proved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, if the <hi>Foeces</hi> be not permixed with them thro' their least parts, then the same happens as if they had not <hi>Faeces,</hi> for their whole Essence will ascend without any cleansing.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Experience also proves this to be true, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause when we sublime from a thing forraign to the nature of Bodies, we su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blime in vain, so that they are found in no wise purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the ascension: but subliming with the Calx of any Body, the sublimation is well, and with facility it is perfectly cleansed.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. The intention of <hi>Faeces</hi> then is, that they be administred or taken from the Calxes of Metals; for in them the work of subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is easie, but in other things most difficult; for which cause there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can be instituted in their stead; for that without the Calxes of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, the Labor will be long, tedious, and most difficult, almost to despa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. But in this there is some benefit, for what is sublimed without <hi>Faeces</hi> or the <hi>Calces</hi> of Bodies, is of greater quantity, but with <hi>Faeces</hi> of lesser: So also, what is calcined with the

                           <hi>Calces</hi> of Bodies is of least quantity, but of easiest and most speedy Labor.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. However every kind of Salt prepared, and things of like nature to it, excuses us from using the <hi>Foeces</hi> of <hi>Bodies,</hi> for that with them we make sublimation in a greater quantity; for separation of things to be sublimed from the <hi>Foeces,</hi> is easily made by solution of the Salts, which happens not in other things</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. But the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Faeces</hi> is, that it be equal to the quantity of the matter to be sublimed, in which you cannot easily err: Yet if the <hi>Foeces</hi> be but half the weight, it may serve with care, to an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Man: For the less the <hi>Foeces</hi> are, the greater will be the Exuberation of the sublimate, provided, that according to the Subtraction of the <hi>Foeces,</hi> an abatement of the <hi>Fire</hi> be in proportion thereto: For in a <hi>small quantity,</hi> a <hi>small fire</hi> serves for perfection; in <hi>a great, a great;</hi> and in a <hi>greater quantity,</hi> a <hi>greater fire</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. Now because fire is a thing which cannot be measured; therefore it is, that error is often commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it, when the Artist is unskilful, as well in respect to the variety of Fornaces, as Woods and Vessels to be used, and their due joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. Therefore in things to be sublimed, you must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their <hi>wateriness</hi> only, with a very small <hi>Fire,</hi> which being removed, if any thing ascend by it, then in the beginning, this <hi>Fire</hi> must not be increased, that the most subtil part may (by this most weak fire) be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, and put aside, which is the cause of Adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. But when little or nothing shall ascend (which you may prove by putting a little <hi>Cotton Weik</hi> into the hole in the top of the <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi>) increase the fire under it; and how strong the fire should be, the <hi>Cotton Weik</hi>
                           <pb n="420" facs="tcp:65913:230"/>
will shew: For if <hi>little</hi> of the sublimate comes forth with it, or it be clean, it shews your fire is small, and therefore must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased: But if much and unclean, that it is too great, and must be diminished.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. When then you find your sublimate to come forth with the <hi>Weik</hi> Clean, and much, you have the due proportion of your Fire, but if unclean the contrary: For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or uncleanness of the sublimate adhereing to the Cotton, must you order your Fire in the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimaiton: by this means you may bring it to its due height without any error.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. Yet the way of <hi>Faeces</hi> is better, <hi>viz.</hi> To take <hi>Scales of Iron,</hi> or <hi>Copper calcined:</hi> these indeed by reason of the privation of an Evil humiditity, do easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imbibe <hi>Sulphur</hi> or <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicck,</hi> and Unite them with themselves; the method of which the experienced on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. It is fit therefore, that we should rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you in the sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these two Spirits [<hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Arsenick</hi>] least you should erre through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: We say then, that if you put in many <hi>Faeces,</hi> and augment not the Fire proportionally, nothing of the Matter to be sublimed will ascend.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. If you put in a small quantity of <hi>foeces,</hi> or none of the <hi>Calx of Bodies,</hi> and have not a fit propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Fire, the matter will ascend with its whole substance: So likewise by reason of the Fornace, you may err: For a great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace gives a great heat of Fire; a small Fornace, a small, if the Fewel and Vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes be proportionate.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. If you sublime a great quantity of matter in a small Fornace, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make a fire great enough for Elevation: If a small quantity in a great Fornace, you will exterminate the sublimation by excess of
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:65913:230"/>
heat. Again, a thick For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace gives a condensate and strong Fire: A thin For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, a rare and weak fire, in both which you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily err.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. So also, a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace with large Vent holes, gives a clear and strong fire, but with small Vent-holes, a weak fire: And if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of space between the Fornace and the Vessel be large, the fire will be the greater, but if small, the less; in all which, without care, you may easily also err.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. You must there fore build your Fornace, according to the strength of the Fire you would have, <hi>viz.</hi> thick, with free Vent-holes, so as there may be a good distance between the Vessel, and sides of the Fornace, if you would have a great fire: But if a mean fire, in all these things you must find a mean propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: All which we shall teach you.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. If you would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate a great quantity of matter to be sublimed, first be provided of a sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of such a capacity, that it may contain your matter to be sublimed, the height of ones hand breadth above the bottom: To this fit your Fornace, so as the <hi>Aludel,</hi> or <hi>Sublimatory</hi> may be received into it, with the distance of two Fingers round about the Walls, or Sides of the Fornace; which being made, make also to it ten Vent-holes, in one proportion, equally distant, that there may be an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the fire in all parts thereof.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. Then put a <hi>Bar</hi> of Iron into the Fornace transverse, which fasten at each end in the sides of the Fornace, which <hi>Bar</hi> let be distant from the bottom of the Fornace about a Span, or 9 Inches: About an Inch above it the <hi>Sublimatory</hi> must be firmly placed, and inclosed round about to the Fornace.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. Now, if your Fornace can well and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:65913:231"/>
discharge it self of the Fumosities, and the Flame can freely pass through the whole Fornace in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the <hi>Aludel,</hi> it is well proportioned; if not, it is not so. Then you must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen its Vent-holes, and if by that it is mended, all is well; if not, you must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily alter it, for the distance of the Vessel from the sides of the Fornace, is too small: Wherefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the distance, and try it, continuing these Tryals, till it can freely quit it self of the smoak, and the flame is bright and clear.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. But as to the thickness of the Fornace, if you intend a great fire, it ought to be about 5 or 6 Inches; but if a moderate fire, 3 or 4 Inches; if a les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser fire, 2 or 3 Inches thick will be sufficient.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. Then as to the Fewel, solid Wood gives a strong and durable fire; lighter Wood a weak fire, and soon ended; dry Wood gives a great fire and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> green Wood a small and long lasting. From the consideration of all these things, the diversity of Fires may easily be found out.</p>
                        <p n="34">XXXIV. In the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the <hi>Sublimatory</hi> must be made with a great and large concavity within, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the manner of an Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick with a Nose, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the whole <hi>sublimate</hi> may descend to the bottom of the Vessel, through too great heat, for that in the end of the sublimation, the <hi>Sulphur</hi> ascends not, unless with force of fire, even to Ignition of the <hi>Alndel:</hi> And if the <hi>Sulphur</hi> be not retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Concavity above, seeing it easily flows, it will descend again by the sides of the Vessel, to the very bottom, and nothing will be found <hi>sublimed.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="35">XXXV. The <hi>Aludel</hi> is to be made of thick Glass, for other matter is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, unless it be thick, and of the like substance with Glass; because Glass only, or what is like to it, wanting Pores, is able to retain Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:65913:231"/>
from flying away: For through Porous Vessels, the Spirits would pass and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. Nor are Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals serviceable in this case, because Spirits (by reason of their Amity and Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy) penetrate them, and are united therewith: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Composition of your <hi>Aludel,</hi> let a round Glass, or <hi>Concha,</hi> be made with a flat round bottom; and in the middle of the sides thereof, a Zone, or Girdle surrounding the same; and above that Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, cause a round Wall to be made, equidistant from the sides of the <hi>Concha,</hi> so that in this space, the sides of the Cover may freely fall without pressure.</p>
                        <p n="37">XXXVII. But the height of this Wall (above the Girdle) must be according to the height of the Wall of the <hi>Concha,</hi> little more, or less. This done, let two Covers or Heads be made equal to the measure of this Concavity of the two Walls the length of the two Covers must be equal, and each a Span, or 9 Inches The Figure of one of them also Pyramidal, in the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior parts of which Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, must be two equal holes, one in each, so made that a Hens Feather may conveniently be put in.</p>
                        <p n="38">XXXVIII. The intention of this <hi>Concha</hi> is, That its Cover may be moved at pleasure; and that the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture might be ingenious, so that through it, though without any luting, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits might not pass. But if you can better contrive this Vessel, you may do so, notwithstanding this our description.</p>
                        <p n="39">XXXIX. Yet in this we have a special intention, that the interiour <hi>Concha,</hi> with its sides, should enter half way within its Cover, for seeing it is the property of Fumes to ascend, not to descend, by this means they are kept from vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Also that the Head of the <hi>Aludel</hi> should be often emptied, left part of what is sublimed (being over
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:65913:232"/>
much) should fall down to the bottom again.</p>
                        <p n="40">XL. Another intention is, that what ascends up in the form of pouder, near the hole of the head of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludel,</hi> be always kept apart, from that which is found to have ascended fused and dense in small lumps; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and clear at bottom thereof, with adherency to the sides of the Vessel; for that it is known to have less of Adustion, than what is found to ascend nigh to the hole of the Head: Now the sublimation is well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, if it be found clear and lucid, and not burnt with inflammation: This is the perfection of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liming of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick:</hi> And if it be not so found, the Work must so often be repeated, till it is so.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LI.</hi> Of Descension, and the way of Purifying by Pastils.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THERE is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Cause of its invention. 1. That when any matter is included in that Vessel, which is called, a <hi>Chymical Descensory,</hi> that after its fusion, it may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend through the Holes thereof, by which descent, we are assured, it has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a fluxing.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. 2. That weak Bodies may by it be preserved from Combustion, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction from their <hi>Calces:</hi> For when we reduce weak Bodies from their <hi>Calces,</hi> we cannot reduce all their whole substance at one time: If then that part, which is first reduced into a body, should lie while the whole is reduced, a great
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:65913:232"/>
quantity would vanish by the force of the Fire; so that it was neeessarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, that one part so soon as it is reduced, may fall from the Fire, through this descensory.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. 3. That the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Bodies might be so excellently performed, as to be freed from every extraneous thing: For the body descends in a Flux clean, and leaves every thing which is alien there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, in the Concavity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Therefore as to the way or method thereof, we say, that the <hi>form</hi> of it must be such as its bottom may be pointed, and the sides of it without roughness, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually terminating in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Acuity, or point of the bottom: And its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (if any be needful) must be made in the like ness of a plain or flat Dish, and well fitted to it, and the Vessel with its Cover, must be made of good firm Earth, not easie to break, or crack in the fire.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Then put in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which you would have to descend, upon round Rods or Bars made of like Earth, and so placed, as they may be more nigh the top than bottom of the Vessel. Then covering the Vessel, and luting the jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, set it into the fire, and blow it until it is in Flux, and the whole matter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend into a subjacent Vessel.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But, if the matter be of difficult fusion, it may be put upon a Table plain, or of small Concavity, from which it may easily descend by inclining the head of the Descensory when it is in Flux; for by this means Bodies are purified.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. But they are yet better purified by Pastils, which method of Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is of the same force, with the way of purifying by descension: For it holds the foeces of Bodies as well as a Descensory and better, the way of which is thus.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <pb n="426" facs="tcp:65913:233"/>
VIII. Take the body which you intend to cleanse, and granulate it, or file it, or reduce it into a <hi>Calx,</hi> which is yet better, and more perfect: Mix it with some other <hi>Calx,</hi> which is not to be melted, and then make the body to flow.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. By this method, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, Bodies are cleansed, but not with a perfect Mundification, which is to perfection; yet it is a profitable purifying, that Bodies capable of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may the better and more perfectly be transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. For there is an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration always to go before, and to proceed such a Transmutation, all which shall be declared in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. The Descensory For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace is made, as before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, and is wonderfully useful to the melting of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals by <hi>Cineritiums</hi> and <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> For all Calcined, Combust, Dissolved, and Coagulated <hi>Bodies,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by this Fornace into a solid Mass, or Metal.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. <hi>Cineritiums</hi> also, and <hi>Cements,</hi> and <hi>Tests,</hi> or <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibles,</hi> in which Silver is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten melted, are put into this Fornace, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the Metal imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>DIstillation</hi> is the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating of Aqueous Vapours in their proper Vessel; and is of divers kinds. 1. Either with fire, or without fire. Those
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:65913:233"/>
made by fire is also two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. 1. <hi>Ascending</hi> by an <hi>Alembick.</hi> 2. <hi>Descending</hi> by a <hi>Descensory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Cause why Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation was invented, was the purification of a liquid matter from its filth, and conservation of it from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction. For we see things distilled (by what kinds soever of Distillation) are made more pure, and more pure to be preserved from putrefaction.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. But the special cause of Distillation by <hi>Ascent,</hi> or an <hi>Alembick,</hi> is the separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of a pure Water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Earth or Foecs; for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so distilled has no fecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency: And the Cause of the invention of such pure water, was for the Imbibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spirits, and of clean Medicines, lest by the fe culency of the Water, our Medicines, or Spirits might be defiled or currupted.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But the cause of the Invention, which is made by <hi>Descent,</hi> or a <hi>Descensory,</hi> was the extracting its Oyl, pure in its Nature; because by Ascent, Oyls are not so easily had in their combusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Nature.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And the Distillation, which is made without fire, or by <hi>Filter,</hi> was invented for this cause sake, to clear water (whether distilled, or not distilled) from all manner of Impurities what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Distillation by <hi>Ascent</hi> is two-fold, 1. In Ashes, or Sand. 2. In Balneo, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hay, or Wool in its proper Vessel, so disposed, that the Cucurbit, or Vesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca may not be broken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Work is finished.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Distillation by <hi>Ashes</hi> or <hi>Sand,</hi> is done with a greater, stronger, and more acute fire: But that by <hi>Balneo,</hi> with a mild, soft, or gentle and equal fire; for <hi>Water</hi> admits not the Acuity of Ignition, as <hi>Ashes</hi> or <hi>Sand</hi> do.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Therefore by that Distillation which is made <hi>in Ashes,</hi> colours, and the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:65913:234"/>
more gross parts of the Earth are elevated; but by that in <hi>Balneo,</hi> the parts more subtil, and without color, and more approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of simple Water, only arise. So that a more subtil separation is made <hi>by distillation in Balneo,</hi> than <hi>by a Distillation in Ashes or Sand.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">IX. This is evident; for Oyl distilled <hi>by Ashes,</hi> is gross, thick, and foetid: But that being rectified <hi>in Balneo,</hi> the Oyl is separated into its Elemental parts; so that from a most Red Oyl, you have another most lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, white, and serene, the whole redness remaining in the bottom of the Vessel.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. By this Operation, we come to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate separation of all the Elements of every Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and of that which from Vegetables proceeds to a <hi>Being,</hi> and of every like thing. But by that which is made by <hi>Descent,</hi> we at tain the Oyl of every thing Vegetable, determinately, and of their like: and by <hi>Filteration</hi> we accomplish the clearness of every liquid thing.</p>
                        <p n="11">
                           <hi>XI. To Distil in Ashes.</hi> You must have a strong earthen Pan, and fitted to the Fornace, like to the aforesaid Fornace of Sublimation, with the same distance from the sides of the Fornace, and with like Vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes; upon the bottom of which Pan sifted Ashes must be put to the thickness of one Fingers breadth <hi>[length almost]</hi> and upon the Ashes, the Retort, or Distillatory must be set, and covered round about with the same Ashes, almost as high as to the neck of the Alembick, <hi>[Retort, or Distillatory.]</hi>

                        <head>CHAP. LIII. <hi>Of Calcination of Bodies and Spirits, with their Causes and Methods.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p n="1">I. CAlcination is the bringing a thing to Dust by Fire, through an abstraction of its humidity, holding the particles of the Body together.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The cause of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention thereof, is, that the Adustive, corrupting and defiling sulphureity, may be abolished by Fire; and it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, according to the diversity of the things to be calcined: for <hi>Bodies</hi> are calcined; and <hi>Spirits</hi> are calcined; as also other things foreign to these, but with a divers intention.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And seeing there are imperfect Bodies of two kinds, <hi>viz. Hard,</hi> as <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars;</hi> and <hi>Soft,</hi> as <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter;</hi> all which are calcined; there was a necessity of calcining them with a several intention, <hi>viz.</hi> General and Special.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. They are calcined with one general Intention, when that their corrupting and defiling <hi>Sulphureity</hi> may be abolished by Fire: for every adustive <hi>Sulphureity,</hi> which could not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without Calcination, is thereby abolished from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing whatsoever.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And because the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it self is solid, and by reason of that solidity, the internal <hi>Sulphureity</hi> conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the continuity of the substance of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> is defended from Adustion; therefore it was necessary to separate the Continuity thereof, that the Fire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely to every its least parts, might burn the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureity</hi> from it, and that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:65913:235"/>
the Continuity of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> might not defend it.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The common inten tion also of <hi>Calcination,</hi> is Depuration of the Earthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for it is found that Bodies are cleansed by rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated Calcination and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, as we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shew.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Special Calcination is of <hi>Soft Bodies,</hi> and with these two intentions, that through it there may be an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Hardning and Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is accomplished by an Ignitious repition of Calcination upon them; and this is found true by Experience.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. But why the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination of Spirits was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, is, that they may the better be fixed, and the more easily dissolved in to Water; for that every kind of thing Calcined is more fixed, then the not Calcined, and of easier so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: and because the Particles of the Calcinated, more subtilized by Fire, are more easily mixed with Water, and turned into Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The Calcination of other things, is subservient to the Exigency of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Spirits and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, of which Preparation we shall speak more at large in the following: but these are not of Perfection.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. The way of Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is divers, by reason of the diversity of things to be Calcined: for <hi>Bodies</hi> are otherwise Calcined than <hi>Spirits,</hi> or <hi>other things.</hi> And <hi>Bodies</hi> divers from each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are diversly Calcined. <hi>Soft Bodies</hi> have one general way, according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, <hi>viz.</hi> That both may be Calcined by Fire only, and by the acuity of Salt prepared or unprepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. The first Calcination by <hi>Fire</hi> is thus: Have a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of <hi>Iron</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> formed like a Porringer, which let be very strong and firm, and fitted to the Fornace of Calcination, so, that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, the Coles may be cast in and blowed.</p>
                        <p n="12">
                           <pb n="432" facs="tcp:65913:236"/>
XII. Then cast in your <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Tin</hi> (the vessel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firmly set upon a Trivet of Iron or Stone, and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Walls of the Fornace, with 3 or 4 Stones being thrust in, stiff, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Fornace sides and the Vessel, that it may not move: the form of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, must be the same with the Form of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Great Ignition,) of which we have spoken, and shall speak more in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.)</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. And the Fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kindled sufficient for the fusion of the <hi>Body</hi> to be calcined, a skin will arise on the Top, which con tinually rake together, and take off with a Slice, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fit Iron or Stone instu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, so long till the whole body is converted into Pouder.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. If it be <hi>Saturn,</hi> there must be a greater fire, till the <hi>Calx</hi> be changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a compleat whiteness.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. Now understand, that <hi>Saturn</hi> is easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced again into a Body from its <hi>Calx:</hi> but <hi>Jupiter</hi> with most difficulty: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be carefull that you err not in exposing <hi>Saturn</hi> after its first Pulverization to too great a Fire, and so reduce the <hi>Calx</hi> into a <hi>Body,</hi> before it is perfected: in this you must use tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Fire, and that lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surly augmented by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with Caution, till it be confirmed in its <hi>Calx,</hi> and is not so easily redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, but that a gentle fire must be given to the last compleating of the <hi>Calx.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Likewise be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that you err not in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> by reason of its dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult Reduction, for that intending to reduce it, you find it not reduced, but a <hi>Calx</hi> still, or turned into Glass, and so then conclude its reduction impossible.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. Now we say, that if a great Fire be not given in the reduction of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> it reduceth not: and if a great Fire be given, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it reduces not, but
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:65913:236"/>
Possibly may be converted into Glass: the reason of which is, because <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the profundity of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has the fugitive sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: which if long kept in the Fire flies away; and leaves the Body deprived of humidity, so that it is found more apt to Vitrifie, than to be reduced again into a metallick <hi>Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. For every thing deprived of its proper Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, gives no other than a <hi>Vitrifying fusion,</hi> whence it naturally follows, that you must hasten to reduce it with the speedy force of a Violent Fire; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it will not be reduced.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. The Calcination of these Bodies by the Acu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of Salt, is, the quantity after quantity of Salt be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often cast upon them in their fusion, and permixed by much agitation with an Iron Rod, while in fusion, till by the mixtion of the Salt, they be turned into Ashes: and afterwards by the same way of perfection the Calces of them are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, with their conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. But herein also is a difference in the Calces of these two Bodies: for <hi>Lead</hi> in the first work of Calcination is more easily converted into Pouder or Ashes than <hi>Tin;</hi> and yet the <hi>Calx</hi> is not more easily perfected than that of <hi>Tin.</hi> The cause of which diversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, that <hi>Saturn</hi> has a more fixed humidity than <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. The Calcination of <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> is one, yet divers from the former, by reason of the dificulty of their Liquefaction. Make either of these Bodies into thin Plates, heat them red hot, but not to Melting: for by reason of their great Earthiness, and large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Adustive flying Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, they are easily thus reduced into <hi>Calx:</hi> for the much Earthiness being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the substance of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> the due Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the said <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is frustrated.</p>
                        <p n="22">
                           <pb n="434" facs="tcp:65913:237"/>
XXII. And thence comes their porosity, through which the flying Sulphur passes away, and the Fire by that means having access to it, Burns and Elevates the same; whence it comes to pass, that the parts are made more rare, and through discontinuity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Ashes.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. This is manifest, for that plates of Copper exposed to Ignition, yeild a Sulphurous Flame, and make pulverizable Scales in their Superfices; which is done, because from the parts more nigh, a more easy combustion of the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur must be made.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. The form of this Calcinatory Fornace, is the same with the form of the Distillatory Fornace, save only, that this must have one great hole in the Crown of it to free it self from Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosities: and the place of the things to be Calcined, must be in the midst of the Fornace, that the Fire may have free access to them round about, but the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel must be of Earth, such as are Crucibles.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. <hi>The Calcination of Spirits</hi> You must give Fire to them gradually, and leisurly increase it, that they may not fly, till they be able to sustain the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Fire, and approach to Fixation: their Vessel must be round, every way closed, and the Fornace the same with the last mentioned. But you need not use grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Labour than what is to prevent their flight.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. <hi>Or thus,</hi> As to the form of the Fornace. Let it be made square in length four Feet, and in breadth three Feet: <hi>Luna, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> or other things must be Calcined in strong Dishes or Pans made of Clay, such as that of which Crucibles are made, that they may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the strongest force of the Fire, to the total com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion of the matter to be Calcined.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. <hi>Calcination is</hi>
                           <pb n="435" facs="tcp:65913:237"/>
                           <hi>the Treasure of the thing,</hi> Be not weary therefore, for imperfect Bodies are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by it, and by reduction of the Calcinate into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Body or Mass of Metal again: then is our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine projected upon them, which is matter of Joy and Rejoycing.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. <hi>The Ablutions of the Calces.</hi> Have a large Earthen Vessel, full of pure hot fresh Water, with this wash the <hi>Calx,</hi> stirring it often, that all the Salt and Allom may be dissolved (with which they have been Calcined) then being set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, decant the Water gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: put the <hi>Calx</hi> again into hot Water and do as before, till it be perfectly washed, then dry and keep it for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. But its innate foulness, which dwels in the Root of its Generation, must be obliterated or done away, with our Medicine, the greater part of which,

                        <p n="32">XXXII. Again you must note, that Bodies are found to be of Perfection, if in the reiteration of their Cal cination and Reduction, they loose nothing of their Goodness, in respect of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, Weight, Quantity, or Lustre, (of which great care is to be taken in the manifold reiterations of these Operations) if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by repeating the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination and Reduction of altered Metals, they loose any thing in their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Goodness, it is to be supposed you have not rightly persued the Art.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LIV.</hi> Of Solution and its Cause.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. SOlution is the reducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a dry thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Water: and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Solution is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated with subtile Waters, such especially as are acute and sharp, and Saline, hav ing no Feces; as Spirits of Vinegar, of sower Grapes, of acid Pears, of Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, and the like Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lod.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The case of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, was the Subtile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of those things, which neither have Fusion nor Ingress, by which was lost the great advantage of fixed Spirits, and of those things which are of their Nature. For every thing which is dissolved, must necessarily have the nature of <hi>Salt</hi> or <hi>Alum,</hi> or their like.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And the nature of them is that they give <hi>Fusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> before their Vitrification;
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:65913:238"/>
therefore Spirits dissolved will likewise give <hi>Fusion:</hi> And since they in their own nature, agree with Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and each with other, <hi>Fusion</hi> being acquired, they must by that of necessity penetrate <hi>Bodies,</hi> and pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating them, transmute them.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But they neither pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate nor transmute with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our <hi>Magistery</hi> or Art, <hi>viz.</hi> That after Solution and Coagulation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there be added to it some one of the Spirits pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, not fixed; and then to be so often sublimed from it, till it remains with it, and gives to it a more swift <hi>fusion,</hi> and conserves the same in <hi>Fusion</hi> from <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trification.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. For the nature of Spirits is not to be Vitrified, but to preserve the mixture from Vitrification, as long as they are in it: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Spirit</hi> which more retains the nature of <hi>Spirits,</hi> more defends or preserves from Vitrification: And a <hi>Spirit</hi> only purified, more preserves than a <hi>Spirit,</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, calcined, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved: Therefore there is a necessity of mingling such a <hi>Spirit</hi> with the body; for from these there results good <hi>Fusion</hi> and <hi>Ingress,</hi> and true <hi>Fixation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Now we can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate by natural ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that things only holding the nature of Salts, Alums, and the like, are soluble: for in all nature we find no other things to dissolved but them; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what things soever are dissolved, must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be dissolved by their nature or property.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Yet since we see all things truly calcined, to be dissolved, by reiteration of Calcination and Solution; therefore we by that prove, that all Calcinates approach to the nature of Salts and Alums, and must of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity be themselves, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with these proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The way of solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is two-fold: 1. By hot

                        <p n="9">IX. To dissolve by Dung, is, That the Calcinate be put into a Glass Vessel, up on which must be affused Spirit of Vinegar, or the like, double its weight: Then the mouth of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel must be so closed, or stopt, that nothing may go forth, and the matter with its Vessel set in hot Dung to be dissolved, and the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution afterwards filtera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                        <p n="10">X.

                        <p n="11">XI.

                        <p n="12">XII. And that which is undissolved, let it again be calcined; and then again in the same manner dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which Work so often repeat, till the whole is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>COagulation</hi> is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a thing Liquid, to a solid substance, by deprivation of its moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture; for which there is a two-fold Cause; one is the Induration or hardening of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> (of which we have already treated, Chap. 48. Sect. 8. ad 23. The other is the freeing of Medicines dissolved from their Aquosity which is mixed or joyned with them, and so is varied according to the kinds of things to be Coagulated.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The way of Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating things dissolved, is by a Glass placed in Ashes up to its Neck, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual Fire not too hot put under it, and to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the whole Aquosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is Vanished.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Now seeing it is not possible to remove the true Essence of any thing in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the thing it self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, therefore it is said to be impossible to separate these corrupt things from them: for this cause some Philosophers have thought this Art not possible to be attained, and <hi>We,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed other <hi>Searchers</hi> in this Science have been brought to this very State of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. By reason of this, we as well as they were driven to Amazement, and
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65913:240"/>
for a long space of time lay under the shade of Despa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, yet returning to our selves, and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense trouble of dispai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoughts and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we considered Bodies diminished from Perfection, to be foul in the profundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Nature, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pure or clean to be found in them, because it was not in them according to Nature; for that which is not in a thing cannot be found there.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Seeing then nothing of perfection is found in them, therefore necessarily also, in the same nothing superfluous remains to be found, in separation of the divers substances in them, and in the profundity of their Nature, therefore by this, we found somewhat to be diminished in them, which must necessarily be compleated, by matter fit for it, and repairing the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Diminution in them is the Paucity of <hi>Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi> and not right Spissation or Coagulation of the same, therefore to compleat them, you must sufficiently aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> then rightly Inspissate or Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; and lastly induce a permanent fixion (of which we shall speak in the next Chapter.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p n="1">I. Fixation is right dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a Volatile or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive thing to abide and endure in the fire: The cause of the invention thereof is, that every Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and every Alterati on may be perpetuated in the thing altered, and not vanish.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It is manifold, accord ing to the diversity of things to be fixed, which are all the Bodies diminished from perfection, as <hi>Saturn, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, Mars,</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> and according to the diversity of Spirits also, which are <hi>Sulphur and Arsenick</hi> in one degree, and <hi>Argent Vive</hi> in another: Also <hi>Marchasite, Magnesia, Tutia,</hi> and such like, in the Third.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Therefore those Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies diminished from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, are fixed by their Calcination, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are freed from their volatile and corrupting Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureity; the which we have sufficiently declared in the Chapter of Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Also the manifold repititions of sublimation, more swiftly and better do abbreviate the time of Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. For this cause there was a second way of fixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion found out, which is by precipitating of it, sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into heat, that it may constantly abide therein, until it be fixed.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And this is done by a long glass Vessel, the bottom of which (made of Earth, not of Glass, for that it would crack) must be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially connexed with good luting; and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending matter, when it adheres to the sides of the Vessel, must with a Spatula
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65913:241"/>
of Iron or Stone be thrust down to the heat at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, and this precipitation reapted till the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be fixed. How <hi>Sulphur, Arsenick, Argent Tive, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasite, Magnesia,</hi> and <hi>Tutia</hi> are to be fixed, we have taught in their proper Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aforegoing.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. <hi>The Fixatory, Fornace,</hi> or <hi>Athanor.</hi> It must be made after the manner of the Fornace of Calcination, and in it must be set a deep Pan full of Ashes. But the Vessel, with the matter to be fixed, being firmly seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must be placed in the middle of the Ashes, so that the thickness of the Ashes underneath, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove in the compass of the Vessel, may be about four Inches, or according to that which you desire to fix: Because in fixing <hi>One,</hi> a greater fire is required, than in fixing <hi>another.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. By this Fornace, and this way the Ancient Philosophers attained to the Work of the Magistery; which to Men truly Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophizing, may be easily known, from what we have more than enough demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated in these our Books. And by those especially who are real searchers out of the Truth; we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you the Figure of the <hi>Athanor,</hi> yet let not this stop your farther invention, if you can possibly find out any thing more fit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>CEration</hi> is the mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, or softening of an hard thing, not fusible, unto Liquefaction; Whence it is evident, that the cause of the Invention of it was, That the matter which had not ingress into the Body
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:65913:242"/>
for Alteration, (by reason of Privation of its Liquefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) might be softned, so as to flow, and have Ingress.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Wherefore some thought Ceration was to be made with liquid Oyls and Waters, but that is error, and wholly remote from the Principles of this Natural Magistery, and denied by the manifest Operations of Nature.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For we find not, in those Metalick Bodies, that Nature has placed an humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity soon, or easie to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, but rather one of long duration, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of their Fusion and Mollification: For had they been replenished with an humidity easie, or soon to be removed, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily follow, that the <hi>Bodies</hi> would be totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of it, in one only Ignition; so that none of the Bodies, could afterwards be either hammered or melted.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Therefore imitating the Operations of Nature, we follow her way in <hi>Cera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> Nature <hi>Cerates</hi> in the Radix of fusible things, with an humidity, which is above all humidities, and able to endure the heat of fire: Therefore it is necessary for us also to <hi>Cerate</hi> with the like humidity.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. But this Cerative Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity is in nothing better, more possibly, or more nearly found, than in these, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Sulphur</hi> and in <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> nearly; but more nearly in <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> Whose humidity we see not to leave their Earth, by reason of the strong union which they have, and which nature has bestowed upon them in the Work of their Mixture.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But in all other things having humidity, you may find by experience, that the same is separated in Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from their Earthy substance; and after sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof, that they are deprived of all humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: In Spirits aforesaid, it is not so; so that we cannot omit taking them into the Work of <hi>Ceration.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <pb n="445" facs="tcp:65913:242"/>
VII. The way of <hi>Cerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by them, is thus. <hi>You must sublime them so often, upon the thing to be</hi> Cerated, <hi>until remaining with their humidity in it, they give good Fusion:</hi> But this cannot be effected before the perfect cleansing of them from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Corrupting thing.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And it seems bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to me that these should be first fixed by Oyl of <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> and every <hi>Ceration,</hi> fit and necessary in this Art be made with them.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Our Philosophick Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Water</hi> is thus made.

                        <p n="9">IX.

                        <p n="11">XI. From what has been said, 'tis evident, that what Nature left Superfluous or deficient in every of those <hi>Bodies</hi> that are imperfect, has been in part declared: and since it happens that the mutable Bodies of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, are of a twofold kind, <hi>viz,</hi> soft and Ignible, as <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter:</hi> and hard and not fusible with Ignition, as <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> the first indeed not fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but the other fusible with Ignition; Nature has taught us, That according
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:65913:244"/>
to the diversity of Essences in the Radix of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, divers Preparations, according to their Wants, must be administred to them.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. There are two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Imperfection of one kind, <hi>viz. Lead,</hi> which is Black, or <hi>Saturn;</hi> and <hi>Tin,</hi> which is White, or <hi>Jupiter;</hi> which from the innate Root of their nature, are divers each from other, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of their hidden parts, as well as in those which are outward.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. For <hi>Saturn</hi> is clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, livid, ponderous, black, without stridor or crashing, totally mute: But <hi>Jupiter</hi> is white, a little livid, crash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much, a little sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and something bright; Of the Differences of which we have already spoken in their particular Chapters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foregoing.</p>

they cannot be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, so, as that in <hi>Fusion</hi> they be not separated from the Commixtion after prolection of the Medicine al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering them: when you have formed this you have found one of the five dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of perfection.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Also, if the Medicine do not illustrate, and alter and alter into a <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Citrine</hi> Color (according to what your intention is) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a splendent bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and admirable Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; <hi>Bodies</hi> diminished from perfection are not perfected to the utmost.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. So also, if it abides not Lunar or Solar Fusion, it is not changed into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; because it abides not in the Tryal; but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together separated, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Commixti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which you may more amply determine by the <hi>Cineritium,</hi> of which we shall speak hereafter.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. If likewise the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine be not perpetuated with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="5">V. If it attains not to the weight of Perfection, [<hi>hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true ponderosity of</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na <hi>and</hi> Sol,] it is not firmly changed to a perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatment of Nature: for this <hi>weight</hi> is one of the signs of perfection. Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these differences of perfection are five, there is a necessity that our Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine should exhibit these Differences in Projection. Also it is evident from hence, That this Medicine must be prepared from Things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Affinity to Bodies, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily altering, and amicably adhering to them in their profundity: But searching through Universal Nature, we have found nothing which can do all this so well as <hi>Argent Vive</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, according to our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, of which the true Medicine is made to the highest Perfection.</p>

                        <p n="6">VI. Now since it changes not, without the alteration of its Nature, therefore it ought necessarily to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, that it may be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even in the profundity of <hi>Bodies, viz.</hi> That its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may be made such, that it may be mixed even in the profundity of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> alterable, without sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ever.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII.

                        <p n="8">VIII. Nor can this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine have perfect <hi>Fusion</hi> unless great Caution be used in its fixation, that it may soften hard Bodies, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the soft.

Whence it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that it should have such a Preparation, as may make it a most fulgent and purely clean substance, and fixed also; but these things must be done with such great Caution, (in respect to the regulation of the fire, and way of fixing) that in removing its Humidity, so much may be still left, for compleat and perfect Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fion.</p>

                        <p n="11">XI. There is also many other Considerations of the Weight, with their Causes
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:65913:246"/>
and Order. The Cause of great weight, is, the subtiltv of the substance of Bodies, and uniformity in their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: By which the parts of them may be so conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that nothing can come between. And the Density of Parts, is the encrease of weight, and the Perfection thereof.</p>

                        <p n="12">XII. <hi>First,</hi> They have in themselves an Earth most subtil and incombustible, altogether fixed with its own proper Radical Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, and apt for fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                        <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposition of their Natural Humidity is such, that by help of its own Oleaginity in all differences of its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, it contemperates the Earth annexed to it, with such an Unctuosity, and with such a Homogene and equal Union, and bond of inseparable Conjunction, that after the degree of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Preparation, it gives a good Fusion.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Olea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous Property, is of so great purity of Essence, and so artificially cleansed from all Combustible matter, that it burns not any <hi>Bodies</hi> with which it is conjoyned through their least parts, but preserves them from Combustion. <hi>Hermes.

shall here declare the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of all Medicines, which is three fold, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to three Orders.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. A Medicine of the first Order is every prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Minerals, which projected upon the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Bodies,</hi> impresses upon them an Alteration, but induces not a sufficient Compleatment; yet the altered <hi>Body</hi> is thereby changed and Corrupted, with the total evanishing of the Medicine, and all its Impressions.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Of this kind is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sublimation dealbative of <hi>Mars</hi> or <hi>Venus</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not Fixation: and of this kind, is every addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Color of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> or of <hi>Venus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, and <hi>Zyniar,</hi> and the like, set in a Fornace of Cementation.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. This Order changes with a mutation not dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by diminishing it self by Exhalation or Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And of this kind are these described, <hi>Chap.</hi> 44. <hi>Sect.</hi> 15, 16, 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 45. <hi>Sect.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21, 12, 23. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 46. <hi>Sect.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. aforegoing. And the Work of this first Order is called the lesser Work.</p>

                           <hi>2.</hi> Of Medicines of the second Order.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. A Medicine of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Order, I call every preparation, which being projected upon <hi>Bodies</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished from perfection, alters them to some certain degrees of perfection, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaving other degrees of Corruption, as is the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination of <hi>Bodies,</hi> by which all that is fugitive is burnt away and Consumed.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And of this Order are the Medicines Tinging <hi>Luna</hi> perpetually yellow, or perpetually dealbating <hi>Venus,</hi> leaving other diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of Corruption in them.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Now seeing the Medicine of <hi>Bodies</hi> to be cleansed is one; but of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive</hi> perfectly Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable another, we will first
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65913:248"/>
of all declare the Medicines for Bodies: and then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Medicine of the same <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable into a true <hi>Solifick</hi> and <hi>Lunifick Body.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. A Medicine of the second Order is that which does indeed perfect <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies,</hi> but with one only difference of perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But seeing there are many causes of Corruption in every of the imperfect <hi>Bodies,</hi> as in <hi>Saturn a Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Sulphureity, fugitive Argent Vive</hi> (by both which Corruption must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be induced,) and its <hi>Ter restreity:</hi> therefore Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of this second Order, are such as can only remove one of them, or covering it, adorn the same, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind it, all the other causes of Imperfection.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Since then in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, there is somewhat impermutable, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to them in their Radix, and which cannot be taken away by a <hi>Medicine</hi> of <hi>this Order:</hi> that Medicine, which totally removes that, from the mixtion, must be a <hi>Medicine</hi> of the third and Greater Order.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And because we find the <hi>Superfluities</hi> of things Volatile, to be removed by way of Calcination; and the <hi>Earthiness,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, abolished by repeated <hi>Reductions;</hi> therefore there was a necessity of inventing of a Medicine of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Order, which might indeed palliate the innate, soften the hard, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the soft Bodies, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the perfection of their Natures, and not So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistically; but perfectly constitute a true <hi>Lunifick,</hi> or <hi>Solifick,</hi> of imperfect <hi>Bodies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Since then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that in <hi>Bodies only Soft</hi> the hastiness of Melting cannot be taken away, by the Artifices of this Work; nor the innate impurity in the Radix of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples be removed; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of this Medicine was necessary, which in projection might Inspissate their Tenuity, and Inspis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sating
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:65913:248"/>
harden them, to a sufficiency of <hi>Ignition</hi> with their Melting.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. So also in <hi>hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> attenuating their Spis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>situde, to deduce them to a sufficient Velocity, Lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction or Melting, with their own property of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; and palliating them, to adorn the Clow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness of Bodies of either kind, transmuting the one into <hi>White,</hi> the other into <hi>Red</hi> most perfect.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII, This Medicine is differenced from a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of the <hi>third Order,</hi> only by Imperfection of a lesser or meaner preparation. But the <hi>Medicine Inspissating</hi> the <hi>Tenuity</hi> of <hi>soft Bodies,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires one kind of prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a Consumptive Fire: and that <hi>Attenuating</hi> the Spissitude of hard Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, another, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of their Humidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: of which kind are those in <hi>Chap.</hi> 43. <hi>Sect.</hi> 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 44. <hi>Sect.</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. aforegoing, which are in a mean or middle Order.</p>

                           <hi>3.</hi> Of Medicines of the third Order.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. This is every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, which when it is projected upon Bodies, takes away all Corruption and perfects them, with all the differences or signs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But this is one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and therefore by reason of it, we are not obliged to the use of the ten Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of the second Order.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. Of this Order there is a twofold Medicine, <hi>viz. Solar</hi> and <hi>Lunar,</hi> yet but one in Essence, and which have but one way in Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating; and therefore by our Ancestors, whose writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we have read, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led One only Medicine.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. However there is an addition of a Citrine Color, made of the most clean substance of fixed Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur which constitutes the difference between the one for the white, and the other for the yellow, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Lunar</hi> and <hi>Solar</hi> Medicine, the latter containing that
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:65913:249"/>
Color in it self, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. This is called the third Order, or Order of the Greater Work; and that because greater Care, Prudence, and Industry is required in the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration thereof to perfecti on, than in any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and also for that it needs greater Labor and longer time to compleat it for the highest Purity.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Therefore the Medicine of this Order is not diverse in Essence from the Medicines of the second Order, but only in respect of Degrees, as being more subtilized, and exalted to a much higher degree of Purity, Tincture, and Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, in the making and preparation thereof, with a long continued course of Labour.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. All which degrees in their proper place are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared with fincerity of Speech, and the way of preparation Exactly, with its Causes, and manifest Verity; as also the many degrees by which it is brought to Perfection:</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. For the <hi>Lunar</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine needs one way of preparation: but the <hi>Solar</hi> another, for the perfect preparation of its Tincture, with the Administration of Sulphur Tinging it: of which we have abundantly Spoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 46. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11, 12, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 47. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11, 12, 14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 48. <hi>Sect.</hi> 43, 44. aforegoing.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXI.</hi> How Ingression is procured.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. BEcause it happens that a Medicine will sometimes mix, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time not, therefore we shall
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:65913:249"/>
here declare the way of permixing, <hi>i. e.</hi> how every thing, or each particular Medicine not entering, may most profoundly acquire Ingress into a Body.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The way is by disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of that which Enters, and by dissolution of that which Enters not, and by commixing both Solutions: for it makes every thing to be Ingressive, of what kind soever it be, and to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned through its least parts.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Yet this is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated by Sublution: And <hi>Fusion</hi> is also accomplished by the same, in things not otherwise Fusible: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are more apt to have Ingress, and to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. This is the cause why we Calcine some things, which are not of the nature of these, to wit, that they may be the better dissolved: and they are dissolved, that they may the better receive Impression from them; and from them likewise, by these be prepared and cleansed.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Or, We give Ingress to these which are not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to enter by reason of their Spissitude, or Thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, with a manifold Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of the Sublimation, of Spirits not Inflamable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to wit, of <hi>Arse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick,</hi> and <hi>Argent Vive</hi> not fixed; or with manifold Reiteration of the Solution of that which has not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Yet this is a good Caution concerning things Impermixable, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Body be dissolved, which you would have to be changed and altered by these: and the things like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise Dissolved, which you would have both to enter and to alter.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Nevertheless Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be made of all parts, but of some; with which this or that Body, not another, must be imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed time after time.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. For by this means
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65913:250"/>
it has Ingress only into this or that, necessarily; but this does not necessarily happen into any other Body.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Every thing then must needs have Ingress by these ways; by the benefit whereof, it depends on the nature of that, to have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress (as we said before) and to Transmute with the Commixtion found out.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. By this precedent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse, is compleated our said number of Ten Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, with a sufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of them, [<hi>in order to the Great Work it self.</hi>]</p>

                        <p n="1">I. THE Solar and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar substance is on ly permanent in the Tryal by the <hi>Cineritium:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore searching out the true Differences of the Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of these perfect Bodies, and likewise the Causes of the <hi>Cineritium,</hi> we shall make tryal which of the Imperfect Bodies do more, and which do less endure or abide in the Examen of this Magistery.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But we have already sufficiently declared the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of these two Bodies in the profundity of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, <hi>viz.</hi> That their <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix,</hi> or first Principle of being, was a large quantity of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest substance of it; at first more Subtil, but afterwards Inspissate, till it could admit Fusion with Ignition.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Therefore whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Bodies diminished from Perfection, have more of Earthiness, the less abide or endure in this Examen; but what have less Earthiness, do more endure it.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Because these do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more adhere, by reason
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:65913:250"/>
of the Subtilty of their Parts, closely Permixing and Uniting them: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>Bodies</hi> that are of greater Tenuity, or on the contrary, of greater Spissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, than those which are in Perfection, must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be wholly separated from the Commixtion.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. For being not of the same Fusion, they are for that cause sake separated: And indeed <hi>Bodies</hi> which partake of a lesser quantity of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> are more easily separated from the said Commixtion.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. 'Tis evident then, that seeing <hi>Saturn</hi> is of much Earthiness, and contains but a small quantity of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> and of an easie Tenuity for Liquefaction, which are mostly opposite to a <hi>Cineritious Examen;</hi> therefore of all <hi>Bodies,</hi> by the Artifice of the <hi>Cineri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> it least endures in the Commixtion, yea it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and vanishes most speedily.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Seeing therefore of all imperfect <hi>Bodies,</hi> it most gives way and receeds; by that it is more fit for the <hi>Examen</hi> of our <hi>Magistery,</hi> and the reason is, because it sooner takes its flight, and sooner draws every of the imperfect Bodies with its self from the mixture.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Also by reason of this, the greater quantity of the perfect <hi>Bodies</hi> is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for the strong Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion, or mighty devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing force of the Fire of the <hi>Examen:</hi> and therefore by the tryal of <hi>Lead,</hi> it is less burnt, and more easily pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. And because the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> consists more of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and partakes of a lesser quantity of Earthiness, whereby it is of greater purity, and of a more subtil substance; therefore it is more safe in the Mixtion, than <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Venus;</hi> because it more adheres in the profundity thereof.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And for this cause a larger quantity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:65913:251"/>
Body is absumed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Jupiter</hi> conjoyned can be separated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixion: <hi>Venus</hi> gives Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion with <hi>Ignition;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its Fusion is slower of a perfect Body, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is separated from the Commixtion, yet more slowly than <hi>Saturn,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the <hi>Ignition</hi> of its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Substance.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. But because it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains less of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and has more of Earthiness, and a more thick Substance, therefore it is more easily separated from the Mixtion than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> because <hi>Jupi. ter</hi> more adheres in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity than <hi>Venus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. <hi>Mars</hi> has not Fusion, and therefore is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed, which is caused for want of Humidity: but if it happens that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with vehemency of Fire; then because it has not Humidity enough of its own, by imbibing the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity of <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> it is united thereto in its least parts.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Therefore, Tho' it has much Earth, and little <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and wants Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet it can by no slight Artifice be separated from them. By this Artifice [<hi>i. e. of the Cineritium</hi>] you come to the true rectifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every Body, if you understand perfectly what we have writ.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. There are two <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> perfect, abiding this tryal, to wit, <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> by reason of their good Composition, which results from their good Mixtion, and the pure Substance of them.</p>

less burned by the Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fire, <hi>i. e.</hi> they which contain a greater quantity of burning <hi>Sulphur</hi> more, but they which contain less, less: Therefore seeing <hi>Sol,</hi> has a lesser quantity of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> than other Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Bodies,</hi> it is not (in the midst of all Mineral <hi>Bodies</hi>) burnt by the force of fire.</p>
                        <p n="2">II.

And since there is but one only body incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible, that alone, or what is prepared according to the nature of it, is kept safe in <hi>Cement.</hi> But which abide more, and which less, are known with their Causes: <hi>Luna</hi> abides more, but <hi>Mars</hi> less, <hi>Jupiter</hi> yet less, and <hi>Venus</hi> less than <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but <hi>Saturn</hi> least of all.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The way of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination by <hi>Cement</hi> is thus. <hi>You must compound it of Infla mable things, of which kind are all blackening, flying, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating things,</hi> viz. Vitriol, Sal Armoniack, Verdigrise, Alum, <hi>or</hi> Plumous Alum, <hi>and a very small quantity of</hi> Sulphur, with Humane U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, <hi>and other like acute, and penetrating things: All which are made into a Paste, with the Urine aforesaid, and spread upon thin plates of that</hi> Body, which you intend to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine by this way of Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <hi>IX.</hi> Then the said plates must be laid upon a Grate of Iron, included in an Earthen Vessel; but so as not to touch one another, that the power of the Fire may have free and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual access to them. Thus the whole must be kept in <hi>Fire,</hi> in a strong Earthen Vessel for the space of <hi>3</hi> days, but with this Caution, That the plates may be kept Red Fire hot, but not melt.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. After the third day, you will find the Plates cleansed from all impurity, if the <hi>Body</hi> of them was perfect; if not, they will be wholly corrupted and burnt in the Calcination.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Some expose Plates of Metal to Calcination, without a Composition of Cement, and they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in like manner, if the <hi>Body</hi> be perfect: If not, they are totally consumed: But in this kind of <hi>Examen</hi> they must have a longer space of time, (for that
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:65913:253"/>
they are purified by the only force of Fire) than if they were Examined by the help of <hi>Cement.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. And for that the nature of <hi>Luna</hi> differs not much from the nature of <hi>Sol,</hi> therefore of necessity it rests with it in the Tryal by <hi>Cement,</hi> and there is no separation of <hi>Bodies</hi> one from another in these two kinds of Tryal, unless that be caused by reason of the Diversity of the Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their substances.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. For from thence results the Diversity of Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Thickness, or Thinness or Rarity, which are indeed the causes of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration; for that, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the strong Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of some, their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is not corrupted by the substance of the <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Body,</hi> in as much as a mixtion of them, cannot be made through their least parts.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Therefore in such a commixture, they must necessarily be separated each from other, without the total corruption of their Essences. And the perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>imperfect Bodies</hi> is discerned, when they are by Ingenuity of preparation found to be of the same Fusion, Ignition, and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. SInce <hi>Bodies</hi> of greatest Perfection, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate Ignition, are found to receive the Fire before fusion of them; therefore we say, if our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is to find out the com pleat alteration of them, there is a necessity to bring such Bodies to their Fusion.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And before these <hi>perfect Bodies</hi> be Fused, to see them admit <hi>Iguition</hi> with Inflamation of a pleasing Celestine Color, and this,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:65913:253"/>
before their Ignition comes to the whiteness of Fire, which by the Eye can in in no wise be discerned.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. 'Tis evident then, that the <hi>perfect Ignition</hi> of them is before Fusion, with intense <hi>Redness,</hi> and not with whiteness, which the Eye cannot behold: for if the prepared <hi>Bodies</hi> be <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> before they are <hi>red hot</hi> with Fire, they stand not in perfection.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And if they be made <hi>Red Fire hot</hi> with labor, and great Violence of Fire, their preparation is not true and perfect; and this indeed if it happen in <hi>soft Bodies,</hi> for that the same is only found in <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. Because <hi>Ignible Bodies</hi> do not easily in the way of preparation admit <hi>Ignition;</hi> nor <hi>Fusible Bodies</hi> the <hi>right Fusion,</hi> which we find to be in <hi>Bodies</hi> perfect according to Nature.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. If Bodies prepared, in their <hi>Ignition,</hi> give not a flame of a pleasing Celestine Color, their preparation is not compleat.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And if any part of the <hi>Weight, Color, Beauty, Ignition</hi> and the like, be found diminished, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Differences, or force of the Preparation, you have not rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded: therefore you must search again till you find out your Error, and chance to hit upon the right way through the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodness.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>FUsion</hi> with <hi>Ignition</hi> is the only Argument of Perfection; yet not with every kind of <hi>Ignition,</hi> but with Ignition in which the <hi>Body</hi> waxeth not altogether <hi>white;</hi> and with <hi>Ignition</hi> in which is not made a dull paleness of Fire, and in which, the <hi>body</hi> is not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:65913:254"/>
Melted, or flowes not immediately after <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">II. For when a <hi>body</hi> flows with the very small force of a weak Fire, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Ignition,</hi> or with a <hi>pallid Ignition;</hi> the <hi>body</hi> thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, must needs be still an imperfect body.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And if a <hi>body</hi> after Fusion, be not suffered pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to coole, and its <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi> be presently turned wholly into blackness, and by reason thereof, looseth its Ignition, before it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes hard, it is not a <hi>body</hi> brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, of what kind so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be. Now this is from its softness, and is one of the kinds of <hi>imperfect bodies.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. If the Ignition of a body before Fusion thereof be made with great Labor, and Violence of a strong Fire, and with a Ray of brightness Inestimable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together white and shining, it is not a <hi>perfect body,</hi> but a <hi>body</hi> of hardness altered.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. If also after Fusion thereof, and when taken from the Fire, it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently hardned, that it flows not, the fulgent Ignition thereof yet remaining, it is not a body of <hi>Lunar</hi> or <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> perfection, but comes under the nature of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. By what has been said, then, it is evident, that in <hi>bodies Fusible,</hi> a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Ignition</hi> may be found before Melting of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Pallid;</hi> another <hi>Red and clear;</hi> and a third most <hi>white,</hi> shining with <hi>Rays.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The first of these is an Ignition of <hi>soft Bodies;</hi> the second of <hi>perfect bodies,</hi> the third of hard bodies, as is proved by Reason and Experience.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. If you would find out the Degree of all these <hi>Ignitions,</hi> to compleat all <hi>Fusible bodies,</hi> you must learn the Compleat sufficiency for the perfection of Fusion; and by considering, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

the difference of all the Signs of the Degree of Fufion; thus may you find it out, otherwise not.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. We then (from see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this) imitating Nature, do in manner produce a Celestine Color in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>bodies,</hi> which Color is perfected by the goodness of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> as we have formerly declared.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Whatever prepared <hi>bodies</hi> then, being put over the Vapors of acute things, do not produce a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Celestine Color, they are not yet brought to the total Perfection of their preparation.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. There are some <hi>bodies,</hi> which in the <hi>Examen</hi> of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line things, flower in their Superfices, with a <hi>dull Red,</hi> or <hi>dull Citrine</hi> Color mixt with Greenness: of this kind is <hi>Mars.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Some flower with a <hi>dull Greenness,</hi> mixt with a Turbid Celestine Color; of this kind is <hi>Venus.</hi> Some are found to yield a <hi>dull White,</hi> and of this kind is <hi>Saturn:</hi> And some a <hi>clear White,</hi> of which kind is <hi>Jupiter.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Hence it is evident that the most perfect Body flowers least, or nothing at all; and if it yields any

                        <p n="8">VIII. And by this Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or probation, it may be known, in what kind of temperament, the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Body</hi> does consist; if you rightly conceive the Order of these things here declared.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. HAving now handled the Experiences and Causes of the power of this our Magistery, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the necessity, order and method of our proposed Discourse, it only remains, that we should at once declare the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this whole Divine Work; and in few words contract the dispersed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery into one Sum, in general heads.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. We say then, that the Sum of the whole Art, and of the Operations of this whole Work, is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than that the Stone,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:65913:256"/>
Magistery, Elixir, or Tincture (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in its Chapters) should be taken, and with diligent Labour and Industry, that Sublimation of the first degree be repeated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it: for by this it will be cleans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from corrupting Impurity.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And the perfection of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limation, is the Subtilization of the Stone by it, until it can be brought to the ultimate purity of <hi>

                        <p n="4">IV. This being done, by the way of Fixation, it must be fixed, until it can dwell and remain in the highest Violence or Force os Fire: and herein consists the measure of the second degree of preparation.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The Stone is likewise pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared in the third degree, which consists in the Ultimate compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the work, or perfection of the preparation, which is this: The now fixed Stone, you must make by the way of Sublimation Volatile, and the Volatile fixed.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The fixed you must also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve, and the dissolved again make Volatile; and the Volatile again make fixed, until it flow and alter or change into Solifick or Lunifick with all the signs of perfection.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. From the reiteration of the preparations of this third de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, results the Multiplication of the Virtue and Quantity of the Medicine in goodness and purity to the highest perfection in kind.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. From the diversity then of the Operations reiterated upon the Stone, Elixir, or Tincture, in its degrees, results the variety of the Multiplication of the goodness of the Alteration, and quantity of the Medicine for Transmutation according to their kind.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. So that among the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, some transmute into a true Lunifick Body of perfection, and fome into a true Solifick Body of the perfection of the Solar kind.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And of these Medicines, some transmute an hundred-fold as much as their own weight is, some two hundred fold, some three hundred fold, some a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand fold, and some to infinity, so that from hence it may easily be known whether the magistery is brought up to perfection or not.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Now that the Envious may not Calumniate us, we declare, that we have not treated of this our Art with a continued Series of Discourse, but have dispersed it in divers Chapters: and this was done, that evil men might not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surp it unworthily: Therefore we have concealed it in its places, where yet we indeed speak openly, and not under an <hi>AEnigma,</hi> but in a clear and plain Discourse.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. I <hi>John Pontanus</hi> have travelled through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Countries, that I might know the certainty of the Philosophers Stone; and passing through the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, I found many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, but no true Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers, which put me upon incessant Studying, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many doubts, 'till at length I found out the Truth.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. When I attained the knowledge of the Matter in general, yet I erred at least two hundred times, before I could attain to know the singular thing it self, with the work and practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="438" facs="tcp:65913:262"/>
III First, I began with the putrefaction of the Matter, which I continued for nine Months together, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained nothing. I then for some certain time proved a <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> but in vain: After that, I used a Fire of Calcination for threemonths space, and still found my self out of the way.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. I essayed all sorts of Distillations and Sublimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Philosophers, <hi>Geber, Archelaus,</hi> and all the rest of them have prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and yet found nothing: In sum, I attempted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole work of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymy</hi> by all imaginable and likely means, as by Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dung, Baths, Ashes, and other heats of divers kinds, all which are found in the Philosophers Books, yet without any success.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. I yet continually for three Years together studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Books of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and that chiefly in <hi>Hermes,</hi> (whose concise Words comprehend the sum of the whole Matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <pb n="439" facs="tcp:65913:262"/>
the Secret of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, by an obscure way of Speaking, of what is Superior, and what is Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, to wit, of Heaven and of Earth.)</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. Therefore our Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which brings the Mat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter into being, in the first, second, and third Work, is not the heat of a Bath, nor Horse-dung, nor Ashes, nor of the other Fires, which Philosophers excogitate in their Books: Shall I demand then, what it is that perfects the Work, since the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have thus concealed it? Truly, being moved with a generous Spirit, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it, with the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Work.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. The <hi>Lapis Philoso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phorum</hi> therefore is but one, though it has many Names, which before you conceive them, will be very difficult. For it is Watery, Airey, Fiery, Earthy: It is Salt, Sulphur, Mercury, and Phlegm: It is Sulphureous yet is <hi>Argent vive;</hi> it has many Superfluities, which are turned into the true Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:65913:263"/>
by the help of our Fire.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. He which separates any thing from the Subject or Matter, thinking it to be necessary, wholly Errs in his Philosophy: That which is superfluous, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, filthy, feculent, and in a word, the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the subject is tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smuted or changed into a perfect, fixt, and spiritual Body, by the help of our Fire, which the Wise Men never revealed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that few attain to this Art, as thinking that to be superfluous and impure, which is not.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. It behoves us now to enquire after the properties of our Fire, and how it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with our Matter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which I have said, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be made, though the Fire is not such as to burn the Matter, separating nothing from it, nor divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the pure parts from the impure, as the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers teach, but transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and changing the whole
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:65913:263"/>
Subject iuto Purity: Nor does it sublime after the manner of <hi>Geber's</hi> Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor the Sublimations or Distillations of <hi>Arnoldus,</hi> or others; but it is perfected in a short time.</p>
                           <p n="10">X. It is a Matter Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, equal, continuous, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours or fumes not, unless too much provoked; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of Sulphur, and is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken otherwise than from Matter; it destroys all things, dissolves, congeals, coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and calcines, adapted to penetrate, and is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium, without any great cost.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. And that is the Fire, with a gentle heat, soft or remiss, by which the whole Work is perfected, together with all the proper Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations. They who read <hi>Geber,</hi> with all the rest of the Philosophers, though they should survive an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand Years, yet would they not be able to comprehend it, for that this Fire is found by a profound cogitation only, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once apprehended, may
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:65913:264"/>
be gathered out of Books, and not before.</p>
                           <p n="12">XII. The error therefore in this Work proceeds chiefly from a not knowing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the true Fire, which is one of the moving Principles that Transmutes the whole Matter into the true Philosophers Stone; and therefore diligently find it out: Had I found that first, I had never been two hundred times mistaken in the pursuit of the Matter I so long sought after.</p>
                           <p n="13">XIII. For which cause sake, I wonder not that so many, and so great Men, have not attained unto the Work: They have erred, they do err, and they will err; because the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers (<hi>Artephius</hi> only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) have concealed the principal or proper Agent. And unless I had read <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tephius,</hi> and sensibly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood his Speech, I had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver arrived to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Work.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. Now the practical Part is this: Let the Matter
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:65913:264"/>
be taken and dilligently ground with a Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Contrition, put it upon the Fire, with such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of heat, that it only excite or stir up the Matter; and in a short time that Fire, without any laying on of hands, will compleat the whole Work, because it pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefies, corrupts, generates, and perfects, and makes the three principal Colours, <hi>viz.</hi> the Black, White, and Red to appear.</p>
                           <p n="15">XV. And by the means of this our Fire, the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine will be multiplied, (by addition of the crude Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,) not only in Quantity, but also in Quality or Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: Therefore seek out this Fire with all thy Industry, for having once found it, thou shalt accomplish thy desire, because it performs the whole Work, and is the true Key of all the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which they never yet revealed. Consider well of what I have spoken concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Properties of this Fire, and thou must know it, otherwise it will be hid from thine Eyes.</p>
                           <p n="16">
                              <pb n="444" facs="tcp:65913:265"/>
XVI. Being moved with Generosity, I have written these things, but that I might speak plainly, this Fire is not Transmuted with the Matter, because it is nothing of the Matter, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared. And these things I thought fit to speak, as a warning to the prudent Sons of Art, that they spend not their Money unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but may know what they ought to look after, for by this only they may attain to the perfection of this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, and by no other means.

                           <p n="1">I. ANtimony is a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral participating of Saturnine parts, and has in all respects the nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: This Saturnine Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:65913:265"/>
agrees with Sol, and contains in it self Argent vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, in which no Metal is swallowed up, except Gold; and Gold is truly swallowed up by this Antimonial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Without this Argent Vive no Metal whatsoever can be whitened; it whitens Laton, <hi>i. e.</hi> Gold; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth a perfect Body into its <hi>prima Materia,</hi> or first Matter, (<hi>viz.</hi> into Sulphur and Argent Vive,) of a white Colour, and out-shining a Looking-Glass</p>
                           <p n="3">III. It dissolves (I say) the perfect Body, which is so in its own Nature; for this Water is friendly and agreeable with the Metals, whitening Sol, because it contains in it self white, or pure Argent Vive.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. And from both these you may draw a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canum, <hi>viz.</hi> a Water of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnine Antimony, mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and white; to the end, that it may whiten Sol, not burning, but dissolving, and afterwards congealing to the
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:65913:266"/>
consistence or likeness of white Cream.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Therefore, saith the Philosopher, this Water makes the Body to be vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile; because after it has been dissolved in it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigidated, it ascends above, and swims upon the surface of the Water.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. Take (saith he) crude Leaf-Gold, or calcin'd with Mercury, and put it into our Vinegar, made of Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine Antimony, Mercurial, and Sal Armoniack, (as is said) in a broad Glass Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and four Inches high, or more; put it into a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heat, and in a short time you will see elevated a Liquor, as it were Oyl, swimming a top, much like a Scum.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII.

But first this Sol by putrefaction and resolution in this Water, loseth all its light or brightness, and will grow dark and black; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it will ascend above the Water, and by little and little will swim upon it, in a substance of a white colour.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV.

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:65913:268"/>
because that when it feels the vulgar Fire, if there be in it the pure or fine bodies of Sol or Luna, it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately melts them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts them into its white Substance, such as it self is, and gives to the Body co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, weight, and tincture.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. In it also is a power of liquifying or melting all things that can be melted or dissolved; it is a Water ponderous, viscous, precious, and worthy to be esteemed, resolving all crude Bodies into their <hi>prima Materia,</hi> or first Matter, <hi>viz.</hi> into Earth and a viscous Pouder; that is, into Sulphur, and Argen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum vivum.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. If therefore you put into this Water, Leaves, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or Calx of any Metal, and set it in a gentle Heat for a time, the whole will be dissolved, and converted into a viscous Water, or white Oil, as aforesaid.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Thus it mollifies the Body, and prepares it for fusion and liquesaction; yea, it makes all things fusible,

                              <hi>viz.</hi> Stones and Metals, and afterwards gives them Spirit and Life.</p>

                           <p n="6">VI.

                           <p n="13">XIII. But their solution, is also their coagulation, for they have one and the same operation, because one is not dissolved, but the other is congealed: Nor is there any other water which can dissolve the Bodies, but that which abideth with them in the matter and the form.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. It cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent unless it be of the nature of the other Bodies, that they may be made one.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. THus you see that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to be amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by its own like Nature; that is, Gold and Silver are to be exalted in our water, as our water also with those Bodies; which water is called the medium of the Soul, without which nothing is to be done in this Art.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. It is a Vegetable, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and Animal fire, which conserves the fixed Spirits of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> but destroys and conquers their Bodies: For it destroys, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturns, and changes Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and metallick forms, making them to be no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies but a fixed Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. And it turns them into a humid substance, soft and fluid, which hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression and power to enter into other imperfect bodies,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:65913:271"/>
and to mix with them in their smallest parts, and to tinge them and make them perfect.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. But this they could not do while they remained in their metallick Forms or Bodies, which were dry and hard, whereby they could have no entrance into other things, so as to tinge &amp; make perfect, what was before imperfect.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. It is necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to convert the Bodies of Metals into a fluid substance; for that every tincture will tinge a thousand times more in a soft and liquid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, than when it is in a dry one, as is plainly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in Saffron.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. Therefore the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of imperfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, is impossible to be done by perfect Bodies, while they are dry and hard: for which cause sake, they must be brought back into their first matter, which is soft and fluid.</p>
                           <p n="7">
                              <pb n="457" facs="tcp:65913:271" rendition="simple:additions"/>
VII. It appears therefore, that the moisture must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that the hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure may be revealed. And this is called the reincruda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies, which is the decocting &amp; softning them, till they lose their hard and dry substance or form; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which is dry does not enter into, nor tinge any thing besides it self.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. Therefore the dry terrene Body doth not enter into nor tinge, except its own body, nor can it tinge except it be tinged; because (as I said before) a thick drie earthy matter does not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate nor tinge, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, because it cannot enter or penetrate it can make no alteration in the matter to be altered.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. For this reason it is, that Gold coloureth not, until its internal or hidden spirit be drawn forth out of it bowels by this our white water, and that it be made altogether a spiritual sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, a white Vapour, a white Spirit, and a wonderful Soul.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. IT behoves us therefore by this our Water to attenuate, alter, and soften the perfect Bodies, to wit Sol and Luna, that so they may be mixed with other imperfect Bodies.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. From whence, if we had no other benefit by this our Antimonial water, than that it rendred Bodies more subtil, soft, and fluid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its own nature, it would be sufficient.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. But more than that, it brings back Bodies to their first original of Sulphur and Mercury, that of them we may afterwards in a little time (in less than an hours time) do that above ground, which Nature was a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years a doing of under ground, in the Mines of the
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:65913:272"/>
Earth, which is a work al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most miraculous.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. And therefore our ultimate, or highest Secret is, by this our water, to make Bodies volatile, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and a Tincture, or tinging water, which may have ingress or entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other Bodies.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. For it makes Bodies to be meerly Spirit, because it reduces hard and dry Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and prepares them for fusion, melting, or dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; that is, it converts them into a permanent or fixed water.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. And so it makes of Bodies a most precious and desirable Oyl, which is the true Tincture, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent or fixed white wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by nature hot and moist, or rather temperate, subtile, fusible as Wax, which does penetrate, sink, tinge, and make perfect the Work.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. And this our water immediately dissolves Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies (as Sol and Luna) and makes them into an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustible
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:65913:273"/>
Oyl, which then may be mixed with other imperfect Bodies.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. It also converts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bodies into the nature of a fusible Salt, which the Philosophers call <hi>Sal Alebrot Philosophorum,</hi> better and more noble than any other Salt, being in its own nature fixed, and not subject to vanish in fire.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. It is an Oyl indeed by nature hot, subtile, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrating, sinking through and entring into other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: it is called the Perfect or Great Elixir, and the hidden Secret of the wise Searchers of Nature.</p>

He therefore that knows this Salt of Sol and Luna, and its generation and preparation, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards how to commix it, and make it homogene with other imperfect Bodies; he in truth knows one of the greatest Secrets of Nature, and the only way that leads to perfection.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. THese Bodies thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by our water are called Argent Vive, which is not without its Sulphur, nor the Sulphur without the fixedness of Sol and Luna; because Gold and Silver are the particular means, or medium in the form through which Nature passes in the perfecting and compleating thereof.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. And this Argent Vive is called our esteemed and valuable Salt, being anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and pregnant, and our fire, for that it is nothing but Fire: yet not fire, but Sulphur; and not Sulphur only, but also Quicksilver drawn from Sol and Luna by our water, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">
                                 <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> to a Stone of Great price.</p>

                              <pb n="462" facs="tcp:65913:274"/>
III. That is to say, it is the matter or substance of Sol and Luna, or Silver and Gold, altered from Vileness to Nobility.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Now you must note that this white Sulphur is the Father and Mother of the Metals; it is our Mercury, and the Mineral of Gold; also the Soul, and the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea, the Mineral Virtue, and the living Body; our Sulphur, and our Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silver; that is, Sulphur of Sulphur; Quicksilver of Quicksilver, and Mercury of Mercury.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. The Property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of our Water is, that it melts or dissolves Gold and Silver, and encreases their native Tincture or Color.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. For it changes their Bodies from being Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, into a Spirituality: and it is this water which turns the Bodies, or corporeal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance into a white vapour, which is a Soul that is white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness it self, subtile, hot, and full of fire.</p>
                           <p n="7">
                              <pb n="463" facs="tcp:65913:274"/>
VII. This water is also called the tinging or blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour-making stone, being the virtue of the Spiritual Tincture, without which nothing can be done: and it is the subject of all things that may be melted, and of liquefaction it selt, which agrees perfectly, and unites closely with Sol and Luna, from which it can never be separated.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. For it is joyned in affinity to the Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but more immediately to the Gold than to the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: which you are to take special notice of.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. It is also called the medium of conjoyning the Tinctures of Sol and Luna with the inferior or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Metals; for it turns the Bodies into the true Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, to tinge the said other imperfect Metals: also it is the water which whiteneth, as it is whiteness it self; which quickeneth as it is a Soul; and therefore (as the Philosopher saith) quickly entreth into its Body.</p>
                           <p n="10">
                              <pb n="464" facs="tcp:65913:275"/>
X. For it is a living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which comes to moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the Earth, that it may spring out, and in its due season bring forth much fruit; for all things spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Earth, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced through Dew or Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. The Earth therefore springeth not forth without watering and moisture: It is the water proceeding from <hi>May</hi> Dew, that cleanseth the Body; and like Rain it penetrates them, and makes one new Body of two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                           <p n="12">XII. This Aqua Vitae, or Water of Life, being rightly ordered and disposed with the body, it whitens it, and converts or changes it into its white colour.</p>
                           <p n="13">XIII. For this water is a white vapour, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Body is whitened with it.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. It behoves you therefore to whiten the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and open its infoldings:
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:65913:275"/>
for between these two, that is, between the Body and the Water, there is a desire and friendship, like as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Male and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, because of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquity and likeness of their Natures.</p>
                           <p n="15">XV. Now this our second and living water is called <hi>Azoth,</hi> the Water washing the Laten, <hi>viz.</hi> the Body compounded of Sol and Luna by our first Water: It is also called the Soul of the dissolved Bodies, which Souls we have even now tied together, for the use of the wise Philosopher.</p>
                           <p n="16">XVI. How precious then, and how great a thing is this Water! For without it the Work could never be done or perfected: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the <hi>Vas Naturae,</hi> the Belly, the Womb, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of the Tincture, the Earth, the Nurse.</p>
                           <p n="17">XVII. It is the Royal Fountain in which the King and Queen bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and the Mother which must be put into, and
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:65913:276"/>
sealed up within the belly of her Infant; and that is Sol himself, who proceeded from her, and whom she brought forth; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have loved one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother as Mother and Son, and are conjoyned together, because they come from one and the same Root, and are of the same Substance and Nature.</p>
                           <p n="18">XVIII. And because this Water is the Water of the Vegetable Life, it causes the dead Body to vegetate, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and spring forth, and to rise from Death to Life, by being dissolved first, and then sublimed.</p>
                           <p n="19">XIX. And in doing this, the Body is converted into a Spirit, and the Spirit (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) into a Body; and then is made the Amity, the Peace, the Concord, and the Union of the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to wit, between the Body and the Spirit, which reciprocally, or mutually change their Natures which they receive, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one to another through their most minute parts.</p>
                           <p n="20">
                              <pb n="467" facs="tcp:65913:276"/>
XX. So that that which is hot, is mixed with that which is cold, the dry with the moist, and the hard with the soft; by which means there is a mixture made of contrary Natures, <hi>viz.</hi> of cold with hot, and moist with dry, even a most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Unity between E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies.</p>

                           <p n="4">IV. Then have we also the Body, Soul, and Spirit altogether; of which Spirit and Soul it is said, That they cannot be extracted from the perfect Bodies, but by the help or conjunction of our dissolving Water.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Because it is certain, That the thing fixed cannot be lifted up, or made to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, but by the conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or help of that which is volatile.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. The Spirit therefore by the help of the Water and the Soul, is drawn forth
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:65913:277"/>
from the Bodies themselves, and the Body thereby is made Spiritual; for that at the same instant of time, the Spirit, with the Soul of the Bodies, ascend on high to the superiour part, which is the perfection of the Stone, and is called Sublimation.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. This Sublimation, saith <hi>Florentius Cathalanus,</hi> is made by things Acid, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Volatile, and which are in their own nature Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous and Viscous, which dissolve Bodies, and make them to ascend, and be changed into Air and Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. And in this Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation a certain part of our said first Water ascends with the Bodies, joyning it self with them, ascending and subliming into one neutral or complex Substance, which contains the nature of the two, <hi>viz.</hi> the nature of the two Bodies, and of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                           <p n="11">XI. Because from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth this Tincture runs like Oil, running through, and penetrating the Bodies, and giving to them its wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fixity; and this Tincture is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Soul, and the Soul is the Body.</p>
                           <p n="12">XII. For in this operation the Body is made a Spirit, of a most subtile nature; and again, the Spirit is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porified and changed into the nature of the Body, with the Bodies, whereby our Stone consists of a Body, a Soul, and a Spirit.</p>

XIII. O God, how thro' Nature dost thou change a Body into a Spirit! Which could not be done, if the Spirit were not incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Bodies, and the Bodies made volatile with the Spirit, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards permanent or fixed.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. For this Cause sake, they have passed over into one another, and by the Influence of Wisdom are converted the one into the other. O Wisdom! How thou makest the most fix'd Gold to be volatile and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive, yea, though by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it is the most fixed of all things in the World!</p>
                           <p n="15">XV. It is necessary there fore to dissolve and liquifie these Bodies by our Water, and to make them a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or fixed Water, a pure golden Water, leaving in the bottom the gross, earthy, superfluous and dry Matter.</p>
                           <p n="16">XVI. And in this Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, making thin and pure, the Fire ought to be gentle; but if in this Sublimation

with a soft Fire, the Bodies be not purified, and the grofs or earthy parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, [note this well,] be not separated from teh impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Dead, you shall not be able to perfect the Work.</p>
                           <p n="17">XVII. For thou needest nothing but that thin and subtil part of the dissolved Bodies, which our Water will give thee, if thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedest with a slow or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fire, by separating the things heterogene, from the things homogene.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. IT is most certain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this Art, That this Soul extracted from the Bodies, cannot be made to ascend, but by adding to it a volatile Matter, which is of its own kind.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. By the which the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will be made volatile
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:65913:281"/>
and spiritual, lifting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up, subtillizing and subliming themselves, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their own proper nature, which is corporeal, heavy, and ponderous.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. And by this means they are unbodied, or made no bodies, to wit, incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real, and a Quintessence of the nature of a Spirit, which is called <hi>Avis Hermetis,</hi> and <hi>Mercurius Extractus,</hi> drawn from a red Subject or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. And so the terrene or earthy parts remain below, or rather the grosser parts of the Bodies, which can by no Industry or Ingenuity of Man be brought to a perfect dissolution.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. And this white Vapor, this white Gold, to wit, this Quintessence, is called also the <hi>Compound Magnesia,</hi> which like Man does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, or like Man is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of a Body, Soul, and Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. Now the Body is the fixed solar Earth, exceeding
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:65913:282"/>
the most subtile Matter, which by the help of our divine Water is with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty lifted up or separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. The Soul is the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Sol and Luna, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or communicating of these two, (to wit, the Bodies of Sol and Luna, and our Water.)</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. And the Spirit is the mineral power, or vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Bodies, and of the Water which carries the Soul or white Tincture in or upon the Bodies, and also out of the Bodies; like as the Tinctures or Colours in Dying Cloth are by the Water put upon, and diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in and through the whole Cloth.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. And this Mercurial Spirit is the Chain or Band of the solar Soul; and the solar Body; is that Body which contains the Spirit &amp; Soul, having the power of fixing in it self, being joyned with Luna.</p>
                           <p n="10">
                              <pb n="479" facs="tcp:65913:282" rendition="simple:additions"/>
X. The Spirit therefore penetrates, the Body fixes, and the Soul joyns together, tinges and whitens.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. From these three u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together, is our Stone made; to wit, of Sol, Luna, and Mercury.</p>
                           <p n="12">XII. Therefore with this our Golden-Water, a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Substance is extracted, exceeding all natural Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; and so, except the Bodies be broken and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, imbibed, made subtile and fine, thriftily and diligently managed, 'till they are abstracted from, or lose their grossness or solid Substance, and be changed into a thin and subtil Spirit, all our Labour will be in vain.</p>
                           <p n="13">XIII. And unless the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies be made no Bodies, or incorporeal, that is, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into the Philosophers Mercury, there is no Rule of Art yet found out to work by.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is impossible to
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:65913:283"/>
draw out of the Bodies all that most thin and subtile Soul, which has in it self the Tincture, except it be first resolved in our Water</p>
                           <p n="15">XV. Dissolve then the Bodies in this our Golden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, and boil them till all the Tincture is brought forth by the Water, in a white Colour, and a white Oil; and when you see this whiteness upon the Water, then know that the Bodies are melted, liquified, or dissolved.</p>
                           <p n="16">XVI. Continue then this boyling, till the dark, black, and white Cloud is brought forth, which they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>

                           <p n="6">VI. When therefore you see the Bodies dissolved in the first viscous Water, then know, that they are turned into a Vapour, and that the Soul is separated from the dead Body, and by Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, brought into the order of Spirits.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII.

                           <p n="10">X. Wherefore, unless the Bodies be attenuated, or made thin, by the Fire and Water, 'till they ascend in a Spirit, and are made, or do become like Water and Vapour, or Mercury, you labour wholly in vain.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. But when they arise or ascend, they are born or brought forth in the Air or Spirit, and in the same they are changed, and made Life with Life, so as they can never be separated, but are as Water mixt with Water.</p>

                           <p n="4">IV. Thus you may see, that you need not many things, and that this our work requires no great Charges, for that as there is but one Stone, there is but one Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, one Vessel, one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of working, and one successive Disposition to the White and the Red.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. And altho we say in many places, take this, and take that; yet we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that it behoves us to take but one thing, and put it once into the Vessel, until the Work be perfected.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. But these things are so set down by the Obscure Philosophers, to deceive the unwary, as we have before spoken; for is not this <hi>Ars</hi>

                           <p n="7">VII. Truly, I tell thee, (that as for my Self I am no ways self-seeking or envious as others are; but) he that takes the Words of the other Philosophers, according to their common Signification; he even already (having lost <hi>Ariadnes</hi> clue of Thread) wanders in the midst of the Labyrinth, multiplies Errors, and casts away his Money for nought.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. And I <hi>Artephius,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I became an Adept, and had attained to the true and compleat Wisdom, by stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying the Books of the most faithful <hi>Hermes,</hi> the speaker of Truth, was sometimes Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure also, as the others were.</p>

my Head, since the time I was born to this day, through the alone goodness of God Almighty, by the use of this wonderful Quintessence.)</p>
                           <p n="10">X. When I say for so very long a time (as a Thousand Years) I found no Man that had found out or obtained this Hermetick Secret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the obscurity of the Philosophers Words.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. Being moved with a Generous Mind, and the integrity of a good Man, I have determined in these latter days of my Life, to declare all things truly and sincerely, that you may not want any thing for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of this Stone of the Philosophers.</p>
                           <p n="12">XII. (Excepting one cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thing, which is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for me to discover to any, because it is either revealed or made known, by God himself, or taught by some Master, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he that can bend himself to the search of, by the help of little Experience, may easily learn in this Book.)</p>

XIII. And in this Book I have therefore written the naked Truth, altho clothed or disguised with a few Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; yet so that every good and wise Man may happily gather those desirable Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Hesperides from this our Philosophers Tree.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. Wherefore Praises be given to the most high God, who has poured into our Soul of his goodness, and through a good old Age, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven an almost infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Years, has truly fill'd our Heart with his Love, in which (methinks) I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, cherish, and truly love all Mankind together.</p>
                           <p n="15">XV. But to return to our business. Truly our Work is presently performed; for that which the heat of the Sun is an hundred Years in doing of, for the Generation of one Mettal in the bowels of the Earth; our Secret Fire, that is, our Fiery and Sulphurous Water, which is called Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neum Mariae, doth (as I have often seen) in a very short time.</p>

things profoundly; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all things which vanish in, or will not endure the Fire, because from those adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stible, perishing or consuming things, you can never attain to the perfect matter, which is only found in the digesting of your Water, extracted from Sol and Luna.</p>

It is a compendious thing, gotten without cost or charge, or at least with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great purchase; it is humid, vaporous, digestive, altering, penetrating, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, spirituous, not violent, incombustible, circumspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive, continent, and one only thing.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. It is also a Fountain of living Water, which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolveth and contains the place in which the King and Queen bathe themselves; through the whole Work this moist Fire is sufficient; in the beginning, middle, and end, because in it, the whole Art does consist.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. This is the natural Fire, which is yet against Nature, not natural, and which burns not; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this Fire is hot, cold, dry,

                           <p n="1">I. WE have properly three Fires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which this our Art can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be perfected; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever works without them, takes a great deal of Labour in vain.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. The First Fire is that of the Lamp, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuous, humid, vaporous, Spiritous, and found out by Art.</p>
                           <p n="3">
                              <pb n="493" facs="tcp:65913:289"/>
III. This Lamp-fire ought to be proportioned to the enclosure; wherein you must use great Judgment, which none can attain to, but he that can bend to the search thereof.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. For if this Fire of the Lamp be not measured, and duly proportioned or fitted (to the Fornace) it will be, that either for want of heat you will not see the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Signs, in their limited times, whereby you will lose your hopes and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation by a too long delay: Or else, by reason of too much heat, you will burn the <hi>Flores Auri,</hi> the Golden Flowers, and so foolishly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail your lost Expence.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. The Second Fire is <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Cinerum,</hi> an Ash heat, in which the Vessel herme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically sealed is recluded, or buried: Or rather, it is that most sweet and gentle heat, which proceeding from the temperate Vapours of the Lamp, does equally surround your Vessel.</p>
                           <p n="6">
                              <pb n="494" facs="tcp:65913:290"/>
VI. This Fire is not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or forcing, except it be too much excited or stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up; it is a Fire digestive, alterative, and taken from another body than the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; being but one only, moist also, and not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. The Third Fire, is the natural Fire of our Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is also called the Fire against nature, because it is Water; and yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, it makes a mere Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Gold, which common Fire is not able to do.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. This Fire is Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, equal, and participates of Sulphur; it overturns or destroys, congeals, dissolves, and calcines; it is penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, subtil, incombustible and not burning, and is the fountain of Living Water, wherein the King and Queen bathe themselves, whose help we stand in need of, through the whole Work, through the beginning, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and end.</p>
                           <p n="9">
                              <pb n="495" facs="tcp:65913:290"/>
IX. But the other Two above-mentioned, we have not always occasion for, but only at some times.</p>
                           <p n="10">X. In reading therefore the books of Philosophers, conjoin these Three Fires in your Judgment, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, you will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand whatever they have wrote of them.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. NOW as to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, that which does not make black cannot make white, because black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the beginning of whiteness, and a sign of Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction and Alteration, and that the body is now penetrated and mortified.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. From the Putrefaction therefore in this Water, there
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:65913:291"/>
                              <hi>first</hi> appears blackness, like unto Broth wherein some bloody thing is boyled.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The black Earth by a continual digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is whitened, because the Soul of the Two Bodies swims above upon the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, like white Cream; and in this only whiteness, all the Spirits are so united, that they can never flie one from another.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. And therefore the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten must be whitened, and its leaves unfolded, <hi>i. e.</hi> its body broken or opened, lest we labour in vain, for this whiteness is the perfect Stone for the white work, and a body enobled in order to that end; even the Tincture of a most exuberant glory, and shining brightness, which never departs from the body it is once joined with.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Therefore you must note here, that the Spirits are not fixed, but in the white Colour, which is more noble than the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:65913:291"/>
and is more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently to be desired, for that it is as it were the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement or Perfection of the whole work.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. For our Earth putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and becomes black, then it is putrified in lifting up or Separation; afterwards be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dried, its blackness goes away from it, and then it is whitened, and the feminine dominion of the darkness and humidity perisheth; then also the white Vapor penetrates through the new Body, and the Spirits are bound up or fixed in the dryness.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. And that which is corrupting, deformed and black through the moisture, vanishes away; so the new body rises again clear, pure, white, and immortal, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Victory over all its Enemies.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. And as heat work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that which is moist, causeth or generates black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is the prime or first Colour; so always by decoction, more and more
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:65913:292"/>
heat working upon that which is dry, begets white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is the second Colour; and then working upon that which is purely and perfectly dry, it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Citrinity and Redness, Thus much for Colours.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. We must know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the thing which has its Head red and white, but its Feet white and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards red; and its Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hand black, that this thing, I say, is the only matter of our Magistery.</p>

And that is the very Reason why they are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liorated or amended in this Water, because like nature rejoiceth in like nature, and like nature retains like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, being joined the one to the other, in a true Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, by which they are made one Nature, one new Body, raised again from the dead, and immortal.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Thus it behoves you to join Consanguinity, or sameness of kind, with same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of kind, by which these natures, will meet and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one another, purifie themselves, generate, and make one another rejoice; for that like nature, now is disposed by like nature, even that which is nearest, and most friendly to it.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. Our Water then (saith <hi>Danthin</hi>) is the most beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, lovely, and clear Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, prepared only for the King, and Queen, whom it knows very well, and they it.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. For it attracts them to
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:65913:293"/>
its self, and they abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in for two or three days (to wit, two or three months) to wash themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, whereby they are made young again and beautiful.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. And because Sol and Luna have their Original from this Water their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it is necessary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they enter into it again, to wit, into their Mothers Womb, that they may be regenerate or born again, and made more healthy, more noble, and more strong.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. If therefore these do not die, and be converted into Water, they remain alone (or as they were) and without Fruit; but if they die, and are resolved in our Water, they bring forth Fruit, an hundred-fold; and from that very place in which they seem'd to perish, from thence shall they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be that which they were not before.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. Let therefore the Spirit of our living Water be
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:65913:293"/>
(with all care and industry) fixed with Sol and Luna; for that they being convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the nature of Water become dead, and appear like to the Dead; from whence afterwards, being revived, they encrease and multiply, even as do all sorts of Vegetable Substances.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. It suffices then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose the Matter sufficiently without, because that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it sufficiently disposes it self for the Perfection of its own work.</p>
                           <p n="10">X. For it has in it self a certain and inherent moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to the true way and Method, and a much better order than it is possible for any Man to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or think of.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. For this Cause it is, that you need only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the matter, Nature her self alone will perfect it; and if she be not hindred by some contrary thing, she will not over-pass her own certain motion, neither in conceiving or generating, nor in bringing forth.</p>
                           <p n="12">

XII. Wherefore, after the preparation of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beware only, lest by too much heat or fire, you inflame the Bathe, or make it too hot. Secondly take heed, lest the Spirit should exhale, lest it hurts the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator, to wit, lest it destroys the work, and induces many infirmities, as sadness, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, vexation, &amp; discontent.</p>
                           <p n="13">XIII. From these things which have been spoken, this Axiom is manifest, to wit, that he can never know the necessary course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the making or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of Mettals, who is ignorant of the way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them.</p>
                           <p n="14">XIV. You must therefore join them together that are of one consanguinity or kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; for like natures do find out and join with their like natures, and by putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying themselves together, are mixed together and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie themselves.</p>
                           <p n="15">XV. It is needful there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to know this Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb facs="tcp:65913:294"/>
and Generation, and how the natures do embrace one another, and are brought to a fixity in a slow or gentle fire; how like nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth with like nature; how they retain one another, and are converted into a white subsistencie.</p>
                           <p n="16">XVI. This white sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, if you will make it Red, you must continually decoct it in a dry Fire, till it is rubified, or becomes red as blood, which is then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but water, fire, and the true tincture.</p>
                           <p n="17">XVII. And so by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual dry fire, the whiteness is changed, removed, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, made citrine, and still digested till it comes to a true red and fixed colour.</p>
                           <p n="18">XVIII. And consequently by how much more this red is decocted in this gentle heat by so much the more it is heightned in Colour, and made a true Tincture of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Redness.</p>
                           <p n="19">XIX. Wherefore with a dry Fire, and a dry Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:65913:295" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(without any moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture) you must decoct this Compositum, till it be inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with a most perfect red Colour, and then it will be the true and perfect Elixir.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. IT ought to be therefore (as one of the <hi>Sybills</hi> said) that the Son of the Virgin be exalted from the Earth, and that the white Quintessence after its rising out of the dead Earth, be raised up towards Heaven; the gross and thick remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the bottom of the Vessel and of the Water.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Afterwards the Vessel being cooled, you will find in the bottom the black Faeces, scorcht and burnt, which separate from the Spirit and Quintessence of
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:65913:297"/>
Whiteness, and cast them away.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Then will the Argent vive fall down from our Air or Spirit, upon the new Earth, which is called Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent vive sublimed by the Air or Spirit, whereof is made a viscous Water, pure and white.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. This Water is the true Tincture separated from all its black Faeces, and our Brass or Latten is prepared with our Water, purified, and brought to a white Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Which white Colour is not obtained but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and coagulation of the Water: Decoct there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continually, wash away the Blackness from the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, not with your Hands, but with the Stone, or the Fire, or our second Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Water, which is the true Tincture.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. This separation of the pure from the impure is not done with hands; but Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her self does it, and
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:65913:298"/>
brings it to perfection by a circular Operation.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. It appears then, that this Composition is not a work of the Hands, but a change of the Natures; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Nature dissolves and joyns it self, sublimes and lifts it self up, and grows white, being separate from the Faeces.</p>
                           <p n="8">VIII. And in such a Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the more subtil, pure, and essential parts are conjoyned; for that with the fiery nature or property lifts up the subtil parts, it separates alwaies the more pure, leaving the grosser at bottom.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. Wherefore your Fire ought to be a gentle and a continual Vapour, with which you sublime, that the matter may be filled with Spirit from the Air, and live.</p>
                           <p n="10">X. For naturally all things take Life from the inbrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Air; and so also our Magistery receives in the Vapour or Spirit, by the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:65913:298"/>
sublimation of the Water.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. Our Brass or Laten then, is to be made to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend by the degrees of Fire, but of its own accord, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, aand without violence; except the body therefore be by the Fire and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter broken, or dissolved, and attenuated, until it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends as a Spirit, or climbs like Argent vive, or rather as the white Soul, separated from the Body, and by su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimation delated or brought into a Spirit, nothing is or can be done.</p>
                           <p n="12">XII. But when it ascends on high, it is born in the Air or Spirit, and is changed into Spirit; and becomes Life with Life, being only Spiritual and Incorruptible.</p>
                           <p n="13">XIII. And by such an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration it is, that the Body is made Spirit, of a subtil nature, and the Spirit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with the Body, and made one with it; and by such a sublimation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and raising up, the whole, both Body and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are made white.</p>

                           <p n="2">II. Therefore it behoves you to sublime both, that the pure may ascend, and the impure and earthy may descend, or be left at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, in the perplexity of a troubled Sea.</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:65913:299"/>
because it is like to it in the nereness of the first, pure, and simple nature.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. From these things it is necessary to make a separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Decoction, till no more remains of the purity of the Soul, which is not ascended and exalted to the higher part, whereby they will both be reduced to an equality of Properties, and a simple or pure Whiteness.</p>

When therefore gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and with much care, you separate the Earth from the Water, that is, from the Fire, and the thin from the thick, then that which is pure will separate it self from the Earth, and ascend to the upper part, as it were into Heaven, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure will descend beneath, as to the Earth.</p>

                           <p n="1">I. HEar now this Secret: keep the Body in our Mercurial Water, till it ascends with the white Soul, and the earthy part descends to the bottom, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the residing Earth.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. Then you shall see the Water to coagulate it self with its Body, and be assured that the Art is true; because the Body coagulates the moisture into dryness, like as the Rennet of a Lamb or Calf turns Milk into Cheese.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. In the same manner the Spirit penetrates the body, and is perfectly commixed with it in its smallest Atoms, and the body draws to its self his moisture, to wit, its white Soul, like as the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone draws Iron, because of the nearness and likeness of its nature; and then the one contains the other.</p>
                           <p n="4">
                              <pb n="516" facs="tcp:65913:301"/>
IV. And this is our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blimation and Coagulation, which retaineth every vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile thing, making it fixt for ever.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. This Compositum then, is not a mechanical thing, or a work of the Hands, but (as I have said) a changing of Natures; and a wonderful connection of their cold with hot, and the moist with the dry: the hot also is mixed with cold, and the dry with the moist.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. By this means also is made the mixtion and conjunction of body and spirit, which is called a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of contrary Natures; because by such a disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and sublimation, the spirit is converted into a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the body into a spirit.</p>
                           <p n="7">VII. So that the natures being mingled together, and reduced into one, do change one another: and as the Body corporifies the Spirit, or changes it into a Body: So also does the Spirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Body into a ting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and white Spirit.</p>
                           <p n="8">
                              <pb n="517" facs="tcp:65913:301"/>
VIII. Wherefore (as the last time I say) decoct the body in our white water, <hi>viz. Mercury,</hi> till it is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into blackness, and then by a continual decoction, let it be deprived of the same blackness, and the body so dissolved, will at length ascend or rise with a white Soul.</p>
                           <p n="9">IX. And then the one will be mixed with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so embrace one another, that it shall not be possible any more to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them, but the Spirit (with a real agreement) will be united with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and make one perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or fixed substance.</p>
                           <p n="10">X. And this is the soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, and coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the Spirit which have one and the same ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                           <p n="11">XI. Whoso therefore knows how to conjoyn the principles, or direct the work, to impregnate, to mortifie, to putrifie, to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, to quicken the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:65913:302"/>
to make white, to cleanse the Vulture from its blackness and darkness, till he is purged by the fire, and tinged, and purified from all his spots, shall be possessor of a treasure so great, that even Kings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves shall venerate him.</p>

the poorness and meanness of my Parents, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing were (by them that envie me most) accounted honest and good People.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Yet by the Blessing of God, I have not wanted an understanding of the Books of the Philosophers, but learned them, and attained to a certain kind of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, even of their hidden Secrets.</p>

                        <p n="6">VI. In this course of living there fell by chance into my hands a Guilded Book, very old and large, (which cost me only the Sum of two <hi>Florens,</hi> which was about 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> formerly, now 10 <hi>s.</hi> English.)</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. It was not made of <hi>Paper</hi> or <hi>Parchment,</hi> as other Books be, but of admirable <hi>Rindes</hi> (as it seemed to me) of young Trees.

of the Earth, should reign in Glory with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Eternity. Without doubt, this was a very Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Wise, and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. In the third Leaf, and in all the writing that followed, he taught them in plain words the <hi>transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> of Metals, to the end that he might help and assist his dispersed people, to pay their <hi>Tributes</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, and some other things not needful here to be repeated.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII, He painted the Vessels by the sides or mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the Leaves, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered all the Colours as they should arise or appear, with all the rest of the Work.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. But of the <hi>Prima materia,</hi> or first matter or Agent, he spake not so much as one word: but only he told them, that in the <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> Leaves, he had en tirely painted or decypher'd it, and depicted or figu red it, with admirable Dexterity and Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. Now though it was singularly well, and materially or intelligibly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured and painted, yet by that could no Man ever have been able to understand it, without having been well skill'd in their Cabala, which is a series of old Traditions, and also to have well studied their Books.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. The fourth and fifth Leaf thereof was without any writing, but full of fair Figures bright and shining, or as it were enlightned, and very exquisitely depicted.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. First, there was <hi>a Young Man</hi> painted, with <hi>Wings at his Ancles,</hi> having <hi>in his hand a Caducaean Rod, writhen about with two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents,</hi> wherewith he stroke upon <hi>an Helmet</hi> covered with its Head.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. This seemed in my mean apprehension, to be one of the Heathen Gods, <hi>viz. Mercury:</hi> Against him there came running and fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:65913:306"/>
with open Wings, a great Old Man, with an Hour-glass fixed upon his Head, and a Sithe in his hands like Death, with which he would (as it were in Indignation) have cut off the Feet of <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. On the other side of the fourth Leaf, he pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>a fair Flower</hi> on the top of a <hi>very high Mountain,</hi> which was very much sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with the North Wind. Its foot Stalk was blue, its Flowers white and red, and its Leaves shining like fine Gold: and round about it the Dragons and Griffins of the North made their Nests and Habitations.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. On the fifth Leaf was a fair <hi>Rose-tree flowered,</hi> in the midst of a Garden, growing up against a hollow Oak, at the foot whereof bubled forth a Fountain of pure white water, which ran headlong down into the depths below.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. Yet it passed through the hands of a great number of people, who dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Earth seeking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: but by reason of their blindness, none of them knew it, except a very few, who considred its weight:</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. On the last side of the fifth Leaf, was depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a <hi>King</hi> with a <hi>Fauchion,</hi> who caused his Soldiers to slay before him, <hi>many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,</hi> the Mothers standing by and weeping at the feet of their Murtherers.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. These Infants blood, being gathered up by other Soldiers was put into a great Vessel wherein <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> came to bathe themselves.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. And because this History seemed to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the destruction of the <hi>Innocents</hi> by <hi>Herod,</hi> and that I learned the chiefest part of the Art in this Book; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I placed in their Church-yard these Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Figures, of this Learning, Thus have you that which was contained in the first five Leaves.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Of his Pilgrimage into <hi>Spain,</hi> and meeting with a <hi>Jewish</hi> Priest, who in part Interpreted the said Book to him.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. AS for what was in all the rest of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Leaves, which was wrote in good and intelligible La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, I must conceal, lest God being offended with me, should send his Plagues and Judgments upon me: It would be a wickedness much greater, than he who wisht that all Men in the World had but one Head, that he might cut it off at one blow.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Having thus obtained this delicate and pretious Book, I did nothing else, day and night, but study upon it; conceiving very well all the Operations it pointed forth, but wholly ignorant of the <hi>Prima ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi> with which I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, which made me sad and discontented.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. My Wife (whose Name was) <hi>Perrenelle,</hi> whom I loved equal with my self, and had but lately Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, was mightily concern'd for me, and with many words comforting me, earnestly desired to know how she might deliver me from this trouble.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. I could no longer keep counsel, but told her all, shewing her the very Book, which when she saw, she became as well pleased with it as my self, and with great delight beheld the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cover, the Engraving, the Images, and exquisite figures thereof, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood as little of them as I.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Yet it was matter of Consolation to me to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, and entertain my
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:65913:307"/>
self with her, and to think what we should do to find out the interpretation and meaning thereof.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. At length, I caused to be painted within my Chamber as much to the life or original, as I could, all the Images and Figures of the said fourth and fifth Leaves.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. These I shewed to the greatest Scholars and most learned Men in <hi>Paris,</hi> who understood thereof no more than my self: I told them they were found in a Book which taught the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers-Stone.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. But the greatest part of them, made a mock both of me, and that most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Secret, except one whose Name was <hi>Anselme,</hi> a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiser of Physick, and a deep Student in this Art.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. He much desired to see my Book, which he va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued more than any thing else in the World, but I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways refused him; only made him a large de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. He told me, that the first <hi>Figure</hi> represented <hi>Time,</hi> which devours all things; and that according to the number of the six written Leaves, there was required the space of six years to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Stone; and then said he, we must turn the Glass, and see it no more.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. I told him this was not painted, but only to shew and teach the <hi>Prima materia,</hi> or <hi>first Agent</hi> (as was written in the Book:) He answered me, that this digestion for six years, was as it were a <hi>second Agent;</hi> and that certainly the first Agent was there painted, which was the <hi>White and heavy water.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. This without doubt was <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> which they could not six, <hi>i. e.</hi> cut off his feet, or take away his Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility, save by that long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion in the pure blood of young Infants.</p>
                        <p n="13">
                           <pb n="529" facs="tcp:65913:307"/>
XIII. For in that, this <hi>Argent Vive</hi> being joyned with <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> was first turned with them, into a <hi>Plant,</hi> like that there paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterwards by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into <hi>Serpents,</hi> which <hi>Serpents</hi> being perfectly dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and degested, were made a fine powder of <hi>Gold,</hi> which is the <hi>Stone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. This strange or Forreign Discourse to the matter, was the cause of my erring, and that made me wander for the space of one and twenty years in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Meander, from the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; in which space of time I went through a thousand Laborinths or Processes, but all in vain; yet never with the Blood of Infants, for that I accounted Wicked and Villanous.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. For I found in my Book, that the Philosophers called <hi>Blood</hi> the Mineral Spirit, which is in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, chiefly in <hi>Sol, Luna,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> to which sense, I always in my own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment assented; yet these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations for the most part, were not more subtil than true.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Not finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in my operation or course of my processes the signs, at the time written in my book, I was ever to begin again.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. In the end having lost all hope of ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing those <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Figures,</hi> I made a Vow to God, to demand their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of some <hi>Jewish</hi> Priest, belonging to some Synagogue in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Whereupon with the consent of my Wife <hi>Perrenelle,</hi> carrying with me the Extract or Copy of the <hi>Figures</hi> or <hi>Pictures,</hi> I took up a Pilgrims Habit and Staff, in the same manner as you see me figured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the said Arch, in the said Church-yard, in which I put these Hieroglyphick Figures:</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. Whereon also I have set on the Wall, on both hands, the Process,
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:65913:308"/>
representing in order all the colours of the Stone, as they arise in the operation, and go away again.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. This is, as it were, the very beginning of King <hi>Hercules</hi> his Book, entituled <hi>Iris,</hi> or the <hi>Rain bow,</hi> which treats of the colours of the <hi>Stone,</hi> in these words, <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris processio multùm naturae placet;</hi> in <hi>English, The Process of the work is very pleasing unto Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. And these words I also put there expresly, for the sakes of Great Scholars and Learned Men, who may understand to what they allude.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. In this same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I say, I put my self upon my Journey to <hi>Spain,</hi> and so much I did, that I in short time arrived at <hi>Montjoy,</hi> and a while after at S. <hi>James,</hi> where with much devotion I accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed my Vow.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. This done in <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> at my return, I met with a Merchant of <hi>Boloign,</hi> who brought me acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Physician one M. <hi>Canches,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> by Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but now a <hi>Christian,</hi> dwelling at <hi>Leon</hi> aforesaid.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. I shewed him the Extract or Copy of my Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, by which he was (as it were) ravished with great astonishment and joy, he desired immediately, if I could tell him any news of the Book from whence they were drawn.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. I answered him in Latin (in which Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage he asked me the Question) that I doubted not of obtaining the sight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Book, if I could meet with any one who could unfold the AEnigma's.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. Hearing this, and being transported with great earnestness and joy; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to decipher unto me the beginning: To be short, he was much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that he was in hopes, to hear tidings of the Book; and I as much pleased to hear him speak and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret it.</p>
                        <p n="27">
                           <pb n="531" facs="tcp:65913:308"/>
XXVII. (And doubtless he had heard much talk of the Book, but it was (as he said) of a thing which was believed to be utterly lost:) Upon this we resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for our Voyage, and from <hi>Leon,</hi> we passed to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viedo,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Sanson,</hi> where we took ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and went to Sea, in order to going into <hi>France.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. Our Voyage was prosperous and happy; and being arrived in the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> he most truly interpreted unto me the greatest part of my <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> in which, even to the points and pricks, he could decypher Great Mysteries which were admirable to me.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. Having attained <hi>Orleans,</hi> this Learned Man fell sick, even to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afflicted with extream Vomitings, which still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him, as being first caused by his Sea sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Notwithstanding which, he was in continual fear, lest I should leave or forsake him, which was a great trouble to him.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. And although I was continually by his side, yet he would be almost al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways calling for me; at the end of the seventh day of his sickness he died, which was no small grief to me; and I buried him (as well as my present condition would permit me) in a Church at <hi>Orleans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. He that would see the manner of my Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and the joy of <hi>Perenelle,</hi> let him look upon us two, in the City of <hi>Paris</hi> upon the Door of the Chappel of <hi>James</hi> of the <hi>Bouchery,</hi> close by the one side of my house, where we are both painted, kneeling, and giving thanks to God.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. For through the Grace of God it was that I attained the perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all that I desired. Well! I had now the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma materia,</hi> the <hi>first princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> yet not their <hi>first pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> which is a thing most difficult, above all
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:65913:309"/>
other things in the World.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. But in the end I had that also, after a long aberration, and wandring in a labarinth of Errors, for the space of three years, or thereabouts, during which time, I did nothing but stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and search, and labour, so as you see me depicted without this <hi>Arch,</hi> where I have placed my Process.</p>
                        <p n="34">XXXIV. Praying also continually to God, and reading attentively in my Book, pondering the words of the Philosophers, and then trying and proving the various Operations, which I thought to my self, they might mean by their words.</p>
                        <p n="35">XXXV. At length I found that which I desired, which I also soon knew by the <hi>scent</hi> and <hi>odor</hi> thereof: Having this I easily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished the Magistery.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. For knowing the <hi>preparations</hi> of the <hi>prime Agents,</hi> and then litterally following the Directions in my Book, I could not then miss the Work, if I would.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. HAving attained this, I come now to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection; and the first time I made projection was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mercury,</hi> a pound and half whereof, or there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, I turned into <hi>pure Silver,</hi> better than that of the Mine, as I proved by assaying of it my self, and
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:65913:309"/>
also causing others to assay it for me many times.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. This was done in the Year of Our Lord 1382. <hi>January</hi> 17. about Noon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Monday,</hi> in my own House, <hi>Perrenelle</hi> only being present.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Again, following ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly the directions in my Book, litterally, and word by word, I made projection of the <hi>Red stone,</hi> on the like quantity of <hi>Mercury, Perre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle</hi> only being present, and in the same house; which was done in the same Year of Our Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> 1382. <hi>April</hi> 25. at five in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. This <hi>Mercury</hi> I truly transmuted into almost as much Gold, much better indeed than common Gold, more soft also, and more pliable.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. I speak it in all Truth, I have made it three times with the help of <hi>Perrenelle,</hi> who understood it as well as my self, because she assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted me in my Operations: And without doubt, if the would have indeed done it alone, she would have brought the work to the same, or full as great perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as I had done.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. I had truly enough when I had once done it; but I found exceeding great pleasure and delight in see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contemplating <hi>the Admirable Works of Nature within the Vessels.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And to shew to you that I had then done it three times, I caused to be depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted under the same <hi>

IX. For an extremity of Joy takes away the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, as well as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Grief and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: but the goodness of the most great God, had not only given and fill'd me with this Blessing, to give me a Sober and Chaste Wife, but she was also a Wise and Prudent Woman, not only capable of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but also to do what was reasonable, and was more discreet and secret than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily other Women are.</p>
                        <p n="10">X.

                        <p n="12">XII. We also have done at <hi>Boloigne</hi> about as much as we have done at <hi>Paris:</hi> not to speak of the Charitable Acts which we both did to particular poor people, principally to poor Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and Orphans:</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Whose Names should I divulge, with the largeness of the Charity, and the way and manner of doing it, as my reward would then be only in this World, so neither could it be pleasing to the persons to whom we did it.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Building therefore these Hospitals, Chappels, Churches, and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards in this City, I caused
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:65913:310"/>
to be depicted under the said fourth Arch, the most<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true and essential Marks or Signs of this Art, yet under Vails, Types, and Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphick Covertures, in i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of those things which are contained in the Gilded Book of <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>Jew.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">XV. This representation may signifie two things, according to the capacity and understanding of those who may view them. <hi>First,</hi> The Mysterie of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection and day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein Christ Jesus our Lord, (whom I pray and beseech to have mercy upon us) shall come to judge the World.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It might signifie to such as have lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Natural Philosophy, all the principal and necessary Operations of the <hi>Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> or the true and whole Process of the Grand Elixir.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. These <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> Figures serve also as a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way, leading to the Heavenly Life. The <hi>first</hi> demonstrating the Sacred Mysteries of our Salvation, as shall be hereafter shewed. <hi>The other</hi> demonstrating to the Wise, and Men of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, the direct and perfect way of Operation, and lineary work of the Philosophers Stone.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by any one, takes away from him the root of all sin and evil, which is Covetousness, changing his evil into good, and making him Liberal, Courteous, Religious, Devout, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, how wicked soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was before.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. For from thence forward, he is continually ravished with the goodness of God, and with his Grace and Mercy, which he has obtained from the fountain of Eternal Goodness; with the profoundness of his Divine and adorable po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and with the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Admirable Works.</p>
                        <p n="20">
                           <pb n="536" facs="tcp:65913:311"/>
XX. These are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which moved me to set these Figures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in this place; <hi>viz.</hi> to the end, that if any Man obtain this inestimable Good, or becomes Master of this <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. He may consider with himself (as I did) not to hide this Tallent which God has bestowed upon him in the Earth, buying Houses, Lands, and Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions, which are the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Follies of this World:</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. But rather, to persue his Work, and to bestow the product with all Love and Charity, among the Poor and Needy; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that he learned this Secret among them that possessed nothing, to wit, among the Bones of the Dead, in which number he himself shall shortly be found.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. And that after this Life he must render an Account, before a most just and mighty Judge, who will judge every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Works, and to whom he must render an account for every vain and idle word.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. Having therefore well weighed my words, and well understood those my Figures, having also the knowledge of the <hi>prima ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,</hi> or <hi>first Agents,</hi> persue thou the Work to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of this Magistery of <hi>Hermes,</hi> for the Glory of God, and the good of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous and Distressed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man kind;</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. But more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to those who are of the houshold of Faith, to such as are truly poor and just people, Aged persons and Widdows, Orphans and forlorn, the despised, and forsaken, whom the world is not worthy of, dispersing bounteously of this your hidden Treasure, with an open and Liberal, but Secret hand.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXVII.</hi> The Theological Interpretations given to these Hieroglyphicks, according to the Mind of <hi>Flammel</hi> the Author.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. OVer against one of the Pillars of the Charnel-house, which I gave to the Church-yard of the Innocents, I caused to be painted a Man all black, who looks directly on these Hieroglyphicks, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces, <hi>I see a Wonder at which I am much amazed:</hi> Also three Plates of Iron and Copper, on the East, West, and South, of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed Arch where these Hieroglyphicks are, in the midst of the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, representing the holy Passion and Resurrection of the Son of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Whose Interpretation in a Theological sense is, that this Black Man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims it a wonder as well to see the admirable Works of God, in the Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Metals, figured in those Hieroglyphicks, which he so attentively beholds, as to see the Resurrection of the Dead to the fearful and terrible Day of Judgment.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. But the Earthen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel on the right hand of these Figures, within the which there is a Pen-case and Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn (or rather a Vessel of Philosophy, if you take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Strings, and joyn the Pen-case near to the Ink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn) and the other two like it, on the two sides of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the one of which is put <hi>N.</hi> for <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>F.</hi> for <hi>Flammel,</hi> have no Theological sense, but only that as they are 3. in number, so that I have done
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:65913:312"/>
or performed the Magiste ry or Elixir three several times.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. So also these words <hi>NICHOLAS FLAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEL</hi> and <hi>PERRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NELLE HIS WIFE,</hi> signifie nothing more than that I and my Wife, have given that Arch.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. As to the third, fourth, and fifth Figures, by the sides whereof is written, <hi>How the Innocents were slain by the Commandment of</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod, Their Theological sense is well enough known by the very words only themselves.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The two Dragons depicted together, the one within the other, black and blue in colour, and a Sable Field, whereof the one has Gilded Wings, the other has none at all, signifie <hi>Sin</hi> which is tied to our nature; the one having its original Birth from the other: of these <hi>Sins,</hi> some may be chased away, for they fly, having Wings: The other which has no Wings, and signifies the <hi>Sin against the Holy Ghost,</hi> can never be done away.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The Gold on the Wings, shews that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of our Sins, arise from the Ungodly hunger after Gold, to wit, Covetousness: The black and blue colours, shew forth the Wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires which ascend out of the bottomless and dark Pit of Hell.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. These two Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons morally also represent, The Legions of Evil Spirits, which move always about us, and will accuse us before the Just Judge, at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Day of Judgment, whose business is to tempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy us.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. The <hi>Man</hi> and the <hi>Woman</hi> next them, of an <hi>Orange</hi> colour, in a <hi>field A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure</hi> and <hi>blue,</hi> shew that Mankind ought not to have their hope in this life: For the <hi>Orange</hi> colour, signifies <hi>hopelessness</hi> and <hi>despair:</hi> The <hi>Azure</hi> and <hi>blue</hi> on which they are depicted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate <hi>Heaven,</hi> and
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:65913:312"/>
Thoughts of Heavenly things.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And the Motto's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from them, (<hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Homo veniet ad Judicium Dei; Man must come to the Judgment of God.</hi> 2. <hi>Verè illa dies terribilis erat; That day will be terrible indeed;</hi>) are to put us in mind of those things, to the end, that keeping our selves from the Dragons, which are Sins, God may shew mercy unto us.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Next after these things are depainted in a Field Green, two Men and one Woman rising again, of the which, one comes out of a Sepulchre, the other out of the Earth, all three of an exceeding white and pure colour, lifting up their Hands and Eyes towards Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Over the heads of these are two Angels sound ing with Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as if they had called these Dead to the Day of Judgment. Over these two Angels is the Figure of Our Lord Jesus Christ, holding the <hi>World</hi> in his hand, upon whose Head an Angel pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth a Crown, assisted by two other Angels, which say, <hi>O pater Omnipotens: O Jesu bone.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. On the right side of this Figure is <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, cloathed with White and Yellow, with a Sword; at whose Feet is a Man kneeling, cloathed with a Gown of an Orange colour, with folds of black and white, which represents my self to the life, from which proceeds this Motto, <hi>Dele mala quae feci; blot out the Evils which I have done.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. On the other side, on the left hand is <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle with his Key, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in Reddish Yellow, holding his hand upon a Woman kneeling, clothed in a Gown of Orange co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour also, which represents <hi>Perrenelle</hi> to the life, from whom proceeds this Motto, <hi>Christe precor esto pius; Christ I beseech thee be merciful.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="15">
                           <pb n="540" facs="tcp:65913:313"/>
XV. Behind each of these there is an Angel kneeling, the one of which saying, <hi>O Rex Sempiterne, O Eternal King:</hi> The other saying, <hi>Salve Domine Angelorum, Hail thou Lord of Angels.</hi> These things represent to the Vulgar (who know nothing of our matter) the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and future Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so clearly, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more need be said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Next after the three that are rising again, are two Angels more of an <hi>Orange colour,</hi> in a <hi>blue field</hi> saying, <hi>Surgite mortui, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite ad judicium Domini mei; Arise you Dead, and come to the Judgment of Our God.</hi> This is Theologically inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted also of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. Then follow the last Figures, a Man of a Vermilion red in a Violet coloured Field, holding the Foot of a Winged Lyon of a Vermillion red also, and opening his Throat, as it were to devour the Man: thereby representing a Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Man, in a Lethargy of Sin and Wickedness, dying without Repentance, who in that terrible day shall be delivered into the power of the Devil, signified by the Red roaring Lyon, who will devour and swallow him up.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p n="1">I. I Pray God with all my Heart, that he who purposes to search in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to these <hi>Arcana</hi> of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:65913:313"/>
having conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red these <hi>Idea's</hi> in his mind) of the Resurrection and life to come, may first make his Advantage and Gain of them.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And then, having far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advice, that he search into the depth of my <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, Colours,</hi> and <hi>Motto's,</hi> but chiefly of the <hi>Motto's,</hi> because as to the matter of Art they speak not Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Then let him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand why <hi>Paul</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle is on the right hand, where it is accustomed to paint <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle, and <hi>Peter</hi> on the other side in the place of <hi>Paul?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Why the Figure of <hi>Paul</hi> is clothed in colours <hi>White and Yellow,</hi> and that of <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Yellow and Red?</hi> Why also the <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> kneeling by their Feet, and praying to God as at the Day of Judgment are clothed in divers colours, and not naked or nothing but Bones, and why in this Day of Judgment this <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> are painted as at the Feet of the Saints, whereas their place ought rather to have been below on <hi>Earth,</hi> and not in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. Why also the two Angels in <hi>Orange colour,</hi> which say, <hi>Surgite mortui, venite ad judicium Domini mei,</hi> are clad in this colour, and out of their place, for that they ought to be on high in Heaven, with the other two playing on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments? And why they are painted in a Field <hi>Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and Blue?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But chiefly why their <hi>Motto</hi> which speaks to the Dead, ends in the open Throat of the <hi>Red Winged or Flying Lyon?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. After these Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and many others which may justly be made, you ought to open the Eyes of your Mind, and conclude, that these things are not thus done and ordered, without some just and true cause; and that under them, as under a Veil some
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:65913:314"/>
great Secrets are hidden, which you ought to pray God to discover to you.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Then you ought farther to believe that these Figures and Explications, are not made for them who have never read the Books of the Philosophers, and who not knowing the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Principles, or first matter of Metals, cannot be called Children of the Wise Men.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. And that if you think to understand perfectly these <hi>Figures,</hi> and yet shall be ignorant of the <hi>Prima materia,</hi> or <hi>first Agents,</hi> you will undoubtedly deceive your self, and never come to the knowledge of the thing.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Therefore blame me not, if you do not easily understand me; but rather blame your self, that you have not rather sought out the <hi>first Agent,</hi> which is the <hi>Key</hi> opening the Gate into <hi>this Learning;</hi> or initiated your self into the sacred and secret Interpretations of the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the <hi>Prima mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Without which, it is impossible to comprehend or understand, the subtil Conceptions of the obscure Philosophers, which they have skreened from your view, as within a Vail; and not written, but in a Language for their own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciples to read.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Which Principles, and <hi>first Agents</hi> of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they have never plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in any of their Books, but rather left it to be revealed to them by God Almighty, who opens the Secret to whom he pleases; or else by the living Voice of some Adept or Master of this Science, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it by Cabalistical Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which thing not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten falls out.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Now then, my Son, (and let me so call thee, not only for that I am come to a very great Age, but also, for that thou maist be a Child of this knowledge) hearken seriously to me, and
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:65913:314" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give good attention to the words of my Mouth, but proceed not, if thou beest ignorant of the said <hi>Prima materia</hi> or <hi>first Agents;</hi> which I pray God to unfold unto thee for his own Honour and Glory.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. The Vessel of Earth (represented in the first Figure) is called by the Philosophers their Triple Vessel; for which in it, there is a Flore, and upon that a Dish or Pan, (made of Iron or Clay) full of luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm Ashes, within the which is set the Philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Egg, which is a Vial, containing the <hi>Prima mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> or <hi>first Agents</hi> of the Stone.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. That is, the <hi>Scum of the Red Sea,</hi> and the <hi>Fat of the Mercurial Wind,</hi> which is painted in the form of a Penner and Inkhorn.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Now this Vessel of Earth, [or rather Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Fornace] is open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove to put in the Dish or Pan, and the Philosophick Egg, or Vial; under which by the open Gate, [or mouth of the Fornace] is put in the Philosophers Fire, so here you have the three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Vessel, which is three Vessels, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. The For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace. 2. The Sand Vessel. 3. The Philosophick Egg.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. These the obscure Philosophers have called an <hi>Athanor,</hi> a <hi>Sieve, Horse-dung, Balneum Mariae,</hi> a <hi>Fornace,</hi> a <hi>Spheare,</hi> the <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> a <hi>Prison,</hi> a <hi>Grave,</hi> an <hi>Urinal,</hi> a <hi>Phial</hi> and a <hi>Bolthead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. And I my self <hi>in my Summary of Philosophy,</hi> (which I wrote about four Years and two Months last past) called it the <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Habitation of the Chicken:</hi> and the Ashes, <hi>Chaff:</hi> But the Common Name is an <hi>Oven</hi> or <hi>Fornace,</hi> which I had never known if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRAHAM the Jew</hi> had not painted it, together with the fire proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wherein consists a great part of the Secret.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. For it is as the Belly or Womb containing the true natural heat or fire,
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:65913:315"/>
to animate or give life to our Chicken, or young King: if this fire be not made Fornace like (with <hi>Calid ben Jazichus</hi> the <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>) If it be kindled with a Sword, with <hi>Pithagoras;</hi> if you set on fire your Vessel, saith <hi>Morien</hi> whereby it feels the naked heat, the matter will fly, and the flowers be burnt, before they ascend out of the depth of the matter.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. And they will come out <hi>Red,</hi> rather than white, whereby your work will be spoiled: and yet on the contrary, if your fire be too little or small, you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see the end, because of the <hi>frigid nature</hi> of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereby there will want motion sufficient to digest them together.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. The heat then of your Fire in this Vessel must be (as <hi>Hermes</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinus</hi> say) like the heat of the Sun in Winter [but it is to be noted, that <hi>Hermes</hi> liv'd in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> a hot Country, whose Winter, is as hot as our Summer in <hi>England.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. Or rather accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Diomedes,</hi> like the heat of a Hen, with which she hatches her Chickens, like the slow ascension of the Sun from the Sign <hi>Aries</hi> to that of <hi>Cancer.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. For know that the Infant in the beginning, is repleat with cold Flegm, and a white milky sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance: and that too great a heat is an Enemy to the cold and moisture of our <hi>Embrion:</hi> And that the two Adversaries, <hi>viz.</hi> the two Elements of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold,</hi> will never perfectly accord, or embrace one another.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. But by little and little, having first long dwelt together in the midst of the temperate heat of their <hi>Bath</hi> (to wit a gentle Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neo or sand heat) they are changed by long decoction and digestion into an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combustible Sulphur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. Take care there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that with a just and equal proportion of Fire, you manage these proud
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:65913:315"/>
and haughty Natures, for fear, that if you should fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour one more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they who naturally are Enemies, shou'd grow Angry with you through Jealousie, and by their hot and dry choler despise your power, and contemn you to your no small disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. You must also keep them in this temperate heat perpetually or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, to wit, night and day, until the time that <hi>Winter,</hi> to wit, <hi>the time of the moisture of the Matters,</hi> be passed away: for they make their peace, and as it were, joyn hands in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmed and heated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; whereas should these natures find themselves but one only half an hour with out Fire, they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come irreconcileable for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. For this cause or reason it is said in the Book of the <hi>Seventy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts: See that their heat or fire continue unweariedly and without ceasing, and that all their days may be numbred or accomplished.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. And <hi>Rhasis</hi> saith, <hi>The haste that brings with it too much Fire, is always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the Devil and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> And <hi>Diomedes</hi> saith, <hi>When the Golden Bird shall come just to</hi> Cancer, <hi>and that from thence it shall move or fly towards</hi> Libra, <hi>then you may augment the Fire a little.</hi>

                        <p n="1">I.

                        <p n="2">II. That which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most without Wings is <hi>fixed,</hi> or the <hi>Male:</hi> That which is uppermost, and with Wings is the <hi>Volatile</hi> or <hi>Female,</hi> black, and obscure, which strives for the mastery and dominion for many Months.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The first is called <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or heat and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: the other, <hi>Mercury, Argent Vive,</hi> or cold and moisture: these are <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> of a Mercurial source, a sulphurous original, which by a continual fire are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with Royal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, which being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and afterwards chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a quintessence, may overcome all Metallick Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, how hard and solid so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. These are the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> and <hi>Serpents</hi> which the Ancient <hi>AEgyptians</hi> depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in a Circle, the Head devouring the Tail; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by signifying, that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from one and the same thing, and that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone was sufficient; and that in its revolving and circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it made it self per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. These are the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons</hi> which the ancient Poets feigned, did watch (without sleeping) the Golden Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the <hi>Hesperidian</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens: These are they on whom <hi>Jason</hi> in his adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:65913:316"/>
for the Golden Fleece, cast or poured the liquor prepared by the Inchantress <hi>Medea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Of the discourse of whom, the Books of the Philosophers are so full, that not any of them that ever wrote, but has declared something concerning the same even from the times of the most faithful <hi>Hermes Trismegistus, Orpheus, Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras, Artephius, Morienus,</hi> and others following them, even to my self.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. These are the <hi>two Serpents</hi> given and sent by <hi>Juno</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the metallick na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) which <hi>Hercules</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the strong and wise man) must strangle in his Cradle; to wit, overcome and kill them, and to make them putrifie, corrupt, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, at the beginning of his work.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. These are the <hi>two Serpents</hi> twined and twisted round about the <hi>Caduceus</hi> or <hi>Rod of Mercury,</hi> by which he exercises his great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and transforms himself into all shapes as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. He, saith <hi>Haly,</hi> who shall kill the one, shall also kill the other, because the one cannot die without the other.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. These two are those which <hi>Avicen</hi> calls the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian Dog,</hi> and the <hi>Coras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sere Bitch;</hi> which being put together into the Vessel of the Sepulchre, do cruelly bite one another, and by their furious rage and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty poison, never cease to contend, from the very moment that they seize on one another (if the cold hinder not) till both of them become all over bloody, in every part.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And then killing one another, they be deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and digested in their proper Venom or poison, which after their death, changes them into a living and permanent, or fixed water.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Before which time, they by their Corruption
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:65913:317"/>
and putrefaction, lose their first natural forms, to assume afterwards another new one; better, more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and excellent.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. These are the two <hi>Seeds Masculine and Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine,</hi> which generate (says <hi>Rhasis, Avicen,</hi> and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam</hi> the Jew) within the Bowels or Womb of the four Elements, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat all their Operations.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. These are the Radical moisture of the Metals, to wit, <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> not <hi>the Vulgar,</hi> which are sold by Merchants and Druggists; but <hi>Ours</hi> which give us these two beautiful Bodies, we so much desire.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. These two <hi>Seeds</hi> (saith <hi>Democritus</hi>) are not found upon the pure and uncorrupted Earth: But as <hi>Avicen</hi> saith) they are gathered from the Dung, Ordure, and Putrefaction of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Happy are they who know how to gather this fruit: for of it an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> may be made, which has strength and power to conquer all Infirmities, Weaknesses, and Diseases; and even to contend with Death it self, lengthening <hi>Life</hi> (by the permission of God) even to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or appointed time; and withal making him to triumph over the poorness and wretchedness of this Life, giving him an Infinity of Treasure and Riches.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. These two Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, or Metallick Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, will strive each to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the other by its heat: Then if you be not careful you will see a stinking and poisonous Vapour or Fume to arise, exceeding in Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the biting of the most Venomous Serpent.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> why I depicted these two <hi>Seeds,</hi> in the forms of <hi>Dragons,</hi> and of those colours, is because of their virulent or poyson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous smell; and the Vapours or Fumes rising up in the Glass or Philosophick Egg, being also of the same co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:65913:317"/>
with the Painted Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, <hi>viz.</hi> black, blue, and yellow.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. The power of which, and of the Bodies dissolved, is so venomous, that truly in the whole World, there is not a more malignant poyson; for it is able by its own strength and foetid odour, to mortifie or kill every thing living.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. The Artist is never sensible of this ill smell, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less his Vessels break, but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judges when it begins to be, by the sight, and changing of colours, proceeding from the putrefaction of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Digestion.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. These colours, as they signifie Corruption and Putrefaction, so they also presage to us Generation, by the gnawing and dissolving of the perfect Bodies; which dissolution proceeds from external heat, joyned with the watery fire, and the subtil poyson of <hi>our Mercury,</hi> which resolves into a meer Cloud, <hi>viz.</hi> into impalpable powder, whatever resists it.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. Thus, the heat working upon and against the Radical, Metallick, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scous, or Oleaginous Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture of Metals, causes the subject matter to generate blackness.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. For at the same time the matter is dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it grows black, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates: for all Curruption is Generation; therefore blackness is much to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. This is the black Sail with which <hi>Thesus's</hi> Ship, came back with tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph from <hi>Crete,</hi> which was the cause of his Fathers Death: And so must this Father also die, that from the Ashes of this <hi>Phoenix,</hi> another may spring or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise, which Son must be King.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. This is certain, that if this blackness be not at the beginning of your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, during the days of the Stone; let what other colour soever arise, you will wholly fail of the Magiste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:65913:318"/>
nor from that <hi>Chaos,</hi> will you ever produce any thing.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. You cannot work well, unless you putrefie your Matter first, nor can you generate, unless you first meet with Corruption: and by consequence, with out a fit Womb, warmth, heat, and nourishment, the Stone cannot take a Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life, so as to encrease and multiply.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. And truly I must tell you, that though you work upon the true mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet if at the begining, after you have put your <hi>Confection, Prima materia,</hi> or <hi>first Agents,</hi> into the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers Egg; if, I say, sometime after the fire has stirred them up, you see not the <hi>black head of the Crow,</hi> this <hi>black of the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est black,</hi> you must begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, for your fault is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable and not to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. But especially the Orange colour, or half red, is much to be feared: For if at the beginning you see that appearance within your Egg, without doubt you have burnt the Matter, and so will lose the verdure and life of the Stone.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. The colour which you ought to have, must in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely be perfected in black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (like to that of these Dragons) in the space of forty days.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. If therefore you have not these essential marks, retire your self in good time from your work, that you may rescue your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from assured and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain loss.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. And note this also in particular, that it is even next to nothing to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this blackness; there is nothing more easie to come by: for from almost all things in the World, mixed with moisture, you may have a blackness by fire.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. But here you must have a blackness which comes from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Metallick Bodies, and
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:65913:318"/>
lasts a long space of time, nor can be destroyed in less than the space of five Months, after which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red whiteness: if you have this you have enough, but not all.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. The blueish and yellowish colours, signifie that solution and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="35">XXXV. This dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the AEnigmatick Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers is called <hi>Death, Destruction, Perdition;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that the <hi>Natures</hi> change their form; and from hence they raised so many Allegories of <hi>Dead Men, Tombs, Sepulchres,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. Others have called it, <hi>Calcination, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nudation, Separation, Tritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and <hi>Assation;</hi> because the <hi>Compositum</hi> is chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reduced, into most small Atoms and parts.</p>
                        <p n="37">XXXVII.

                        <p n="38">XXXVIII. Others have called it, <hi>Ixir, Iris, Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, Corruption, Cymmerian darkness, a Gulf, Hell, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons, Generation, Ingression, Submersion, Complexion, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, and Impregnation,</hi> because that the matter is black and waterish, that the <hi>Natures</hi> are perfectly
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:65913:319"/>
mixed, and now subsist one by another.</p>
                        <p n="39">XXXIX. For when the heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> works upon him, they are converted, first into a Powder, or into a fat and glutinous Water, which feeling the heat flies on high to the top or head with the Vapour or Fume, with the Wind and Air.</p>
                        <p n="40">XL. From thence this wa ter (drawn out of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or <hi>Compositum</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendeth again, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending, reduces and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves, (as much as may be) the rest of the <hi>Compositum,</hi> continually doing so, till the whole be like a black Broth, somewhat fat.</p>
                        <p n="41">XLI. A while after, this water begins to coagulate or thicken somewhat more, growing very black like to Pitch: Lastly, comes the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> which the Obscure Philosophers have called <hi>Terra foetidae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="42">XLII. For then by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the perfect or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat putrefaction (which is as natural as any can be) this Earth stinks, and yields a smell like to the Scent of Graves, filled with rotten and putrified Carkases, not yet perfectly consumed.</p>
                        <p n="43">XLIII. This Earth was called by <hi>Hermes, Terra fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liata,</hi> but its true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name is <hi>Leton</hi> or <hi>Laten,</hi> which must afterwards be whitened.</p>

XII. To come then to this perfect and sparkling whiteness, you must know what the wreath of this black Girdle signifies, and follow that which they teach you, which is the quantity of the Imbibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. The two ends which are not wreathed about at all, represent the begining, and the ending; for the begining it shews you, that you must Imbibe it at the first time gently and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, giving it then a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Milk, as to a Child new born, to the intent that <hi>Ixir</hi> (as Authors speak) be not drowned.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. The like must we do at the end, when we see that our <hi>King</hi> is <hi>fall,</hi> and will have no more.</p>

The middle of these Operations is explicated by the fire, whose wreaths of the said black Girdle, at what time (because our <hi>Salamander</hi> lives of the fire, and in the midst of the fire, and indeed is a fire, and an <hi>Argent-Vive,</hi> or <hi>Quick-silver,</hi> which runs in the midst of the fire fearing nothing) you must feed him abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, so as that the <hi>Virgins Milk</hi> may encompass all the matter round about.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI.

                        <p n="1">I. I Have depicted the Field <hi>Green,</hi> because that in this decoction the <hi>Compositum</hi> becomes <hi>Green,</hi> and keeps this colour longer than any other after the Black.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. This <hi>Greenness</hi> demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates particularly, that our Stone has a Vegetable Soul; and that by the help of art, it is made to grow into a true and pure Tree, to spring up, and bud forth abundantly; and afterwards to send forth infinite little Springs and Branches.</p>

                        <p n="5">V. The Philosophers do commonly use these terms of Art to hide the Secret from Unworthy Men.</p>

VI. They call the <hi>Body</hi> that <hi>black Earth,</hi> which is obscure and dark, and which we make white.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. They call the <hi>Soul,</hi> the other half divided from the body; which by the purpose of God, and work of Nature, gives to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by its Imbibitions and Fermentations a <hi>Vegetable Soul; viz.</hi> a Power and Vertue, to bud, or spring, increase, multiply, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>White,</hi> like a naked shining Sword.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. They call the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> the Tincture and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; which as a Spirit, has power to pierce all things.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. It would be too te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to tell you, how great reason the Philosophers had, to say always, and in all places, <hi>Our Stone hath answerable to human kind, a Body, a Soul, and a Spirit.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">X. I will only inculcate to you, that as a Man endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> is notwithstanding but one Man, or substance: So likewise in this your white <hi>Compositum,</hi> you have but one only substance, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> which are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly united.</p>
                        <p n="9">XI. I could very easily give you most clear Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons and Expositions of this <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> not fit to be divulged: but should I explicate them, I must of necessity declare things which God reserves to himself, to reveal to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect choice, of such as fear and love him, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                        <p n="10">XII. I have then caused to be depicted here, three persons all in white, as if they were rising again, thereby typifying forth this <hi>Body, Soul,</hi> and <hi>Spirit,</hi> to shew you that <hi>Sol, Luna,</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> are raised again in this Operation, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are made Elements, or Inhabitants of the Air, and Whitened.</p>

XIII. For we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, called the <hi>blackness, Death:</hi> and so continuing the Metaphor, we may call <hi>Whiteness Life:</hi> which comes not, but with, and by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. <hi>The Body.</hi> To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate this more plainly, I have made to be painted, <hi>The Body,</hi> lifting up the Stone of its Tomb, wherein it was inclosed.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. <hi>The Soul.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be put into the Earth, it comes not out of a Tomb, and therefore I only depicted or placed it among the Tombs seeking its Body; It is in the form of a Woman, having her Hair dishevelled, or hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about her Ears.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. <hi>The Spirit.</hi> This neither can be put into a Grave; and therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted it, like a Man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out of the Earth, but not from a Tomb.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII.

                        <p n="18">XVIII. Behold, and lift up your Eyes on high, and see the King Ascended; who being raised again by the power of Life, and Crowned with the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Tincture, has overcome Death, the Darkness and Moisture.</p>

And more Noble (next after the Immortal Soul of Man) than any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, whether having life, or not having life: For it is a Quintessence; most pure Silver, having passed the Coupel, yea all assays: and in the words of <hi>David</hi> the Royal Prophet, <hi>It is fine Silver, seven times refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>

                        <p n="24">XXIV. The like may be said of the three Angels over the head of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, representing our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; the one of which Crowns him, and the other two assisting, say, <hi>O Pater Omnipotens: O Jesu bone:</hi> Rendring unto him Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Praise, with Eternal Thanksgiving.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. THe Violet and Blue Field shews forth, that being to pass, or to be changed from the <hi>White</hi>

                           <hi>Stone,</hi> to the <hi>Red,</hi> you must imbibe it with a little Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Milk of <hi>Sol,</hi> that these Colours may come forth from the Mercurial Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, which you have dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Stone.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. In this Work of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifying, although you do imbibe, you shall not have much black, but Violet Blue, and the Colours of the Peacock's Tail.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For this our Stone, is so absolute and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant in <hi>dryness,</hi> that assoon as your <hi>Mercury</hi> touches it, (the nature thereof rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in its like nature) it is joyned unto it, and drinks or swallows it up greedily.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And therefore the black that comes of Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture can shew it self but a little, and that under the Colours of <hi>Violet</hi> and <hi>Blue,</hi> because that <hi>Dryness</hi> (as is said) does in a very short time govern absolutely.</p>
                        <p n="5">V.

                        <p n="6">VI. For in this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fixed Body will gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly ascend up to Heaven, being wholly spiritual, and from thence, it will descend unto the Earth, even whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther soever you please, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Spirit every where, which is always moved by the fire.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Whereby at length, they are made one and the self same nature; the <hi>Compositum,</hi> or Body, being made wholly spiritual; and the spiritual wholly Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real; so much has it been ground, or subtilized upon our Marble (<hi>i. e.</hi> decocted in our Fire) by the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Operations.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The Natures then, are here transmuted into Angels, <hi>viz.</hi> they are made

                        <p n="10">X. For this Operation ought to be done by a <hi>dry fire,</hi> and by a dry <hi>Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Calcination.</hi>

                        <p n="11">XI. And now I have told you a Secret, which you shall scarcely find, or sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom see written, so far am I from hiding what is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary from you: and I would to God, that every Man knew how to make Gold to his own satisfaction, that he might live a life of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and lead forth his Flocks to their Pastures, without Usurers, or going to Law, in imitation of the Holy Patriarchs of old.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Using only as our first Fathers did, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change one thing for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And yet then, to have that, you must labour, and take pains, full as much as you do now.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Therefore for fear of offending God, I must<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beware how I become the Instrument of such a Change; and lest it should prove of evil consequence, I must take heed how and what I write; only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to you, where it is chat we hide the <hi>Keys,</hi> which can open all the Doors, leading into these Secrets of Nature.</p>

to signifie to you, that your white <hi>Compositum,</hi> or stone, must be a little more deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and digested, that the Black of the Violet and Blue must be chased away by the fire.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII.

                           <hi>CHAP. XXXIV.</hi> Of the Figure representing the Apostle <hi>Peter,</hi> Cloathed in a Robe of Citrine Red, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Key in his Right Hand, and laying his Left upon a Woman kneeling by his Feet, in an Orange Coloured Robe, with her Motto.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THe Woman kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cloathed in an Orange coloured Garment, represents <hi>Perrenelle,</hi> as she
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:65913:328"/>
was in her Youth: She is depicted in this manner of a Supplicant at the Feet of a Man with a Key in his Right Hand, stretching out his Left Hand upon her.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Would you know the Interpretation? This is the Stone, which in this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration requesteth two things, (of the <hi>Mercury of Sol,</hi> which is the Philosophers Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, shadowed out under the form of a Man.)</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Which two things, are Multiplication, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection: Which at this time is needful for her to obtain, and therefore the Man so laying his hand upon her, signifies, the granting of her Petition.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But why should I cause a Woman to be pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? I could as well have caused a <hi>Man</hi> as a <hi>Woman,</hi> or rather an <hi>Angel</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picted; for that the whole Natures are now Spiritual and Corporal, Masculine and Feminine.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. But I rather chose to depict a <hi>Woman,</hi> for that she requests rather this than any other thing, as being the natural and proper de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of a Woman.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And also to shew you, that she requests <hi>Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication,</hi> I caused the <hi>Man</hi> to whom she seems to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress her self, to be paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, representing <hi>Peter</hi> with his <hi>Keys,</hi> having power to open and shut, and to bind and loose.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. For that the obscure Philosophers have never spoken of <hi>Multiplication,</hi> but under these common terms of Art, <hi>Aperi, Claude, Solve, Liga,</hi> viz. <hi>Open, shut, bind, loose.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. By opening and loosing, they mean, the making of the body (which is hard and fixt) soft and fluid, and to run like wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: And by shutting and binding, afterwards by a more strong decoction and digestion, to coagulate it, and to bring it back again into the form of a Body.</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <pb n="572" facs="tcp:65913:329"/>
IX. It was requisite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to represent in this place, a <hi>Man</hi> with a <hi>Key;</hi> to shew you that you must now <hi>open</hi> and <hi>shut,</hi> (that is to say) the budding, or spring and encreasing <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">X. For observe, so often as you shall dissolve and fix, so often will these <hi>Natures</hi> multiply, in Quantity, Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and Quickness or Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; which encrease is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proportion of one to ten.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. So that if the first augmentation be from 1 to 10, the second multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is from 10 to 100 (which is still but decuple) the third from 100 to 1000, the fourth from 1000 to 10000, the fifth from 10000 to 100000, the sixth from 100000 to 1000000, or a Million, thus continually increasing by a <hi>decuple</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion <hi>ad infinitum:</hi> The which augmentation I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed three times, thanks be to God.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. When your Elixir is thus brought unto a kind of Infinity; one grain thereof falling upon a vast quantity of melted Metal, will tinge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, and convert it into the most perfect Metal, to wit, into most fine Silver or Gold, according as it shall have been imbibed and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, expelling, driving forth, and purging out, all the impure, and Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gene matter which was joyned with it, in its first Generation.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. For this reason therefore, I caused a <hi>Key</hi> to be depicted in the hand of a <hi>Man,</hi> to signifie that the stone desires to be opened and shut for <hi>Multiplication;</hi> and also to shew you with what <hi>Mercury</hi> you ought to do this, and when, or at what time, I caused the <hi>Man's Garment</hi> to be made <hi>Citrine Red,</hi> and the <hi>Woman's</hi> of an <hi>Orange Colour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. I must speak no more of this matter, lest I transgress the <hi>Sacred Silence Philosophical:</hi> Only know

that the <hi>Woman,</hi> who is <hi>our Stone,</hi> requesteth to have rich Accountrements, like those of the <hi>Man's</hi> with the Key, which she expresseth by her Motto, <hi>Christe, Precor esto Pius;</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>XV. As if she should say,</hi> O Lord my God, be good and gracious unto me, and suffer me not to be spoiled and undone, Let not him who is come thus far spoil all with his too great zeal, or fire: And though it is true, that from henceforth, I shall no more fear my Enemies, but pass the most vehement fire, like as through most pleasant Tropick Breeze.</p>

Take heed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to this your fire in this place, and manage it with much gentleness and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, attend in hope upon this most admirable quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: And though the fire ought to be something aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, yet it must not be too much.</p>

                        <p n="1">I.

                        <p n="4">IV. And that she (to wit, the Stone, Elixir, or Tincture) appears now like a ravenous Lyon, devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and swallowing up eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pure metallick Nature or Body, and changing it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its own true Substance, into true and most pure fine Gold, exceeding in fineness the Gold of <hi>Ophir,</hi> or that of the best and richest Mines.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Male <hi>Sulphur,</hi> is nothing but Fire and Air; and the true Sulphur is as a Fire, but not the Vulgar, which contains no metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Substance.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Feminine Sperm is <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:65913:331"/>
but Earth and Water; these two Sperms the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Sages called two Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons or Serpents, of which, the one is winged, the other not.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>Sulphur</hi> not flying the Fire, is without Wings; the winged Serpent is <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> born up by the Wind, therefore in her certain hour, she flies from the Fire, not having fixity enough to endure it.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Now if these two Spermes, separated from themselves, be united again, by powerful Nature, in the potentiality of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is the Metaline Fire: being thus united, it is called by the Philosophers the <hi>fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dragon;</hi> because the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> kindled by its Fire, while he flies by little and little, fills the Air with his Fire, and poysonous Vapours.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. The same thing doth Mercury; for being placed upon an exteriour Fire, and in its place in a Vessel; it sets on fire its inside, which is hidden in its profundity; by which may be seen, how the External Fire does burn and inflame the natural <hi>Mercury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And then you may see how the poysonous Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour breaks out into the Air, with a most stinking and pernitious poyson; which is nothing else but the head of the <hi>Dragon,</hi> which hastily goes out of <hi>Babylon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">IX. But other Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have compared this <hi>Mercury,</hi> with a <hi>Flying Lion,</hi> because a <hi>Lion</hi> is a devourer of other Creatures, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights himself in his vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of every thing, except that which is able to resist his Violence and Fury.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. So also does <hi>Mercury;</hi> which has in its self such a Power, Force, and Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to spoil and devastate a Metal of its Form, and to devour it. <hi>Mercury</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much influenced, devours and hides Metals in its Belly; but which of them so ever it be, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that it consumes it not, for in their Nature, they
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:65913:332"/>
are perfect, and much more indurate.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. But <hi>Mercury</hi> has in it self a Substance of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna:</hi> and all the imperfect Bodies or Metals, proceed from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive;</hi> therefore, the Ancients called it the <hi>Mother of Metals;</hi> whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that in its own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Center, being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, it has a double Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Substance.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII.

                        <p n="13">XIII. As soon then as Nature has formed <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> of the two after-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Spirits, then it endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to make them Perfect and Corporeal; but when the Spirits are of Strength, and the two Sperms awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of their Central Principle, then they desire to assume their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Which being done, <hi>Argent Vive</hi> the Mother must die, and being thus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mortified, cannot (as dead things cannot) quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it self as before.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. But there are some proud Philosophers, who in obscure words affirm, that we ought to transmute both perfect and imperfect bodies into running <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> this is the Serpent's subtilty, and you may be in danger of being bit by it.</p>

It is true, that <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> may transmute an imperfect Body, as <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Tin;</hi> and may without much labour, multiply in a Quantity; but thereby it diminishes or loses its own perfection, and may no more for this reason be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Argent Vive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. But if by Art it may be mortified, that it can no more Vivifie it self, then it will be changed into another thing, as in <hi>Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar,</hi> or <hi>Sublimate</hi> is done: For when it is by the Art
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:65913:332"/>
coagulated, whether sooner or later, yet then its two Bodies assume not a fixed Body, nor can they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, as we may see in the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Lest any one therefore should err, there are in the Veins of Lead some fixed Grains or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of fine <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> mixed in its substance or nourishment.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. The first coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is the Mine of <hi>Saturn;</hi> and most fit and proper it is to bring him unto perfection and fixation; for the Mine of <hi>Saturn</hi> is not without fixed Particles of Gold, which Particles were imparted to it by Nature: So in its self it may be multiplied, and brought to perfection, and a vast power or strength, as I have tryed and therefore affirm it.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. So long as it is not separated from its Mine, <hi>viz.</hi> its <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> but well kept, (for every Metal which is in its Mine, the same is an <hi>Argent Vive</hi>) then may it multiply it self, for that it has substance from its <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> but it will be like some Green Immature Fruit on a Tree, which the Blossom being past, becomes an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe Fruit, and then a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Apple.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. Now if any one plucks this unripe Fruit from the Tree, then its first form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be frustrate, nor would it grow larger nor ripe; for Man knows not how to give Substance, Nourishment, or Maturity, so well as Internal Nature, while the Fruit yet hangs on the Tree, which feeds it with Substance and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, till the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Maturity is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. And so long also does the Fruit draw Sap or Moisture for its augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nourishment, till it comes to its perfect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. So is it with <hi>Sol;</hi> for if by Nature, a Grain,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:65913:333"/>
or Grains are made, and it is reduced to its <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> then also by the same it is daily (without ceasing) su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained and supplied, and reduced into its place, <hi>viz. Argent Vive,</hi> as he is in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and then must you wait till he shall obtain some substance from his <hi>Mercury</hi> as it happens in the Fruits of Trees.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. For as the <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> both of perfect and imperfect Bodies is a Tree, so they can have no more nourishment, otherwise than from their own Mercury.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. If therefore, you would gather Fruit from <hi>Argent Vive, viz.</hi> pure <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> if they be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from their <hi>Mercury;</hi> think not that you, (like as Nature did in the begining) may again conjoyn and multiply, and without change, augment them.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. For if Metals be separated from their Mine, then they (like the Fruit of Trees too soon gathered) never come to their perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as Nature and Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience makes it appear: For if an Apple or Pear be once plucked off from the Tree, it would then be a great Vanity to attempt to fasten it to the Tree again, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting it to encrease and grow ripe: and experience testifies, that the more it is handled, the more it wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. And so it is also with Metals: For if you should take the Vulgar <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> endeavouring to reduce them into <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> you would wholly play the Fool, for there is no Artifice yet found, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it can be performed: Though you should use ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Waters, and Cements, or other things infinitly of that kind, yet would you continually err, and that would befal you, which would him that should tie unripe Fruit to their Trees.</p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. Yet some Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers have said truly, That if <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> by a right <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Argent Vive</hi> be rightly conjoyned, they
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:65913:333"/>
will make all imperfect me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals perfect: But in this thing most Men have erred, who having these three, Vegetables, Animals, and Minerals, which in one thing are conjoyned; for that they considered not, that the Philosophers speak not of Vulgar <hi>Sol, Luna,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are all <hi>dead,</hi> and receive no more substance or increase from Nature, but remain the same in their own Essence, without the possibility of bringing others to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. They are Fruits plucked off from their Trees before their time, and are therefore of no value or esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: Therefore seek the Fruit in the Tree, that leads them streight to it, whose Fruit is daily made greater with increase, so long as the Tree bears it: This Work is seen with joy and satisfaction; and by this means one may trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant the Tree without ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Fruit, fixing it into a moister, better, and a more fruitful place, which in one day will give more nourishment to the Fruit, than it received otherwise in an Hundred Years.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. In this therefore it is understood, that <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> the much commended Tree must be taken, which has in its power indissolva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna;</hi> and then transplanted into another Soil nearer the Sun, that thence it may gain its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable increase, for which thing, <hi>Dew</hi> does abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suffice: For where it was placed before, it was so weakened by Cold and Wind, that little Fruit could be expected from it, and where it long stood and brought forth no Fruit at all.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. And indeed the Philosophers have a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, where the Sun as well Morning as Evening re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with a most sweet Dew, without ceasing, with which it is sprinkled and moistened; whole Earth brings forth Trees and Fruits, which are transplan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thither, which also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:65913:334"/>
descent and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the pleasant Meadows.</p>
                        <p n="32">XXXII. And this is done daily, and there they are both corroborated and quickened, without ever sading; and this more in one Year, than in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand, where the cold af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects them.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. Take them therefore, and Night and Day cherish them in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillatory Fire; but not with a Fire of Wood or Coals, but in a clear transparent Fire, not unlike the Sun, which is never hotter than is requisite, but is always alike: For a Vapour is the Dew, and Seed of Metals, which ought not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.</p>
                        <p n="34">XXXIV. Fruits, if they be too hot, and without Dew or moisture, they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide on the Boughs, but without coming to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, only withering or dwindling away: But if they be fed with heat and due moisture on their Trees, then they prove Elegant and fruitful: For heat and moisture are the Elements of all Earthly things, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Vegetable, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                        <p n="35">XXXV. Therefore Fires of Wood and Coal produce or help not Metals; those are violent Fires, which nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish not as the heat of the Sun does, that conserves all Corporeal things; for that it is natural which they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. But a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher acts not what Nature does: For Nature where she rules, forms all Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Animals, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, in their own degrees: Men, do not after the same sort, by their Arts make natural things: When Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has finished her work about them; then by our Art they are made more perfect.</p>
                        <p n="37">XXXVII. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ancient Sages and Philosophers, for our infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, wroughr on <hi>Luna</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> her true Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:65913:334"/>
of which they made <hi>the Mercury of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi> which in its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is much stronger than the <hi>Natural Mercury:</hi> For this is serviceable only to the simple, perfect, imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, hot and cold Metals: But <hi>our Mercury,</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher's-Stone, is useful to the more than perfect, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies, or Metals.</p>
                        <p n="38">XXXVIII. Also that the Sun may perfect and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish them without diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, addition, or immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they were created or formed by Nature, and so leaves them, not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any thing.</p>
                        <p n="39">XXXIX. I will not now say, that the Philosophers conjoyn the Tree, for the better perfecting their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, as some unskilful in the nature of things, and unlearned Chymists affirm, who take common Sol, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and Mercury, and so unnaturally handle them, till they evanish in smoak: These Men endeavour to make the Philosophers Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, but they never attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, which is the first mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Stone, and the first <hi>Minera</hi> thereof.</p>
                        <p n="40">XL. If you would come hither and find good, and to the Mountain of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where there is no plain, you would betake your self, from the highest, you must look downward to the sixth, which you will see afar off.</p>
                        <p n="41">XLI. In the height of this Mountain, you will find a Royal Herb trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing, which some have called Mineral, some Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, some Saturnine: But let its Bones or Ribs be left, and let a pure clean Broth be taken from it; so will the better part of your work be done.</p>
                        <p n="42">XLII. This is the right and subtil Mercury of the Philosophers, which you are to take, which will make first the white work, and then the red: If you have well understood me, both of them are nothing else, as they term them, but the practick, which is so easie
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:65913:335"/>
and so simple, that a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man sitting by her Distaff may perfect it.</p>
                        <p n="43">XLIII. As if in Winter she would put her Eggs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Hen, and not wash them (because Eggs are put under a Hen without wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them) and no more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is required about them, than that they should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day turned, that the Chickens may be the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and sooner hatched, concerning the which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough is said.</p>
                        <p n="44">XLIV. But that I may follow the Example, first, wash not the Mercury, but take it, and (with its like, which is fire) place it in the Ashes, which is Straw, and in one Glass which is the Nest, without any other thing in a convenient Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, which is the House, from whence will come forth a Chicken, which with its Blood will free thee from all Diseases, and with its Flesh will nourish thee, and with its Feathers will cloath thee, and keep thee warm from the Injuries of the cold and ambient Air.</p>
                        <p n="45">XLV. For this cause I have written this present Treatise, that you may search with the greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, and walk in the right way: And I have written this small Book, this Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that you might the better comprehend the Sayings and Writings of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, which I believe you will much better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand for time to come.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XXXVII.</hi> Of the Original of Metals, and Principles of the Mineral Work.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THE Bodies of all Natural Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well perfect as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect from the Original of time, and compounded of a quaternity of Elements or Natures, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, Air, Earth, Water, are conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God Almighty in a perfect Unity.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. In these four Elements is hid the Secret of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers: The Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter give Corporeity and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility: The Fire and Air, the Spirit and Invisible Power, which cannot be seen or touched but in the other two.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. When these four E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements are conjoyned, and made to exist in one, they become another thing; whence it is evident, that all things in nature are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the said Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:65913:336"/>
being altered and changed.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. So saith <hi>Rhasis, Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Generation, and Natural Transformation is the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Elements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. But it is necessary, that the Elements be of one kind, and not divers, to vit, Simple: For otherwise neither Action nor Passion could happen between them: So saith <hi>Aristotle, There is no true Generation, but of things agreeing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> So that things be not made but according to their Natures.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The Eldar or Oak Trees will not bring forth Pears; nor can you gather Grapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles, things bring not forth, but only their like, or what agrees with them in Nature, each Tree its own Fruit.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Our Secret there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is to be drawn only out of those things in which it is. You cannot extract it out of Stones or Salt, or other Heterogene Bodies: Neither Salt nor Alum en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into our mystery: But as <hi>Theophrastus</hi> saith, <hi>The Philosophers disguise with Salts and Alums, the Places of the Elements.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. If you prudently desire to make our Elixir, you must extract it from a Mineral Root: For as <hi>Geber</hi> saith, <hi>You must obtain the perfection of the Matter from the Seeds thereof.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Sulphur and Mercury are the Mineral Roots, and Natural Principles, upon which Nature her self acts and works in the Mines and Caverns of the Earth, which are Viscous Water, and Subtil Spirit running through the Pores, Veins, and Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Mountains.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Of them is produced a Vapour or Cloud, which is the substance and body of Metals united, ascending, and reverberating upon its own proper Earth, (as <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> sheweth) even till by a temperate digestion through the space of a Thousand
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:65913:336"/>
Years, the matter is fixed, and converted into a Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stone, of which metals are made.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. In the same manner of Sol which is our Sulphur, being reduced into Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by Mercury, which is the Viscous Water made thick, and mixt with its proper Earth, by a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate decoction and digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ariseth the Vapour or Cloud, agreeing in nature and substance with that in the Bowels of the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. This afterwards is turned into most subtil wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is called the Soul, Spirit, and Tincture, as we shall hereafter shew.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. When this Water is returned into the Earth, (out of which it was drawn) and every way spreads through or is mixed with it, as its proper Womb, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes fixed. Thus the Wise man does that by Art in a short time, which Nature cannot perform in less than the Revolution of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Years.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it is not We that make the metal, but Nature her self that does it. Nor do or can we change one thing into another; but it is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that changes them: We are no more than meer Servants in the work.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. Therefore <hi>Medus</hi> in <hi>Turba Philosophorum,</hi> saith, <hi>Our Stone naturally contains in it the whole Tincture.</hi> It is perfectly made in the Mountains and Body of the Earth; yet of it self (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out art) it has no life or power whereby to move the Elements.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Chuse then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Minerals, to which, by the advice of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> add Art: For Nature gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates Metaline Bodies of the Vapours, Clouds, or Fumes of Sulphur and Mercury, to which all the Philosophers agree. Know therefore the Principles upon which Art works, to wit, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or beginnings of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals: For he that knows not these things shall never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

                        <p n="17">
                           <hi>XVII.</hi> Geber <hi>saith,</hi> He who has not in himself the knowledge, of the Natural Principles, is far from attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perfection of the Art: <hi>being Ignorant of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Root upon which he should work.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. <hi>Geber</hi> also farther saith, <hi>That our Art is only to be understood and Learned through the true wisdom and knowledge of Natural things:</hi> that is, with a wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom searching into the Roots and Natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the matter.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. Yet saith he, my Son, I shew thee a Secret, though thou knowest the Principles, yet therein thou canst not follow Nature in all things. Herein some have erred, in Essaying to follow Nature in all her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and differences.</p>

                        <p n="1">
                           <hi>I. THe second Principle of our Stone is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Mercury, <hi>which some Philosophers call (as it is simple of it self) a Stone. One of them said,</hi> This is a Stone, and no Stone, and that without which Nature never performs any thing; which enters into, or is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up of other Bodies, and also swallows them up.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. This is simply <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> which contains the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Power, which Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the Tincture of our Elixir or Philosophers Stone.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="589" facs="tcp:65913:337"/>
III. Therefore saith <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis, such a thing may be made of it which exceedeth the highest perfection of Nature.</hi> For it is the Root of Metals, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monises with them, and is the Medium that expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates and conjoyns the Tinctures.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. For it swallows up that which is of its own Nature and production; but rejects what isForreign and Heterogene: being of an Uniform substance in all its parts.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. THis is a great and certain truth, that the Clean ought to be sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Unclean, for nothing can give that which it has not: For the pure substance is of one sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essence, void of all He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneity: But that which is impure and unclean, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of Heterogene parts, is not simple, but compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (to wit of pure and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure) and apt to putrifie and corrupt.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Therefore let nothing enter into your Compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is Alien or Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the matter, (as all Impurity is;) for nothing goes to the Composition of our Stone, that proceedeth not from it, neither in part nor in whole.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. If any strange or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign thing be mixed with it, it is immediately corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by that Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Work becomes fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Citrine Bodies (as Sol, &amp;c.) you must purge by Calcination or Cementation; and it is then purged or purified if it be fine and florid.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The metal being well cleansed, beat it into thin Plates or Leaves (as is Leaf Gold,) and reserve them for use.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The White Liquor (as Mercury) contains two Superfluities, which must necessarily be removed from it, <hi>viz.</hi> Its foetid <hi>Earthiness,</hi> which hinders its Fusion: and its <hi>Humidity,</hi> which causes its flying.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="591" facs="tcp:65913:338" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                           <hi>VII. The Earthiness is thus removed.</hi> Put it into a Marble or Wooden mortar, with its equal weight of pure fine and dry Salt, and a little Vinegar! Grind all with the Pestle, till nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appears, but the whole Salt becomes very black. Wash this whole matter with pure Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till the Salt is dissolved; this filtby water decant, and put to the Mercury again as much more Salt and Vinegar, grinding it as before, and washing it with fair water, which work so often repeat, till the water comes clear from it, and that the Mercury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains pure bright and clear like a Venice Looking Glass, and of a Coelestial Colour. Then strain it through a Linen Cloth three or four times dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, two or three times (into a clean Glass Vessel) till it be dry.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The proportion of the parts is as 24 to 1. There are 24 Hours in a Natural Day, to which add one, and it is 25. [to wit, the Rising of the Sun.] To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this, is Wisdom, as <hi>Geber</hi> saith. Indeavour through the whole Work to over-power the <hi>Mercury</hi> in Commixtion.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Rhasis</hi> saith, Those Bodies come nearest to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which contain most <hi>Argent Vive:</hi> He farther saith, That the Philosophers hid nothing but Weight and Measure, to wit, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of the Ingredients, which is clear, for that none of them all agree one with another therein: which causeth great error.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Though the matters be well prepared and well mixed, without the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions or Quantities of the things be just, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the reason of the Work, you will miss of the truth, or the end, and lose all your Labour; you will not indeed bring any thing to perfection.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And this is evident in the Examination: When there is a Transmutation of the Body, or that the Body is changed, then let it be put into the Cineritium or
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:65913:339"/>
Test, and then it will be consumed, or otherwise re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; according as the proportions are more or less than just; or just as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        <p n="12">XII. If they be right and just, according to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that, your Body will be incorruptible and remain firm, without any loss, through all Essays and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als: you can do nothing in this work without the true knowledge of this thing, whose Foundation is Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matter, purity of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and right Reason or proportion.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. <hi>EUclid</hi> the Philosopher, and a man of great understanding, advises to work in nothing but in <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Mercury;</hi> which joyned together make the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and admirable Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone, as <hi>Rhasis</hi> saith: White and Red, both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one Root; no other Bodies coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
                        <p n="3">II. But yet the Gold, wanting <hi>Mercury,</hi> is hindred from working according to his power. Therefore know that no Stone, nor Pearl, or other Forreign thing, but this our Stone, belongs to this work.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. You must therefore Labour about the Dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Citrine Body, to reduce it into its first matter: for as <hi>Rhasis</hi> saith, <hi>We dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Gold, that it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into its first Nature or matter that is into Mercury.</hi>

IV. For being broken and made One, they have in themselves the whole Tincture both of the <hi>Agent</hi> and <hi>Patient.</hi> Wherefore saith <hi>Rhasis,</hi> make a Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age (that is a Conjunction) between the RED <hi>Man,</hi> and his WHITE <hi>Wife,</hi> and you shall have the whole Secret.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <hi>V. The same saith</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin: If you Merry the White Woman to the Red Man, they will be Conjoyned and Imbrace one another, and become im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated. By themselves they are Dissolved, and by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves they bring forth what they have conceived, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the two are made but one Body.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And truly our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, is only the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the hard Body into a liquid form, and into the Nature of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> that the Saltness of the <hi>Sulphur</hi> may be diminished.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Without our Brass then be Broken, Ground, and Gently and Prudently managed, till it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from its hard and Dense Body, into a thin and subtil Spirit, you la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in Vain.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And therefore in the <hi>Speculum Alchymiae</hi> it is said, <hi>The first work is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the Body into Water, that is, into Mercury.</hi> And this the Philosophers called <hi>Dissolution,</hi> which is the Foundation of the whole Art.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. This Dissolution makes the Body of an Evident Liquidity, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Subtilty: and this is done by a gentle Grinding, and a soft and continued Assation or Digestion.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Wherefore saith <hi>Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> the work of making our Stone is, that the matter be put into its proper Vessel, and continually Decocted and Digested, until such time as it wholly Ascends, or Sublimes to the top there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. This is declared in <hi>Speculum Philosophorum. The</hi>

Philosophers Stone is converted from a vile thing, into a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Substance: for the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Solare,</hi> is cast into the Matrix of Mercury, by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation or Conjunction, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in process of time they be made one.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Also, that when it is Compounded with the like, and Mercurizated, then it shall be the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bud. For the <hi>Soul,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the <hi>Tincture</hi> may then be drawn out of them by the help of a gentle Fire.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Therefore saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the true matters or principles are not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be transformed or changed (by the most Learned in Alchymie) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be reduced into their first matter.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. And <hi>Geber</hi> saith, all ought to be made of Mercury only: for when <hi>Sol</hi> is reduced to its first Original or Matter, by Mercury, then Nature em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth Nature.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. And then it will be easie to draw out the Subtil and Spiritual Substance thereof: of which <hi>Alkindus</hi> saith, take the things from their Mines, and Exact or Subtilize them, and reduce them to their Roots, or first matter, which is <hi>Lumen Luminum.</hi>

                        <p n="16">XVI.

THe Vessel for our Stone is but one, in which the, whole Magistery or Elixir is performed and perfected; this is a Cucur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, whose Bottom is round like an Egg, or an Urinal, smooth within, that it may Ascend and Descend the more easily, covered with a <hi>Limbeck</hi> round and smooth every where, and not very high, and whose Bottom is round also like an Egg.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Its largeness ought to be such; that the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine or matter may not fill above a fourth part of it, made of strong double Glass, clear and transparent, that you may see through it, all the Colours appertaining to, and appearing in the work; in which the Spirit moving continually, cannot pass or flie away.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Let it also be so clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that as nothing can go out of it, so nothing can enter into it; as <hi>Lucas</hi> saith, <hi>Lute the Vessel strongly with</hi> Lutum Sapientiae, <hi>that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing may get in or go out of it.</hi>

V. And though the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers oftentimes say, that the matter is to be put into the Vessel, and closed up fast, yet it is sufficient for the Operator, once to put the said matter in, once to close it up, and so to keep it even to the very perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and finishing of the work.

                        <p n="9">IX.

                        <p n="17">XVII. For with an easie decoction, the water is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, and the humidity which corrupteth, drawn out; and in drying, the burning is avoided.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. YOu ought to put on Courage, Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Constancy, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting this great work, lest you Err, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, sometimes following or doing one thing, and then another.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. For the knowledge of this Art consisteth not in the multiplicity, or great number of things, but in Unity; Our Stone is but One, the matter is One, and the Vessel is One: The Government is One, and the disposition is One. The whole Art and Work thereof is One, and begins
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:65913:343"/>
in One manner, and in One manner it is finished.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Notwithstanding the Philosophers have subtily delivered themselves, and clouded their instructions with AEigmatical and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Phrases and Words, to the end that their Art might not only be hidden and so continued, but also be had in the greater Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Thus they advise to Decoct, to Commix, and to Conjoyn; to Sublime, to Bake, to Grind, and to Congeal; to make Equal, to Puttefie, to make White, and to make Red; of all which things, the order. management and way of working is all one, which is only to Decoct.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And therefore to Grind is to Decoct, of which you are not to be weary, saith <hi>Rhasis:</hi> Digest continually, but not in haste [that is, not with too great a Fire;] cease not, or make no intermission in your work, follow not the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Sophisters, but pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue your Operation, to the Complement and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof.</p>

                           <hi>VI. Also in the</hi> Rosary <hi>it is advised,</hi> to be cautious and watchful, lest your work prove dead or imperfect, and to continue it with a long Decoction. <hi>Close up well thy Vessel, and pursue to the end.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. For there is no Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of things, but by Putrefaction, by keeping out the Air, and a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al internal motion, with an equal and gentle Heat.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Remember when you are in your work, all the Signs and Appearances which arise in every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, for they are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood in order to the perfecting the matter.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. You must be sure to be incessant and continual in your Operation, with a gentle Fire, to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the perfect White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which cannot be if

                        <p n="2">II. And in about the space of Forty Days, the superficies or upper part of the Medicine will appear black as melted Pitch: and this is the Sign, that the Citrine Body is truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into Mercury.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <hi>III. Therefore saith</hi> Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellus, when you see the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:65913:344"/>
of the Water to appear, be assured that the <hi>(Citrine)</hi> Body is made Liquid: <hi>The same thing saith</hi> Rhasis; the Disposition or Operation of our Stone is One, which is, that it be put into its Vessel and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Decocted and Digested, till such time as the whole Body ibe Dissolved and As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And in another place he saith, continue it upon a temperate or gentle <hi>Balneo,</hi> so long till it be perfectly Dissolved into Water, and made impalpable, and that the whole Tincture be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted into the blackness, which is the Sign of its dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>Lucas</hi> also assureth us, that when we see the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the water in all things to appear, that then the Body is dissolved, or made Liquid.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. This blackness the Philosophers called the first Conjunction; for then the Male and Female are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together; and it is the Sign of perfect mixtion.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the whole Tincture is not drawn out together; but it goes out every day, by little and little, until by a great length of time, it is perfectly extracted, and made compleat.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And that part of the Body which is dissolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ever Ascends or Rises to the Top, above all the other undissolved Matter which remains yet at Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>

                        <p n="10">X.

or moisture has the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but if that be once wasted, then it emits divers Colours, after many and several ways.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And many times it shall be changed from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to Colour, till such time as it comes to the fixed Whiteness.</p>

                        <p n="9">IX. But value none of these Colours, for they be not the true Tincture: yea many times it becomes <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> and Redish; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times it is dryed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes liquid again, before the Whiteness will appear.</p>
                        <p n="10">X.

                        <p n="12">XII. The cause of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of such variety of Colours in the Operation of your Medicine, is from the extension of the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for as much as Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Whiteness be the extream Colours, all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Colours are but means between them.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Therefore as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as any degree or portion of Blackness descends, so often another and another Colour appears, until it comes to Whiteness.</p>
                        <p n="14">
                           <hi>XIV.

XV. Moreover this you are to observe, that if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Blackness and the Whiteness, there should appear the Red or Citrine Colour, you are not to look upon it or esteem it, for it is not fixt but will vanish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. There cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be any perfect and fixt <hi>Redness,</hi> without it be first <hi>White:</hi> Wherefore saith <hi>Rhasis,</hi> no Man can come from the first to the third, but by the second.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. From whence it is evident, that Whiteness must always be first lookt for, [after the Blackness, and before the Redness,] for as much as it is the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the whole Work.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Then after this Whiteness appears, it shall not be changed into any true or stable Colour, but into the Red: Thus have we taught you to make the White; it remains now that we elucidate the Red.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XLVI.</hi> Of the Way and Manner how to educe the Red Tincture out of the White.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THe matters then of the White and Red, among themselves, differ not in respect to their Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence: But the Red Elixir needs more subtilization, and longer digestion, and a hotter fire in the course of the Operation, than the White, because the end of the White work, is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Red work; and that which is compleat in the one, is to be begun in the other.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="608" facs="tcp:65913:347"/>
II. Therefore without you make the White Elixir first, make the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come first White, you can never come to the Red E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir, that which is indeed the true Red: Which how it is to be performed we shall briefly shew.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Medicine for the Red ought to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our moist fire, until the White Colour aforesaid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, afterwards take out the Vessel from the fire, and put it into another pot with sifted Ashes made moist with water, to about half full, in which let it stand up to the middle thereof, making under the Earthen pot a temperate dry fire, and that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But the heat of this dry fire ought to be double at the least, to what it was before, or than the heat of the moist fire, by the help of this heat, the white Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine receiveth the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Tincture of the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. You cannot err if you continue the dry fire: Therefore <hi>Rhasis</hi> saith, <hi>With a dry fire, and a dry Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion decoct the dry matter, till such time as it becomes in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, like to Vermilion or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. To the which you shall not afterwards put (to compleat it) either Water, or Oyl, or Vinegar, or any other thing.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Decoct the Red Matter, or Medicine; the more red it is, the more worth it is; and the more decocted it is, the more red it is: Therefore that which is more decocted, is the more pretious and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Therefore you must burn it without fear in a dry fire, until such time as it is clothed with a most Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Red, or a pure Vermil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion Colour.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. For which cause <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistus</hi> the Philosopher saith, <hi>Decoct the White in a Red hot</hi>
                           <pb n="609" facs="tcp:65913:347"/>
                           <hi>Furnace, until such time it be clothed with a purple Glory.</hi> Do not cease, though the Redness be somewhat long, before it appears.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. For as I have said, the fire being augmented, the first Colour of White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, will change into Red: Also when the Citrine shall first appear, among those Colours, yet that Colour is not fixt.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. But not long after it, the Red Colour shall begin to appear, which ascending to the height, your Work will indeed be compleat.</p>
                        <p n="12">
                           <hi>XII. As</hi> Hermes <hi>saith in</hi> Turba, Between the Whiteness and the Redness, one Colour only appears, to wit, Citrine, but it changes from the less to the more.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. <hi>Maria</hi> also saith, <hi>When you have the true White, then follows</hi> the false and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine Colour; <hi>and at last the Perfect Redness it self.</hi> This is the Glory and the beauty of the whole World.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XLVII.</hi> Of the Multiplication, or Augmentation of our Medicine, by Dissolution.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. OUR Medicine, or Elixir, is multiplyed after a two-fold manner, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. By Dissolution. 2. By Fermentation.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. By Dissolution, it is augmented two manner of ways, First, by a greater or more intense heat: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by Dew, or the heat of a <hi>Balneum Roris.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Dissolution of heat is, that you take the Medicine put into a glasen
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:65913:348"/>
Vessel, or boil or decoct it in our moist fire for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days or more, until the Medicine be dissolved into Water, which will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Trouble.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The dissolution by Dew, or <hi>Balneum Roris,</hi> is, that you take the Glass Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel with the Medicine in it, and hang it in a Brazen or Coper Pot, with a narrow Mouth, in which there must be water boyling, the Mouth of the Vessel being in the mean Season shut, that the Ascending Vapours of the boyling water may, dissolve the Medicine.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. But Note, that the boyling water ought not to touch the Glass Vessel, which contains the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, by three or four Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and this Dissolution pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly may be done in two or three days.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. After the Medicine is dissoved, take it from the Fire, and let it cool, to be fixed, to be congealed, and to be made hard or dryed; and so let it be dissolved many times; for so much the oftner it is dissolved, so much the more strong, and the more perfect it shall be.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Therefore <hi>Bonellus</hi> saith, <hi>When the AEs, Brass, or Laten is burned, and this burning many times reiteated, it is made better than it was:</hi> and this Solution is the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilization of the Medicine, and the Sublimation of the Virtues thereof.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. So that the oftner it is sublimed and made sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, so much the more Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it shall receive; and the more penetrative shall the Tincture be made, and more plentiful in quantity; and the more perfect it is, the more it shall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. In the Fourth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation then, it shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such a Virtue and Tincture that one part shall be able to transmute a thousand parts of the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Metal into fine Gold or Silver, better than that which is Generated in the Mines.</p>
                        <p n="10">
                           <pb n="611" facs="tcp:65913:348"/>
                           <hi>X. Therefore saith</hi> Rhasis, The goodness or excellency of the Multiplication hereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends only on the Reiteration of the dissolution and fixation of the perfect Medicine.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. For so much the oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the work is Reiterated, so much the more fruitful it will be, and so much the more augmented.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. So much the oftner you sublime it, so much the more you increase it: for every time it is augmented in Virtue, and Power, and Tincture, one more to be cast upon a thousand; at a second time upon ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand; at the third time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one hundred thousand; at the fourth time upon a Million: And thus you way increase its Power by the number of the Reiterations, till it is almost infinite.</p>
                        <p n="13">
                           <hi>XIII. Therefore saith</hi> Meredes <hi>the Philosopher,</hi> know for certain, that the oftner the Matter or Stone is dissolved and congealed, the more absolutely and perfectly, the Spirit and Soul are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned and retained.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. And for this cause, every time the Tincture is Multiplied, after a most admirable and unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. OUr Medicine is Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and the Ferment for the <hi>White</hi> is pure <hi>Luna,</hi> the Ferment for the <hi>Red,</hi> is pure fine <hi>Sol.</hi>

                        <p n="2">II. Now cast one part of
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:65913:349"/>
the Medicine upon twenty parts of the Ferment, and all shall become Medicine, Elixir, or Tincture: Put it on the Fire in a Glass Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and seal it so that no Air go in or out, dissolve and subtilize it, as oft as you please, even as you did for making of the first Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And one part of this second Medicine, shall have as much Virtue and Power, as Ten parts of the former.</p>

                           <hi>IV.

                        <p n="5">V. You must then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn it, that it may Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate its like; yet you must not joyn it with any other that it might convert it to the same, but only with that very same kind, of whose substance it was in the beginning.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <hi>VI. For</hi> in Speculo Terrae Spiritualis, <hi>it is written,</hi> that the Elixir is figured in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, from whence it was taken in the beginning, when it was to be dissolved.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. That is to say, to dispose, Marry or Conjoyn that Earth revived, and in its Soul purified by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion of its first Body, from whence it took begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <hi>VIII.

                        </p>
                        <p n="9">IX. And so the White Earth is Ferment of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for when it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned with <hi>Luna;</hi> or shall be made a Medicine, it is to cast upon Mercury, and every imperfect Metaline Body, to be converted into <hi>Luna.</hi>

                        <p n="12">XII. Wherefore we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Argent Vive to be mixed with Argent Vive, until one clear water be made of two Argent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve's Compounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. But you must not make the mixture of them, till each of them apart or separately be dissolved into water: and in the Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of them, put a little of the matter upon much of the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> First upon four; and it shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in a short time a fine Pouder, whose Tincture shall be <hi>White</hi> or <hi>Red.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. This Pouder is the true and perfect Elixir or Tincture, and the Elixir or Tincture, is truly a simple Pouder.</p>

Keep entire the sume or vapour, and take heed that nothing thereof flie out from it: Tarry by the Vessel and behold the wonders, how it changes from Colour to Colour, in less space than an hours time, till such time as it comes to the Signs of White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Redness.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. For it melts quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Fire, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals in the Air.

                        <p n="18">XVIII. This Pouder is the compleat and perfect Elixir or Tincture; now you may separate or take, if from the fire, and let it cool.</p>

                        <p n="20">XX. From what has been said, it is manifest and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that if you do not congeal Argent Vive, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it to bear or endure the fire, and then conjoyning it with pure Silver, you shall never attain to the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. And if you make not Argent ViveRed, and so as it may endure the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est fire, and then conjoyn it with pure fine Gold, you shall never attain to the Redness.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. XLIX.</hi> Of the Differences of the Medicine and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions used in Projection.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. GEBER, <hi>the</hi> Arabian <hi>Prince, Alchymist, and Philosopher, in</hi> lib. 5. cap. 21. saith, <hi>That there is three orders of Medicines.</hi> The First Order, is of such Medicines, which being cast upon imperfect Bodies, takes not away their Corruption or Imperfection, but only give Tincture, which in Examination, flies away and vanishes.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Second Order, is of such Medicines, which being cast upon Imperfect Bodies, tinge them (in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination) with a true Tincture, but take not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way wholly their Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The Third Order, is of such Medicines, which being cast upon Imperfect Bodies, not only perfectly tinge them, but also take away all their Corruption and Impurities, making them incorrupt and perfect: Of the first two kinds, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Medicines, we have nothing to say here; we now come to speak of the third.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Let therefore this your perfect Medicine, or Elixir, be cast upon a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand or more parts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the number of times it has been dissolved, subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and made subtil: If you put on too little, you must mend it by adding more; otherwise the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish a perfect Transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <pb n="616" facs="tcp:65913:351"/>
V. The Philosophers therefore made three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, divers manner of ways, but the best propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this: Let one part be cast upon an hundred parts of <hi>Mercury,</hi> cleansed from all its Impurities; and it will all become Medicine, or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir; and this is the second Medicine: which projected upon a thousand parts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts it all into good <hi>Sol,</hi> or <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Cast one part of this second Medicine upon an hundred of <hi>Mercury</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and it will all become Medicine, and this is the Third Medicine, or Elixir of the third degree, which will project upon ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand parts of another Body, and transmute it wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fine <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Again, every part of this Third Medicine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cast upon an hundred parts of prepared <hi>Mercury,</hi> it will all become Medicine of the fourth degree, and it will transmute ten hundred Thousand times its own quantity of another Metal into fine <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as your fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Now these second, third, and fourth Medicines may be so often dissolved, sublimed, and subtilizated, till they receive far greater virtues and powers, and may after the same manner be multiplyed infinitely.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. According to <hi>Rhasis,</hi> the proportion is thus to be computed. First, multiply Ten by Ten, and its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is an Hundred: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain 100 by 10, and the product is 1000; and a 100 by 10, and the product will be 10000.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And this 10000 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing multiplyed by 10, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces an 100000; and thus by consequence you may augment it, till it comes to a number almost infinite.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. That is to say, put 1 upon 10, and that 10 upon an 100, and that 100 upon a 1000, and it shall multiply to, or produce an 100000; and so forward, in the same proportion.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. NOW the projection is after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be done: Put the Body, or Metal upon the fire in a Crucible, and cast thereon the Elixir as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, moving, or stirring it well; and when it is melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, become liquid, and mixed with the Body, or with the Spirit, remove it from the fire, and you shall have fine Gold or Silver, according to what your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir was prepared from.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But here is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That by how much the more the Metaline Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is the easier to be melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by so much the more shall the Medicine have power to enter into, and transmute it.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Therefore by so much as Mercury is more liquid than any other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by so much the more, the Medicine has power in being cast upon it, to wit, Mercury, to transmute it into fine Sol or Luna.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And a greater quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it shall your Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine transmute, give tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture to, and make perfect, than of any other Mineral Body.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The like is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, to be performed in the same manner upon other Mineral Bodies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are easie or hard to be fused or melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. AND because prolix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is not pleasant, but induceth errour, and clouds the understanding, we shall now use much bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and shew the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of the whole work, the premises being well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. It appears, that our Work is hidden in the Body of the Magnesia's, that is, in the Body of Sulphur; which is Sulphur of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; and in the Body of Mercury, which is Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury of Mercury.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Therefore our Stone is from one thing only, as is aforesaid, and it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by one Act or Work, with decoction: and by one Disposition, or Operation, which is the changing of it first to Black, then to White, thirdly, to Red: and by one Projecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which the whole Act and Work is finished.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. AFter many ways and in divers manners, the Ancient Philosophers have through all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings delivered themselves; and in AEnigmaes or Riddles, they have wholly Clouded and left shadowed to us, the most Noble Science, and as it were under a Veil of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speration, have wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Us the knowledge thereof, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. For which Reason sake, I here signifie (that you may the more firmly Establish your mind) I have in the following Chapters declared (more plainly than is taught in any other writings) the whole Art of the Transformation of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>

III. And if you often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve these instructions in your minds, you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the knowledge of the beginning, the middle, and the end of the Work; and you shall see such a subtilty of Wisdom, and such a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of matter, which shall amply repleat your Soul, and fill you with Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Now in the ancient Codes, many definitions of this Art are to be found, the meaning of which it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves us to consider, <hi>Hermes</hi> saith concerning this Art, <hi>it is the Science of compounded Bodies, joyning together, (through the knowledge of the matter and its effects or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) the more pretious</hi> things one to another, and by a Natural Commixion, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert or transmute the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a better kind.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LIII.</hi> Of the Natural Principles and Generation of Metals and Minerals.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THe Natural Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and first Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Metals and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals. I shall compleatly
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:65913:354" rendition="simple:additions"/>
declare: where is first to be Noted, that the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beginnings, or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Minerals are Argent Vive, and Sulphur: From these all Metals, are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and all Minerals, how manifold soever, their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities or kinds may be.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. But I say, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture always proposes, and contends, to bring them to the perfection of Gold; but by several Supervenient accidents, the said Metals are transformed or embased, as you may plainly see in the Books of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For according to the Purity or Impurity of the said two, to wit, of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and Sulphur, pure and impure Metals are genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to wit, Gold, Silver, Tin, Lead, Copper, Iron. concerning the Natures of which, <hi>viz.</hi> of their puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and impurities, or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous corruption and defects, we have a few true things to say.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. <hi>Of Gold.</hi> It is indeed a Body perfect, made of pure Silver, fixed, clean, Red; and of a clean Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, fixed, Red, not burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and free from defects.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. <hi>Of Silver.</hi> It is a Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, clean, pure, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most reaching to perfection; generated of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> pure, clear, white, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most fixed; and of a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, like it in all respects; wanting only a little infixa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Colour and Weight.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. <hi>Of Tin.</hi> It is a clean Body but imperfect, generated of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> fixed, and not fixed, clear, white in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, but red in its occult or inward parts; and of a little pure, fixed, and not fixed Sulphur: and is only wanting in a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent decoction or digestion.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. <hi>Of Lead.</hi> It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and imperfect, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, not fixed, terrene, faeculent, a little White out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, but Red inwardly, and of such a like Sulphur, adustible in some parts: it is deficient in purity, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:65913:355"/>
Colour, and Igniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Of Copper.</hi> It is a Body impure and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, generated from an <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> impure, not fixed, Earthy, Burning, Red, not clear, and from such a like Sulphur: but is wanting in fixation, purity and weight; having also too much impure Colour, and terrestreities not burning.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. <hi>Of Iron.</hi> It is a Body impure and imperfect, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated from impure <hi>Quick-Silver,</hi> too much fixed, Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, burning White and Red, not clear, and of a like Sulphur: it is wanting in fusion, purity and weight; and has too much of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure fixed Sulphur, with a burning terrestreity. All which things you are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to Note.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. IN what we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared, we have spoken sufficiently of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Metals; now we apply our selves to the choice and perfecting of those which are imperfect.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Out of what has been said, it appears, that from <hi>Argent Vivc,</hi> and Sulphur, all the Metals are generated; and how with their impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and uncleanness they are corrupted: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatsoever matter does adhere to any Metal, which is not of its <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> or does not belong to its composition, it is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected and cast away.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For that no Foreign matter, which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:65913:355"/>
of the aforesaid two principles, <hi>viz. Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> can either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Metal, or make any new transmutation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. This is also to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that even some wise prudent Persons; should lay the Foundation or whole matter of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir, in the Animal or Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Kingdoms, which are so infinitely remote from the thing, whilst they may find Mineral much nearer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin to the Work and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. It is not indeed to be at all believed, that any of the Philosophers, should place the Art, or Secret in such remote things, where there is not the least con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity or similitude of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. But out off the two aforesaid things, (<hi>viz. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi>) all Metals are made: and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing does adhere to them, nor is conjoyned with them, nor can transmute them, except that which arises from the same Root or Principles.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And therefore we say, that it behoves you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed and in truth, to take <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> for the matter of our Stone, not <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> by it self alone, nor <hi>Sulphur</hi> by it self alone; for neither of them alone can generate Metals: but from a commixtion of both, divers Metals are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously generated, as also many Minerals.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Therefore from a commixtion of them both, our matter of the Stone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be chosen, which is most excellent and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hidden: from which Mineral matter, that which is yet nearer and more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kin thereto is to be made. And this very thing it self, we attain to the knowledg of, by a diligent and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate search and enquiry.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Take then this our Matter, chosen as you may think out of Vegetables, and from thence, first make
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:65913:356"/>
                           <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> by a long decoction: But since Nature has given us <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> we are excused from those things, and their too tedious Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: nor yet out of them could you produce the said <hi>Prima Materia.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">X. And if you should seek for it in Animals, as in humane Blood, Hair, Urine, Dung, Hens Eggs, or any other things proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Animals; from these you should also make <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> by such a like long decoction; but in all these things, you would miss of the <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> as you did before in Vegetables.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. If also you should make choise of the middle Minerals, such as are all the kinds of Magnesia's, Marchasites, Tutias, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triols, Alums, Borax, Salt, and many others of like Rank, you must from these make <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> by long Boyling, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, you would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in Vain; yet in Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating upon these things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, you would Err.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. If also you should make choice of some one of the seven Spirits by it self, as alone of <hi>Argent Vivs,</hi> or of <hi>Sulphur</hi> alone, or of <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and one of the two <hi>Sulphurs,</hi> or of <hi>Sulphur Vive,</hi> or Auripigment, <hi>i. e.

                        <p n="13">XIII. Because Nature does nothing, except there be a just or proportional mixtion of the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; nor can we (for the same Reason) from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid <hi>Argent Vive</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as they are in their own Nature, doe any thing.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Lastly, if we should chuse even the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, be they what they will, we ought to mix them according to the just &amp; true proportion, which humane ingeny is ignorant of, &amp; then to decoct or boyl them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, till they are coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated into a solid mass.</p>

                           <pb n="627" facs="tcp:65913:356"/>
XV. And therefore we forbid the taking of those two, <hi>viz. Argent Vive,</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> as they are, or lie in their own proper Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and being also igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the just proportion of Parts for the mixtion.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. So that we must find out those Bodies in which we may find the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid things or principles justly proportionated, coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, and joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, as their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures require: which Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret is very warily to be kept.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LV.</hi> Of the nearest Matter of Our Stone, yet more plainly.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. GOld is a Body per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and Masculine, without any superfluity or diminution, and if the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies commixed with it by a sole Liquefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, be perfected by it, it is in Order for the Elixir for the Red.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Silver also is a Body almost perfect, and Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine, which if it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with imperfect bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys, solely by a vulgar fufion, it shall make them nearly perfect, it is in Order for the Elixir for the White, which yet it is not, nor can be, because the Elixirs only are perfect.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Because if that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscible with imperfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, yet would not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Body be compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the perfect Bodies, but rather their perfection would be diminished and
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:65913:357"/>
destroyed by means of the said Imperfect Bodies.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. But if those which shall be more than perfect, in a Double, Quadruple, Centuple, or larger propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perfection, be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the imperfect Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they will indeed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect them.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And because Nature always Operates after a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner, the perfection in these things is simple, and inseparable, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscible; nor by this Art, are the imperfect things themselves (for the shorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work) to be joyned with the Stone for the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor may they then be reduced into their pristine State, when their exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Volatility exceeds the highest sixity.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And because Gold is a body perfect, made of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> Red, and clear, and of such a like <hi>Sulphur,</hi> we do not ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore chose it, for the near matter of the Stone for the Red Elixir; for that by reason it is simply so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, without any artificial purification, and so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Digested, and Decocted by a Natural Heat, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not so easily Operate upon it (nor upon Silver) with our Artificial Fire.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And altho Nature may do something in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to perfection, yet it does not know howthrough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to cleanse, and is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how to Purifie and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, because it works after a simple manner upon what it hath.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Wherefore, if we chuse Gold or Silver for the matter of our Stone, we shall scarcely, or with difficulty find out a Fire which will work upon them.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. And though we know the Fire, yet we may not be able to attain to the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and inward opening of their bodies, because of their firm compacted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or density of body and Natural composition: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we refuse to take the
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:65913:357" rendition="simple:additions"/>
first for the Red, or the latter for the White.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. When we shall find some thing or body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from a pure matter, or a more pure <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> above that which Nature has a little or in some small Measure wrought or brought forth; then possibly, by the help of our Fire, and manifold experiences in this our Art, which an Ingenious and continued Oporation upon the matter, through a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous Decoction, Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Coloration, &amp; Fixation, we may attain and perfect the thing sought after.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Therefore that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is to be chosen, in which is a pure <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> clear, White, and also Red, not yet brought to its compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or perfection, but commixed equally and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally as it requires, with such a like pure, clean, White and Red <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Which Matter is to be Coagulated into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Mass; and with Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Prudence, by the help of our Artificial Fire, we may be able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish, its intimate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mundification, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Purity of things, and to perform such a work or make such a body, as shall (after the compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Operation) be a Million of times stronger, and more pure and perfect than the simple bodies themselves, Decocted and made by a Natural heat.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Be therefore wise: for in this my subtle Dos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course I have demonstrated plainly the matter of our Stone sought after, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest probation, to the true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ingenious. Here you may taste of that which is most delectable, above all whatsoever the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have told you.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LVI.</hi> Of the manner of Working, and of the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and continuing of the Fire.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. NOW it is possible, that you may find out this Mystery (if you will bend your self to study and labour) and wholly casting off your Folly and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, become wise through the words which I speak; to the attainment of that true matter of the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, the Blessed Stone of the Wise, upon which the Operations of Alchymia are exercised; by which we endeavour to perfect the imperfect <hi>Bodies;</hi> and thereby to make them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the perfect.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. And forasmuch as Nature has handed down to us Imperfect Bodies only with the perfect, it is our business to take the known matter, which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in these Chapters) and by much Pains and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, through the help of our art, to make it even more than perfect.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. If you be ignorant of the manner of doing or working, What is the Cause? Truly because that you see not after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Nature (which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perfects the Metals) frequently, or commonly operates.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. See you not, that in the Mines, by the continual heat which is in those Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Mountains, the gross waters, are decocted, and so much inspissated, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by (through length of time) to be made <hi>Argent Vive?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. And from the fat of the Earth, by the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:65913:358" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and heat, is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, Sulphur: and that by the same heat preserved and continued upon the same, from the aforesaid things, [<hi>viz. Argent Vive, and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi>] according to their Purities and Impurities, all the Metals are generated?</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And that Nature, by a sole or only decoction, does make or bring to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection the <hi>perfect Bodies,</hi> as well as all the Imperfect Bodies or Metals?</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. O great madness! These things which I thus quaery about, would you bring to pass and perfect, by fantastick, strange, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect methods?</p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <hi>VIII.

                        <p n="9">
                           <hi>IX. And</hi> that God has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon Nature a right <hi>method, a direct way, which is by a continual decoction,</hi> which the Insipid and Fools, through their ignorance, despise, and scorn to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate.</p>

                           <hi>X.

                           <hi>CHAP. LVII.</hi> Of the Quality of the Vessels and Fornaces.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THE limits, method, way and manner of working, we have even now determined; it follows, that we treat next of the Vessel and Fornace; after what manner, and with what matter, it ought to be made.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. When Nature, with a natural heat in the metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Mines does decoct; it is true, it performs this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction without any Vessel: Now though we propound to follow Nature in decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet we cannot do it without a fit Vessel for that purpose.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Therefore let us see first, what kind of place that is, where Metals are generated. It is evidently manifest, that they are produced in Mineral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that the generat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat is in the bottoms of the Mountains, where
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:65913:359"/>
it is perdurable, and always equal, and whose nature is always to ascend; which in ascending continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siccates every where where it passes, and coagulates the spissed or gross water hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the Bowels or Veins of the Earth or Mountains, into <hi>Argent Vive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And if a mineral fat in the same place, from such a like Earth, shall be warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gathered together in the Veins of the Earth, and it run through the Mountains, it becomes Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And as you may see in the said veins of the said place, that Sulphur genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (as is said) of the fat of the Earth, doth meet also with the <hi>Argent Vive</hi> (as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid) in the said veins of the Earth, so also it produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a thickning, or inspissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of that Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Also, there, by the said heat in the bottoms, or bowels of the Mountains, equal, and perdurable, through a very long space of time, there is generated divers and several Metals, according to the nature, or diversity of the place.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. This also you must know, that in the places where Minerals are found, there is always found a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable heat.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. From these things, then, we ought always to note, that a Mineral Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is every where close to its self, externally; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so stoney: because if the heat should possibly get out, no Metals would be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. So also, if we intend to imitate Nature, we must necessarily have such a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, as may have some likeness or resemblance of a Mountain, not as to its magnitude, but as to its continued heat; so that the imposed fire, when it as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends, may not find a way forth; but that the heat may reverberate back upon the vessel, containing in it
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:65913:360"/>
self (firmly closed up) the matter of the Stone.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. Which vessel ought to be round, with a little neck, made of Glass, or some certain Earth, like in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or closeness of body to Glass: Whose Mouth ought to be so stopped or closed up with Bitumen, or other like Emplastick substance, or otherwise Hermetically sealed up, so as the least Vapour may not come forth.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And like as in the Mines, the heat does not immediately touch the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sulphur and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> because the Earth of the Mountain is every where between:</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. So in like manner, the fire ought not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to touch the Vessel containing in it self, the matters aforesaid of our Stone: But in another clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Vessel in like manner, <hi>that</hi> is to be put; that so the temperate heat may better, and more conveniently touch both above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and every where, the matter of our Stone.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, <hi>That Mercury, in the Light of Lights is to be decocted in a threefold Vessel:</hi> and that the Vessel be made of the most firm and pure Glass, or, which is better, of Earth, having in it self the nature of Glass. [<hi>Of which kind is our late</hi> China <hi>and</hi> Porce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane <hi>Ware, brought to us out of</hi> Persia, China, <hi>and other places of the</hi> East-Indies.]</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LVIII.</hi> Of the Colours, Accidental and Essential, appearing in the Work.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. WE have now taught you what the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite matter of the Stone is, and also the true man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of working; by what method, and with what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the decoction of the Stone is to be performed, whence oftentimes arises di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and various colours in the Philosophick matter.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Concerning which Colours, a certain Wise Man saith: <hi>Quot colores, tot nomina; so many Colours as it has, so many Names:</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diversity of Colours appearing in the operation, the Philosophers have given it several Names.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For which Reason, in the first operation of this our Stone, it is called <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction;</hi> and our Stone is made black: For which reason saith a Philosopher, <hi>When thou findest that black; know that in that blackness, whiteness is hidden;</hi> and now it behoves us to extract that whiteness from its most sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til blackness.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Now after the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction [<hi>or blackness</hi>] it grows red, but not with the true redness: of which one of the Philosophers saith, <hi>It often grows red, and it often grows Citrine or Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; and it oftentimes melts, or grows liquid, and it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes coagulated, before the true whiteness appears to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="5">V. Also it dissolves its self, coagulates it self, putrefies its self, tinges or colours its
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:65913:361"/>
self, mortifies it self, vivifies its self, denigrates, or black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens it self, dealbates or whitens it self, and adorns it self in the red with the white.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. It is also made green: for which reason another saith: <hi>Decoct it till you see the birth of the Greenness, or till the greenness is brought forth, which is the Soul there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi> And another: <hi>Know that the Soul doth rule in the Greenness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Also, the colour of the Peacock appears before the <hi>Whiteness;</hi> for which cause, saith one: <hi>Know that all the Colours which are in the World, or are possible so be thought of, appear before the</hi> Whiteness; <hi>and then the</hi> true Whiteness <hi>follows.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="8">
                           <hi>VIII. Of which, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Philosopher saith:</hi> But when the pure Stone is decocted, so long till the Eye of the Fish (as it were)grows very bright; a profit, or good may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it; and then our Stone will be congealed into its roundness.</p>
                        <p n="9">

                        <p n="10">X. Notwithstanding, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct till the whole Redness be brought forth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. For it is between the true Whiteness and the true Redness, that a certain <hi>Ash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour</hi> appears, of which we have spoken: after the <hi>Whiteness</hi> appears you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not err, for by augmenting the fire you come to the <hi>Ash-colour.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. LIX.</hi> Of the manner of projection upon any of the Imperfect Metals.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. I Have perfectly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated the end of the promised Work, <hi>viz.</hi> of our great Magistery, for the making the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Elixir, as well Red as White: It now remains, that we shew the method, or way of Projection, which is the compleatment of the work, the long expected, and much desired cause of rejoycing.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Now the true Red Elixir, tinges a pure and deep Citrine or Yellow, to infinity of parts, and it tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smutes all Metals into most fine Gold.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The true White E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixir also, whitens to Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty likewise; and it makes, or tinges every Metal into a perfect Whiteness: But you must know, that one kind of Metal is much more remote, or far distant from perfection than some others are; and that some are much nearer to the said per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection than others.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And although every Metal may be brought to perfection by the Elixir; yet those which are nearer to perfection, are easier, sooner, and better reduced to that perfection, or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>smuted into perfect Bodies, than those that are more remote.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And when we have found a Metal, which is as it were, a kin, or nearer to perfection, we are excused in some measure, from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king use of, or projecting upon those Metals which
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:65913:362"/>
are more remote there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Now what Metals are remote from, and near to perfection, and what are yet more near, and as it were a kin to the perfect Bodies, we have taught in these Chapters; in which, if you be indeed wise you may plainly see, and truly determine which they be.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And without doubt, he who is lawfully initiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Mysteries of this our Art; may be able through his own Ingenuity and Industry by studying in this my <hi>Speculum <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap>,</hi> to find out and know the true matter of our Stone: And he will know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand well upon what Body, the Medicine or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistery ought to be project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for perfection.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. For the Masters of this Art, who have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or found out the <hi>Prima Materia,</hi> and the whole Mystery they have, I say, plainly demonstrated, and, as it were, indigitated the direct way of working, and made all things naked and plain to us, when they say,</p>
                        <p n="9">
                           <hi>IX.</hi> Nature contains Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Nature exceeds Nature, and Nature overcoming Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does rejoyce, and is trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted or changed into another Nature. <hi>And in another place,</hi> every like doth rejoyce in its like; for that the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between things is said to be the cause of Sympathy or Friendship: <hi>of which many Philosophers have written notable things.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="10">
                           <hi>X.</hi> Know then that the Soul doth soon enter into its own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; but with a Forreign or Strange Body, it can never be joyned or United. <hi>In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place:</hi> If you shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to joyn it with a Forreign or Heterogene Body, you shall wholly Labour in Vain. <hi>Also:</hi> The nearness of the Body to perfection makes a Transmutation the more Glorious.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. For the Corporeal, by the Power of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Nature, is made
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:65913:362"/>
Incorporeal; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Incorporeal is made Corporeal; and in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatment, the spiritual Body is made wholly fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. And because it is Evidently manifest that the <hi>Elixir</hi> is Spiritual, and so very much exalted beyond its own Nature, as well for <hi>the White,</hi> as for the <hi>Red:</hi> It is no wonder, that it is not to be mixed with Bodies.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. The Method, or way of Projection then is, that the Body of the Metal to be transmuted, beliquifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or melted; and then that the Medicine or Elixir, be projected or cast upon the melted Metal.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Moreover you must Note, that this our Elixir, is of a mighty strong Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and of great Force, for one part being projected upon a Million, or Ten Hundred Thousand parts, and more, of the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Body, it does inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently penetrate it, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse it self through the whole, and transmute it.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. Wherefore I deliver to you a great and hidden Secret. Mix one part of this our Elixir, with a Thousand parts of a body near to perfection; put all into a proper Vessel, inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it firmly; and then put it into a Furnace of Fixation, first with a very gentle fire, and then always augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fire gradually for three days; so will they be inseparably conjoyned. This is a work of three days.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Then again, and lastly, take one part of this mixture, and project it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Thousand parts of another Body or Metal, (the nearer to perfection the better,) so the whole will be a most fine and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Body, according to the kind, and according to your intended work, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the White or for the Red.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. And all this is but the work of one day; or
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:65913:363" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather, but of an hour, or of a moment: for which wonderful work, Praises be perpetually rendred to the Lord our God, for Ever and Ever.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LX.</hi> A Short Recapitulation of the whole Work.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. OUR Tincture then, is only generated out of the Mercury of the wise, which is called the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Materia, Aqua permanens, Acetum Pilosophorum, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                              </gap> Lac Virginis, Mercurius Corporalis,</hi> with which nothing extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, Alien or Forreign is commixed, such as are Salts, Alums and Vitriols.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Because from this Mercury alone, the Virtue and Power of this our Magistry is generated: and it so resolves every (Metalline) Body, that it may be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented or multiplied.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. This our aforesaid Mercury is both the Root and the Tree, from whence many and almost Infinite Branches Spring and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The first work for the making of this Elixir, is sublimation, which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, but the subtiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter of our Stone, by which it is clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from all its superslui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The fixed and Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile parts are not separated one from another, but they remain United, and are fixed together, till they both may have an easie fusion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in the fire.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Take therefore our aforesaid <hi>Mercury,</hi> which, in a Sealed Glass, put into its hot bed, for one whole Philosophick month, which is 40 days, till it begins in its own body to putrisie and
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:65913:363"/>
be Coagulated, and all its Humidity be Consumed in its self, and also converted into a black Earth.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. In this Sublimation is compleated the true se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the four Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Because the cold and watery Elements is changed into a hot and dry Earth, which is the head of the Crow, the Mother of the remaining Elements.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Thus our work is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but a transmuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Nature, and a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Elements.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. The Spiritual is made Corporal, the Liquid is made thick, and the water is made Fire.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. Moreover the black Earth is imbibed with its own water, and dryed so long till it is sufficiently cleansed and brought on to Whiteness.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Which then is called the White Earth foliated, <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Nitre, <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Magnesia: and then there is a new Conjunction of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and a Resurrection of the Dead Body.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. When our Earth bearing Fruit is moistned with its own proper water, it drinks it up in that its thirst with much greediness, till it generates or is made pregnant, and then brings forth Fruit an Hundred Fold.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Now proceed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the White Earth, augmenting or increasing the Fire <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> it, till by the motion of the Continual Heat, it is digested and brought into the highest and most pure Red.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. And now it is called our Red Coral, Red Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, Blood, our Purple Gold, our burnt <hi>Crocus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. This very Work repeat three or four times with new Materials, and you shall have the most perfect Red Stone, of the
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:65913:364" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Philosophers, Red as Blood it self, with which you may tinge <hi>Mercury,</hi> and all other imperfect Metals.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. But it behoves you to take of our aforesaid <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> three parts, adding one part of fine Gold, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a subtle Calx and of the water thereof two parts; these three mix subtilly, till they become one Inseparable Matter: these then digest in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Fornace, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Red Stone.</p>

<pb n="644" facs="tcp:65913:365"/>
Years, drawing Forth, and Selecting the true Root, and Marrow of Nature (by a series of Experiences) from its most inward Recesses, and secret Habitations.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The which I am mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and compelled to from the singular Good-will, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Affections, and Sincere Love, which as well as in times past, I now at present bear unto you: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall faithfully (tho' briefly) declare the Secrets of this Art to you; plainly and openly, not Darkly and AEnigmatically, as if it was done under a Shadow or Vail.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Such indeed is your Life (your Works witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the same) that you are as a healing Balm, a Refuge of Defence, and Shelter to the Church of God, a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of his Holy Temple, for which Reasons, I am ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to reveal these hidden Mysteries, and make known to you the abscondite Paths of Nature, not to rejoyce your outward Man only, by adding Health and long Life, heaping up Treasures, and external Honours and Applause in the World, but to excite in you the highest Devotion to God Almighty, that you might become good to all Men, profitable to the Church, a Father to the Fatherless, and a San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary to the Needy and Distressed.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And in these things, I am confident of you, in whom is found such a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Treasure of Vertue, Prudence, Piety, and true Wisdom, but most chiefly, for that I know you to be such a one, who has God always before your Eyes.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And therefore I speak truly and fervently, and I will declare the Truth to you, with all faithfulness according to the reality of my Soul; I shall Elucidate the undoubted Verity, and declare such things, as with much Labour, Care, and Diligence I have sought out, and obtained the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of; which I have seen with my Eyes, and have handled with my Hands,
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:65913:365"/>
and which my own self has done: And in this matter I will neither be tedious nor obscure, lest that love which I profess to you, should seem to be deficient or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Whatever I write, I shall open the same briefly and plainly beseeching God, that the matter whereof I shall entreat, may become profitable unto you; and that if you shall please to put the same into practice you may find the faithful experience thereof, and not be deceived, or spend your time in vain: For we know certainly, that of all transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things, Time is truly the most pretious.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Wherefore I write unto you (honourable and dearly beloved Friend) such things only as may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; making this humble suit unto your Excellency, that the Revealed Secrets and Experiments which I send you in this little Book, may not be prostituted, or bestowed upon unworthy Men, who are naughty, or swoln up with Pride, or whose Souls are bound up in their Covetousness.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. I require not of you for this Secret, a great Summ of Gold or Silver; nor do I put this Secret in writing, for you to bestow much Cost and Expences upon it; nor do I for my self desire any reward; these things agree not with the Philosophick Verity, which professes, that its Works are not chargeable and Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive. <hi>Morienus</hi> saith, <hi>beware that you spend nothing in this Magistery of Gold.</hi> And <hi>Dastine, saith with the Value of one Noble is the whole Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery performed.</hi>

                        <p n="9">IX. Since then it is so, in what thing is our Gold to be found? Is it not in Mercury, which is called Quick or living Gold? <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandus</hi> saith, <hi>He that will reduce</hi> Quick-Gold <hi>into thin water, must make it, doe it, and Work it by its contrary.</hi>

<pb n="646" facs="tcp:65913:366"/>
saith he, <hi>if you putrefie its Cold with its Hot, and its Dry with its Moist, you shall not only have the Humidity of all Bodies, but you shall have a</hi> Menstruum, <hi>which will dissolve</hi> Argent Vive <hi>for ever.</hi> For the least part of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury being once dissolved, the dissolved Mercury will always dissolve Mercury <hi>ad Infinitum.</hi>

                        <p n="10">
                           <hi>X. [Mercury</hi> may as well be called <hi>Quick-Gold,</hi> as <hi>Quick-Silver,</hi> for it contains them both. If Air will make this separation, we must put thereto divers contrary things, as <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> saith in <hi>Speculo.</hi> But this putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be done, till it is dissolved in Water white as <hi>Milk,</hi> putrifie that <hi>Milk 15</hi> days in <hi>B.

Quick Gold</hi> is Crude, Imperfect, and unfixt in every degree and yet it is accounted a Body, altho' there be no fixation in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may be much sooner brought to its first matter, than any other of the Bodies, that have any part of fixation in them, for they must have much Labour and long time to separate them, and bring them back into their fixt matter.]</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. For saith <hi>Lully,</hi> The Elements of Mercury may be dissolved, and being so dissolved, they may be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated. There be some that think our Resoluble Seed, or dissolved <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,</hi> is the water of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Vive,</hi> made only by it self, because it does dissolve both Metals, and pretious Stones which we call Pearls; and so it is. Now how this dissolving <hi>Menstrum</hi> is made, not only <hi>Raymund</hi> seems to shew, but <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> in like manner in his <hi>Speculum Alchymiae,</hi> where he saith, put the Body which is most weighty, into a <hi>Distillatory,</hi> and draw forth thereof, its Sweet <hi>Ros,</hi> or <hi>Dew,</hi> with a little Wind, or Breath: [<hi>for betwixt every drop of Water, comes forth a Breath, as it were of a Man, which is the substance of</hi> Argent Vive, <hi>and which the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers call our</hi> Mercury: <hi>which</hi>
                           <pb n="647" facs="tcp:65913:366" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                        <p n="12">XII. To the same thing <hi>Raymundus</hi> assents, where he saith, then have you that <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> which is called Ours; and so it is indeed one of Our <hi>Argent Vive;</hi> altho' the intent of the same Philosopher in <hi>Libro Animae Artis Transmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoriae,</hi> Cap. 2. was touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another more noble and more excellent Water [<hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by some, to be Our Burning-Water, drawn out of the Gum of Vitriol,</hi>] by the Virtue of which most Noble and Excellent, attractive Water, he did not only often dissolve the Body of <hi>Sol</hi> [<hi>not as he doth it with the aforesaid</hi> Argent Vive <hi>commonly dissolved</hi>] but also the same solar Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, by force of that attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Virtue, is disposed in a more noble manner; as I my self have seen done, not only in the Metalline Elixir, but also in the Elixir of Life, as hereafter shall be declared, Chap. 71, 72. Sect.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. It is fansied by an Experienced Philosopher, that Mercury did speak, and said, I am the Father of Enchantments, Brother to the Sun, and Sister to the Moon, I am the Water of Life drawn out of Wine, [<hi>i. e. out of the Wine of Mercury</hi>] I kill that which was alive, and make alive that which was dead; I make Black, and I make White, and I carry in my Belly the <hi>Sol</hi> of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and therefore he that can joyn me after that I am dissolved, and made the pure clear and Silver like Water, called <hi>Lac Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginis,</hi> with my Brother the Sun, he shall tinge him with my Soul, not only much more than he was before by an hundred fold, but also if he be joyned with my Sister <hi>Luna,</hi> he shall make all things fair and bright.

OF this Mercury, speaks another Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher thus, when its Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are separated, and again joyned and mixed together by equal weight, then is it made a compleat Elixir upon <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter;</hi> but its Elements can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be separated, until such time as it is dissolved: and of this Metalline Water, ought the Artist to draw the <hi>Tincture.</hi>

[</hi> The Elements of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> being separated, and again commixed by equal weight or proportion, make the Elixir compleat, with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dissolving and congealing of the Spirit, which must be done upon a Marble Stone, weighing the Body, and then taking its weight of the Secret Salt, grinding them together very subtil, then putting them into <hi>Balneo,</hi> that they may be dissolved; which done, take it out, and make your congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a dry Fire, do so oftentimes, and then, &amp;c.]</p>
                        <p n="3">III. And therefore to confirm this, <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith, <hi>O my Son, Our Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is drawn out of one Vile thing, and is decked, finished, and ended with another thing which is more Noble; for we do Ferment it with Vulgar Gold:</hi> He calls it Vile, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saith it is sometimes found in Vile places, as in Old draughts: also it is Vile, because (as <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith) it is found not only in a fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy form, and ugly shape, but because it is in every thing, of the which (saith <hi>Albertus</hi>) is made a Perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent or fixt Water.</p>

                           <hi>IV. [</hi> Here is to be Noted, that <hi>Raymundus</hi> commands this Tincture to be drawn out of the Body of <hi>Venus,</hi> which Tincture he does Ferment with the prepared <hi>Calx</hi> of common or Vulgar Gold.]</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And therefore saith <hi>Avicen,</hi> it behoves you to have a great quantity of our Gold, and of our Silver, to the end, that thereby the humours may be drawn forth; <hi>viz.</hi> to have at the least sixty pounds weight, which will be a sufficient quantity for your whole life. He also saith, the best <hi>Mercury</hi> is brought in skins, from <hi>Mount Passulane.</hi> Of this <hi>Mercury, Geber</hi> saith, you must labour in all your work to separate <hi>Mercury,</hi> or as others read it, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or over-come <hi>Mercury,</hi> in commixing and conjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for he that cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Mercury,</hi> or undoe it in its composure, cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair or restore it: nor may you work with it as <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> saith, till it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And therefore it is said, joyn not that which is Crude, with that which is Decocted; for of that only with the Ferment, is made the Elixir, which does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal all manner of <hi>Argent Vive.</hi> Wherefore as <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> saith, it is never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed without a congealing <hi>Sulphur;</hi> and being congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you have a great secret: for in the dissolved, Decoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Mercury,</hi> is a great and hidden Mystery.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Another Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher also saith, that there is a certain subtil Fume, which does spring forth from its proper Veins, dispersing and spreading its self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, the which thin Fume if it be wisely gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether again, and sprinkled upon its proper Veins or Matrix, it will make not only a certain fixation (of which thin Fume, in short space is made the true Elixir) but also cleanses the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Metals or <hi>Alchymick</hi> Body.</p>

                           <hi>VIII. [</hi> As to the Tincture
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:65913:368"/>
mentioned at Sect. <hi>4:</hi> above, it rather seems by other words of the said <hi>Raymundus,</hi> that he drew it out of <hi>Quick-Silver,</hi> and no other vile thing, of which <hi>Mercury</hi> is made. What is meant at Sect. <hi>6.</hi> by not joyning the Crude with the Decocted, is to be understood of not joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Crude <hi>Mercury</hi> to the Decocted Bodies or Metals, but to put to them Decocted, <hi>i. e.</hi> dissolved Mercury. And herein is hidden a great secret, for <hi>Mercury</hi> being dissolved, is an hot and moist Sperm; but Crude, it is cold and dry <hi>Saturn.</hi> So that if you pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie its hot and moist Sperm with its cold and dry Earth, you will have <hi>Quick-Silver</hi> dissolved, which is not Crude, but Decocted <hi>Mercury.</hi> So that in Crude <hi>Mercury</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved is hidden a great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. And however it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by a Fire not natural or against Nature, yet it must be mixed, conjoyned, fixed.]</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. This Alchymick Body is called <hi>Leprous Gold,</hi> wherein Gold and Silver, are in Essence and Power, but not in sight or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; in its Profundity or Depth, it is Airous or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Gold, which none can obtain, unless the same Body be first made clean and pure. The which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure Body after mundifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is a thousand times better than are the Bodies of common <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> Decocted by natural heat.</p>

The Earth, the uncleansed Body, is to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with its own Water, and afterwards nourished with its Mothers Milk, which is called the Sulphur of Nature.]</p>

                        <p n="12">XII. This Oyl does not only make the Medicine penetrable, being amicable and conjoynable to all Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies or Corporeal things, but it is also the hidden or Secret fire of Nature; which does so augment the Excellencies of those Bodies to whom it is so joyned, that it makes them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in infinite proportions of goodness and purity. So much as does appertain to the Work of <hi>Alchymiae,</hi> which is only for the Elixir of Metals, is now suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently opened, which if you rightly understand, you will find that no great cost is required to the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Philosophick Operation.</p>

                        <p n="14">XIV. But this Elixir of Metals is not all that I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to shew you; the Elixir of Life is that which I chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly designed, infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding all the Riches of this World, and to which the most excellent of all the Earthly things cannot be compared.

                           <hi>CHAP. LXIII.</hi> Of the Mineral Stone, and Philosophick Fires.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. ON a time as I have learned, there was an Assembly of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, where the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Secret <hi>Stone,</hi> and the <hi>Manner</hi> of working it, was propounded. Several spoke their Opinions, but at length, one younger in Years, and (as was thought) Inferiour in Learning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his thoughts and knowledge concerning that Secret. I know saith he, the Regiments of the Fires. When they had heard what he could say, they all as a mazed held their peace for a while.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. At lenght, one of the Company made answer; If this be true which thou hast said, thou art Master
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:65913:369"/>
of us all, and thereupon with one consent, they gave him the Right Hand of Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship. Whereupon they gathered, that the Secret of this wonderful Tincture lay chiefly in the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. But the Fire differs after several manners; one Natural, another innatural or preternatural, another Elemental, another against Nature. The Natural Fire does come from the Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Sol,</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and the Asterisms, or the <hi>Sun, Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> of the which are Ingendred, not only the burning Waters, and potential Vapours of Minerals, but also the Natural Virtues of living things.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. The Innatural or Preternatural Fire, is a thing accidental, as Heat in an Ague, being made Artificially, and called by the Philosophers a moist Fire, Our generating Water, the fire of the first Degree; and for the temperature of its Heat is called a Bath, a Stew, a Dunghil, in which Dunghil is made the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of our Stone. See Sect. 13. of the former Chapter, where it is more amply defined.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The Elemental fire, is that which does Fix, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and Burn, and is nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished by Combustible things.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The fire against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture [<hi>which is a violent, strong, Corrosive, destroying the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial form of that which is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved therein,</hi>] is that which in Power Dissolves, Frets, Infects, and destroys the generative Power of the form of the Stone: it does Dissolve the Stone into Water of the Cloud, with the loss of its Natural, At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive, and special Form, and is called <hi>Fire against Nature,</hi> (as <hi>Raymundus</hi> 
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>) from its Operation: for that which Nature does make, this fire against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture destroys and brings to Corruption, unless there be fire of Nature put to it.</p>
                        <p n="7">
                           <pb n="654" facs="tcp:65913:370"/>
VII. Here as <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith, lies contrary Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, [<hi>as in the Compounded Water:</hi>] for as <hi>the fire against Nature,</hi> does Dissolve the Spirit of the fixed Body; the Volatile Spirit is thereby constrained to retire into a fixed Earth, [<hi>a Congealed Earth as White as Snow.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. For the fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does Congeal the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Spirit of the fixed Body into a glorious Earth: and the Body of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile being fixed, by the same <hi>fire against Nature,</hi> is here again by <hi>the fire of Nature</hi> resolved into the Water of Philosophers, but not into the Water of the Cloud: and so by this means the fixed is returned back again into its wonted Nature of Flying, and the moist is made dry, and the ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous is made light.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. But yet he saith, <hi>this fire which is against Nature</hi> is not the Work of Our Magistery, but it is <hi>the fire which is purely Natural.</hi> This he saith, because he would shew us thereby the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Mineral Elixir, and the Vegetable, and the Animal. For that these three several Elixirs are made of three several Waters, <hi>viz.</hi> Mineral, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, and Animal, which serve for the Work divers ways.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. And First we will Treat of the Mineral Elixir, then of the other in order. The Fire against Nature is a Mineral Water, [<hi>viz. the Humour or Tincture drawn out of Body of</hi> Venus <hi>Dissolved in its Mineral Spirit</hi>] very strong and Mortal, serv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to the Mineral Elixir.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. This Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or Fire against Nature, is drawn with fire Elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, from a certain stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Menstruum,</hi> as <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> saith, and is made of four things. It is the strongest Water in the World, whose only Spirit, (saith he) does wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increase and multiply the Tincture of the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for here <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Gold</hi> is
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:65913:370"/>
Tinged with the Mineral Spirit, the which Mineral Spirit is the strength of the most simple <hi>Sulphur</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Earthiness.</p>
                        <p n="11">
                           <hi>XII.</hi> [Thin Mineral Water is the dropping of <hi>Adrop</hi> or <hi>Adrup, Venus,</hi> which is the noble Tincture called the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Roman Vitriol, and which for the abundance of its noble Tincture, is called <hi>Roman Gold.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="12">XIII. This some do call the Spirit of the <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> others the blood of the <hi>Green Lyon:</hi> wherein almost all Err, and are deceived: for <hi>the Green Lyon of the Philosophers,</hi> is <hi>that Lyon,</hi> by whose Virtue attractive, all things are lifted up from the Bowels of the Earth, and the Winter-like Caverns, making them to Wax green and flourish: whose Child (for all the Elixirs are to be had from it) is to us most acceptable and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
                        <p n="13">
                           <hi>XIV.</hi> [The Child of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers is generated of their Green Lyon, of which Child is had the strength of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> both White and Red; Our two Sulphurs of Nature are the Gold and Silver of the Philosophers, and their hidden Treasure.]</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. Of this Child of the <hi>Green Lyon</hi> of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers is drawn the strength of <hi>Sulphur</hi> White and Red, but not Burning as <hi>Avicen</hi> saith, which are the two best things the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chymist</hi> can take to make his Gold and Silver of: and this is sufficient to be said, for the attaining the knowledge of the Green Lyon: which is so called, because, that when he is dissolved, he is streight ways adorned with a green Vesture. [i. e. <hi>When our</hi> Sulphur <hi>of Nature is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in its own</hi> Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, <hi>which is the</hi> Virgins Milk, <hi>it is clothed with this greenness, and therefore called the</hi> Green Lyon.]</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. But of the <hi>Green Lyon</hi> of <hi>Fools,</hi> this we say, that from it with a strong, fire is drawn <hi>Aquafortis,</hi> in the which, the aforesaid Philosophers Lyon of the
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:65913:371"/>
Mineral Stone, ought to be Elixirated, and assumes its Name. <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith, it were better, or fafer, to eat the Eyes of a <hi>Basalisk,</hi> than that Gold, which is made with the Fire against Nature.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. And I say also, that the things from whence the same <hi>Aquafortis</hi> is drawn is green Vitriol and <hi>Azoth:</hi> i. e. Vitriol Natural, not Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial, <hi>viz.</hi> the droppings of Copper, <hi>called also Roman Vitriol, Roman Gold,</hi> by many of the Philosophers, from the abundance of its noble Tincture, the which Tincture must be Ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Common Gold.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. How great and Secret a Virtue, then, and of what strength, <hi>the Fire against Nature</hi> is, evidently appears in the construction of the Body of the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit, being by it vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly sublimed in the form of Snowy Whiteness. <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> in the end of the Epistle of his Abridgment saith, feed <hi>Argent Vive</hi> with this Oyl, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Oyl wherewith the Spirit of the Quintessence is thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, &amp;c.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXIV.</hi> The manner of Elixiration with the Fire against Nature.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. TAke the first <hi>Sol,</hi> Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined with the first Water, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercurial Spirit, very clean, and brought into the Color of Blood, in the space of 20 days, (in lesser time it is not to be done.) This Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination cannot be so profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as it would be, unless <hi>Sol</hi> be first Mercurializ'd into such a thinness, as it may cleave together to that to which it must be joyned in a 24 fold propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (<hi>viz.</hi> as 1. to 24.) strain ed through a clean Linnen Cloth, without any remain ing substance of the Gold.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. I my self have seen it so ordered and done; and then it may certainly, in a strong <hi>Bolt Head,</hi> well Luted on every side, except on the Top, boyling in a strong Fire for the space of 20 days, be precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into a Red Pouder, like <hi>Cinnaber,</hi> (all which I have seen performed.) Every particle of this Pouder you shall so fix, as that if it be put upon a Red-Hot Iron Plate, its Spirit shall not fume or fly away.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. This Pouder Dissolve with, or in our <hi>Fire against Nature;</hi> being Dissolved, abstract the Water of the Fire against Nature from it, so long till the substance of the Pouder so Dissolved, do remain in the Vessel, as thick as an Oyl; which Oyl, first, with a soft fire, and after with a stronger, fix into dry Pouder.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <hi>IV.</hi> [This Work is not to be done all at once, but by
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:65913:372"/>
little and little at a time, till it goes through with it in the Color of Blood; then will it precipitate into a Red Pouder, called by the Philosophers <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricon:</hi> Dissolve it with as much of Our Vegetable <hi>Sal Anatron,</hi> the space of an hour, then set it in <hi>Balneo,</hi> in a long Receptory, till it be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dissolved, and becomes as it were a fine Wine, which with the very softest heat, make it to Evaporate, and Congeal, so will you have a pure Stone, and of subtil parts.</p>
                        <p n="5">
                           <hi>V.</hi> Also if you dissolve this same Red Pouder of <hi>Mercury</hi> in Water or Spirit of Common Salt, prepared as <hi>Bachon</hi> and <hi>Albertus</hi> have taught, you shall have an Oyl or Salt of Gold, which no Fire can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy, which will melt and tinge with a solar Color upon a Plate of <hi>Venus.</hi> This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure carry always with you, wheresoever you go: Who knows not the Secret of this prepared Salt in Our lesser Works, knows little of the hidden things of <hi>Alchymie.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. Try this fixt Pouder (at Sect. 3. above) for the fixation, reiterate still the Work with the same <hi>Fire against Nature</hi> upon the same Pouder Ten times, and it will be dryed up no more into Pouder, but remain in a thick Oyl, the which will turn <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and all Bodies into pure Alchymick Gold, sufficiently good for all works of the <hi>Goldsmith,</hi> but not for Medicine for Man's Body.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. A Second way, Gold is much more wonderfully Elixirated by the said <hi>Fire against Nature,</hi> compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Fire Natural,</hi> after this manner. Let Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol of the Fire of Nature, made of the most sharp Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, or moisture of <hi>Grapes,</hi> and <hi>Sericon,</hi> joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in a Mass, with the Natural Mineral Vitriol (<hi>called the Gum of</hi> Adrop, <hi>or Vitriol Azoth,</hi>) made some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what dry, and with Sal Nitre, be dissolved.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. First Ascends a Fair, Weak, Flegmatick Water, which cast away. Then a White Fume, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Vessel appear
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:65913:372"/>
White like Milk, which Fume must be gathered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the receiver, so long till it ceases, and the Vessel becomes clear, of its own Color. This water of the White Fume is the stinking <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which is called Our Dragon against Nature. This <hi>Menstruum,</hi> if the said Dragon against Nature was absent, would be our Fire Natural, of which we shall hereafter speak in its proper place.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. [Raymundus <hi>saith, this Water is made of four things:</hi> 1. <hi>The Composition of</hi> Sal Amarum. 2. Menstru um Foetens. 3. Argent Vive, <hi>which is a common substance in every Corruptible Body.</hi> 4. Mineral Vitriol.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. This <hi>compounded Water Mineral,</hi> and <hi>Water Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> being mixed together, and made one Water as aforesaid, doth work con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Operation, which is wonderful, it Dissolves and Congeals, it makes moist and dry, it putrifies and purifies; it divides asunder and joyns together; it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys and restores; it kills and makes alive; it wounds and heals again; it makes soft and hardens; it makes thin and thick; it resolves Compounds, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds again: It begins the Work and makes an end of the same.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. These two Mineral Waters Compounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one, are the two Dragons Fighting and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to gather one against the other in the Flood of <hi>Satalia: viz.</hi> the White Fume and the Red; and one of them shall devour the other. And here the Solutory Vessels ought to be Luted but gently, or clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with Linnen Cloth, or with Mastick, or common Wax, or Cerecloth.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. These two Dragons are Fire and Water, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Vessel and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and therefore if they feel any exteriour fire, they will rise up to the top of the Vessel, and if they be yet forced by the violence or strength of the Fire, they will break the Vessel, and
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:65913:373"/>
so you will lose all your Work.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. This Compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Water aforesaid, does Congeal as much as it does Dissolve, and lists it up into a glorious Crystalline Earth. This is our Secret dissoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Stone, which is always done with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation of its Water. The Fire of Nature is here put to the Fire against Nature; therefore as much as the Stone has lost of its form by the power and strength of the <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Fire against Nature;</hi> so much has it got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recovered again of its form, by the Virtue of the <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Fire of Nature.</hi> But the Fire against Nature, by the means of the Fire of Nature, cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. THE Practice with the said Compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Water, upon the <hi>Calx</hi> of the Body duly dissolved and prepared: <hi>Take the prepared Body</hi> (made with a thick Oyl,) <hi>put to it so much of the Compounded Water as may cover the same Calx</hi> (i. e. <hi>Our prepared</hi> Calx <hi>with Our Vege table</hi> Menstruum) <hi>by the depth of half an Inch.</hi> The Water will presently boil over the <hi>Calx</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal dissolving the Stone, and lifting it up into the form of <hi>Ice,</hi> with the dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up also of the said Water.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The said <hi>Calx</hi> being so dissolved and sublimed into the form of <hi>Ice,</hi> you must take away; after this is done, the residue of the <hi>Calx</hi> remaining in the Vessel
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:65913:373"/>
undissolved, shall again be well dryed by the Fire, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which put so much of the said Compounded Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as you did before, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, subliming and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, till the <hi>Calx</hi> is wholly dissolved.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The substance thus dissolved, subtily separated and brought into a Pouder, must be put (as thereafter shall be shewed) into a good quantity of the <hi>Fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> (<hi>which is a Quintescence</hi>) the same being first well rectified, and the Vessel well stopp'd, to the end, that the means of the heat outwardly administred unto it, procuring the inward heat to work, it may be dissolved into an Oyl; the which will soon be done, by reason of the simplicity of the Water, or simple <hi>Fire of Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And therefore when you have brought the said Pouder so dissolved, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed, and prepared with the said Compounded Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into an Oyl (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap> is our <hi>Menstruum</hi> Visible, unto sight) by putting thereto a good quantity of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said rectified simple <hi>Fire of Nature,</hi> as before declared; then abstract or draw away the said Water again from the same Oyl, by Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the same in a moist Temperate heat, so long till there remains in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Glass a thin Oyl.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. This Oyl, the oftner it is dissolved with the said simple rectified <hi>Fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the said Water Abstracted or Distilled by a Temperate heat, so much the more will the said Oyl be made subtil and thin.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. With the said Oyl (provided the <hi>Calx</hi> be the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna</hi>) you may incere the substances or Calces of other Bodies, the said Bodies being first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, exalted, sublimed, and prepared with the said Compounded Water, in manner and form of <hi>Ice</hi> aforesaid, till that by the <hi>Inceration</hi> of the said subtil and thin Oyl of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> the said substances of
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:65913:374"/>
other Bodies be made fixed, and to flow like Wax.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. With which flowing substance, you shall not only congeal <hi>Argent Vive</hi> into perfect <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> according as you have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared your Medicine, but you shall also with the same fluxible and flowing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, transmute and change all such other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Bodies, (as they were, whose Calces were so sublimed, and from whom, at their first sublim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or lifting up, they took their beginning) into <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> aforesaid.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And this thin and subtil Oyl, being put into <hi>Kemia</hi> its proper Vessel, first sealed up, to putrifie in the Fire of the first degree, being moist: it becomes as black as liquid Pitch. The fire may then have its Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Body, to corrupt it, (the same Body as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so opened.)</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Therefore it grows first black, like melted Pitch, because the bear working in this moist Body, does first beget a blackness, which blackness is the first sign of Corruption: and since the Corruption of one thing is the generation of another; therefore of the Body cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, is generated a Body Neutral, which is certainly apt, declinable, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable unto every <hi>Ferment</hi> whatsoever you please to apply it to.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. But the <hi>Ferment</hi> must be altered together with the <hi>Alchymick</hi> Body; and the whole substance of our Stone or Elixir must partake of the Nature of the Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescence, otherwise it will be of no effect.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And between the said sign of blackness and perfect whiteness, which will follow the said blackness, there will appear a green Color, and as many vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Colors afterwards as the mind of Man is able to conceive.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. When the present White Color shall begin to appear like the Eyes of
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:65913:374"/>
Fishes, then may you know that Summer is near at hand, after which <hi>Autumn</hi> or <hi>Harvest</hi> will happily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with ripe fruit, which in the long looked for Red ness: This is after the Pale, Ashy, and <hi>Citrine</hi> Color.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. First the <hi>Sun</hi> does perfectly Descend by its due Course, from its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridional height and Glory, through its gross and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral solution into an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Pale, and Ashy Color, shining in the Occidental parts of the West, which is somewhat of a yellowish or Brick dust Color: from thence it goes to the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentrional parts of the Earth, being of a Variable watrish blackness, of a dark, cloudy, alterable, putrefactive wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trishness.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Then it Afcends up to the Oriental parts, shining with a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Crystalline, Summer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and Paradisical White: Lastly, he Ascends his <hi>Fiery Chariot,</hi> directing his Course up again to his Meridional Life, Perfection and Glory, there to Rule and Shine, in fire, brightness, splendor, and the highest perfection, even in the highest, most pure, and Imperial Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. When this aforesaid simple Oyl of the altered Body, being in its Vessel duly sealed, is by the Fire thus disposed, what is there more than one simple thing, which nature has made to be generated of <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Bowels of the Earth?</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. Thus it is evident, that our Stone is nothing else but <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna, Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> and <hi>Mercury: Male</hi> and <hi>Female; Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold.</hi> And therefore (to be more short) when all the parts of our Stone, are thus gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, it appears plainly enough, what is our <hi>Mercury,</hi> Our <hi>Sulphur,</hi> Our <hi>Alehymick</hi> Body, Our <hi>Ferment,</hi> Our <hi>Menstruum,</hi> Our <hi>Green Lyon:</hi> And what Our <hi>White Fume,</hi> Our two <hi>Dragons,</hi> Our <hi>Fires,</hi> and Our <hi>Egg,</hi> in which is both
<pb facs="tcp:65913:375"/>
the Whiteness and the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. As also what is Man's Blood, Our <hi>Aquae Vitae,</hi> Our <hi>Burning,</hi> Water, and what are many other things, which in this Our Art are Metaphorically, or figuratively named to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Foolish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Also there is a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of a <hi>Tri-une,</hi> shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Body, Soul, and Spirit. The Body is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Stone. The Soul is the <hi>Ferment</hi> which cannot be had, but from the most perfect Body; and the Spirit is that which raiseth up the Natures from Death and Corruption to Life, Perfection and Glory.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. In <hi>Sulphur,</hi> there is an Earthiness for the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: In Mercury, there is an Aerealness for the Spirit, and in them both a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Unctuosity for the Soul or Ferment; all which are inseparably United in their least parts for ever: From this Fermental Body the Stone is formed, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, it cannot be made.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. It is the peculiar pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> (the which property appertains to the Stone it self) to give the form of Gold and Silver. And therefore the Elixir, whether it be White or Red, may be Infinitely aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the Fermental Oyl: if you do cast the same upon Mercury, it shall transmute it into the Elixir, which Elixir must be cast afterwards upon the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Bodies.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. Moreover the said White Elixir is augmented with Mercurial Water, and the Red Elixir with the Mercurial Oyl; the which two, <hi>viz.</hi> the Mercurial Water and Mercurial Oyl, can only be had of Mercury dissolved of it self.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. See what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith, <hi>He stroke the Stone, and Water flowed out, and he brought forth Oyl out of the Flinty Rock.</hi> We may Note the whole composition of the Elixir in these four Verses following.</p>
                        <p n="23">

XXIII. <hi>He stretched forth the Heavens as a Curtain. The Water stood above the Mountains:</hi> This is the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which does cover Our Matter, and performs the dissolution thereof, causing a cloudy Ascension. <hi>That does walk upon the Wings of the Wind.</hi> This figures forth the sublimation of ourStone.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. <hi>Who makes his Angels Spirits, and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters a flame of Fire.</hi> By this is shadowed forth the rectification, separation, and disposition of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. <hi>Who has founded the Earth upon its Basis; so fixt, that it shall not be moved for ever.</hi> Under which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the fixation of the Elements, and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Philosophick Stone.</p>

                        <p n="1">I. ANother way, by which the Body of Gold is Elixirated by the power of the <hi>Fire against Nature,</hi> through the help of the Operation of the <hi>Fire of Nature;</hi> which is thus. Dissolve the Body of pure Gold in the <hi>Fire against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> the same fire being well rectified <hi>Arsenick</hi> [<hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury sublimate</hi>] as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is; from which Gold being so dissolved into a Citrine, clear and shining Water, without any Hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogenity, or Sand remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let the water be abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, till the Body does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the bottom of the Glass, like a fixt Oyl.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Upon this Oyl, affuse the said <hi>Water,</hi> or <hi>Fire against</hi>
                           <pb n="666" facs="tcp:65913:376"/>
                           <hi>Nature</hi> again, and abstract again, and this work so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeat till the <hi>water</hi> or <hi>fire against Nature,</hi> have no more sharpness upon the Tongue than common Well-Water.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. This done, draw such another <hi>new water</hi> or <hi>fire against Nature,</hi> which Affuse upon the former Oyl, and abstract in all respects as before is taught: then Affuse upon this Oyl the <hi>water</hi> or <hi>fire of Nature</hi> well rectified, and let it be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in quantity or propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said Oyl of the Body so dissolved, and put it into a Vessel, which stop well, and set it in <hi>Balneo</hi> for seven days; so will the <hi>water</hi> or <hi>fire of Nature</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Citrine Color.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. This <hi>water</hi> or <hi>fire of Nature</hi> by its attractive Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, will draw away the Tincture from the <hi>fire against Nature,</hi> as <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith in his practical Alphabet. And altho' it is somewhat opposite to Nature, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Bodies with the <hi>fire against Nature;</hi> yet if you know how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the matter with the <hi>fire of Nature,</hi> and by <hi>Balnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in 15 days, to draw it from the blackness of the water, or <hi>fire against Nature,</hi> (the which may be done, as I have proved, in 6 days) you shall perfect the work, and attain the desired end.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Let the aforesaid Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Water or fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so tinged with a Yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Color, be always wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily emptied, and poured off from the aforesaid dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved Bodies, into another Vessel, with a narrow Mouth, that may be firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly stopped: and then with more of the said fire, let there be made in <hi>Balnco,</hi> in the space of time aforesaid, another quantity of the said Oyl.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And so the same wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being tinged with <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Gold,</hi> let it be warily emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied, and poured off as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and when the water of Nature will be tinged no more, then it is a sign, that the Tincture is all drawn forth from the dissolved

Body by the <hi>Fire against Nature.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Put the Tinctures thus decanted off into a Glass Stillatory, and with a soft or easie Fire abstract the Water or Fire of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the same, so long till you see in the bottom an Oyl; to which you must put New Fire of Nature again, well rectified: and after the Matter has stood in <hi>Balneo</hi> for the space of 6 days, then abstract the said water or fire of Nature by distillation.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And let the work with the same water be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated upon and from the said Oyl, after the same manner so long till you have brought your Oyl of Gold to be most subtil and pure, without any Foeculent grossness, wherein let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the water or fire of Nature be left behind, but the substance of Gold only, turned to Oyl.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. This subtil and pure Oyl of Gold, being put in <hi>Kemia,</hi> or its proper Vessel, and firmly sealed up, may by the aforesaid Regiments be changed into the great Elixir, as it is shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the other simple Oyl, made with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Water, in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practice, at Sect. 8. Chap. 65. aforegoing.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. But to proceed: sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime <hi>Quick-Silver</hi> with <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Vitriol and prepared or Calcined Salt; and after that sublime it by it self alone three times from its Foeculent substance. This done, and the same made into Pouder, put this subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Pouder into a fixato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Vessel, and put thereto a certain quantity of your aforesaid Oyl of Gold, but so much only, as may scarcely cover the subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate: firmly close the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and set it in a soft Fire, till the Natures are perfectly joyned together.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. This done, grind it upon a Marble, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerate it again with your said Oyl of Gold, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter put it again into its Fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atory Vessel, under a Fire
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:65913:377"/>
of the first Degree as before, and let the same Vessel stand twice as long as it did before, to the Intent that the Natures may be firmly Compact and United together.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Now this Rule is generally to be Observed, that the Vessel with the Matter in it to be fixed, ought always to be set over the fire from time to time to be augmented: and this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceration to be continued still upon the <hi>Argent Vive</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limed, until the same is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly fixed with the said Oyl or substance of Gold.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. The which must be proved upon a Plate of Silver Red Hot: And if it be found fixed, let it have for the greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, one Inceration more of the said Oyl, which set under a strong fire for the space of three days: then grind it with your Oyl up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same Stone, till it be as thick as an Oyntment; which make perfectly dry with an easie fire, and then let it be Calcined with a strong fire for the space of eight hours.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Which done, then Incerate it, and dry it again with a soft or gentle fire oftentimes, till it stands in the fire like melted Wax. This Medicine will trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute Silver substantially and perfectly into fine and pure <hi>Alchymick Gold,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to all the works of <hi>Goldsmiths,</hi> but not to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for Man.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXVII.</hi> Two other Mineral Elixirs, <hi>or</hi> Two other Processes of Mercury.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THere be many other Noble and Profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Secrets in this Art, or Mystery of our Mineral Stone; <hi>viz.</hi> good Elixirs to be made out of Metalline Bodies; of which Mineral Elixirs, two are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the rest, the first of which we shall han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in this Chapter.</p>
                        <p>[Here comes in the Process or Practical Operation of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mentioned <hi>Chap. 61. Sect. 13.</hi> aforegoing.]</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The first of these Elixirs is only in Mercury: <hi>The second,</hi> in Mercury and the White Body for the White Elixir; and with the same to the Red too, if you so please, being prudently pursued and sought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. The first manner to Elixirate only with <hi>Mercury</hi> is thus. Dissolve <hi>Mercury</hi> only, by it self into a Milky water, with the which <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> so dissolved, you may dissolve so much more <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> and so continually, as long as you please.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Put this into a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fire to be Distilled, so shall you have Our Virgins Milk White and Chrystal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, wherewith all Bodies may be dissolved into their first Matter, Washed and Purged.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. This water is of a Silver Colour, which if you fix with its Earthy Faeces Calcin'd, and after that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved again in the quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of its remaining water,
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:65913:378"/>
and then again Coagulated and Congealed, (which work is to be done upon a Stone,) you will have at length the Elixir of <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> which will transmute all Imperfect Bodies to a perfect Whiteness.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And so of this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial substance is made a water permanent or fixt, wherewith the Calces of all Bodies may be so depurated and Whitened, as thereby to become the most pure and fine Silver.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And therefore as I have said before in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this work, when <hi>Mercury</hi> is dissolved, then are its Elements separable; and after the separation of its Mercurial Liquor, and that a competent putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is performed; after the same White Liquor, there will Distill a Golden moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture or humour, to which if you add a small quantity of the Ferment of the Gum of the aforesaid Elix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>irated White Stone, that then the same White Stone, with the said Golden hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, shall be made the Red Stone, which shall transmute <hi>Argent Vive,</hi> and all Metalline Bodies into the finest and most pure Gold.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. Again, if you take the aforesaid Red humour of <hi>Mercury</hi> and Dissolve in it a little of the aforesaid Red Ferment, being made as aforesaid of the White Stone, and then with the same Red humour of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury,</hi> so Fermented with it self, the Calces of all Bodies, may be so depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Citrinated, that thereby they may become most pure Gold.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. When also <hi>Argent Vive</hi> is dissolved, then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve in it a little of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Red Ferment, and so put all into <hi>Kemia,</hi> or a proper Vessel, which firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly close up with a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick Seal. Then with a continual and easie or gentle Fire, draw out the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the four Elements through the Depth of the Sea, until (the Floods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dryed up) there appears
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:65913:378"/>
in the Matter a bright shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing substance, like to the Eyes of the Fishes.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. For by this Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if you keep your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Fire continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, the Floods shall dry up, with an exceeding drought, and the dry Land or Earth shall appear, as in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> the waters were dryed up from off the Earth, and behold the Face of the Ground was dry. And by lifting up the Rod of <hi>Moses,</hi> and stretching out his hand, the waters were dryed up, and the dry Ground appeared in the midst of the Sea: for so says <hi>David, He Rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up; he led them through the Depths as through the Wilderness.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="11">XI. And then by the Space of Forty days following, it shall be Rubified, (as the Philosophers Demonstrate) by the help of a Vehement Fire, as the Nature of it requires, continuing and remaining in the same strong Fire till it melt and flow like Wax, whereby it will be able to transmute all Bodies into pure fine Gold.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. And thus the White and Red Medicines are mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied with their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per humidities: <hi>viz.</hi> only by the solution of the White Medicines in their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per White and Red hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and by their Coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation again of the same, as necessity requires. Thus have we explicated, with singular plainess of Speech, the Elixiration of <hi>Mercury per se,</hi> or <hi>Argent Vive</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>

                           <hi>I. TO Elixirate with</hi> Mercury, <hi>and the Body</hi> Alchymick. <hi>Take</hi> One part of the most pure Kibrick <hi>[quod est pater Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curij &amp; omnium Liquabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,]</hi> Sea water twelve parts, in which dissolve the <hi>Kibrick:</hi> being dissolved, strain the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter through a Linnen Cloth; and what remains undissolved, which will not go through, put into the Vessel called <hi>Kemia,</hi> set it over a gentle fire, as it were the heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till there appears on the Top a Red Color.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <hi>II.</hi> Then put to it a quarter more of the Sea-water afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, being kept in a very clean Vessel, set it on a very gentle fire, and dry it up again, as you did before, by little and little at a time.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For in this Work, by so much less there is put of the Spirit, and more of the Body; by so much the sooner and better shall the Solution be made; the which Solution is made by the Congelation of its wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. And therefore as the <hi>Rosary</hi> saith, you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that the Belly be not made over moist, for if it be, the water shall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or attain to its dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. This manner of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibition must be Observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and continued so long, till the whole water by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Imbibitions shall be dryed up into a Body.</p>
                        <p n="6">
                           <pb n="673" facs="tcp:65913:379"/>
VI. This done, let the Vessel be firmly and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophically Sealed up, and placed in its proper For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, with a mean or gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle fire, which must not wax cold, from the first hour you begin to set the same into the Fornace, till you have made an end of the whole work.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. And when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is sublimed, then let it be made to Descend by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little without Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the fire being Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially made or set over it; which done, let it be again sublimed as before.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. And so let the Soul of the <hi>Sun</hi> of the Vulgar (the which Soul is Our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Oyntment, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit not yet conjoyned with the Body) Ascend from the Earth to the Heaven; and again make it to Descend from Heaven to the Earth, till all becomes Earth, which before was Heaven.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. To the end there may be made a substance, not so hard as the Body, nor yet so soft as the Spirit; but holding a mean dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, standing fixed and Permanent in the fire, like a White peice of melted Wax, flowing in the bottom of the Vessel.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. The which White substance, of a mean or middle consistency, must be fed and nourished with Milk and Meat, till the quantity thereof be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed according to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>

Now this Elixir, be it White or Red, shall be increased an hundred fold more, both in Virtue and Goodness, if its Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence be fixed with it, and that then afterwards it be brought and reduced by the Fire of Nature into a thin Oyl, the which must be done in a Circulatory Vessel: for truly, then the least drop thereof does Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geal a thousand drops of Mercury into the very greatest Medicine.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXIX.</hi> Of the Vegetable Stone.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. THe Vegetable Stone is gotten by Virtue of the Fire of Nature, of the Composition of which fire we now intend plainly to treat, and of the way how to work with it, in every respect.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <hi>II.</hi> [Its Composition is of four things, as <hi>Raymundus</hi> saith, in his Book of Quintes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences: It is a Composition of <hi>Sal Amarum,</hi> which is <hi>Ignis adeptus,</hi> a fire that is gotten without Wood or Coal, and by an easie working, does work against all manner of sharpness of Action of the Visible Fire, like as if it were the fire of Hell; and therefore, altho' Wine be hot, yet this water of Mercury is hotter: for it is able to dissolve all Bodies, to putrefie, and also to divide the Elements, which neither common Fire nor Wine can do.]</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Some think that this Fire of Nature is extracted or drawn from Wine, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common way, and that it must be rectified by often Distilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until its Flegm is wholly abstracted, which hinders its Heat, Virtue,
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:65913:380"/>
Strength and Burning. But this, when it is done to all advantages, and its highest perfection (which Fools call the <hi>pure Spirit</hi>) and then put to the <hi>Calx</hi> of the Body never so well prepared, yet will it be weak and ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual to Our purpose, for Dissolution, Conservation, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p n="4">
                           <hi>IV. [</hi> The true and <hi>Pure Spirit</hi> is Our Silverish Spirit of Wine, which is our Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Mercury, and the true water of the Philosophers. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, see in <hi>Ripley's</hi> secret Concord.]</p>
                        <p n="5">V. Wherefore since the vulgar Spirit or Wine is such, it is evident that there is an Error in choosing of this Principle: for the true Principle, (which is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning) is the <hi>Resolutive Menstruum</hi> [<hi>which is the Soul of Mercury, and this Tincture is a very Oyl, separate from its foul Earth and faint Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>] which, as we know, and according to the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Wise Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, is an Unctuous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, which is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Matter of Our Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and Philosophick Mercury.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. The which Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Resolutive Menstruum, Near Matter,</hi> or <hi>Unctuous Moisture,</hi> Raymundus [<hi>in Cap.</hi> 6. <hi>and Cap.</hi> 8. <hi>of his Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>] does call Black, Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than Black: The which Black thing or Matter I certainly know.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. But since <hi>Raymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> saith, that this <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Menstruum,</hi> does come from Wine, or the Lees, or Tartar thereof, how is he to be understood? Truly, he himself unfolds the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery: Our Water or Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum, is a <hi>Metalline Water,</hi> generated of a Metalline Matter only: So that <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> speaks, either of the <hi>Resolutive Menstruum</hi> or of the <hi>Resoluble Menstruum.</hi>
                        </p>

                        <p n="10">X. If he (<hi>viz.

                        <p n="12">XII.

XVII. <hi>Raymundus</hi> doth say, that an Unctuous Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity is the last comfort and support to the Humane Body, which what it is, is manifest to the Philosophers, it makes a noise or sound in the Vessel, and is Distilled with a great deal of Art. He also saith, that Our Stone is made of the hottest Matter or substance in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And I say that Wine is hot; but there is another thing which is much hotter than Wine, whose sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, by reason of its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Airyness or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity is most quickly inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. And the Lees, or Tartar, and Dregs of this Unctuous humidity, is gross, like the Rinde or Bark of a Tree: and the same Tartar is blacker than the Tartar of the black Grape of <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia,</hi> for which cause it is called by <hi>Raymundus,</hi> a Black, more Black than Black. [<hi>By these Lees, or Tartar and Dregs, is meant the Lees of our Silver Wine, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the Lunary Body.</hi>]</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. And because that this humidity is Unctuous, therefore it better agrees with the Unctuosity of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, than the Spirit drawn from Common Wine; for through its Liquefactive Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Metals do Melt, and are made flowing and moist in the Fire; the which Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion truly the Spirit of Common Wine cannot do.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. For the Spirit of Wine, how strong soever it be, is (comparatively) but clear Flegm or Water: whereas contrariwise, in Our Unctuous Distilled Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there is no watrishness at all. But this thing being rare in our parts, as well as other Countries, <hi>Guido Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanor</hi> found out another Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous humidity, which swims upon other Liquors, which humidity proceeds from Wine, which <hi>Raymundus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Arnoldus</hi> knew, with some others, but they taught not how it should be obtained.</p>

                        <p n="22">XXII.

                        <p n="24">XXIV. Wherefore as the same Philosopher affirms, among these things is this Menstruum one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of this Art, whose Virtue must be increased by a wise management of the Matter: you must circulate this Menstruum in the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuous humidity in a Vessel of Circulation, by rotation continually, an hundred and twenty days, in the hottest Fornace.</p>

Truly his intention is that there should be made a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution with the Spirit of Wine, but that this Spirit of Wine should be joyned with another Menstruum reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble,

                        <p n="9">IX. And when the White Fume shall begin to appear, change your Receiver, and Lute it strongly, that it breath not forth; so shall you have our burning wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Our <hi>Aquae Vitae,</hi> and Resolutive Menstruum, (the which before was Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) a Vapour potential, a mighty Vapour, able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve Bodies, to Putrifie, and to Purifie, to divide the Elements, and also to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt theEarth into a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Salt, by the force of its attractive Virtue.

                        <p n="10">X.

But this Animal Elixir is neither from Wine, as it is Wine, nor from Eggs, Hair or Blood, as they are such things, but only from
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:65913:384"/>
the Elements: And these Elements we ought to search out, in the Excellency of their exceeding Simplicy and Rectification.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. The Elements as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Bachon</hi> saith, are the Roots of all things, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of every thing: yet the Elements of the said things do not enter into the Work of this Our Elixir; but only by the Virtue and Commixtion of those Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the Elements of Spirits, and Bodies of Metals.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Yet so indeed as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Bachon</hi> saith, the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of those things afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said do so enter in as to pierce through [<hi>tho' not to dwell there</hi>] and to Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish this Our great Elixir.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. Notwithstanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all those things which be Natural, (as all the rest be, which Philosophers have taken,) there is one thing yet, which is found more pretious, more excellent, more proper, and more Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural than all the rest, for this our purpose.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. The which one thing, because it is more excellent than all the rest, the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers have taken for the nearest; because of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perfection which God has given to the <hi>Microcosm</hi> or lesser World, in whom are not only the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the Courses and effects of the Planets, Stars, and Aste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risms, but also the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, humours, Spirits, and Natural Virtues of the Elements.</p>
                        <p n="6">VI. And therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the most noble Bird of <hi>Hermes,</hi> which when the <hi>Sun</hi> is in <hi>Aries,</hi> begins to fly; and as it is advised, so let it be brought forth and sought for. Seek out the true <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> from his <hi>Mine</hi> or <hi>Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> not being corrupted, for the whole perfection lies in the uncorrupt <hi>Sulphur.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="7">VII. This is our Stone, the which as <hi>Aristotle</hi> saith, in his Secret of Secrets, is generated in the Dunghil, High-ways, and must be divided into four parts: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause saith he, each part has
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:65913:385"/>
one Nature, the which parts must be joyned together again, till they resist or strive no more; when they are joyned unto it, it shall be White; is Fire, Red; as you please.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. But understand, that this Division, must not be a Manual Division, [<hi>but in Power and Effect,</hi>] where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let this one thing which all Men have (its over-flowing Flegmatick property being somewhat Evacuated) be put into <hi>Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> or proper Vessels, which Seal up Philosophically; let it putrifie in a moist Fire a long Season, into a black thickness.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Then by the second Degree of Fire, let it be Coagulated into a dryness, after many Bublings, which it will make, wherein shall shine innumerable Colors: and when all that which is fine and subtil, shall Ascend upwards [<hi>or sublime</hi>] in the Vessel moft White, like as the Eyes of Fishes, the work is compleat in the first part.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. This truly is a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous thing, more to be wondred at, than any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of Nature, for then the self same White, has fully the Nature of White <hi>Sulphur,</hi> not Burning [<hi>or Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>] and is the very <hi>Sulphur</hi> of Nature and <hi>Argent Vive.</hi>

                        <p n="11">XI. Let some quantity of <hi>Luna</hi> be added to it in the manner of an Amalgama; then it brings forth, by Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or generation of White into White; and the same thing worketh it into Red, and is made compleat into Red, by a greater Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion in the Fire.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Then, as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers advise, let the two <hi>Sulphurs, viz.</hi> the White and the Red be mingled with the Oyl of the White Elixir, that they may work the more strongly; upon which, if the Quintescence of the Vegetable Stone shall be fixed, you shall have the highest Medicine in the World, both to Heal and Cure Humane Bodies, and to transmute the Bodies of Metals into the most pure and fine Gold and Silver.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. LXXIII. Ripley's</hi> Philosophical Axioms out of the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum Chymicum.</head>
                        <p n="1">I. OUr Stone is called the <hi>Microcosm;</hi> One and Three; <hi>Magnesia</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned by Nature her self. Now understand that that there are three <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> which being the Key of the whole Science, <hi>Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus</hi> calls his Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, without which, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be done in this Art: but the Essential <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> of the Bodies is the chief material of our Stone.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Our Stone is a Soul and a substance, by which the Earth does receive its splendor: what other thing is <hi>Sol</hi> or <hi>Luna,</hi> than a <hi>Terra Munda,</hi> a pure Earth, Red and White? The whole Composition we call Our <hi>Plumbum</hi> or <hi>Lead,</hi> the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of whose splendor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">III. No impure Body, one excepted, which the Philosophers vulgarly call the <hi>Green Lyon,</hi> (which is the Medium which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns the Tinctures between
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:65913:387"/>
                           <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> with perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) does Enter into our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistry.</p>
                        <p n="4">IV. These Menstruums you ought to know, without which no true Calcination, or natural dissolution can possibly be done. But our principal Menstruum may be said indeed to be Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible or Spiritual; yet by the help of our <hi>Aqua Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophica secunda,</hi> through a separation of the Elements, in form of clear water, it is brought to light, and made to appear.</p>
                        <p n="5">V. And by this Menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um with great Labour is made the Sulphur of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by Circulation in a pure Spirit; and with the same you may dissolve your Body after divers manners: and an Oyl may be extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therefrom, of a Golden Color, like as from Our Red <hi>Lead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">VI. 1. <hi>De Calcinatione.</hi> Calcination is the Purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Stone, restoring it to its own Natural Color, inducing first a necessary dissolution thereof, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Corrosives,</hi> nor fire alone, nor A. F. nor with other Burning waters, or the Vapour of <hi>Lead,</hi> is our Stone Calcined; for by such Calcinations, Bodies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, for that they dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish their humidities.</p>
                        <p n="7">VII. Whereas in our Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination the Radical humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity is Augmented or mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied, for like increases like; he which knows not this knows nothing in this Art. Joyn like with like, and kind with kind, as you ought; every seed answers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces in seed of its own kind: and every Spirit is fixed with a <hi>Calx</hi> of its own kind or Nature.</p>
                        <p n="8">VIII. The Philosophers make an Unctuous <hi>Calx,</hi> both White and Red, of three Degrees, before it can be perfected, that shall melt as Wax, till which it is of no use. If your water shall be in a right or just propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with your Earth, and in a fit Heat, your Matter will Germinate, the White together with the Red,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:65913:387"/>
which will endure in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fire.</p>
                        <p n="9">IX. Make a Trinity of Unity, without dissention; this is the most certain and best proportion: and by how much the lesser part is the more spiritual, by so much the more easily will the dissolution be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: drown not the Earth with too much water, lest you destroy the whole Work.</p>
                        <p n="10">X. 2. <hi>De Dissolutione.</hi> Seek not that in a thing which is not in it, as in Eggs, Blood, Wine, Vitriol, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther middle Minerals; there is no profit to be had in things not Metallick: In Metals, from Metals, and by or through Metals, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are made perfect.</p>
                        <p n="11">XI. First make a Rotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Elements; and before all things, convert the Earth into water by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: Then Dissolve that Water into Air, and then make that Air into Fire: this done, reduce it again into Earth, for otherwise you labour in vain.</p>
                        <p n="12">XII. Here is nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Sister and the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that is, the Agent and the Patient, Sulphur and Mercury, which are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Co-essential substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The dissolution of one part of the Corporeal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, causeth a Congela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another part of the spiritual.</p>
                        <p n="13">XIII. Every Metal was once a Mineral Water, wherefore they may all be dissolved into Water again; in which Water are the four repugnant Qualities with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity. In one Glass all things ought to be done, made in the form of an Egg, and well closed.</p>
                        <p n="14">XIV. Let not your Glass be hotter than you can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure your naked Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so long as your matter is in dissolution: When the Body is altered from its first form, it immediately puts on a new form.</p>
                        <p n="15">XV. 3. <hi>De Dispositione.</hi> Beware that you open not your Glass, nor ever move
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:65913:388"/>
it, from the beginning of the work to the end there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for then you will never bring your work to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Dry the Earth till it becomes thirsty in Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, otherwise you Act in vain. Divide the matter into two parts, that you may separate the subtil from the gross, or thin from the thick, till the Earth remains in the bottom of a Livid Color.</p>
                        <p n="16">XVI. One part is Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Volatile; but they ought all to be converted to one matter or substance. And distil the Water, with which you would Vivifiethe Stone, till it be pure &amp; thin as water, shinning with a Blew Livid Colour, retaining its Figure and Ponderosity: with this Water <hi>Hermes</hi> moistens or waters his Tree, whilst in his Glass, and makes the Flowers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease on high.</p>
                        <p n="17">XVII. First divide that, which Nature first tyed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, converting the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential Mercury into Air, or a Vapour, without which natural and subtil separation, no future Generation can be compleated.</p>
                        <p n="18">XVIII. Your Water ought to be seven times sublimed, otherwise there can never be any natural Dissolution made; nor shall you see any Putrefaction like Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid Pitch; nor will the Colors appear, because of the defect of the Fire Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in your Glass.</p>
                        <p n="19">XIX. 4. <hi>De Ignibus.</hi> There are four kinds of Fires which you ought to know; the Natural, the Innatural, that contrary to Nature, and the Elemental, which burns Wood: These are the fires we use, and no others.</p>
                        <p n="20">XX. The Fire of Nature is in every thing, and is the third Menstruum. The Innatural Fire is occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so called, and it is the Fire of Ashes, of Sand, and Baths for putrefying: and without this no Putrefaction can be done.</p>
                        <p n="21">XXI. The Fire against Nature, is that which tears
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:65913:388"/>
Bodies to pieces or Atoms; which is the fiery Dragon, violently burning like the fire of Hell. Make there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that your fire within, in your Glass, which will burn the Bodies much more powerfully than the vulgar Elemental fire can do.</p>
                        <p n="22">XXII. 5. <hi>De Conjunctione.</hi> Conjunction is the joyning together of things separated, and of differing Qualities; or the Adequation or bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an equality of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples: he which knows not how to separate the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to divide them, and then to conjoyn them again, errs, not knowing the true way.</p>
                        <p n="23">XXIII. Divide the Soul from the Body, and get that, for it is the Soul which causes the perpetual Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction: the Male, which is our Sol, requires three parts; and the Female which is his Sister, nine parts; then like rejoyces with like for ever.</p>
                        <p n="24">XXIV. Certainly Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and Conjunction, are two strong principles of this Science, tho there may be many other principles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.</p>
                        <p n="25">XXV. 6. <hi>De Putrefactione.</hi> The Destruction of the Bodies is such, that you are diligently to Conserve them in a Bath, or our Horse-Dung, <hi>viz.</hi> in a moist heat for ninty days Natural: but the Putrefaction is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly Absolved, and brought to whiteness, like the Eyes of Fishes, in less than 150 days; the blackness first appearing, is the Index or Sign, that the matter draws on to Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                        <p n="26">XXVI. Being together Black like Liquid Pitch, in the same time, they swell and cause an Ebullition, with Colors like those of the Rainbow, of a most beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful aspect; and then the water begins to whiten the whole Mass.</p>
                        <p n="27">XXVII. A temperate heat working in moist Bodies, brings forth blackness, which having obtained, there is
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:65913:389"/>
nothing that you need fear for in the same way, the Germination of our Stone does follow, and forthwith, to wit, in the space of thirty [<hi>or Forty</hi>] days, you have <hi>Gas,</hi> or <hi>Adrop,</hi> which is our <hi>Uzifer</hi> or <hi>Cinnabar,</hi> and our <hi>Red Lead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="28">XXVIII. Takeheed to defend your Glass from a Violent Heat, and a sudden Cold; make use of a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Fire, and beware of Vitrification. Beware how you bind up your matter; mix it not with Salts, Sulphurs, nor the middle Minerals; let Sophisters prate what they will, Our Sulphur and our Mercury are found in Metals only.</p>
                        <p n="29">XXIX. 7. <hi>De Coagulatione.</hi> Coagulation or Congelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the induration or hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of things, in <hi>Calore Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dido,</hi> and the fixing of the Volatile Spirit. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are forthwith convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Congelation is no way impeded, for those things which are Congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Air, melt or soften not in the Water; for if so, Our work would be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and come to nothing.</p>
                        <p n="30">XXX. When the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum is brought to White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, then the Spirit is Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and Congealed with the Body; but it will be a good length of time before such a Congelation will appear in the likeness or Beauty of Pearls. The cause of all these things is the most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate heat, continually working and moving the Matter. Believe me also, that your whole Labour is lost, except you revivifie your Earth with the Water, without that you shall never see a true Congelation.</p>
                        <p n="31">XXXI. This Water is a Secret drawn from the Life of all things existing in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for from Water all things in the World have their first beginning, as you may easily perceive in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things. The substance or Matter is nourished with its proper Menstruum, which the Water and the Earth only produce, whose proper Colour is Greenness.</p>
                        <p n="32">
                           <pb n="693" facs="tcp:65913:389"/>
XXXII. Understand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that our fiery Water thus acuated is called the Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strual Water, in which Our Earth is dissolved, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally Calcined by Conge lation; when you have made seven Imbibitions, then by a Circumvolution, putrifie again all the Matter without addition, beholding in the first place the blackness, then the Whiteness of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed Matters.</p>
                        <p n="33">XXXIII. Thus your Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is divided into two parts: with the first part, the Bodies are purified: the second part is reserved for Imbibitions; with which afterwards the Matter is made black, and presently after with a gentle fire, made White, then reduce to Redness.</p>
                        <p n="34">XXXIV. 8. <hi>De Cibatione.</hi> Cibation, is the Feeding or Nourishing of our dry Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with Milk and Meat, being both administred mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, till it is reduced to the third Order: you must never give so much as to cause a suffocation, or that the Aqueous humour should exceed the Blood: if it drinks too much, the work will be hurt.</p>
                        <p n="35">XXXV. Three times must you turn about the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophick Wheel, observing the Rule of the said Cibati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and then in a little time it will feel the Fire, so as to melt presently like Wax.</p>
                        <p n="36">XXXVI. 9. <hi>De Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> Sublime not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the top of the Vessel, for without Violence, you cannot bring it down to the bottom again; by a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat below, in the space of 40 days, it will become black and obscure. When the Bodies are purified, let them be sublimed by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees more and more, till they shall be all elevated or converted into Water.</p>
                        <p n="37">XXXVII. We use Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation for three Causes. First, that the Body may be made spiritual. Secondly, that the the Spirit may be made Corporeal aud fixed with it, and become Consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with it. Thirdly, that it may be purified from its Original Impurities; and its Sulphurous Salt may be
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:65913:390"/>
diminished, with which it is infected; subliming it to the Top, as White as Snow.</p>
                        <p n="38">XXXVIII. 10. <hi>De Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentatione.</hi> Fermentations are made after divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by which our Medi cine is perpetuated. Some dissolve <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> into a certain clear Water; and with the Medicine of them, they make the same to Coagulate, or be Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, but such a Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we propose not.</p>
                        <p n="39">XXXIX. This only is our Intention, that first you must Break, or Tear, or Grind the matter to <hi>Atoms,</hi> before you Ferment it: Mix then presently your Water and Earth together; and when the Medicine shall flow like Wax, then see the above mentioned Amalga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and put forth the same; and when all that is mixed together, above or on the top of the Glass, (being well closed,) make a Fire, till the whole be Fluxed; then make projection as you shall think fit, because it is a Medicine wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: Thus have you made the Ferment both for the Red and the White.</p>
                        <p n="40">XL. The true Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Incorporation of the Soul with the Body, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing to the same the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Odour, Consistency, and Colour, by a Natural Inspissation of the separated things. And as the Magnet draws <hi>Iron</hi> to it self, so our Earth by Nature draws down its Soul to it self, Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with Wind: For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the Earth is the Ferment of the Water, and by Course or Turns, the Water is the Ferment of the Earth.</p>
                        <p n="41">XLI. We make the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter most Odoriferous, with which we reduce all the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into Oyl, with which Oyl we make our Medicine flow. We call this Water a Quintessence, or the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and it Heals or Cures all humane Diseases. Make therefore this Oyl of <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> which is a Ferment most fragrant in smell.</p>
                        <p n="42">
                           <pb n="695" facs="tcp:65913:390"/>
XLII. 11. <hi>De Exaltatione.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation differs a little from Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, if you understand aright the words of the Philosophers. If therefore you would Exalt your Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, sublime them first with <hi>Spiritus Vitae;</hi> then let the Earth be subtilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a Natural rectification of all the Elements; so shall it be more pretious than Gold, because of the Quintessence or Powers which they contain.</p>
                        <p n="43">XLIII. When the Cold does over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Heat, then the Air is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into water, &amp; so two contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are made by the way, till they kindly conjoyn and rest together: after this manner you must work them, that they may be Circulated, that they (one with another) may speedily be Exalted together. In one Glass well Sealed, all this Operation is to be done, and not with hands.</p>
                        <p n="44">XLIV. Convert the Water into Earth, which will quickly be the Nest of the other Elements; for the Earth is in the Fire, which rests in the Air. Begin this Circulation in the <hi>West,</hi> then continue it till past the Meridian, so will they be exalted.</p>
                        <p n="45">XLV. 12. <hi>De Multiplicatione.</hi> Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication is the thing which makes the augmentation of the Medicine, in Color, Smell, Vertue, and Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity; for it is a Fire, which being Excited, never dies, but always dwells with you, one spark of which is able to make more Fire by the Virtue of Multiplication.</p>
                        <p n="46">XLVI. He is rich which has but one Particle or Grain of this our Elixir, because that Grain is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be augmented (by one way) to Infinity: if you dissolve this our dry Pouder, and make a frequent Coagulation thereof, you will aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it, and so you may Multiply it, till it increases in your Glass, into the form of a Tree, and which <hi>Hermes</hi> calls a Tree, most Beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Aspect. Of which one Grain may be Multiplied to an hundred, if you know how wisely to make your Projection.</p>
