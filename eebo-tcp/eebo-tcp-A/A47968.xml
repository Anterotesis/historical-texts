            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A <hi>LETTER</hi> concerning the TRYAL at <hi>Oxford</hi> of <hi>STEPHEN COLLEGE,</hi> Auguſt <hi>17. 1681.</hi>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THis is to Anſwer your Command in the beſt account I can gain of the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings here againſt Mr. <hi>College.</hi> He was brought this Morning to his Tryal upon a Special Commiſſion, and upon his Arraignment, he did at firſt Refuſe to Plead; but upon Second Thoughts, and better Advice, he Pleaded Not Guilty. His ſuggeſtions were, That <hi>as a Free-man of</hi> London <hi>he ought not to be Tryed any where elſe for Treaſon:</hi> And he inſiſted further upon the Reſtoring ſome Writings to him that had been taken from him, without which he would not Plead.</p>
            <p>Now for your better underſtanding of this Paſſage, ſome of his Friends obtained leave from the Judges (as I am informed) to go to Viſit him, where it is ſaid that one <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> was obſerved to put ſome Papers into his hand, which were preſently ſeized and carried to the Attorny-General; and theſe were the Papers that he demanded back again. The Court told him, that what was fit for him to have ſhould be delivered him, and ſo they gave him back one of them, which was a Note of his <hi>Witneſſes Names.</hi> There was a Second, which they ſay was a Speech intended for him to make uſe of at his Tryal, and that was denied him as a <hi>Libellous Paper.</hi> There was a Third alſo, which was matter of Direction what to Plead, and how to mannage his Defence: and this they told him was Equivalent to Councel, which was not to be allowed in caſe of Treaſon, unleſs matter of Law appeared upon Pleading. but all this notwithſtanding, the Court did ſo far Indulge the Priſoner in all warrantable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that his Paper of Inſtructions was delivered him alſo, and only the Libellous Paper detained: And thereupon his two Friends, Mr. <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Starkey,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Aaron Smith</hi> being with him at the Delivery of theſe Papers, were both of them called upon and obliged to enter into Recognizance to appear when the Court ſhould require it: they denying to anſwer the Court, being Interrogated about the Delivery of thoſe Papers, inſiſting upon it, That no man was obliged to Confeſs anything to his own Prejudice. Mr. <hi>College</hi> would needs perſuade the Court that all the Proteſtants of <hi>England</hi> were concerned in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his Caſe, and Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> they ſay ſpake ſome words reflecting upon the Dignity of the Court, which ſome would have had to be Recorded; but I do not hear that any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notice was taken thereof.</p>
            <p>It was a long Tryal, and could not be otherwiſe, Mr. <hi>College</hi> having between Forty and Fifty Evidences there, which were heard at large, with all the Fairneſs and Patience imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Two of the Witneſſes were a <hi>Divine</hi> (as I take it) and a <hi>Drawer.</hi> About Three of the Clock in the Morning, <hi>Auguſt</hi> 18. after half an hours Conſideration, the Jury brought him in Guilty, with a great Shout upon the Verdict: The Sentence being deferred till Seven the next Morning. The High Sheriff was ſo Candid and Generous, as upon hearing that one of the Jury had declared himſelf diſaffected to the Priſoner, he cauſed him to be ſtruck out. There were but Six Witneſſes for the King, One Iriſh-man, and the other Five Engliſh.</p>
            <p>This is all the Trouble you ſhall receive upon this Occaſion from</p>
