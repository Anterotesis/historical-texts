            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

drawn parallel to the base, through every one of
these divisions, though in the Diagram there is not
so many. From P to the first Q suppose to be 2, its
square 4; the half thereof 2, which multiplied by 9
equal to PH, the Product will be 18; that is, the

                  <p>As 14, is to 11; so are all the squares in one
fourth of the conoid, to one fourth of the conoid
it self. because this one fourth ought to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
by the number of cubick inches in a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,
suppose it 288, to shew the number of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
in each portion, we may multiply 14 by 288,
that is 4032. Then as 4032 is to 11; so are all the
squares in one fourth of the conoid, to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
in that one fourth. Further, because this one
fourth ought to be multiplied by 4, to reduce it to
a whole conoid; therefore, divide the constant
divisor, that is, 4032, by 4, and it will be 1008.
Then, as 1008, is to 11; so are those several por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the second colum of the last table, to the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40180:7"/>
number of Gallons in those several portions of a
parabolick conoid. By such compositions may the
Practitioner compose constant divisors or divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends,
which will much breviate the work; this is
onely for an Example.</p>
                  <p>Every parabolick conoid hath its second diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
equal. To find the second differences,
work thus, Square one of the equal segments of
the axis, and multiply that Square by the Parame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that product will be the second difference. In
this Example, the equal segment of the axis is 2,
the square of it 4; which multiplied by the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter
9, the product is 36, the second difference.
Half of the second difference, is always the first of
the first difference. Half 36 the second difference,
is 18, the first of the first difference, &amp;c. Here
note, this 36 is the second difference of one fourth
of all the squares in a parabolick conoid; if 36 be
multiplied by 4, it makes the second difference 144;
whose half is 72, the first of the first differences.
Or, the first differences are found by taking half
the difference of the squares of any two segments,
which multiplied by the Parameter, thereby the
first differences are obtained. Thus, to find the
first difference answerable to the Segments 6 and
8; the Square of 8, is 64; the Square of 6, is 36;
the difference of those Squares is 28, whose half
is 14; which multiplied by the Parameter 9, the
product is 126; the first difference answerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
6 and 8.</p>

make tables of the second and first differences,
and then the table of portions it selfe. Every
sphere hath its third differences equall. To find
the third difference, doe thus. Cube one of the
equal segments of the axis and multiply that cube
by 2, and that product will be the third difference,
thus, the cube of three is 27, which multiplyed
by 2, the product is 54; the third difference of
all the squares in one fourth of a sphere. Here note,
that it is to be understood, that the axis of the
sphere is equally divided into an equal number
of segments; so then, if the number of segments
in the semiaxis, less by one; be multiplyed by
the third difference, it gives the first of the second
differences. Thus, the number of segments in the
semiaxis is 4, then 4 less 1, is 3; which being
multiplyed by 54, the product is 162: the first
of the second differences.</p>
               <p>To find the third difference in one fourth of
all the squares in a spheroid, do thus: The axis
being divided as above in the sphere; cube the
difference betwixt two Segments, which being
multiplyed by 2, makes a product; then, as the
square of the semiaxis, is to the square of the
other semidiameter; so is that former product to
a fourth number, which will be the third diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

               <p>To find the second differences in a pyramid:

               <p>Let there be a pyramid whose Altitude is 10,

5; therefore the area of the base is 200. Let the

the cube of 2, is 8; whose double is 16.

by a continuall adding of the third difference to
