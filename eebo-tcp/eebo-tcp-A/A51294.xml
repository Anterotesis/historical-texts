         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Adjusting of the</hi> Phaenomena <hi>of the
World to the Goodness of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi>
Arguments that will easily
allure the Attention of the Curious,
and I think handled with that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
that full comprehension and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
circumspection, that they will also
satisfie the Ingenuous. But they that
have a minde to finde flaws will easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
phansie they see them even there
where they are not. The main Scope
of the Authour in the handling of the
<hi>Attributes of God</hi> seems to be, to
cut his way with that Caution and
Iudgement, as neither to lessen the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of the Godhead</hi> by a pretence of
making his <hi>Nature</hi> so universally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible
to all Capacities whatsoever,
(for it is well known how dull and
short-sighted some are) nor yet on the
other side to make his <hi>Existence</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible,
by puzzling and confounding
even the best vnderstandings with high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flown
Notions and hard Repugnancies,
yea perfect Contradictions, upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of magnifying the <hi>Nature of God</hi>
the more thereby. As if the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plext
<pb facs="tcp:55306:3"/>
and self-inconsistent the <hi>Nature
of God</hi> were, it were the more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and adorable; and that were
not a Reprehension of our Saviour to
the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> but an <hi>Encomium,</hi>
where he saies,<note place="margin">John 4. 22.</note> 
               <hi>Ye worship ye know
not what.</hi> Which yet is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all those that dress up the Deity
with repugnant Attributes, and an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation
to the Atheistically-given to
quit both the Deity and his Worship
at once.</p>
            <p>Which consideration I conceive made
the Authour of these Dialogues not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with sound Reason to beat down,
but also with a due and becoming Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuousness
to explode that new fond
Opinion of the <hi>Nullubists,</hi> who, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth,
imagine themselves so superla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
<hi>intellectual</hi> above other men, in
declaring that <hi>God is no-where,</hi> though
they cannot deny but that he is. In
which lofty adventure though they boast
themselves as so safely elevated above
the Region of <hi>Imagination,</hi> yet I do
not doubt but this high Lift of their
thoughts will be found at last to be but
<pb facs="tcp:55306:4"/>
as a tumid Bubble on troubled waters,
and that the <hi>Levity</hi> and <hi>Puffiness</hi> of
their <hi>Spirits</hi> has carried their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(if they have any of the thing
they pronounce of) above the levell of
<hi>common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his <hi>adjusting of the</hi> phaenomena
<hi>of the Universe to the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
it is considerable that he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
no Difficulties the wit of man
can imagine or invent, but brought them
all into view, or at least the hardest of
all, and such <hi>Specimina</hi> of all kindes,
that in all likelihood, what-ever new
Instances may occur to men, or they may
on set purpose excogitate, will be easily
satisfy'd by the Solution of these fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Examples.</p>
            <p>That also is not to be pretermitted,
how he has fitted <hi>Solutions</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theses</hi>
to the severall degrees and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
of the mindes of men, that the
Argument may not be too big for some,
and too little for others. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
how in the representing of the
gross Barbarities of the Manners and
Religions in the Vnciviliz'd parts of
<pb facs="tcp:55306:4"/>
the World, he does by not an unpleasant
<hi>Satyricalness</hi> dexterously endeavour the
quickening of the Civilized parts into a
sense and abhorrence of the least shadow
or resemblance of those execrable Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities.</p>
            <p>And that again, methinks, is very so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and humane, in that in the setting
out these <hi>Genius's</hi> of severall sorts and
sizes, as I even now intimated, there
is nothing of reproach cast upon any, but
he that has not the Fate to be a <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
or a <hi>Bathynous,</hi> is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
allow'd to be a <hi>Sophron.</hi> All
which Dispensations in their kinde are
laudable and honourable; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
want of Iudgement or Good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that makes them contemn one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For those that are arrived to any
due measure of real Piety and Vertue
finde so great a Perfection in that, that
those whom they see arrived to the
like degree there with themselves, let
their other Capacities be what they
will, they will easily give them the right
hand of Fellowship, and acknowledge
them their equals. But for those whose
<pb facs="tcp:55306:5"/>
either <hi>Knowledge</hi> or <hi>Ignorance</hi> is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with so high a pitch of Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Immorality, as that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and reproch all that are not of
their own size in <hi>either,</hi> it is but just
if they find themselves lightly perstrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the Parable of those two loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singing
Nightingales of <hi>Arcadia</hi> that so
rudely awakened <hi>Bathynous</hi> out of
his Divine Dream.</p>
            <p>Lastly, For the observation of <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>
of Persons, though it be not negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or transgressed in any part of all
the Five Dialogues, yet it is more full
and articulate in these Three; whenas
the peculiar Character of <hi>Hylobares</hi>
had no occasion distinctly to shew it
self in the Two last. But the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of all the others are more or
less discernible in all Five, but most of
all that of <hi>Cuphophron.</hi> In the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of which Person the <hi>Dramatist</hi>
seems to have been judicious even to
<hi>Physiognomonicall</hi> Curiosity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating
him to be one of so little a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Which comports excellently well
with that gaiety of Manners, that ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satility
<pb facs="tcp:55306:5"/>
of Wit, and lightsomeness of
Humour, that discovers it self all along
from the beginning to the end in the
person of <hi>Cuphophron.</hi> For this qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification
of Manners is most incident,
according to the rules of <hi>Physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi>
to men of a little stature, their Heat
and Spirits being something over-propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionated
to the bigness of their Bodie;
which makes them quick and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and of a sudden apprehension,
obnoxious to Raptures and exalted
Resveries, though reaching short, or
else shooting over, and not easily hit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Truth. Which therefore agrees
well with the <hi>Platonicalness</hi> of <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron</hi>'s
Genius. Besides that it may
be the Authour may have some regard
to the littleness of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of whose Wisedome <hi>Cuphophron</hi>
is introduced such an excessive Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.
As if the lesser-sized Bodies were
the fittest Sheath or Case for a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesian</hi>
Wit. Not to note farther, that
<hi>Plato</hi> also was of no procere Stature.</p>
            <p>Severall such like <hi>Prettinesses</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
the <hi>nervose</hi> prosecution of

wherein to the free and ingenuous I
think the Authour will not easily seem
to have over-shot himself in any thing,

that so-much-admired Ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Renatus Des-Cartes,</hi> on whom persons
well versed in Philosophicall Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have bestowed so high <hi>Encomiums,</hi>

besides the many Commendations he up

been intended in the behalf of <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi>
to set him in the infallible
chair, he concludes all at last with a
<pb facs="tcp:55306:6"/>
very high and unparallel'd Elogie of the
<hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy. Wherefore it may
very well be questioned whether it was
so advisedly done of the Writer of these
Dialogues, to adventure the exposing of
his own Credit, by so openly opposing and
oppugning the great Name and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of so very famous and eminent a
Philosopher as <hi>Cartesius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for my part, I must confess, the
more he may have exposed himself by
this freedome, (provided that he be
in the right, which the impartial Reader
must judge of) the Points that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
are of such great consequence,
that I think it is in him the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous
Act of Vertue, and that that
very ground upon which this Imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Over-shooting himself is raised is
a Principle to be abhorred by all good
and generous Spirits; namely, As if it
were a point of Imprudence to be less
tender of a man's own private Credit
then of the Glory of God and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Good; or, As if any one ought to
lose any esteem by doing what is r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ally
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orthy and laudable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55306:7"/>
Besides, he does but follow the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of that very Authour that is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so highly to have commended <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi>
most of the Allegations against
his Philosophy being more fully pursued
in that <hi>Encomiast</hi>'s Writings. And in
that very Epistle to <hi>V. C.</hi> where he
makes it his business to apologize for
him, and to extoll him and magnifie him
to the skies, yet he does plainly and
apertly declare, <hi>That it is a kinde of
vile and abject</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>or supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
idolizing of Matter, to pretend
that all the</hi> Phaenomena <hi>of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
will arise out of it by mere Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical
Motion.</hi> And yet in the same
Epistle he seems to acknowledge that
there may be some few effects purely
Mechanicall. Which I believe was from
his over-great desire of making <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>
seem as considerable as he could
with any judgement and Conscience.
But for my part, upon my more seriously
considering what occurrs in these Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
I am abundantly assured that
there is no purely-Mechanicall <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon</hi>
in the whole Vniverse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55306:7"/>
Nor ought that Authour so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
in the comparing <hi>Cartesius</hi> with
<hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> as if he did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
believe he was supernaturally inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
For with what face can any one
put that sense upon such an high-flown
Complement, whenas he does as well up
and down in his Works plainly and
zealously confute <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> where he
findes him faulty in things of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
as praise him and commend him
where he deserves it? Which is a
plain indication he did not take him to
be infallibly inspired. And it may be
the right <hi>Exegesis</hi> of <hi>Bezaliel</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiab</hi>'s
being <hi>filled with the Spirit
of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 35. 35.</note> is but their being <hi>filled with
wisedome of heart</hi> for those Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Curiosities of Work; as it is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
toward the end of that Chapter,
That they had a special and extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Genius</hi> that way, which was the
gift of God in Nature. Besides that
every great thing in Nature according
to the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Idiom has its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from God.<note place="margin">Exod. 35. 31.</note> And therefore <hi>to be
filled with the Spirit of God in wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb facs="tcp:55306:8"/>
and understanding,</hi> &amp;c. is to
have a great measure of Wisedome and
Vnderstanding in such and such things.
As without question <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> had a
great deal of Wit and Sagacity to finde
out the most credible Material Causes of
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World, and to
order them into the most specious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture
that the thing is capable of, to
make up a Mechanicall Philosophy. But
that these things can neither arise nor
hold together without an higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
that must superintend and guide
them, this great <hi>Encomiast</hi> of his does
as plainly declare in<note n="*" place="margin">Antidot. <hi>

            <p>But as for the Authour of <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia
Scripturae Interpres,</hi> I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I do much admire, that after he has
laboured so much to make good his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,
he should pitch upon <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>
his Philosophy as such a safe
Oracle to consult about the meaning of
Scripture. It is true, that severall strokes
of it are very fitly applicable to a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophical
sense of the Six daies Creation:
<pb facs="tcp:55306:8"/>
but those are such as are comprehended
in the <hi>Pythagorick</hi> frame of the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse,
and correspond with the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Cabbala;</hi> are no new Inventions
of the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Wit. And the truth is,
that which makes <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
look so augustly on't is, in that
he has interwoven into it that noble Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem
of the World according to the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
or, if you will, of the most anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<hi>Cabbala</hi> of <hi>Moses.</hi> But the rest of
his Philosophy is rather <hi>pretty</hi> then
<hi>great,</hi> and in that sense that he drives
at, of pure Mechanism, enormously and
ridiculously false.</p>
            <p>But now for those Principles or Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
in his Philosophy that are more
peculiarly his own, there is nothing
more estranged from the <hi>Genius</hi> of
the Scripture and the service of The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie
then they. For fuller satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and for the <hi>suavity</hi> of the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit's
sake, let us make triall in some
few. It is a grand Principle with
him, that where-ever we cannot but
conceive an Extension or Expansion,
<pb facs="tcp:55306:9"/>
we must likewise necessarily conceive
there is Matter. And therefore because
we cannot but conceive an indefinite
Space round about us extended, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but conceive Matter all along exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
Which plainly implies, we cannot
but conceive there is Matter, what-ever
else there is. Whence it follows, that
its existence is necessary of it self and
independent of God, because in its very
Notion or <hi>Idea</hi> it cannot but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be; we being not able other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
to conceive but that there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite
Extension round about us. How
this will comport with the absolute Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of God, or how sound a sense
it will render of the first Verse in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis,</hi>
I leave to any one to conjecture.</p>
            <p>Again, It is as confessed a Principle
with him, that Matter alone with such
a degree of Motion as is supposed now
in the Vniverse will produce all the
<hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World, Sun, Moon,
and Stars, Air, Water, Earth, Plants,
Animals, and the Bodies of Men, in such
order and organization as they are
found. Which Principle in his Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
<pb facs="tcp:55306:9"/>
certainly must prove a very inept In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter
of <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 19, 20. where <hi>the
eternall Power and Godhead</hi> is said
<hi>clearly to be seen by the things that
are made;</hi> insomuch that the Gentiles
became thereby unexcusable. But if the
<hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy be true, it was
their ignorance they could not excuse
themselves. For they might have said,
That all these things might come to pass
by Matter and mere Mechanicall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and that Matter excludes Motion
in its own <hi>Idea</hi> no morè then it includes
Rest: so that it might have Motion of
it self as well as its Existence, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the former Implication. See al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
how fit a Gloss this Principle will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
upon <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 17. and how well
that Text agrees with the first Section of
the first Chapter of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A third peculiar property of his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
is,<note place="margin">Princip. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

all search into the Final causes of
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World: as if,
forsooth, that were too great a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
of humane wit, to pry into the
Ends of God's Creation; whenas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb facs="tcp:55306:10"/>
his Philosophy is of that nature,
that it prevents all such Researches;
things coming to pass, according to it,
as if God were not at all the Creatour
and Contriver of the World, but that
mere Matter Mechanically swung about
by such a measure of Motion fell neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily,
without any more to doe, into this
Frame of things we see, and could have
been no otherwise then they are; and
that therefore all the particular Vseful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
of the Creation are not the Results
of Wisedome or Counsel, but the blinde
issues of mere Material and Mechanicall
Necessity. And things being so, it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
very consistent to cast the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Final Cause out of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicall
Philosophy. But in the mean
time how fit an Interpreter of Scripture
this Philosophy will be in such places as
that of the Psalmist, <hi>O Lord, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
are thy works! in wisedome
hast thou made them all,</hi> I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

an Organized body, (as <hi>Cartesius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
affirms;) the Souls of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
and of the godly in the other state
are equally freed from the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Sin.</p>
            <p>These few Tasts may suffice to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
us how savoury an Interpreter the
<hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy would prove of
Holy Scripture and Theologicall Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
So that Religion can suffer no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by the lessening of the Repute of
<hi>Cartesianism,</hi> the Notions that are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
thereto having so little tendency
to that service. Indeed if <hi>Cartesius</hi>
had as well demonstrated as affirmed
that Matter cannot think, he had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
deserved well of Religion it self.
But how-ever Providence has so ordered
things, that in an oblique way his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy
<pb facs="tcp:55306:12"/>
becomes serviceable to Religion,
whether he intended it or no, or rather,
that of it that was most against his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
namely the Flaws and Defects
so plainly discoverable in it. For the
unsuccessfulness of his Wit and Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
in the Mechanicall Philosophy has
abundantly assured the sagacious, that
the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the Vniverse must
be entitled to an higher and more Divine
Principle then mere Matter and Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
Motion. Which is the main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
that his greatest <hi>Encomiast</hi> does so
affectionately recommend the reading of
the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy:<note place="margin">Sect. 14, 15.</note> as you may
see in the Preface to his Treatise of the
<hi>Immortality of the Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These things, I think, duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
will easily clear the Authour of these
Dialogues from all imputation of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence,
in opposing the renowned Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
in such things as it is of so
great concern thus freely to oppose him,
especially he going very little farther
then his highest <hi>Encomiasts</hi> have led the
way before him.</p>
            <p>Nor can I bethink me of any else
that may have any colourable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
<pb facs="tcp:55306:12"/>
of a just Complaint against him,
unless the <hi>Platonists,</hi> who haply may
judge it an unfit thing that so Divine a
Philosophy should be so much slurred
by introducing <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist,</hi>
uttering such tipsie and temulent
Raptures and Rhetoricall Apologies, as
he does in the Second and Third Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues,
for the extenuating the hideous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Sin; besides the ill Tendency of
such loose and lusorious Oratorie. And
yet the judicious, I believe, will finde
those passages as pertinent and usefull as
those that bear the face of more Severity
and Reservedness; and will easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that the Character of <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron</hi>
is not simply a <hi>Platonist,</hi> but an
<hi>aiery-minded one,</hi> (as indeed both
the danger and <hi>indecorum</hi> of Light<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
mindedness or over-much Levity of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is both represented and perstringed all
along in his person;) which therefore
does not redound to the discredit of
<hi>Platonism</hi> as such, but to the discovery
of the hazard of that Philosophy, if it
meet not with a minde that is sober and
well ballasted. And for the ill Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency

            <head>THE
EPISTLE
Of Fr. Euistor, the Palaeopolite,
to a Noble Friend of his, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the ensuing Dialogues.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Honoured Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is now well-nigh two years agoe
since I gave you Intelligence tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that notable Meeting I had the
good hap to be at in <hi>Cuphophron</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Arbour: Wherein I signify'd
to you the great satisfaction <hi>Philopolis</hi>
received in those Conferences, and
how excessively <hi>Hylobares</hi> was trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
with <hi>Philotheus</hi> his Converse,
being made thereby so firm a Convert
to the belief of <hi>Spiritual Beings,</hi> and
of the <hi>Accuracy</hi> of that <hi>Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
that has the Government of the
World. But though the Hints I gave
then of the severall Days Discourses
made you so passionately desirous of
having the whole matter of those
Disceptations more fully communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to you, and all the Five Days Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
<pb facs="tcp:55306:14"/>
recovered, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
into so many <hi>Dialogues:</hi> yet, for
all the care and industry I could use, I
could not till now bring about what
you so earnestly requested.</p>
            <p>But now, partly out of my own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
I made to my self there a-nights
after every Day's Discourse, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by communicating since that time
either by Letters or word of mouth
with those that were there present,
(especially <hi>Sophron,</hi> a man of a very
firm memory as well as of an able
judgement) I think I have at length
recovered all that passed in every
Day's Conference, even to the minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Humours and Circumstances of
our Converse: Which I have done
with that faithfulness, that I have not
omitted such passages as may seem to
redound to my own discredit; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more then once not over-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
abused by our young Friend
<hi>Hylobares,</hi> who, you know, is free
enough in that kinde with his familiar
Acquaintances. Which made him fly
upon <hi>Cuphophron</hi> so frequently as he
did, even to the admiration, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense
<pb facs="tcp:55306:15"/>
sometimes, of my worthy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
<hi>Philopolis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These two, I mean <hi>Hylobares</hi> and
<hi>Cuphophron,</hi> are, as it were, the small
Mean and Treble in this <hi>Heptachordon</hi>
or Instrument of seven Strings. And
indeed they are all along (especially
in the Three first <hi>Dialogues)</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
and canorous as two stridulous
Swallows on the top of a Chimney.
The rest you will find <hi>grave</hi> enough,
and my self some degrees below Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,
that is to say, pretty <hi>solemnly</hi>
and <hi>authentickly dull.</hi> How ever, I
served to supply the place of an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian
to them; as I do to you in the
rehearsall of the whole matter.
Wherein I recording the Humours
and Passions of men as well as their
Reasonings, if any thing be faulty in
any phrase of speech or Comport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the young men, yet you are
to consider that it had been a Fault in
me to have omitted it; esp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>cially the
Blemishes of the less perfect being so
discernible in the company of those
more-accomplished persons, and
therefore the more likely to beget a
<pb facs="tcp:55306:15"/>
disrelish and aversation in the Reader
to such Miscarriages. Which is the
main Scope of all <hi>Moral</hi> Writings,
whether <hi>Poetry</hi> or <hi>History.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what may seem more harsh in
those youthfull persons, compared
with the discreet and unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
demeanour of those of more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
age, will yet be found very su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and harmonious to the Persons
themselves, if you have but recourse
to the particular Characters in the Page
before the Book; which briefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
the Genius of every Actour.
Which if you firmly fix in your mind,
and carry with you all along as you
reade, you will at least be assured that
I am not altogether an unskilfull <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matist,</hi>
how-ever you may doubt
whether I be so exact an <hi>Historian.</hi>

small prelibation of the Joys of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise
here upon Earth.</p>

                  <p>For my part, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi>
I think he need envy no body who
has his Heart full fraught with the
Love of God, and his Mind establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in a firm belief of that unspeakable
Happiness that the vertuous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soul enjoys in the other State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<hi>the spirits of just men made
perfect.</hi> The firm belief of this in an
innocent Soul is so high a prelibation
of those eternal Joys, that it equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizes
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55306:22"/>
such an one's Happiness, if he
have but the ordinary Conveniences
of life, to that of the greatest Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates.
Their difference in external
Fortune is as little considerable as a
Semidiameter of the Earth in two
measures of the highest Heaven, the
one taken from the Surface of the
Earth, the other from its Centre:
The disproportion you know is just
nothing.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>And for gratifying your
Friends; They that are in a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of being truly such, are as fully
well satisfy'd with your ordinary En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
as if you were Master
of the Fortunes of Princes. Besides
that it would be hazardous to your
self to live in that affected Splendour
you speak of, as it is not altogether
safe to affect it. For both the desire
and enjoyment of external Pomp
does naturally blinde the eyes of the
Mind, and attempts the stifling of
her higher and more heavenly Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
engages the Thoughts here
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55306:23"/>
below, and hinders those Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that carry the Soul to an antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patory

above.</p>

                  <p>What you say, <hi>Philotheus,</hi>
may be, and may not be: These
things are as they are used. But I
must confess I think worldly Fortunes
are most frequently abused, and that
there is a danger in them: which
makes me the more contented with
the state I am in.</p>

<hi>Cuphophron:</hi> for though you will not
admit you live splendidly, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deny'd but that you live neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and elegantly. For such are the

with free Discourses in Philosophy.
And this will prove your greatest

                  <p>No Entertainment better
any-where then a frugal Table, and
free and ingenuous Discourse. But
I pray you, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> who is that
<hi>Hylobares?</hi> Is it he who is so much
famed for holding That there is <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing</hi>
but <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Matter</hi> in the world;
That there is <hi>nothing Iust</hi> or <hi>Vnjust</hi> in
its own nature; That all Pleasures
are alike honest, though it be never
so unaccountable a satisfaction of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a man's Cruelty or his Lust?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>O no, it is not he. For I
verily believe I know who you mean,
though it never was yet my fortune
to be in his company, and I least of
all desire it now. For he is a person
very inconversable, and, as they say,
an imperious Dictatour of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Vice, and impatient of all
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55306:24"/>
dispute and contradiction. But this
<hi>Hylobares</hi> is quite of another Genius
and extraction; one that is as great a
<hi>Moralist</hi> on this side rigour and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of life, as he is a <hi>Materialist,</hi> and
of a kind and friendly nature.</p>

                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>That is not incredible: For
I see no reason why a Soul that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
immersed into this mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
or corporeall Dispensation may
not in the main be as solid a <hi>Moralist</hi>
as a <hi>Mathematician.</hi> For the chief

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55306:24"/>
it shall please God to recover his

For even <hi>Moral Honesty</hi> it self is
part of the Law of God, and an adum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the <hi>Divine life.</hi> So that when
Regeneration has more throughly il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated
his Understanding, I doubt
not but that he will fall into that pious
admiration and speech of the ancient
Patriarch,<note place="margin">Gen. 28. 16</note> 
                     <hi>Verily God was in this place,

all his Appearances, and bid a

                  <p>But besides the goodness of

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>It was more fitting that we

us. But we have been here but a

                  <p>A very little while indeed;
but now our Company is doubled, so
little will be twice as little again. I
am very much transported to see my
little Arbour scored with such choice
Guests. But that mine own Worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness

spoils the conceit, I could
think our Company parallel to the

                  <p>I warrant the <hi>Septenary</hi> will

                  <p>You are so transported with

                  <p>That is soon recounted. I

                  <p>I did early provide for our

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>There's to gratifie your Tast
then, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> besides the delicacy
of these ripe Fruit, which recreate
also the Nostrils with their Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
sent; as also does the sweet smell
of the Eglantines and Hony-suckles
that cover my Arbour.</p>

                  <p>Is there any thing more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
to the Touch then the soft

                  <p>Mirth and Chearfulness,
O <hi>Sophron,</hi> are but the due reward
of Innocency of life; which, if any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
I believe is to be found in
your manner of living, who do not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55306:27"/>
quit the World out of any <hi>Hypocrisie,
Sullenness,</hi> or <hi>Superstition,</hi> but out of
a sincere love of true Knowledge and
Vertue. But as for the pretty war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of the Birds, or that greater
skill of <hi>Hylobares</hi> on the Flagellet, I
must take the liberty to profess, that
it is not that kind of Musick that will
gain my Attention at this time, when
I see so many able and knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
met together; but the pursuance
of some instructive Argument free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and indifferently managed for the
finding out of the Truth. Nothing
so musicall to my ears as this.</p>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>But I am the more eager,
because I would not lose so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
an opportunity of improving
my Knowledg. For I never met with
the like advantage before, nor am
likely again to meet with it, unless
I meet with the same Company.</p>

                  <p>Well then, let us for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
sake consider onely the severall
kinds of Animals: which, beside the
Usefulness of some of them especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and more appropriately to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
(as the Dog and the Horse for
Services, and Oxen and Sheep for
his Food) their external Shapes are
notoriously accommodated to that
Law or guise of life that Nature has
designed them; as in general the
Birds for flying, the Fish for swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
and the Beasts for running on
the ground; the external frame and
covering of their Bodies are exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitely
fitted for these purposes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what also is very general, that
contrivance of Male and Female for
Propagation, and that notable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Fishes and Birds being ovi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous,
that there might be the more
full supply for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> great Havock
that would be necessarily made upon
those kind of Creatures by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
enemies. To these you may
add the instinct of Birds in building
their Nests and sitting on their Eggs;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:55306:34"/>
the due number and position of the
Organs of Sense and peculiar Arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of Creatures, with the instinct
of using them: That those Fowls
that frequent the Waters, and onely
wade, have as well long Legs as long
Necks; and those that are made for
swimming have Feet like Oars: and
that no Birds have Paps, as Beasts
have. All which things, and infinite
more, do plainly argue the accuracy
of Design in their framing.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>Things are, I must confess,
as if they were plainly designed to
be so.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>But to put an end to these
Instances, which, as you said, a whole
Age would not suffice to enumerate;
the inward Anatomie and use of
Parts in many thousand kinds of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals
is as sure a demonstration of
a very-curiously contrived Design in
each of these Animals Bodies, as the
severall Figures and Demonstrations
in the above-named Book of <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes</hi>
are of the Writer's purpose of
concluding the Truth of each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:55306:34"/>
to which they appertain.
That in Man's Body is notorious.
The fabrick of the Eye, its safe and
usefull situation, the superaddition of
Muscles, and the admirable contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of the Flesh of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in a manner into that usefull Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization;
those of the Larynx for
Speech and Singing; the industrious
perforation of the Tendons of the
second Joints both of Fingers and
Toes, and the drawing of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons
of the third Joints through
them; the Ventricles of the Heart
and their <hi>Valvulae,</hi> as also the <hi>Valvulae</hi>
of the Veins; the fabrick of these,
and the apparently-designed Use of
them, and of a thousand more, not
onely in Man, but analogically in the
rest of Animals, are as certain a
pledge of the Existence of a God,
as any Voice or Writing that contains
such Specimens of Reason as are in
<hi>Archimedes</hi> his Treatise are an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the existence of some man
or Angel that must be the Authour of
them.</p>

                  <p>The weight of Reason and
the vehemence of <hi>Philotheus</hi> his Zeal
does for the present bear me down
into this belief whether I will or no.
For I easily feel the force of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing
from these few Hints, having
perused the latest Treatises of this
Subject, and being sufficiently versed
in Anatomicall History; which, I
must confess, urges upon me, more

                  <p>Which belief, methinks,
you should never be able to stagger
in, if you consider that in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
kinds of living Creatures, none
of them are made foolishly or inept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
no not so much as those that are
gendered of Putrefaction. So that
you have infinite examples of a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

that these things cannot come

they not be the effects of Necessary

Law of the Motion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
As a Line proportionally cut, if
the greater Segment subtends an <hi>Iso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceles</hi>
whose <hi>Crura</hi> each of them are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to the whole Line, each Angle

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>But what does this prove,
whenas there is no necessity in the
matter that any Line should be so
cut, or, if it were, that any two
Lines of equal length with the whole
should clap in with the greater Seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to make such a Triangle, much
less to inscribe a Quinquangle into a

matter should frame an exact <hi>Icosaë<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drum</hi>
or <hi>Dodecaëdrum,</hi> whose fabrick
much depends on this proportional
section of a Line, as you may see in
<hi>Euclide?</hi> And yet there is a more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifarious
Artifice in the structure of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:55306:36"/>
the meanest Animal. I tell thee, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobares,</hi>
there is nothing necessarily
in Matter that looks like an Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual

No, the necessary and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

thy Minde is the Image of the

it had been stript from it long before

                  <p>It should seem so; and that
the motion of Matter is not guided

                  <p>That seems very evident
from light things that rise up in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
As for example in a deep Bucket
of water, where we will suppose a
thin round Board forced to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
of almost the same wideness
that the Bucket is: the water of the
Bucket we will suppose so heavy, that
scarce two men shall be able to bear
it. Now tell me, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> how this
thin Board does get to the top, so
massie a weight lying on it. The
whole water that lies upon it does
actually press downward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rather presses it down, then helps
it up.</p>

                  <p>It may be the weight of the
water gets by the sides under it, and
so bears it up by its own sinking.</p>

                  <p>That is ingeniously at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,
<hi>Hylobares.</hi> But you must
consider that the water that lies upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55306:39"/>
the Board to press it down is, it may
be, forty times more then that which
you conceive to press betwixt the
rim of the round Board and the
Vessel.</p>

                  <p>He thinks he has solved all
<hi>mechanically</hi> he treats of. But, to
deal freely, I finde none of his Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

not his formation of Suns, Stars nor

of the Magnetick particles; not
his Hypothesis of the Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux
of the Sea; not the figure and
colours of the Rainbow; not the
Winds, nor Clouds, nor Rain, nor
Thunder: neither of these, nor of
any other <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> has he given
sufficient Mechanicall causes. Nay, I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55306:39"/>
will adde at once, That that simplest
and first Hypothesis of his,<note place="margin">Princip. Philos. part. 3. sect. 46, 47.</note> That all
the Matter of the Universe was first
cast into small parts equal in motion
and magnitude, and that hence the
Suns or Stars and <hi>Vortices</hi> arose in
the distinction of the Matter (by the
mutual fridging of those Particles one
against another) into the first and
second Element, I will adde, I say,
That this first Original of things is
most grosly repugnant to the actual
proportion of these Elements one to
another. For from this Mechanicall
way, so stated as he has declared, it
will follow that the Sun overflows
the Orbit of <hi>Saturn</hi> no less then ten
millions four hundred eighty four
thousand Semidiameters of the Earth:
which one would think were inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
sufficient to give us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,

in the works of Nature, and
cuts off the most powerfull and most

the Demonstrations to the contrary

you are much transported with the

that your mere desire should thus
confidently present them to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

conceive there is far more pleasure
in clearly and demonstratively dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
that they are not, then
there would be if it were discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
that they are. And that way of

his comparing of the Volume of

annexed to each Proposition

Demonstration of them is not a more

Agent, then an hundred thousand
single fabricks of Matter here in the

and his ways then that they are <hi>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,</hi>
is to encourage the Atheist,
and yield him the day; for that is the

in, that he is secure there is neither
head nor foot in the Mysteries of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55306:49"/>

                  <p>I desire onely so to understand

                  <p>I believe <hi>Philotheus</hi> will make
this good, that nothing is truly attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to God but what is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
existent in the world, whether
we understand it or not; and that
there is nothing in the world truly in
such circumstances as are repugnant
to the Attributes of God.</p>

                  <p>I conceive <hi>Bathynous</hi> means
this, that unless we will entangle our
selves with making good some ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Attributes of God, or defend his
Providence upon false suppositions
and circumstances, there will be no
greater entanglements touching the
Notion of God and his Providence,
then there would be in the nature of
those things we are sure do exist,
though there were no God in the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55306:49"/>
world. Wherefore, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> let me
advise you to this, since you have
such fast and certain hold of the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of the Deity by the repeated
effects thereof in Nature, not to let
that hold goe upon any grounds that
are uncertain or false. For the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
declares nothing contradictious
touching the Nature of God: nor is
there any humane Authority that has
any right to be believed when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
Contradictions: nor are we
bound to burthen the Notion of a
Deity with any thing we are not assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
implies Perfection. These Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
if we use, no man, I think, need
be much entangled in his thoughts
touching the Nature of the Deity.</p>

more chearfully propound my Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
which are drawn from these
five Heads; from the <hi>Eternity</hi> of God,
from his <hi>Immutability,</hi> from his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisciency,</hi>
his <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and his <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresencie.</hi>
For, to my understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
the very Notion of <hi>Eternity</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:55306:50"/>
implies a Contradiction, as some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it, namely, That it is an essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
presence of all things with God,
as well of things past, present, as to
come; and that the Duration of God
is all of it, as it were, <hi>in one steddy

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or <hi>Instant at once.</hi>
If there cannot be a God, but he must
be in such a sense as this eternall, the
Contemplation of his <hi>Idea</hi> will more
forcibly pull a man back from the
belief of his Existence, then his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
in Nature draw a man to it. For
what can be more contradictious,
then that all things should have been
really and essentially with God from
all Eternity at once, and yet be born
in time and succession? For the reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and essence of corporeall things is
corporeall; and those very individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Trees and Animals that are said to
be generated, and are seen to grow
from very little Principles, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
it seems, in their full form and
growth: which is a perfect repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to my Understanding. For it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
that the same thing that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55306:50"/>
ready in being may, notwithstanding,
while it is, be produced of a-fresh.
That eternall duration should be at
once, is also to me utterly unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
and that one <hi>permanent Instant</hi>
should be commensurate, or rather
equal, to all successions of Ages. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
if the Duration of God be all
at once, sith no Agent acts but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compass of its own Duration,
God must both create and destroy
the World at once. Whence it seems
impossible that eternall Duration
should be indistant to it self, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
continuation of Intervalls.</p>

against that Notion of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

of common Sense and Reason. If we
may charitably guess at what they
would be at in this so lofty a Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
it may be it is onely this, That
the whole Evolution of Times and

is so collectedly and presentifickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented
to God at once, as if all

                  <p>Yes surely; and not har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to conceive how Continuity of
Duration is also competible to the
Divine Existence, as well as <hi>Eternity</hi>
or <hi>Life eternall,</hi> which comprehends
the <hi>Idea's</hi> of all Things and Ages at

is as a vast Globe wholly moved on

of a steady Rock by which a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
slides; the standing of the Rock,
as well as the sliding of the River, has
a Continuity of Duration. And no

to Time then so; that is to
say, the Comprehension of the Evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of all Times, Things and

                  <p>It may be out of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
as if that whose Existence was
successive would necessarily break
off, or at least may hazard to fail,
one part of successive Duration ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no dependence on another. But
it is a mere Panick fear: For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation
of Duration is necessary
where the Existence of the thing is
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55306:52"/>
so. And such is manifestly the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence
of God from his own <hi>Idea.</hi>

                  <p>And this <hi>necessary Existence</hi>
of God I conceive to be the most
substantial Notion of his eternall Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
which cannot well be said to
be <hi>successive</hi> properly and formally,
but onely virtually and applicatively;
that is to say, it contains in it <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi>
all the successive Duration ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
and is perpetually <hi>applicable</hi>
to the succeeding parts thereof, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
always present thereto, as the
Chanel of a River to all the water
that passes through it; but the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
is in no such successive defluxion,
though the water be. Such is the
steddy and permanent Duration of
the necessary Existence of God in
respect of all successive Durations
whatsoever.</p>

                  <p>I say that <hi>successive Duration</hi>
properly so called is incompetible to
God, as being an Essence <hi>necessarily</hi>

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:55306:52"/>
but the most infinite <hi>successive</hi>
Duration that you can imagine will
be found to have a beginning. For
what-ever is past was sometime pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent:
And therefore there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of all this infinite Succession but
was sometime present, the most-infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely-remote
moment thereof was
sometime present: Which most-in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely-remote
moment was the <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
terminans</hi> thereof, which plainly
shews it had a beginning.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>You say true, <hi>Bathynous.</hi>
There must be a <hi>most-remote Moment</hi>
in Succession, and a most-infinitely-remote
one in infinite Succession. But
being the most-infinitely-remote Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
cannot be <hi>Terminus copulans,</hi>
there being nothing for it to couple
with future Succession, and therefore
it being <hi>Terminus terminans,</hi> and of
necessity having been once <hi>present,</hi> it
is plain that at that present was the
term or beginning of this infinite sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
Succession.</p>
                  <p>Or briefly thus, to prevent all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
Exceptions against the <hi>most</hi>-infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely-remote
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55306:53"/>
Moment in an <hi>infinite</hi>
Succession, as if they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I
would rather argue on this manner;
<hi>viz.</hi> That forasmuch as all the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<hi>past</hi> in infinite Succession were
sometime <hi>present,</hi> it thence plainly
follows that all the Moments in this
infinite Succession, or at least all but
one, were sometime to come. And
if either all these Moments, or all but
one, were sometime to come, it is
manifest that the whole Succession
(or at least the whole bating but one
Moment) was sometime to come,
and therefore had a beginning. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the strength of your reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
very well. And therefore when
I spake of the successive Duration of
God, I did not mean Succession in
that <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>formal</hi> sense, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a virtual, applicative or relative
Succession; as you might gather from
some passages or expressions in my
speaking thereof. The Duration of
<hi>God</hi> is like that of a <hi>Rock,</hi> but the
Duration of <hi>natural things</hi> like that
of a <hi>River;</hi> their Succession passes
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55306:53"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as <hi>Heraclitus</hi> speaks. And
therefore they that give <hi>successive</hi>
Duration properly so called to the
steddy Permanency of a necessary
Self-existence, seem like those that
phansie the Shore to move by reason
of the motion of the Ship.

               </sp>
               <p>We apply our own fluid successive
Duration to the steddy Permanency
of the eternall Duration of God:
whose Duration, though steddy and
permanent, and without all defluxion
and succession, (as being indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but his <hi>necessary Self-exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence)</hi>
is notwithstanding such as
the most infinite <hi>successive</hi> Duration
<hi>past</hi> can never reach beyond, nor <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

that though the eternall Duration of
God be really <hi>permanent,</hi> yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be an <hi>indivisible Instant,</hi>
and to be perfectly and in all regards

                  <p>But farther to corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
it, answer me but this one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>Hylobares.</hi> Is it not necessary
that that part of the representation
you made of Eternity be either a
<hi>Perfection,</hi> or an <hi>Imperfection,</hi> or a
thing of <hi>Indifferency?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>That cannot be deny'd.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>If it be an <hi>Imperfection,</hi> it
is to be removed, and so the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is removed therewith: If an <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency,</hi>
it is in different whether you
remove it or not: If a <hi>Perfection,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it is not impossible, as you
cannot but acknowledge, no man
need hesitate, nay he ought not, but
to attribute it to God. So that be
your fate what it will in the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of your assent to any of these
three parts, it can be no impediment
to the belief of God's Existence.
This is the thing that made your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
seem so considerable to you,
that you did not consider, that
though all those Voices and Sights
are perceived in the Divine Being at
once, yet they are per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the most dexterous art in facilitating
our adherence to the belief of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity

have but one Scruple more touching
God's Eternity, and I will pass to the
next Attribute. The eternall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of God's Existence seems to
imply a Contradiction. For unless e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

the whole cannot be infinite. And if
every denominated part, suppose the

be infinite, there are so many Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>I understand you very
well. But you must consider that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God has been <hi>ab aeterno,</hi> or the
World has been so. Wherefore
something being so certainly eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
it is no repugnancy that God be
so. So that you see there is no more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:55306:57"/>
perplexity or difficulty on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of God's being, then if he were
not in the world, according to the
last of my preliminary Advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Nay, indeed, the most inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricable
Perplexity of all would be
to admit a World <hi>ab aeterno</hi> without
God. For an eternall Flux of Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Matter would be eternall
<hi>Succession</hi> properly so called; which
<hi>Bathynous</hi> shrewdly suggested to be
impossible. And if it ever rested,
and afterwards was moved, there
must be a first Mover distinct from
the Matter. Which seems necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to inferr there is a God; and the
rather, because if Matter was of it
self, it must eternally have rested be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it moved.</p>

the next Attribute, <hi>Hylobares:</hi> for I
am hugely pleased to see the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of <hi>Philotheus.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">XVIII.</note>
which seems to me a necessary Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of God,<note place="margin">The Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability.</hi>
                     </note> forasmuch as <hi>Mutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
implies Imperfection. But here
humane understanding does seem to
be caught in this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> That ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we must acknowledge a mutable
God, or an immutable one: If the
former, he is not properly God; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God excludes all Imperfection
in his nature: If the latter, he is not
to be worshipped; for all the good
that was to come will come without
our worshipping him; and none of
the evil can be kept off by all our
Services, because he is <hi>immutable.</hi>
Wherefore we must either grant an
imperfect God, or a God not to be
worshipped: either of which is so
absurd, that it seems forcibly to sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
that there is no God at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>This seems a smart <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma</hi>
at first, <hi>Hylobares;</hi> yet I think
neither Horn is strong enough to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55306:58"/>
push us off from our belief of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of a God. But for my part, I
will bear the push of the former of
them, and grant that God is <hi>mutable;</hi>
but deny that all <hi>Mutability</hi> implies
Imperfection, though some does, as
that Vacillancy in humane Souls, and
such Mutations as are found in corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
matter. But such a Mutability as
whose absence implies an impotency
to or incapacity of the most noble
acts imaginable, such as the Creation
of the World, and the administration
of Justice to men and Angels, is so far
from being any Defect, that it is a
very high Perfection. For this power
in God to act upon the Creature in
<hi>time,</hi> to succour or chastise it, does
not at all discompose or distract him
from what he is in himself in the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
calmness and stilness of his all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensive
<hi>Eternity,</hi> his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
being absolutely free and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite.
So that they that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
this power of acting in time an
imminution to the Perfection of God

as if one should contend that

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>And that you may be the
more throughly convinced of the
weakness of your <hi>Biaion,</hi> I will bear
the push of the latter Horn, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that the <hi>Immutability</hi> of God
would imply that he is not to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped.
For what is the Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of God but the acknowledging
those supereminent and Divine Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies
in him to which the World
owes its Conservation and Subsistence,
and from which is that beautifull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and wise Contrivance of things
in the Universe? It is therefore a
piece of indispensable Justice to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
this rich Fountain and
Original of all Good, and not the less,
because he is so perfectly good, that
he cannot be nor act otherwise, but
is immutably such. Besides that this
Praise and Adoration done to him are
actions perfective of our own Souls,
and in our approches to him he is
made nearer to us; as the opening of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:55306:59"/>
our Eyes is the letting in of the light
of the Sun.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>What you say, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> I
must confess will hold good in that
part of Worship which consists in
Praising of God: but I do not see
how his <hi>Immutability</hi> will well consist
with our Praying to him. For things
will be or will not be whether we
pray unto him or no.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>But you do not consider,
that though this were, yet our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to him is an acknowledgment of
his being the great Benefactour of
mankinde; and it is like Children
asking their Fathers Blessing, who
yet would <hi>pray to God to bless them</hi>
whether they ask it or no. Besides
that while we pray to God for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
good things, for Grace, Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and Vertue, we do <hi>ipso facto</hi>
open our Souls to receive the Divine
Influence, which flows into our
Hearts according to the measure of
the depth and earnestness of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.
Which is, as I said, like the
opening of our Eyes to receive the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:55306:59"/>
light of the Sun. Nor do we alter or
change the will of God in this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it is the permanent and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
will of God, that as many as
make their due Addresses to him shall
receive proportionable Comfort and
Influence from him. And, lastly, for
externall good things, though we
should imagine God still resting in
the immutable <hi>Sabbatism</hi> of his own
ever-blessed <hi>Eternity,</hi> and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is done in this world <hi>ad extra</hi>
but by either natural or free created
Agents, either good men or those
more high and holy orders of Angels,
that are as the Ears and Eyes and
Arms of God, as <hi>Philo</hi> somewhere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuates,
and who are so steddily and
fully actuated by the Spirit of God,
that they will do the very same things
that God himself would doe if he
were to act <hi>ad extra</hi> in the affairs of
the world: upon this Hypothesis of
things, notwithstanding the Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of God, it implies no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity
to pray unto him. For he does
not onely hear and behold all things
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55306:60"/>
at once, but has eternally and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
laid such trains of Causes in the
world, and so rules the good Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
and over-rules the bad, that no
man that prays unto him as he ought
shall fail of obtaining what is best for
him, even in externall matters.</p>

that he may chuse which part he will,

and indeed is a contradiction to

to foresee a thing as certain even

                  <p>You do more then satisfie me

                  <p>That is shrewdly urged
and seasonably. But you are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand,
that so much Liberty as is
in Man will leave room enough for
millions of certain Predictions, if
God thought fit to communicate
them so throngly to the world. For
though I question not but that the
Souls of men are in some sense free;
yet I do as little doubt but there are
or may be infinite numbers of Actions
wherein they are as certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
as the brute Beasts. And such
are the Actions of all those that are
deeply lapsed into Corruption, and of
those few that are grown to a more
Heroicall state of Goodness: It is
certainly foreknowable what they
will doe in such and such circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Not to adde, that the Divine
Decrees, when they finde not men

Prophecies are peremptory or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditionate.</p>

                  <p>What <hi>Philotheus</hi> has hitherto
argued for the reconciling of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Omniscience with the Notion of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55306:63"/>
Man's Free will and the nature of
Sin, bears along with it a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
plainness and plausibleness for
its easiness to the understanding. But
in my apprehension, for all it looks
so repugnantly that there should be
a certain foreknowledge of what is
free and uncertain, yet it seems more
safe to allow that Privilege to the
infinite Understanding of God, then
to venture at all to circumscribe his
Omniscience. For though it may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be said, that he does not know any
thing that <hi>really</hi> implies a Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to be known; yet we are not
assured but that may seem a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to us that is not so really in it
self. As for example, To our finite
Understanding a Quadrate whose
Diagonial is commensurate to one of
the Sides is a plain Contradiction, and
we conceit we can demonstrate it to
be so, that is to say, that the <hi>Ratio</hi> of
the one to the other is unconceivable
and undefinable. But dare any one
be so bold as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ffirm that the Divine
Intellect it self, whose Comprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55306:64"/>
is infinite, cannot define to it self
the <hi>Ratio</hi> of a Diagonial Line in a
Quadrate to the Side thereof? The
Application is very obvious.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>It is so, <hi>Bathynous.</hi> For I
suppose in brief you mean this; That
as the Diagonial Line and Side of a
Quadrate, which to our apprehension
are incommensurate, are yet commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable
to the infinite Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Divine Intellect; so a certain
and infallible Prescience of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Futurities, that seems inconsistent
to us, may notwithstanding be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
abundantly consistent by
the all-comprehensive Understanding
of God. A very safe and sober Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the present Difficulty. I am
very well contented it should be so,
<hi>Bathynous,</hi> and that what I have offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

                  <p>That may very well be. But
then they had not that true and

most Philosophers have in this Age:
but it is likely they understood no

may be true. But to say it is properly
a subtile Body, is to acknowledge it

which is too mean a conception of
the Majesty of God. Besides that it is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55306:65"/>
unconceivable how these loose
Atoms, which are so independent of
one another, should joyn together
to make up the Godhead; or how
they do conspire to keep together,
that there is not a dissolution of the
Divinity. Or thus: If this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Divine Atoms be God, be they
interspersed amongst all the matter
of the World? or do they keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
If they be dispersed, God
is less one then any thing else in the
World, and is rather an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Deities then one God or any
God; and this infinite number in an
incapacity of conferring notes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
so wise a frame of the Universe
as we see. But if there be one <hi>Conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
of Divine Atomes that keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
in which of those infinite
numbers of <hi>Vortices</hi> is it seated, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which? or how can it order

which it is so far distant? or how a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
do these Atomes, though not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terspersed,
communicate Notions one

                  <p>These Experiments indeed
strike very strongly on the Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

And now methinks I could wish
the <hi>nature</hi> of a Spirit were more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55306:68"/>
to me then it is, that I might

cannot but know thus much of it,
whether I will or no, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
extended, or not extended; I

has no <hi>Amplitude</hi> or Extension, the
ridiculous Hypothesis of the Schools

for ought I know, may dance
on a Needle's point, or rather, they,
having no <hi>Amplitude,</hi> would be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
If they have any <hi>Amplitude</hi>

as that admired Wit <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidly

                  <p>It is much, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> that
you should give such an adamantine

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55306:68"/>
Assertion as this of <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi> For
though it be wittily supposed by him,
for a ground of more certain and
Mathematicall after-Deductions in
his Philosophy; yet it is not at all
proved, that Matter and Extension
are reciprocally the same, <hi>as well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

Matter extended.</hi> This is but an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>start
conceit of this present Age. The

as much for a <hi>Vacuum</hi> as for <hi>Atomes.</hi>
And certainly the world has hitherto
been very idle, that have made so
many Disputes and try'd so many
Experiments whether there be any
<hi>Vacuum</hi> or no, if it be so demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
concludible, as <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>
would bear us in hand, that it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Contradiction there should be
any. The ground of the Demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lies so shallow and is so obvious,

                  <p>If Motion were a thing that

forasmuch as I easily conceive
that, if God were exterminated as

this Extension you talk so magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
of would to my deluded phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
seem necessarily to remain. But
if there were no God nor Matter,
there would be nothing. Which is a

                  <p>This is cunningly fetch'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
O <hi>Cuphophron.</hi> But if you
well consider things, this Fetch of
yours, which seems to be against me,
is really for me. For in that you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
that while you conceive
God exterminated out of the World,
this Extension does notwithstanding
remain, it is but an Indication of
what is true, that the conception of
God's being exterminated out of the
World implies a Contradiction, as
most certainly it does. For no Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
that is exterminable can be the
Essence of God, forasmuch as his
Essence implies necessary Existence.
Wherefore that God which you did
exterminate, that is to say, conceived
exterminable, was a figment of your
own: but that Extension which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
to you whether you will or no,
is really and indentifically coincident
with the Amplitude of the Essence of
God. Whence we may see not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the folly, but the impiety, of the
other Position, which would trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
that main Prerogative of God,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55306:76"/>
I mean his necessary Existence, upon
Matter, upon pretence that whatever
is extended must be such; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
necessarily exterminate God out
of the Universe with as many as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive any thing to be but
what is extended, that is to say, has

                     <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> and I doubt not but I shall

more then Phancy in those arguings.
I will appeal to your <hi>Reason,</hi> your
<hi>Imagination,</hi> and your <hi>Sense.</hi> What
therefore is it, O <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
a Figure, as the Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
speak, but to draw some <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum</hi>
or some point of it through the
parts of some other <hi>Extensum,</hi> so that
the parts are passed through of that
<hi>Extensum</hi> in which the Figure is said
to be described?</p>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>This to gratifie your <hi>Reason.</hi>
But farther too to caress your <hi>Sense</hi>
and <hi>Phancy,</hi> let us imagine for that
wooden Cylinder a glass one, with a
red Line in it for its <hi>Axis,</hi> and from
the top of this <hi>Axis,</hi> another red Line
drawn down to the Peripherie of the
<hi>Basis;</hi> which Lines would be visible
to your very sight through the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent
Glass.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>A fine thing to play with,
<hi>Hylobares;</hi> what then?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>I would have you play with
such a thing, O <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> but in
such sort, as to make it turn swiftly
upon its <hi>Axis.</hi> And there will appear
to your very sight a red <hi>Conicum,</hi> like
the usual shape of an Extinguisher.
If the Line were blew, it would be
like it something in colour as well as
figure. This I conceive (for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
try'd it, nor thought of it before
now) you might distinctly see in
the Glass.</p>

                  <p>You answer what is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>Cuphophron,</hi> and against your
first concession. For the red Line
does not pass through the parts of

them, and therefore cannot describe

                  <p>I am cast upon the same An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers

it is the <hi>Idea</hi> of a possible <hi>Extensum,</hi>
which indeed the glass-Cylinder actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally is.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>That is to say, It is the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
or individual possible <hi>Idea</hi> of
that <hi>Extensum</hi> which the glass-Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is actually.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>It is that, or else I confess I
know not what it is. It is a mockery
of the minde, it is a troublesome Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>But you do not mean any <hi>Idea</hi>
in our Brain by this possible <hi>Idea.</hi> For
the red Line that describes the <hi>Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum</hi>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore I must mean the

                  <p>But is not the actual descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing

which this particular Cylinder is

but this Cylinder removable from
it even while it does exist. How
can it then be that particular pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<hi>Extensum</hi> which the Cylinder
is actually? But admit it could be,
and let this Cylinder be removed
from this possible immovable <hi>Exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi>
and another Cylinder of the

Now this second Cylinder is <hi>actually</hi>
that particular <hi>Extensum</hi> which still
the same individual possible <hi>Extensum</hi>
is or was <hi>potentially.</hi> And so both the
first and second Cylinders are one and
the same individual Cylinder: For
one <hi>individual Possibility</hi> can afford no

nothing else but that Matter has

so that of it self it would be

                  <p>That is easily understood

move together in one hard piece, the

indeed Separation is so.</p>

                  <p>Very right. And have you

of these Attributes as of the other?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>I will try. By the <hi>Self-unity</hi> of
a Spirit I understand a Spirit to be
<hi>immediately</hi> and <hi>essentially one,</hi> and to
want no other <hi>Vinculum</hi> to hold the
parts together but its own essence
and existence; whence it is of its
own nature <hi>indiscerpible.</hi>

               <sp>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>This I am carried to by my
Reason. But methinks my Imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
boggles and starts back, and brings
me into a suspicion that it is the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a thing that cannot be. For
how can an extended Substance be
indivisible or indiscerpible? For <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55306:83"/>
extended it must be divisible.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>It is true, it is <hi>intellectually</hi>
divisible, but <hi>Physically</hi> indiscerpible.
Therefore this is the fallacy your
Phancy puts upon you, that you
make <hi>Indivisibility</hi> and <hi>Indiscerpibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
all one. What is <hi>intellectually</hi> divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
may be <hi>Physicall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>
                     </hi> indivisible or
indiscerpible: as it is manifest in the
nature of God, whose very <hi>Idea</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
Indiscerpibility, the contrary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so plain an Imperfection. For
whatsoever is discerpible is also mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable:
But nothing is movable but
must be conceived to move in that
which is a necessary and immovable
Essence, and which will necessarily
be, though there were nothing else
in the world: which therefore must be
the holy Essence of God, as <hi>Bathyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>
has very well noted already, and
seems to have light upon the true

sought for above the Heavens, but

Wherefore at length to

Contradiction, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> that the

                  <p>He does indeed say so,

                  <p>I understand an active power
in a Spirit, whereby it either modifies
it self according to its own nature, or
moves the Matter regularly according
to some certain Modifications it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
upon it, uniting the <hi>Physicall
Monads</hi> into particles of such magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and figure, and guiding them in
such Motions as answer the end of the
spiritual Agent, either conceived by
it or incorporated into it. Whence
there appears, as was said, the reason
why both <hi>Disunity</hi> and <hi>Inactivity</hi>
should belong to Matter.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>Very accurately and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly
answered, <hi>Hylobares.</hi> You are

have thought of these Notions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>I have read something of them.
But your dexterous defining the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of <hi>Matter</hi> might of it self
make me a little more chearfully nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
at defining those of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
now I can close with the belief
of its Existence, which I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doe heartily before. And for the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:55306:85"/>
last Attribute, which seemed to me
the most puzzling, I mean that of
<hi>Self-penetrability,</hi> it is now to me as
easie a Notion as any: and I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
nothing else by it, but that
different Spirits may be in the
same space, or that one and the same
may draw its Extension into a lesser
compass, and so have one part of its
essence lie in the same space with
some others: By which power it is
able to dilate or contract it self. This
I easily conceive may be a Property
of any created and finite Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Extension of no Spirit is
corporeall.</p>

                  <p>Very true. But did you

<hi>Sympathy</hi> from the Capacity

I cannot but collect that it is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> or <hi>Incorporeall</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
And I understand by this <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy,</hi>
not a mere <hi>Compassivity,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a <hi>Coactivity</hi> of the Spirit in which
it does reside: which I conceive to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55306:86"/>
be of great use in all <hi>perceptive</hi> Spirits.
For in virtue of this Attribute, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
or in what-ever circumstances
they are affected in one part, they
are after the same manner affected in
all. So that if there were a percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Spirit of an infinite Amplitude
and of an infinite exaltedness of
<hi>Sympathy,</hi> where-ever any percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Energie emerges in this infinite
Spirit, it is suddenly and necessarily
in all of it at once. For I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
<hi>Philotheus,</hi> I have often thought
of these Notions heretofore, but
could never attribute them to a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
because I could not believe there
was any such thing as a Spirit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch
as all Extension seemed to me
to be corporeall. But your Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial

I mean the <hi>essential</hi> Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presency
of God. For attending to
the infinite Perfection of God accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his <hi>Idea,</hi> I cannot but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Essence to be infinite, and
therefore that he is essentially present
every-where. And for those that
would circumscribe the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
I would ask them, how they
can make his Essence finite, and his
Attributes infinite; or to what extent
they conceive him circumscribed. To
confine him to a Point were intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
ridiculous. And to pretend that
the amplifying of his Essence beyond
this were any advantage or Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
were plainly to acknowledge that
the taking away his essential Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresency
is to attribute to him an
infinite Imperfection. For any Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscription
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:55306:87"/>
implies an infinite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
These considerations, O <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
force me to believe that God is
essentially Omnipresent, and that he
pervades all things, even to all infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
imaginable spaces. But when I
have thus concluded with my self, I
am cast off again with a very rude
and importune check, as if this were
to draw down the Divinity into miry
Lakes and Ditches and worse-sented
places, and to be as unmannerly in

who, upon pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolling
the Nature of God above the
capacity of being so much debased as
to be present with any thing that is

wits to the utmost extent to lift the

they insinuating that which cannot

which is no-where is not at all.

                  <p>It might; but this in the

How that that Atheisticall Plot laid
against the Existence of God in that
bold Assertion, [That there can be no
Extension or Amplitude, but it must
necessarily be Matter] being defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Notion of the <hi>essential Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipresence</hi>
of God, to make sure work,
and to baffle the Truth, they raised
this <hi>sublime</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> Fiction, that
in stead of <hi>God's being every-where,</hi>
according to the universal Opinion of
all sober men, that his Nature is such
that <hi>he can be no-where:</hi> without
which far-fetch'd Subterfuge they
could never have born two faces un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
one hood, and play'd the <hi>Atheist</hi>
and <hi>Deist</hi> at once, professing God was
no-where, and yet that he was.</p>

                  <p>Is this your Sagacity or deep
Melancholy, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> that makes
you surmize such Plots against the
Deity? For I have no more Plot
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55306:92"/>
against God, then against my own
Soul, which I hold to be a Spirit.
And I hold God to be no-where, not
as he is God, but as he is an Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

that they are now-where.</p>

<hi>some-where.</hi>

                  <p>That which is no-where can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be in the midst of any things. It
is onely the Body that is in the midst
of those Objects, which obtrudes

she thinks herself to be in the midst
of them, whenas indeed she is not.</p>

are but the Instruments whereby
the Soul perceives those distant Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

herself must needs be where the

do concentre. Nay indeed the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of any single Motion through

For how can that which is

Souls to be nearer and farther

it is vitally united onely to one.</p>

                  <p>That is a captious question.
For whether I say to the inside or to

                  <p>O <hi>Hylobares,</hi> there be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
Reasons of this seeming Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox,
if they meet with a minde ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of them: but the chief are
these two. First, In that the Minde
of man thinks of such things as are
no-where, as of many <hi>Moral, Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi>
and <hi>Mathematicall</hi> Truths, which
being of the nature to be no-where,
the Minde that conceives them must
be necessarily no-where also. The
second, In that <hi>Cogitation,</hi> as Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is <hi>ipso facto</hi> exempted or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinded
from all Extension. For
though we doubt whether there be
any Matter or any Extended thing in
the world, yet we are even then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
that we are <hi>Recogitantes.</hi> Which
shews that <hi>Cogitation</hi> has nothing at
all to doe with <hi>Extension,</hi> nor has a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Applicability</hi> to it; forasmuch as
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:55306:97"/>
we perceive our selves to think, when
we have not the least thought of any
thing extended. Wherefore our
Thoughts having no <hi>Relation</hi> or <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicability</hi>
to Extension, they have
no Applicability to Place, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
neither they nor our Mindes
are any-where.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>I partly understand what you
would be at, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> but not so
fully as to discover any strength at
all in your Reasonings. The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the first Ground you may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
from hence; That it will as
well follow, that the Soul or Minde
of man is some-where, because it
thinks of things that are some-where,
as that it is no-where, because it thinks
of things that are no-where. Besides
that those things which you say are
no-where are some-where, I mean
those <hi>Moral, Logicall</hi> and <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi>
Truths. For they are in the
Minde or Soul; and the Soul I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
demonstrated, I think, to any
unprejudiced Auditour, to be in the
Body, and the Body you cannot deny
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55306:97"/>
but to be some-where. It is true, some
of those Truths, it may be, as they
are <hi>Representations,</hi> respect neither
Time nor Place; but as they are <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
or <hi>Modes</hi> of a <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
they cannot but be conceived
to be in that Substance. And foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as there is no Substance but has
at least an <hi>essential Amplitude,</hi> they are
in a Substance that is in some sort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and so by virtue of their
Subject must necessarily be conceived
to be some-where. For the Mode of
a thing is inseparate from the Thing
it self.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>But here you run away with
that, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> which I will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
you to assume, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is
a Substance of the Minde or Soul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinct
from <hi>Cogitation.</hi> I say that
<hi>Cogitation</hi> it self is the very Substance
of the Soul, and therefore the Soul is
as much no-where as if it had no sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>But observe, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> that
in your saying that <hi>Cogitation</hi> it self is
the very <hi>Substance</hi> of the Soul, you
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:55306:98"/>
affirm the Soul is a Substance. And
so my Argument returns again upon
you; though the saying the <hi>very O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi>
is the Substance is a manifest
falshood. For the Operations of the
Soul are specifically distinct, and such
specifically distinct Operations suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
one another must be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to your account, so many speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical
Substances succeeding one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
So that your Soul would not
be alwaies the same <hi>specifical Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi>
much less the same <hi>individual;</hi>
then which nothing can be more
wilde and extravagant. Again, the
Soul is accounted a <hi>permanent thing</hi>
by all men, but her Operations are in
<hi>flux</hi> and <hi>succession:</hi> How then can
the Operations be the Soul her self?
or what will become of Memorie?
There is therefore, O <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> a
substance of the Soul as distinct from
its Operations or succeeding Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as the Matter is from the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and Motions that succeed in it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>I am not yet convinced of
that.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:55306:98"/>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>And now for your second
Ground, which would inferr from
our being assured we <hi>think,</hi> while
we doubt whether there be any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
thing in the World, or, it may
be, think of no Extension, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Minds have no <hi>relation</hi> or <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicability</hi>
to any Extension whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
The weakness of this Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
you may easily discover, if you
will but consider, That Intension of
Heat or Motion is considered without
any relation to Extension, and yet it
is related to a Subject extended, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to a burning-hot Iron. And we
think without at all thinking of Time
or of the course of the Sun; and yet
our Thought is applicable to Time,
and by the motion of the Sun may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitively
be said not to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
till such a minute of an hour,
and to have ceased by such a minute.
And there is the same reason of Place
as of Time, that is to say, such a
man's Thoughts may be said defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
to have been conceived in such
a place, as well as within such a time.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55306:99"/>
And, to conclude, it seems a mere
Sophism, to argue from the precision
of our Thoughts, that the Things
themselves are really prescinded one
from another; and it is yet far worse,
to inferr they have not any relation
or applicability one to another. If
they were so unrelated indeed in the
full and adequate apprehension of
them, as well circumstantial as essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
then I confess the Inference might
be sound: But when the Minde is so
set on the Metaphysicall rack as to
pull those things asunder that are
found together in nature, and then
to say they have no relation to one
another, or to leave out by inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
what cannot be excluded from
the perfect <hi>Idea</hi> of s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ch or such a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
all Conclusions from such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
must be like the Principles
themselves, defective or distorted.
And therefore, being so little satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
with <hi>Cuphophron</hi>'s Solution of the
present Difficulty touching the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Omnipresence,</hi> I foresee that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus</hi>
must have the sole honour of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55306:99"/>
fully easing and settling my mind in a
right and rational apprehension of all
the Attributes of God.</p>

                  <p>The honour of that satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

who has given you so quick an

believe you will find it one of the
easiest you have propounded, though
I must confess it may seem odd at the
first sight, as it has done to very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Criticks in Points of Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
who mainly from this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55306:100"/>
that the foul and ill-sented pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Earth are an unfit Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle
of the Divine Presence, have
made bold to confine the Godhead
to the Heavens. Which opinion of
theirs is rather to be imputed to the
nicety of their Sense then to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity
of their Wit. For all those
things that seem so foul and disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in nature are not <hi>really</hi> so in
themselves, but onely <hi>relatively;</hi> and
what is one Creature's <hi>poison</hi> is the
<hi>delight</hi> and <hi>food</hi> of another, and what
is the <hi>death</hi> of the one is the <hi>life</hi> of
the other. So that we may easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
though God has an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of what-ever is, that yet there is
no necessity at all that he should be
disaffected, disgusted, or any way
annoy'd by being present with any
thing: nay rather, that it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
he should, every thing that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
Imperfection being incompeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Divine Essence; so that he
need not withdraw himself from it,
he suffering nothing by immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
residing in it, no more then he can
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55306:100"/>
be <hi>wounded</hi> with <hi>a sword</hi> or <hi>prick'd</hi>
with <hi>a thorn;</hi> and there is the like
reason for any other ingratefull
Sense. For all is to be resolved into
the <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>figure</hi> of the <hi>particles</hi>
of the <hi>Matter</hi> variously impressed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Organs of our Bodies: And
what Unholiness or absolute Defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
can there be in any either <hi>moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
figure,</hi> or <hi>exi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

Wherefore the frame of all natural
things whatsoever, nothing at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
is no less <hi>inoffensive,</hi> no less
<hi>holy,</hi> no less <hi>agreeable</hi> to the <hi>Eternall

no part whereof gives him the least

through all. Whence it appears that
this exception against the Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God is nothing but a fallacy
put upon our own inadvertent
thoughts, while we phansie God li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

So that it is no discouragement to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue

him <hi>extended,</hi> and to me
it is all one to acknowledge an <hi>exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:55306:102"/>
God, and no God at all. For
what-ever is extended, is either Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or as uncapable of Cogitation or
Perception as Matter it self. For if
any entire thing, any Form or Figure
be perceived by what is extended,
nothing in the extended <hi>Percipient</hi>
perceives the whole, but onely part.
Which is a sign that our own Souls
are not extended, much less the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God. But I will not renew
the Dispute.</p>

                  <p>Very easily. Do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
the Notion of <hi>Sympathy,

                  <p>I partly understand you,

at these Notions, we will discourse
some time more fully of them at my

cannot but be fully satisfy'd with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus</hi>

with the consideration, that the

you and <hi>Cuphophron</hi> touching
God's Omnipresence, meet together
and join so strongly in one common

doe sometimes: Of which some pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages

if you will, to these two more
general ones, <hi>The Evils that are in the
World,</hi> and <hi>The defect of Good.</hi> For
when you have senced as well as you
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:55306:107"/>
can, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> and pretty well satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
us that all things here upon
Earth are at least well enough, and
that there is no such Evil discovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as implies the first Principle of
all things not to be the <hi>Sovereign
Goodness;</hi> there is yet this Difficulty
behinde, How it can consist with the
Goodness of God, that this good
Scene of things should begin no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
or spread no farther, that is to
say, that there should be no more
Earths then one, or that this one or
all should have been but six thousand
years ago or thereabout.</p>

dismay'd; I dare pass my word that
nothing that is holy or sacred shall
suffer any detriment by this conflict,
when I have declared the Laws of
the Combate, and what Weapons
we must be confined to, namely to
mere <hi>Reason</hi> and Philosophy. In
which Field I must notwithstanding
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:55306:108"/>
confess that I suspect <hi>Hylobares</hi> will
prove a stout Champion. But it's
much if we be not all able to deal with
him. And forasmuch as it is so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evident from a world of <hi>Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,</hi>
that there is a Principle that
acts out of Wisedom and Counsel, as
was abundantly evidenced by yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's
discourse, and as roundly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged;
it shall be severely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
and exacted of <hi>Hylobares,</hi> That
<hi>he do not oppose false or uncertain Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheses,
or popular Mistakes and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizes,
or vagrant and fictious Stories,
against certain Truth, such as is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable

So that what you bring as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

                  <p>This is ingeniously inferr'd,
O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> so far as it will reach,
namely, to prove there is a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
or Fore-sight of God: but
you seem to forget the main Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in hand, which is, <hi>Whether the
measure of his Providence be his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
and that nothing is transacted
against that Attribute. But your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
seems to imply that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
and wittingly brought Evil into
the World; which seems therefore
the more grossly repugnant to his
<hi>Goodness.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks, Gentlemen, you
are both already agreed in a Point of
so great concernment, namely, That
there is a Divine Providence, that if
there were any modesty in mortal
men they might be content with that
bare discovery, without so strictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
or searching into the Laws
or Measures thereof, but apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:55306:109"/>
to the Law of Life which God
has written in their hearts, or expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in the Holy Writ, that it may go
well with them in the Conclusion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>That is very piously and
judiciously noted, O <hi>Sophron.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>So it is indeed, O <hi>Philopolis:</hi>
But yet I humbly conceive that it is
not alwaies an itch of searching into,
but sometimes a necessity of more
punctually knowing, the truth of the
Mysteries of God, that drives some
mens spirits into a more close and
anxious meditation of so profound
matters. As it may well doe here in
this present Point touching the <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of God's Providence,</hi> namely,
Whether the <hi>Rule</hi> thereof be his <hi>pure
Goodness,</hi> or his <hi>mere Will and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty.</hi>
For if it be his <hi>Goodness,</hi>
all free Agents have all the reason
in the world to apply themselves
to that Law of Life which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron</hi>
mentions, because <hi>their labour
shall not be in vain in the Lord,</hi> as the
Apostle speaks. But if the measure
of his Providence be his <hi>mere Power,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:55306:110"/>
Will</hi> or <hi>Sovereignty,</hi> no man living can
tell what to expect in the conclusion.
All true Believers may be turned into
Hell, and the wicked onely and the
Blasphemer ascend into the Regions
of Bliss. For what can give any stop
to this but God's <hi>Iustice,</hi> which is a
branch or mode of his <hi>Goodness?</hi>

                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>Methinks, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> that
you both have reason, both <hi>Sophron</hi>
and your self; nor do I desire <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus</hi>
to desist from the present Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
though I much long, I confess, to
hear him discourse of the Affairs of
the <hi>Kingdom of God.</hi>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>That shall be done in due
time, <hi>Philopolis.</hi> In the mean while I
dare avow to <hi>Hylobares,</hi> that there
are no Evils in the World that God
foresaw (and he foresaw all that
were to be) which will not consist
with this Principle, <hi>That God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is the Measure of his Providence.</hi>
For the nature of things is such, that
some Particulars or Individuals must
of necessity suffer for the greater
good of the Whole; besides the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:55306:110"/>
                     <hi>Incompossibilities</hi> and <hi>Lubrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
of <hi>Matter,</hi> that cannot have the
same conveniences and fitnesses in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
shape or modification, nor would
be fit for any thing, if its shapes and
modifications were not in a manner
infinitely varied.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Wherefore I inferr, That
still the Measure of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is his Goodness: Forasmuch
as those <hi>Incompossibilities</hi> in <hi>Matter</hi>
are unavoidable; and what-ever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
or permitted Evil there seems
in Providence, it is for a far greater
good, and therefore is not properly
in the summary compute of the whole
affairs of the Universe to be reputed
evil, the loss in particulars being so
vast a gain to the Whole. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Ignorance, O <hi>Hylobares,</hi> of
the true Law of Goodness (who are
so much immersed into the Life of
<hi>Selfishness,</hi> which is that low Life of
Plants and Animals) that makes us
such incompetent judges of what is
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:55306:111"/>
or is not carried on according to the
Law of that <hi>Love</hi> or <hi>Goodness</hi> which
is truly Divine: whose Tenderness
and Benignity was so great as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
us of Sighs and Tears, to meet
those particular Evils with which
she foresaw would necessarily emerge
in the World; and whose Gayety
and Festivity is also so conspicuous in
endowing us with that passion or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
of Laughter, to entertain those
lighter miscarriages with, whether in
manners or fortune: As if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
look'd upon her bringing Man
into the World as a Spectatour of
a Tragick-Comedy. And yet in this
which seems so ludicrous, see, <hi>Hyloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
what a serious design of good
there is. For <hi>Compassion,</hi> the mother of
Tears, is not alwaies a mere idle Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatour,
but an Helper oftentimes of
those particular Evils that happen in
the World; and the Tears again of
them that suffer, oftentimes the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Compassion in the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours,
and extort their help. And the
news of but one ridiculous Miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:55306:111"/>
age fills the mouths of a thousand
men with Mirth and Laughter; and
their being so liable universally to be
laught at makes every man more
carefull in his manners, and more
cautious in his affairs, especially where
his path is more slippery.</p>

themselves, for I should doe that but
brokenly; but I believe there are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few of the particular Instances in
them but I remember firmly enough.
As first, That so much of the Earth is
taken away from us by the Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Mountains and Rocks, by the
inaccessibleness of large Woods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by wilde Beasts, by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreading
of the Seas, and by huge
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:55306:113"/>
vast Marishes: Besides that the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
and Frigid Zones are unhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
the one by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of Heat, the other by reason of
the extremity of Cold: That that
part of the Earth that is inhabited by
men is of so perverse a nature, that
if it were not for Man's industry and
hard labour, it would be all over-run
with Thorns and Brambles: That
when with much toil he has made the
ground fruitfull, and all things look
green and flourishing, often all this
hope is quash'd by either excess of
Heat and Drought, or violence of
Rain and Storms, or keenness of
Frosts. To which he adds the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of wilde Beasts, that are so
terrible and hurtfull to mankinde
both by land and by sea; the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidness
of the Seasons of the year,
and the frequentness of untimely
Death; and, lastly, the deplorableness
of our Infancy and first circumstances
of entring into life; which he sets off
so pathetically, that I cannot but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
those Verses whether I will

I had not so dinumerately and
articulately mustered up or shaped
out the particular Arguments I would
urge you with, though I felt my
mind charged with multifarious
thoughts; and that pressed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardest
that had left the latest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
on my mind on the Rode as
we rid hither to this City, upon our
being overtaken with so great a
Storm of Thunder, Hail, and a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dash of Rain, that we were well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigh
wet to the skin. For I began to
think with my self how consistent
those kinde of Accidents could be
with so good and exact a Providence
as men imagine. For the High-waie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:55306:115"/>
grow by being liquored without-side,
but within: besides the wetting of all
our Clothes, and the indangering
the catching of an Ague or a Fever.
Wherefore if Providence were so
exact, the Rain would be alwaies
directed to such places as are bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited
thereby, not to such as it does
no good to, but trouble and mischief
to those that are found there.</p>

                  <p>Your meaning is then, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobares,</hi>
that it is a Flaw in Providence
that the Rain is not restrained from
falling on the High-ways. But in
the mean time you do not consider
how intolerably du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty they would be,

                  <p>And this, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> I war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
you take to be an impregnable
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:55306:115"/>
Argument, a stout Instance indeed,
in that you place it thus in the front
of the Battel. But if it be sounded
to the bottome, it will be found to
stand upon a ground no less ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
then that Comicall conceit in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristophanes,</hi>
of <hi>Iupiter</hi>'s pissing through
a Sieve as often as it rains: or what is
a more cleanly and unexceptionable
expression, that the descending of
Rain is like the watering of a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
with a Watering-pot by some
free Agents; where they do not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Walks of the Garden, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Beds or Knots wherein the
Flowers grow. Which is the most Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otick
and unphilosophicall Conceit,
<hi>Hylobares,</hi> that could ever fall into
the minde of any man of your Parts.
For the committing of all the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the natural <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> as they
are called, to any free Agents, were
the utter abolishing of all natural Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
and indeed of Nature it
self; and there would be no Object
left of Speculation in these things,
but either Metaphysicall or Moral.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:55306:116"/>
And by the same reason that you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
that the Rain should onely fall
upon such plats of the Earth as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stined
for Grass, for Corn, for Trees,
and the like, you must require also
that the Sun should not shine on the
High-waies for fear of infesting us
with dust, and that it should divert
its beams from the faces of tender
Beauties; that the Shadow of the
Earth should withdraw to those that
travel in the night; that Fire should
not burn either an usefull building or
an innocent man; that the Air should
not transmit the voice of him that
would tell a Lie, nor the Rope hang
together that would strangle the
guiltless, nor the Sword of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
be it never so sharp, be able to
enter the flesh of the just. These and
many millions more of such sequels
would follow in Analogie to this

dash'd me out of conceit with this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:55306:116"/>
first Instance, which I thought not so
contemptible. But though with but
a broken confidence, yet I must per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist,
and demand, if Providence would
not be more exact, if all things were
carried thus as my Instance implies
they should be, then it is now as they
are.</p>

For the Scene of the World
then would be such a languid flat
thing, that it would disgrace the great
<hi>Dramatist</hi> that contrived it. For
there would be no compass or circuit
of any Plot or Intrigue, but every
thing so shallow or sudden, so simple
and obvious, that no man's Wit or
Vertue would finde any Game to
exercise themselves in. And assure
your self, it is one fundamental point
of the Divine Counsel, and that laid
deep in his Wisedome and Goodness,
<hi>that at least on this terrestrial Stage
there should be sufficient difficulty
and hardship for all Sensible and Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
Creatures to grapple and contest
with,</hi> that an ignoble and corruptive
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:55306:117"/>
torpour may not seize their bodies
and spirits, and make their life lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid
and their Faculties useless, and
finde nothing to doe in the world but
to eat and drink and sleep. For there
are very few men given to <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,</hi>
and yet fewer successfull in it.
That therefore that I contend for is
this, That in these general, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and peremptory, strokes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
there is an exact Providence of
God; and that which you account a
Defect is indeed a Perfection and a
surer pledge of a Divine Foresight,
that does thus manifestly in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of things defalcate either useless
or hurtfull super<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>uities; as this guide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the <hi>Rain</hi> from the High-ways
in Winter. For has he not given
man wit and art to make a supply
by good wax'd Boots, oil'd Coats
and Hoods, and eyes in his head to
chuse his way, if one be better then
another; or if all be intolerable, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall
wit to make Laws and Orders
for the mending of the High-ways?
For thus are men honestly employed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:55306:117"/>
for their own and the common good.
And judge you what a ridiculous
thing it were, that the <hi>Sun</hi> should so
miraculously turn off his beams from
every fair Face, whenas the same End
is so easily served by the invention of
Masks; or that the continued Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of the Earth should be broken
by sudden miraculous eruptions or
disclusions of light, to prevent the Art
and officiousness of the Lantern-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
and the Link-boy; or lastly, that
the Aire should not resound a Lie,
nor the point of a Sword pierce the
skin of the innocent. For this were
an exprobration to the Wisedom of
God, as if he had mistook himself in
creating of free Agents, and by an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-device
thus forcibly ever defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their free Actings, by denying
them the ordinary assistences of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
This would be such a force
and stop upon the first spring of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the greatest trialls of mens
spirits and the most pompous exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
solemnities would be stifled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
or utterly prevented; and all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:55306:118"/>
Prudence, Sagacity, Justice and
Courage would want their Objects.
Wherefore this indifferent and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating
constancy of Nature
ought to be; it being reckoned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in those Faculties God has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd
both men and other Animals
with, whereby they are able to close
with the more usual advantages of
these standing Laws of Nature, and
have sense and foresight to decline or
provide against any dangerous cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
of them; and that with
at least as much certainty as is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
to the considerableness of
the safety of such an individual Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as cannot live always, nor was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
intended to live long upon Earth.</p>

seem'd very unkinde to pelt a young

but a sportfull passage of Nature, to
try how tight and tinnient her new

not able to bear such small Fillips, it
would be a sign that things hung very
crazily and unsoundly together.
Wherefore Nature does but justifie
the accuracy of her own Artifice, in
exposing her works to a number of
such trialls and hardships. This is
but a slight Scruple, <hi>Hylobares;</hi> but

shrewdly urged. But are you sure,

                  <p>I must confess, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> it
is an hard matter to define what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

to prescribe laws or ways to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in so obscure a matter. Besides,
there are so many notoriously wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

escaped would be forward to phansie

that there was no Judgement
to come, because Vengeance was
taken so exactly in this life. Besides
that you seem to forget that the
strokes of Nature levell not at par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.
For she is an unperceptive
Principle, and cannot act <hi>pro re nata,</hi>
or suspend her self from acting; and
that the end of <hi>Thunder</hi> is not to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall

for clearing the Air, and sending

                  <p>Why truely <hi>Philotheus</hi> his
discourse is able to make us all <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheusses.</hi>
And methinks, following
his footsteps, it is no such difficult
business to answer all those Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Lucretius.</hi> I shall willingly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
some of them my self. As that
Complaint of the Earth's being run
over with Thorns and Thistles, if
man by his hand-labour did not cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
it. For besides that we know
that Curse that came upon the Fall,
it is fit that we in this life should have
something to grapple with, to keep us
from Idleness, the Mother of Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
And that the Husband-man's
pains are sometimes lost by Ill wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
over-much Heat, or Wet, or
the like; he is taught thereby not to
sacrifice to his own Net, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon God, and to give him the
praise when he is successfull, as also
to be frugal and provident, and to
lay up for an hard year. But for that
imputation of so much of the Earth's
being unhabitable by reason of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of Heat or Cold, we find by
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:55306:121"/>
experience that it is mostly a mere
calumnie of Nature. For the <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
Zone</hi> is habitable, and a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
part of the <hi>Frigid:</hi> and that
which is not is so little, that it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.
And to speak briefly and
at once: The Inclination of the <hi>Axis</hi>
of the Earth is so duely proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for the making it as habitable as
it can be, that the wit of man cannot
imagine any posture better. Now for
those Allegations, That Rocks and
Mountains and Woods and the Sea
take up so great a part; what-ever
elegancy there may be in <hi>Lucretius</hi> his
Poetry, the Philosophy of such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
I am sure, lies very shallow.
For it is as unskilfully alledged against
Nature that all the Earth is not soft
molds, as it would be that any Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
is not all Flesh, but that there is
Bloud also and Bones. The <hi>Rocks</hi>
therefore, beside other uses for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying
the subterraneous Water, may
serve also for consolidating the Earth.
And it is manifest that the <hi>Hills</hi> are
usually the Promptuaries of Rivers
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:55306:121"/>
and Springs, as Geographers make
good by infinite examples. Not to
adde what a treasury they are of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
and Metalls, and wholesome
Pasturage for Sheep, as the Rocks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
the Goats and the Coneys. But
the Poet seems to speak so unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
as if he expected all the face
of the Earth should be nothing else
but rank green Meadow; whenas
to exclude the <hi>Sea,</hi> would be like the
draining of an Animal of its Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloud.
Or if things could be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
as that all the Surface of the
Earth should be rich Meadow, and
the World thereby thick inhabited
by men, the Air, in all likelihood,
would become so unwholesome, that
Plagues and Death would ever and
anon sweep away all. Wherefore
long Tracts of dry and barren pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are the security of so much Health
as we enjoy: Which is of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
then to have the Earth pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster'd
so with Inhabitants, and ever
and anon to have all to stink with
Noisomeness, Pestilence and Death.</p>

fame of the dancing of Fairies
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:55306:122"/>
in Woods and desolate places, <hi>Olaus</hi>

there are <hi>Daemones Metallici,</hi> that

(especially) by night there are
heard and seen severall Illusions and
Impostures of wicked Spirits. For
which cause Travellers must have a

he will be called out of his way by
these busie Deceivers, who saluting
him by his own name, and feigning

lead him aside to his utter destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

for from hence, methinks, an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is easily framed against his Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
from Man's being liable to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
by horrible and hurtfull Beasts.
For considering the general Mass of
Mankinde was grown such an Herd
of wicked Animals, that is, Beasts,
what repugnancy to Providence is it
that one Beast invades another for
their private advantage? But yet
Providence sent in such secret sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to these Beasts in humane shape,
that seemed otherwise worse appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for fight then their savage ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
armed with cruel Teeth, and
Stings, and Horns, and Hoofs, and
Claws, (which she did partly by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing
them with such Agility of
body and Nimbleness in swarming of
trees, as Apes and Monkeys have
now, but chiefly by giving them so
great a share of Wit and Craft and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:55306:125"/>
combining Policy) that <hi>Lucretius</hi> has
no reason to complain against Nature
for producing these Objects that do
but exercise mens Policy and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
and have given them an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of so successfull a Victory, as
we see they have obtained in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
throughout the whole World at
this very day. And lastly, for that
lamentable Story of the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the entrance of Infants into
this life, it is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it is <hi>mere
poeticall Smoke or Fume,</hi> that vanishes
in the very uttering of it, and is so
far from being a just Subject of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretius</hi>
his complaining Rhetorick a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Providence, that it is a preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Instance of the exactness and
goodness of Providence in Nature.
For there being so much wit and care
and contrivance in Mankinde, both
Male and Female, the weakness and
destituteness of the Infant is a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Object to entertain both the skill
and compassion of that tenderer Sex,
both Mother, Midwife, Nurse, or
what other Assistents: Though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:55306:125"/>
there has come in a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
in Nature by our own defaults.
But how-ever, that Body that was to
be an Habitacle for so sensible a Spirit
as the humane Soul, ought to be more
tender and delicate then that of brute
Beasts, according to that Physiogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall
Aphorism of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
Nor is the crying of
the Infant so much a presage of the
future Evils of life, as a begging of aid
against the present from them about
him, by this natural Rhetorick which
Providence has so seasonably furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with. And for Lambs, and
Calves, and Cubs of Foxes, they are
not so properly said to need no
Rattles, as not to be capable of them,
they having not so excellent a spirit
in them as to be taken up with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
of any thing. For the
Child's amusement at the Rattle is but
the effect of that Passion which is the
Mother of Reason and all Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
And for that last of all, That
mankinde clothe themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Seasons of the year, it is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:55306:126"/>
their Privilege, not their Defect: For
brute Beasts, when it is cold, willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apply themselves to the Fire. But
thus silly are ordinarily the Reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of those men that have a minde
there should be no <hi>God.</hi>

in the defence thereof; as if we
in a moment could finde out all the
richness of that Divine Wisedome
that is couched in the Contrivance
of Nature and in the ordering of the
World. It is sufficient that we shew,
that even to our present thought such
Reasons occurr as are able to stop
the mouths of them that are not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially
affected, and to give a tast how
that, if they would search farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

<hi>Death</hi> it self, the sad effect of so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightfull

to make it appear, that the World in
general are more scar'd then hurt by
these affrightfull Bug-bears. I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with that which is accounted the
most horrid, I mean, <hi>Death</hi> it self. For
why should mankinde complain of
this Decree of God and Nature,
which is so necessary and just? I
mean not onely in reference to our
Lapsed condition, which incurr'd the
penalty of Death; but that there is a
becoming Sweetness in this Severity,
in respect both of the Soul it self, as
it is so timely released from this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of Vanity, and also in regard of
our <hi>peccaminous terrestriall</hi> Personali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:55306:127"/>
here. For I hold it an Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
more befitting the Goodness of
God, to communicate life to a succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Series of <hi>terrestriall</hi> persons, then
that one constant number of them
should monopolize all the good of the
world, and so stifle and forestall all
succeeding Generations.</p>

                  <p>I do not understand that, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus.</hi>
Why may not a set sufficient
number of men, equal to the largest
number of the Succession, be as meet
an Object of the Divine Goodness,
as a continuall Succession of them?
For there is an equal communication
of good in the one case and in the
other.</p>

                  <p>If there be this equality,
it argues an indifferency whether
way it be; and therefore it is no
flaw in Providence what-ever way it
is. But yet I say that way that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
is the best: because that in this
terrestriall condition there would be
a satiety of the enjoyments of this
life; and therefore it is fit that,
as well-saturated Guests, we should

From whence I would inferr, That
there is more joy and pleasure arises
to men in this way of Succession of
mankinde, then if there were the
same men alwaies. And the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre
of the World is better varied and
made more delightfull to the invisible
Spectatours of it, as also the Records
of History to them that reade them.
For it were a dull thing to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the same Actours upon the
Stage. Besides that the varieties of
mens Ages would be lost, and the
prettinesses of their Passions, and the
difference of Sexes, which afford
their peculiar pleasures and delights
one to another. And there is the
same reason for Brutes, who when
they die, though they finde not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the other State, as we do,
yet they no more miss themselves af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Death then they sought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
before they were born.</p>

                  <p>I must confess, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> that
the case is at least so disputable, that
a man cannot lay any just charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Providence from this Topick.</p>

                  <p>Besides, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> it seems
to be of the very nature of terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Animals to be mortal, and that
without the force of a Miracle they
cannot endure for ever. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could Providence doe better,
then to make their <hi>Species</hi> immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
by a continued Propagation and
Succession? For that is the infirmity
of <hi>our particular</hi> nature to dote upon
<hi>Individuals:</hi> But the <hi>Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
which is <hi>Vniversal,</hi> is of a more
released and large nature; and since
<hi>Individuals</hi> will be thus fading and
mortal, concerns her self onely in the
Conservation of the <hi>Species.</hi> To all
which you may adde, That unless
you could secure this terrestriall
World from Sin and sense of Grief
and Pain, not to be able to die, to the
generality of men oppressed and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the Tyranny and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of others, might prove the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:55306:129"/>
Infelicity that could befall them.
Immortality, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> joyn'd with
Pride and Ambition, would easily
bring the World to this pass: And

immortal Enmities one against

                  <p>As for <hi>Diseases</hi> in general,
<hi>Hylobares,</hi> they are as necessary Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quels
of the terrestriall Nature as
Death it self. But as <hi>Death</hi> would
visit us more slowly, so would <hi>Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
less fiercely and frequently, if it
were not for our own Intemperance
and irregular Passions; which we are
to blame for what we finde most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable,
and not to tax Providence,
which has contrived all for the best,
and has let nothing pass without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
judgement and deliberation. For
<hi>Diseases</hi> themselves, though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:55306:130"/>
sequels of a mortal Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
may well be approved of by the
Divine Wisedom for sundry Reasons.
As first, While they are inflicted they
better the minde in those that are
good, and are but a just Scourge to
them that are evil; and the pleasure
of Recovery doth ordinarily more
then compensate the over-past misery
in both. So little cause have either
to complain of the neglect of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in such visitations.</p>

                  <p>Nay, indeed, I think that
mankinde have so little reason to
complain, that they have rather a
very high obligation to admire and
extoll that Providence that suffers so
many outward <hi>Evils,</hi> as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
to rove in the World. For
where they hit, they frequently put
us into such capacities of seriously
bethinking our selves of the duties
of Piety and Vertue as we should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
meet with, for all the <hi>boasts of
our Free will,</hi> unless these heavy
weights were cast into the balance to
<hi>poize against</hi> our propensions to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:55306:130"/>
the Lusts and Pleasures of life,
and the ordinary Allurements of the

                  <p>I was observing in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place,
That the sick being a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle
to them that are wel, make them
more sensible of their own Health,
and should stir up in them thankfull
Devotion towards God their Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and engage them to employ
their Health to the best purposes.
And lastly, That <hi>Diseases</hi> are a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object of man's art and industry
and skill in Medicine: The exercise
whereof does very highly gratifie
them that are either lovers of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde</hi>
or of <hi>Money.</hi> That therefore
that does naturally accrue to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of a terrestriall Creature, why
should God interpose his Omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to disjoin it, especially it bringing
along with it such considerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences?
Nor must we think much
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:55306:131"/>
that sometimes a Disease is invincible:
For thereby Sickness becomes more
formidable to the Patient, without
which it would not prove so good
Physick to his Soul; and general suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
would lessen the estimate of the
Cure, and the pleasure of escaping the
danger of the Disease; as likewise
it would diminish the Joys and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations
of Friends and officious
Visitants. For it is fit that things
should be set home upon our Passions,
that our Delights thereby may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
more poinant and triumphant.</p>

I answer, first in general, That
it is worth our taking noti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of, how
Divine Providence has counted upon
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:55306:131"/>
this extraordinary expense of man's
bloud and life, the Generations of
men being not considerably scanted
for all these four greedy devourers
of them. And therefore we ought
to consider what a testimony of the
Perfection of the works of God in
Nature the greatest Disasters of the
world are. For if they did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
we should think it liable to none,
but that it stood wholly on its own
leggs. But we now seeing it liable to
so great ones, and yet such as are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
triumphed over by that
Wisedom and Counsel of God that is
so peremptorily carried on in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of things, we are thereby mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
convinced of a Providence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from such things as at first sight
seem most to contradict it. To which
you may adde that eminent use of
the Calamitousness of this Scene of
things, if we must needs think it so,
namely the serious seeking after a
Portion in those Regions that are not
subject to such horrid Disasters, those

                  <p>Why, that is no such hard
Province, <hi>Hylobares.</hi> For as for <hi>War</hi>
and its effects, it is not to be cast upon
God, but on our selves, whose unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
Lusts, having shaken off the
yoke of Reason, make us mad after
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:55306:132"/>
Dominion and Rule over others, and
our Pride and Haughtiness impatient
of the least Affront or Injury. And
for <hi>Famine,</hi> it is ordinarily rather the
effect of <hi>War</hi> then the defect of the
Soil or unkindliness of the Season;
which if it were, mens Providence
and Frugality might easily prevent
any more direfull ill consequences
thereof; and present necessities set
mens wits on work. And there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
that Communication betwixt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Countries, that Supplies are
usually made in such like Exigencies.
I confess <hi>Plagues</hi> and <hi>Pestilences</hi> would
seem more justly chargeable upon
God, did we not pull them down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
our selves as deserved Scourges for
our Disobedience. And though whole
Cities be sometimes swept away with
them, as that of <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi>
yet we are to consider that
such acute Diseases make quick dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch;
which makes <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in
like manner the more tolerable. For
whether they be Islands or Cities that
are thus swallowed into the ground
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:55306:133"/>
or sunk into the Sea, it is a present
Death and more speedy Buriall. Thus
perished those two famous Cities of
<hi>Achaia, Helice</hi> and <hi>Buris;</hi> as also, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>Plato</hi> and some others, an
ancient <hi>Atlantick</hi> Island sunk into the
Sea. But what more then ordinary
mischief came to the Inhabitants?
For the Souls of the good, having
once left their Bodies, would easily
find way through the Crannies of the
Earth or depth of the Sea, and so
pass to those Ethereall Seats and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the Blessed. And for the
Souls of the bad, what advantage the
Atheist can make to himself by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
after them I know not. If a
man's phancie therefore be not sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
snatch'd away, these things are
nothing so terrible as they seem at
first sight; nay, such as we of our
own accord imitate in <hi>Sea-fights,</hi>
which have sunk I know not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands of floating Islands thick
inhabited, by the thunder and batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of murtherous Cannons. But it
is the skill of the great <hi>Dramatist</hi> to
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:55306:133"/>
enrich the History of the World with
such Tragicall transactions. For were
it not for bloudy fightings of Battels
and dearly-bought Victories, the
strange Changes and Subversions of
Kingdoms and Empires, the horrible
Narrations of Countries depopulated
by devouring Plague and Famine, of
whole Cities swallowed down by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
Earthquakes, and entire
Continents drown'd by sudden Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
the Spectatours of this terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall
Stage-play would even nod for
want of something more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
notorious to engage and hold on
their attention. Wherefore these
things are not at all amiss for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orning
of the History of Time, and
recommending of this Theatre of the
World to those that are contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of Nature and Providence. For
the Records of these fore-past Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of other Ages and Places natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
engender a pious Fear in the
well-disposed, and make all that hear
thereof more sensibly relish their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
tranquillity and happiness. And,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:55306:134"/>
which is ever to be considered, the
unexhaustible stock of the Universe
will very easily bear the expense of
all these so-amusing Pomps and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities:
which therefore give the
more ample witness to the <hi>Wisedom</hi>
and <hi>Power</hi> of the Deity.</p>

that they may be swept away some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for the Wickedness or Triall of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:55306:134"/>
their Owners. And therefore I will
not so much insist upon the death of
dumb Creatures, as upon such Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
as may make their lifes more
lingringly miserable; as the putting
some Limb out of joint, the breaking
of a Bone, or the like. For why
does not that invisible Power that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigilates
over all things prevent such
sad Accidents? it being as easie for
him that made them to keep them
from harm, as it was to make them;
he being <hi>able</hi> to doe all things without
any trouble or disturbance to himself,
and being so <hi>good</hi> and <hi>benign</hi> as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
none of his innocent Creatures.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>This is pertinently urged,
<hi>Hylobares.</hi> But I answer, That God
has made the World as a complete
<hi>Automation,</hi> a <hi>Machina</hi> that is to move
upon its own Spring and Wheels,
without the frequent recourse of the
Artificer; for that were but a Bungle.
Wherefore that the Divine Art or
Skill incorporate into Matter might
be manifest, absolute Power does not
interpose, but the condition of every
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:55306:135"/>
thing is according to the best Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
this terrene Matter is capable
of. Wherefore these ill Accidents
that happen to living Creatures testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
that there is nothing but the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Divine Artifice</hi> modifying the
Matter that keeps up the Creature in
its natural condition and happiness.
Whereby the Wisedome of God is
more clearly and wonderfully set out
to us; that notwithstanding the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Matter, yet the carefull Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization
of the Parts of a Creature
does so defend it from mischief, that
it very seldom happens that it falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
such harms and casualties as you
specifie. But if an immediate extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
and absolute Power did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
interpose for the safety of the
Creature, the efficacy of that Intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Contrivance of the Matter into
such Organs and Parts would be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
hid from our knowledge,
and the greatest pleasure of natural
Philosophy come to nothing. Which
is of more concernment then the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
security of the Limbs of every
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:55306:135"/>
Beast; especially it happening so ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
seldome that any of them are
either strain'd or broken, unless it be
long of us, and then Providence is
acquitted.</p>

                  <p>How long of us, <hi>Philotheus?</hi>

                  <p>As for example, when one
shoots at a flock of Pigeons or a flush
of Ducks, do you expect that Divine
Providence should so guide the shot
that it should hit none but what it
kill'd outright, and not send any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
with a broken leg? By the
same reason neither should it be in
our power to break the leg of a Bird,
if she were in our hands. And, which
is of greater moment, the Judge
should be struck dumb so soon as he
began to give Sentence against the
Innocent; the Sword should fall out
of the hand of him that maintains an
unjust Quarrell; the lips of the Priest
should be miraculously sealed up so
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:55306:136"/>
soon as he began to vent false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
and delude the people with
Lies; and the dangerous Physick of
either an unskilfull or villainous Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician
should never be able to finde
the way to the mouth of the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Patient. The sense of which
would be, That God should make
man a free Creature, and yet violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
determine him to one part. Which
would make useless the sundry Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul, prevent the variety
of Orders of men, silence these busie
Actours on this Stage of the Earth,
and by this palpable Interposall, as it
were, bring <hi>Christ</hi> to Judgement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time. Thus would the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
and Impatience of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull
raise the Theatre before the
Play be half done, the intricacy of
the Plot making the Spectacle tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to them that understand it not.

notorious. For it takes away all

                  <p>My Answer in brief is this:
That this is the Sport that the Divine
Wisedome affords the Contemplative
in the speculation of her works, in
that she puzzles them at the first
sight even to the making of her self
suspected of some Oversight, and that
she has committed some offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the sacred nature of <hi>God,</hi> which
is <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Iustice</hi> it self; which
yet they afterwards more accurately
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:55306:139"/>
scanning finde most of all agreeable
to that Rule. As certainly it is
here. For what is so just as that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorism
of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his School,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that <hi>the worse
is made for the better?</hi> And what so
good wisedome, as to contrive things
for the highest enjoyment of all?
For I say, as I said before, That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Providence in the generations of
Fishes, Birds and Beasts, cast up in
her account the Supernumeraries that
were to be meat for the rest. And
<hi>Hylobares</hi> is to prove whether so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Individuals of them could come
into the World and continue so in
succession, if they were not to be les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened
by this seeming cruel Law of
feeding one upon another. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
we see sundry <hi>Species</hi> of living
Creatures this way the most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly
and transportingly provided
for. For how delightfull a thing it
is for them by their craft and agility
of body to become masters of their
Prey, men that make to themselves a
fortune by their own wit, policy and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:55306:139"/>
valour, let them be Judges. Where
something of consequence is in chace,
it makes the pleasure of the Game
more solid, fills the Faculties with
more vigour and alacrity, and makes
the Victory more savoury and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
As running for a wager makes
a man feel his limbs with more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
and speed, and finde himself more
pleased that he has overcome his
Antagonist. Wherefore the <hi>Animal
life</hi> in Beasts and Birds (and they
were never intended for any thing
higher) is highly gratify'd by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
of their strength and craft, and
yet the <hi>Species</hi> of all things very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously
preserved. But to complain
that some certain numbers are to be
lopp'd off, which notwithstanding
must at last die, and if they lived and
propagated without any such curb,
would be a burthen to the Earth and
to themselves for want of food, it is
but the Cavill of our own <hi>Softness</hi>
and <hi>ignorant Effeminacy,</hi> no just charge
against God or Nature. For the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisedome freely and generous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:55306:140"/>
having provided for the whole,
does not, as Man, dote on this or that
Particular, but willingly lets them go
for a more solid and more Universal
good. And as for <hi>Beeves</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi>
the more ordinary food of Man, how
often is the Countrey-man at a loss
for Grass and Fodder for them? Judge
then what this foolish pity of ever
sparing them would bring upon them.
They would multiply so fast, that they
would die for famine and want of
food.</p>

                  <p>What you say, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> I

highly commend this good nature in
you, yet I must tell you it is the <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oticalness</hi>
of your phancie that makes
you thus puzzled in this case. For
you phansie Brutes as if they were
Men: whenas they have no other
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:55306:140"/>
Law then the common Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is the Law of <hi>Self-love,</hi>
the cravings of which they will sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie,
what-ever is incommodated
thereby. As the Fire will burn if it
take hold, though to the consumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a whole Forest, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Wood never did the Fire any
hurt, that it should use it so: so eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Animal would satisfie its own cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
appetite, though it were by the
devouring of all the world beside.
This every Sparrow, Titmouse or
Swallow would doe. So that if you
will indulge to that phancy, they are
all wicked alike; and therefore it
need not seem so harsh that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
are also to be devoured. But
it is the most true and Philosophicall
apprehension, to impute no more
wickedness to devouring Brutes then
to swallowing Gulfs of the Sea or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
Fire.</p>

                  <p>Onely this; That this

meanest, the least glorious and least

that God may make one part of the

it may be his Wisedom requires it
should be so at length in process of
time; as the Art of Painting requires
dark Colours as well as those more
bright and florid in well-drawn Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.
Therefore I say the nature of
things, even of all of them, Sin one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
excepted, is but less good here, not
truly evil or malignant.</p>

                  <p>It is manifest, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that there is no such malignant
heat as is supposed in Fire, but all is
sound and sacred, if it be in due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and in right circumstances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd.
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:55306:142"/>
For it is well known that the
gentle and comfortable Rays of the
Sun may be so crouded together in
one point by the artifice of Glasses,
that they will be so furiously hot as to
melt hard metalline bodies. And little
question is to be made but that there
are certain particles, good store, in
Nature, of a form long and flexible,
that the ordinary heat of the Sun rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
into a Vapour, and he or some
higher Principle still more strongly
agitating them, will cause mighty
Winds and Tempests, and these
Tempests vehemently toss the Sea,
and make it rage and roar. But that
Sea-voiages become dangerous by
this means, is but the exercise of the
wit and observation of man, and has
occasioned a more accurate Art of
Navigation. And if some Ships not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
be cast away, it ever
makes the Passenger that has any
Piety in him pay his Vows at Land
with greater religion and devotion.
And for the Wrath of Beasts, it has
nothing more diabolicall in it then
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:55306:142"/>
natural Choler and the flames of
Fire, which do no more hurt then
the pure beams of the Sun passing
through a pure Glass, whose figure
onely makes them burn. But the
power of God indeed seems more
barely set out in these fierce Beasts
of prey, such as the <hi>Lion, Bear,</hi> and
<hi>Tiger,</hi> and is yet more terrible in huge
scaled <hi>Dragons</hi> and <hi>Serpents.</hi> But if
these kind of Creatures bear any
mischief or poison in their teeth or
tails or their whole bodie, that poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is nothing but disproportionality
of particles to the particles of our
own or other Animals bodies. And
Nature has armed us with caution,
flight and abhorrency from such
dreadfull Spectacles. But we must
not make our abhorrency the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and true estimate of others Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
For those poisonous Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are not poisonous to their own
kinde, and are so far from mutual ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency,
that they are joyned in the
nearest link of love that can be,
whereby they propagate their <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:55306:143"/>
Wherefore these Objects of so
terrible an aspect are not evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but being capable of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of the <hi>Animal life</hi> as well as any
other, and being so egregiously dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to behold, as living Symbols of
that Attribute of <hi>Power</hi> unqualified
with <hi>Goodness,</hi> they were rightly
brought into Being in this Region of
Sin, as ready Instruments of Divine
Wrath, notorious Ornaments of the
Theatre of the World, and a great
enrichment of the History of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which would be defective, did
it not run from one extreme to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

a piece of Sportfulness in the order

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:55306:143"/>
whereupon the sudden com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of his countenance into its
natural frame seems the more lovely
and amiable. But for these prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Deviations, they are not many.
For it is the rarity of them that invites
the people to look after them. And
it is a plain argument they are well
pleased with these novel Spectacles,
they so willingly parting with their
moneys to have the sight of them.
For these diversities of Objects in the
World variously touch the minds of
men, playing upon their severall Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
and Faculties as a Musician
on the sundry Keys of an Organ or
Virginals. And that Stop which is
a Discord of it self, yet not being too
long stood upon, makes the succeeding
Harmony more sweet. And so it is in
that which is uglily defective or mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen,
it quickens the sense of that
due Shape and Elegancy we see ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
in other things. But that there
are whole Nations absolutely mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
or misshapen, such as the <hi>Cyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephali,
Acephali, Monoculi, Monocoli,</hi> &amp;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:55306:144"/>
the like, it will be then time enough
to answer to that Difficulty, when the
truth of the Story is cleared. The
probability of which I think <hi>Euistor</hi>
is as able to judge of as most men, he
taking so special a felicity in reading
of Histories.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>That there are such mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
Nations mentioned in History,
O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> it cannot be dissembled.
But for the credibility of the Story
or pertinency to this Subject, that is
not so clear. For in my apprehension
Historians do very much betray their
vanity in the very circumstances of
what they relate. As in the <hi>Monoco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li</hi>
of <hi>Tartarie,</hi> which, they say, have
but one Arm as well as but one Leg;
but they adde, that they run so swift
on that single Hand and Foot, that no
Horse can keep pace with them.
Which if it were true, what great
charge could be laid against Nature
for making so admirable and usefull
a Fabrick? There is also a People
near <hi>California,</hi> called <hi>Enoticoeti,</hi>
which they say have long Ears that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:55306:144"/>
reach to the very ground, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
so large and thin and limber, that
they hang like a Skarf behinde or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them; which they spread and lie
in a-nights on the ground, (if any be
so foolish as to believe it:) from
whence they are called <hi>Enoticoeti,</hi> as
having their <hi>Ears</hi> for Sheets to <hi>lie in.</hi>
So that when they travel they may <hi>in
utramque aurem dormire,</hi> and be afraid
of no contagion but what they carry
with them.</p>

                  <p>This is a pretty privilege,

                  <p>For my part, I must confess,
I look upon it as a very Fable; as I
do also upon those several Stories of
the <hi>Monoculi.</hi> And S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Iohn Mande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi>
to outbid the mendacity of all
his predecessours, thought it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to feign Nations with one Eye
in their heads onely, but also such as
had none at all, but onely two Holes
like empty Sockets where the lights
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:55306:145"/>
should be placed. But to give you my
conjecture, I think the first occasion
of this fable of the <hi>Monoculi</hi> was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
from the <hi>Scythian Arimaspi,</hi>
which were famed to be such, and
indeed have their name from thence,

to say an <hi>Eye.</hi> So that <hi>Arimaspus</hi> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies

I believe there is no more in it then
this; and can hardly conclude with

they begot Children quite deprived
of one of their Eyes. But be that
how it will, that was no fail of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but a fault of their own. But
surely from such slight hints as these
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:55306:145"/>
might so many loud Lies be spred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
in the world. And when they
had once brought it to one Eye, they
might then place it according to the

themselves so as to raise admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, for the <hi>Cynocephali,</hi> it
is a thing incredible, and betrays the
falseness by the circumstances of the
Report. As that they understand
one another by Barking and Howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and partly by Signs with their

engender as Dogs do, and that the

more shamefull and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest.
I believe the truth of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence

I cannot devise how such <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
as these can well comport
with so benign a Providence as you
seem to plead for. To me, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi>
they are the most dismall sights

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>And, to deal ingenuously
with you, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> there is nothing
does more contristate and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize
my spirit then any reflexions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
such Objects. But yet I cannot
conclude but that God may be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Good and Just in his dealings with
men for all this. For we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that Mankinde by their Fall are
lapsed into a parallel condition with
that of Beasts in a manner, and, by
their being invested with these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial
Induments, do put themselves
into all those hazards that the Brutal
life is obnoxious to, that is to say,
not onely the Diseases of the Body,
but the Maladies also of those better
Faculties of Perception and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:55306:147"/>
of natural Wit and Sagacity,
and of natural Humour and Disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The distemper of any of these
seizes the Soul, if it meet with so ill
a fitted Body. For we see that some
Beasts are egregiously more sottish
and slow then others of their own
kinde, and more mischievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manageable,
as is observable in <hi>Dogs</hi>
and <hi>Horses.</hi> And several Brutes are
capable of becoming mad. These
mischiefs follow this terrestrial Fate
of things, which none can be secure
from but those that inhabit not in
these houses of clay. And who knows
but he that is born a natural Fool, if
he had had natural Wit, would have
become an arrant Knave? which is
an hundred times worse. And to
have been in a capacity of being
good, and yet to range out into all
manner of Wickedness, is more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
then to have ever had a sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness
of what is pious and vertuous
uninterruptedly from the very birth.
And as for <hi>Mad-men,</hi> it is notoriously
known that the greatest cause is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:55306:148"/>
Immorality, Pride, the want
of Faith in God, or inordinate love
of some outward Object. But no
Madness but that which is purely a
Disease is to be charged upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
for which there is the like A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
as for other Diseases; which
if we should admit they did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
good to the afflicted, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied but that they do very
naturally tend to the bettering of the
Spectatours, as this sad Object of
<hi>Madness</hi> ought to doe; to make men
humble and modest, and masters of
their Passions, and studious of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of Soul and Body, and close
adherers to the Deity, that so hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
a distemper may never be able to
seize them; to keep down the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of Desire, and to be wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to the Will of God in all
things, and not to seek a man's self
no more then if he were not at all;
not to love the Praise of men, nor
the Pride of the world, nor the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
of life, but to make it his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
pleasure to be of one Will with
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:55306:148"/>
his Maker, nor to covet any thing
but the accomplishment of his will in
all things.</p>

                  <p>I conceive, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> that
<hi>Hylobares</hi> may not call that excellent
state of the Soul a <hi>Divine Madness</hi>
out of any reproach to it, but for the
significancy of the expression. For
Madness is nothing else but an Ecsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticalness
of the Soul, or an Emotion
of the Minde, so that a man is said
<hi>not to be himself,</hi> or <hi>to be beside him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
The misery of which in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Madness is, that he being thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hindged,
he roves and is flung off at
randome whither it happens, or lock'd
into some extravagant phancy or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
that is to no purpose, or else to
ill purpose. But <hi>Divine Madness</hi> is,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:55306:149"/>
when a man by studiously and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
quitting himself and his own
animal desires through an intire puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of his spirit, being thus loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sened
from himself, is laid fast hold
on by the Spirit of God, who guides
this faithfull and well-fitted Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not according to the ignorant
or vicious modes of the World, but
his motions keep time to that Musick
which is truly holy, Seraphicall and
Divine, I mean, to the measures of
sound Reason and pure Intellect.</p>

                  <p>I meant no worse, <hi>Bathynous,</hi>
then you intimate; but you have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologized
more floridly and Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
for me then I could have done
for my self. And therefore this rub
being removed, I beseech you, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus,</hi>
proceed in your well-begun
Apologie touching those Difficulties
in Providence which I last propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>I will adde therefore these
two considerations. First, That this
Life is short, and that no more is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of these ill-appointed persons
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:55306:149"/>
for Wisedom and Vertue then propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally
to the Talent committed to
them. So that their danger is dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
according to the lessening of
the measure of their Capacities. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
That it is our Phancie ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then our Reason that makes us
imagine these Objects so much more
sad and deplorable, then what we see
in the ordinary sort of men. For, as
I was intimating before, which of
these two is the more deplorable
state, to be a Fool by <hi>Fate</hi> or upon
<hi>choice?</hi> And are not all things Toies
and Fools-baubles and the pleasures
of Children or Beasts, excepting what
is truly <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Intellectual?</hi> And
how few, I pray you, amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousands do seriously spend their
studies in any thing weightily Moral
or Intellectual, but fiddle away their
time as idlely as those tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> pill
Straws or tie knots on Rushes in a fit
of Deliration or Lunacy? The Wits
of this Age contend very much for
this Paradox, That there is no other
Happiness then Content; but it is
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:55306:150"/>
the Happiness of natural Fools, to
finde their Content more easily and
certainly then these very Wits. And
there is in this case much the same
reason of <hi>Mad-men</hi> as of <hi>Fools.</hi> And
what is the gaudiness of Fools Coats
but the gallantry of these Wits,
though not altogether so authentick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in fashion? Besides, this may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
Providence something, that the
generality of men do usually flock af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Fools and Mad-men, and shew
themselves delighted with the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>

                  <p>They are pleased, it may be,
to see some more mad and sottish then
themselves, and so congratulate to

as they phansie, of their

                  <p>It may be they approch to

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>You may have spoken
more truly in that, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> then
you are aware of, saving that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:55306:150"/>
men are more foolish and mad
then these Looking-glasses can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
them. <hi>Nihil tam absurdè dici
potest quod non dicatur ab aliquo Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophorum,</hi>
is a saying of <hi>Cicero.</hi> And
if the Philosophers themselves be such
fools, what are the Plebeians? Could
ever any thing more sottish or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
fall into the minde of either
<hi>natural Fool</hi> or <hi>Mad-man,</hi> then, <hi>That
the eternall God is of a corporeall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and shape; That the World and all
the parts of it, the organized Bodies of
men and beasts not excepted, are the
result of a blinde Iumble of mere Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Motion without any other guide?</hi>
What more phrantick then the <hi>fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Transubstantiation,</hi> and of <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Lust, Ambition, and Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness?</hi>
Or what more outrageous <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen</hi>
of Madness, then the killing and
slaying for the Non-belief of such
things? A man is accounted a natural
Fool for preferring his Bauble before
a bag of Gold; but is not he a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
times more foolish that preferrs
a bag of Gold, a puff of Honour, a
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:55306:151"/>
fit of transient Pleasure, before the
everlasting Riches, Glory and Joys
of the Kingdome of Heaven? No
man wonders that a Mad-man unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
kills another; and if he did it
advisedly and of set purpose, yet it
being causelessly and disadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to himself, he is reputed no less
mad. How notoriously mad then are
those that, to their own eternall dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
depopulate Countries, sack
Cities, subvert Kingdoms, and not
onely martyr the bodies of the pious
and righteous, but murther the Souls
of others, whom by fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
they pollute with Idolatrous
and impious practices; and all this
for that gaudy Bauble of Ambition,
and a high Conceit of <hi>one Vniversal
Spiritual Monarch,</hi> that ought to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
in Wealth, and tumble in all the
fleshly and sensual Delights of this
present World? Wherefore, to speak
my judgement freely, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that there would be such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of men <hi>mad</hi> and <hi>foolish</hi> and
<hi>wicked</hi> according to the <hi>ordinary
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:55306:151"/>
guize</hi> of the world, it does not mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beseem
the <hi>Goodness</hi> of <hi>Providence</hi> to
anticipate this growing degeneracy in
some few, by making them <hi>Fools</hi> and
<hi>Mad-men</hi> as it were by <hi>birth</hi> or <hi>fate:</hi>
that Folly and Madness being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
to the sons of men in a more
unusual disguise, by hooting at it,
they may doe that piece of justice as
to reproch themselves thereby, who
are upon their <hi>own cost</hi> and <hi>charges</hi>
more reprehensibly wicked then they
that never came within any capacity
of being vertuous, (if there be any
such) and more outrageously mad
and abominably sottish in the eyes of
him that can judge rightly, then any
natural Fool or Bedlam; or rather,
that using that seasonable reflexion
which <hi>Plato</hi> somewhere commends
upon the consideration of the ill car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of others, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
they may finde by such analogies as
I have hinted at, that they are far
worse Fools and Mad-men then are
hooted at in the Streets, and so for
very shame amend their lives, and
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:55306:152"/>
become truly wise and vertuous. For
what can be more effectuall for the
raising an horrour and detestation of
what is ugly and dishonest in our
selves, then the reflexion, that what
we so abhorr in others is more in our
selves both as to degrees and other
circumstances; and that whereas o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
may seem an Object of <hi>pity,</hi>
our selves deserve the highest <hi>reproof</hi>
and <hi>scorn?</hi>

Vertue) looks upon that which we
ordinarily call <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Wickedness</hi> to
have such an <hi>essential</hi> and <hi>infernal</hi> Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and <hi>hellish</hi> Perverseness in it, so
<hi>abominable</hi> and <hi>detestable,</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
and repugnant to the nature of
God, that it seems a Contradiction
that they should both coexist in the
world together, but that the wrath
of the Almighty ought to have thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-struck
or stifled so horrid a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster

reason of those natural Evils it una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably

                  <p>In my judgement no man has
so luckily pointed at the true nature
of Wickedness as <hi>Mercurius Trisme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistus,</hi>
in that short saying, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
That <hi>Wickedness is
connate or natural to Beasts.</hi> Which
yet I am so far from believing in that
sense the words sound in, that I hold
it incompetible to them. But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as that mirrour of Wisedom,
<hi>Moses,</hi> has defined in his Law, when
the Leprosie is all over a man, no
part untainted, that he is to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as clean; so Brutes, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
onely of Sense and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Affections, without any partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of an higher Principle, they are
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:55306:156"/>
uncapable of Sin. And if there were
any Rational Animals, be they in
what shape they will, from the sight
of whose mindes that higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
was ever excluded fatally and
naturally, they would be as the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall</hi>
Leper, or rather as an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Brute, devoid both of Sin and
Conscience, relishing onely the Laws
of the <hi>Animal</hi> Life: wherein when
we have considered how much there
is of the Divine Wisedome and
Goodness that contrived them, we
shall not have so venemous a conceit
concerning the Creation of God, or
be cast upon <hi>Manicheism</hi> or <hi>Gnosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cism,</hi>
phansying the sign of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
paw, or senting the Sulphur of
Hell in every thing as strongly as the
Bishop's foot in milk burnt to the
Skillet bottom.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I may say that those myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
depths of Satan which the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osophers
so diligently discover, such
as are <hi>Ipseity, Egoity,</hi> or <hi>Selfishness,</hi>
it is nothing else but that sovereign
or radicall Principle in the <hi>Animal
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:55306:156"/>
life,</hi> which is <hi>Self-love.</hi> Of which if
there be no necessity in Nature that
it should be, (as indeed we see some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the Affections of Creatures to
be carried out so to others that they
forget themselves) yet it was fit for
Divine Providence to settle this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
in them all, That every thing
should love it self very heartily and
provide for it self; as the Roots of
Trees without all scruple draw to
themselves all the nourishment they
are capable of, not regarding what
Tree withers, so they flourish, in
which notwithstanding there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of either Devil or Sin.</p>
                  <p>But now that Providence did very
well in implanting so smart a <hi>Self-love</hi>
in every Animal, is manifest. For
those more notable Functions of the
Animal life, such as depend on
Strength and Agility, Craft and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,
could not be exercised to any
considerable degree without this
Principle. A Crow would not have
the heart to pick at a Worm, nor a
Swallow to snatch at a Fly. And
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:55306:157"/>
there is the same reason for those
more notable and industrious Insidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of other stronger and more
crafty Creatures that hunt after their
prey. Besides, every Animal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of it self has in some sense or
measure a resemblance of that Divine
Attribute of <hi>Omnipresence;</hi> for be it
where it will, it cannot leave it self
behinde. Wherefore it is fit it
should be indued with this great
Love and care of it self, being in a
more constant readiness to pleasure,
help and provide for it self then for
another. Lastly, it is a thing unima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
unless Brutes were indu'd
with intellectual Faculties, (and then
they would be no longer Brutes) that
they should be able to have so free
and reflexive Cogitations as to seek
the emprovement and live in the
sense of the publick good. And if
their thoughts and phancies were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
taken up or gadding after the
welfare of others, the height of life
and joy in every one would much be
diminished and obscured. For Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:55306:157"/>
is far weaker then the present
sense of the body: And if you would
have it any thing strong, how cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous
must the lives of these Animals
be, who must die, must be maimed
and suffer mischief, as often as any
of their Fellow-animals suffer any of
these things? Wherefore it is better
for the whole generations of brute
Animals, that every one love and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
it self, then that they be all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
and tortured with ineffectual
thoughts concerning the welfare of
others. We see therefore, O <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>
the Wisedome and Benignity of
Providence, that has so firmly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted
this Principle of <hi>Self-love,</hi> the
root of undisturbed Joy and of Self-preservation,
in the <hi>Animal life.</hi>
From whence is also in Animals that
eminent love of their young, and
their kindness and tameness to them
that feed them. And for those Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
in Animals that look more grim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and infernally on't, or at least
seem to have a more nauseous and
abominable aspect, as <hi>Wrath, Envy,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:55306:158"/>
Pride, Lust,</hi> and the like, they are but
the branches or modifications of this
one primitive and fundamental Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Self-love.</hi> For what is <hi>Wrath,</hi>
but Self-love edged and strengthned
for the fending off the assaults of evil?
What <hi>Envy,</hi> but Self-love grieved at
the sense of its own Want, discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and aggravated by the fulness of
another's enjoyment? What <hi>Pride,</hi>
but Self-love partly desiring to be the
best or to be approved for the best,
and partly triumphing and glorying
that it is now become none of the
meanest? And, lastly, what is <hi>Lust,</hi>
but Self-love seeking its own high
delight and satisfaction in the use of
Venery?</p>
                  <p>These are the main misshapen
Spawn of that monstrous Fiend,
that deeply-couched Dragon of Hell,
<hi>Self-love;</hi> which if we eye more accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
we shall find as necessary and
usefull in the <hi>Animal</hi> Life as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that bears them. For as for
<hi>Wrath,</hi> and also <hi>Craft,</hi> (which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
to mention before) it is plain
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:55306:158"/>
they are as unblameable in Beasts as
Prudence and Valour in men. And
for <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Gloriation,</hi> it is but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Spur to quicken their Animal
Powers, or but the overflowing of
that tickling sense they have of those
perfections Nature has bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and shews how mightily
well-pleased they are with them, and
what thankfull witnesses they are of
that Goodness and Wisedom that fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them. And for <hi>Lust,</hi> who dare
blame it in the brute Creature, there
being distinction of Sexes, fitness of
Organs, and sufficiency of Spirits pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
by the Divine Wisedom in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
for it? Besides that it is one of
the most important Acts, as well as
accompanied with the greatest and
most enravishing Joy that the <hi>Animal</hi>
Life will afford. A matter of that
consequence, that the Generations of
living Creatures would cease to be
without it; and the Sun and Moon be
constrained once again to shine on an
empty Earth; and the shadows of
the Trees to shelter nothing but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:55306:159"/>
the Trees themselves, or the
neighbouring Herbs and Flowers.
That which looks most like a Fury
of all this litter is <hi>Envy;</hi> which as bad
as it is, yet methinks <hi>Aristotle</hi> slanders
it, whiles he would make it such a Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
as was not raised from the sense
of our own Want, but merely out of
the sense of another's good, without
reference to our selves; which for
my part I look upon to be such a
Monster as I suspect is scarce to be
found in the Regions of Hell.</p>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>But that <hi>Envy</hi> that is, O <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi>
is a genuine result of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Life, and more usually in a pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
melancholick Spirit, and is a
Grief arising from the sense of our
Want discovered, as I said, and set off
more stingingly to us by the more
flush and full representations of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
Happiness. But that there
should be any more wickedness in
Grief then in Joy, or in Pain then in
Pleasure, is a thing my understanding
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:55306:159"/>
cannot reach to. For then Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
it self would be a Sin.</p>

                  <p>It's well you pass so favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable

                  <p>It is in virtue of the <hi>sweet
Affections,</hi> O <hi>Sophron,</hi> that I speak so
favourably of the <hi>sowr.</hi> But to tell
you the truth, I had rather give them
good words at a distance, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them into my house, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
any more <hi>inward</hi> familiarity
with them. To my peculiar temper
they are but harsh Guests.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore we conclude that
no branch of the <hi>Animal</hi> Life is simply
<hi>sinfull, poisonous</hi> or <hi>diabolicall,</hi> they
being really the Contrivances of the
good and wise God in the frame of
Nature, or else the necessary sequels
of such Contrivances. And that
therefore those men that are so
strongly enveagled in the Pleasures
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:55306:160"/>
and allurements of this lower life are
rather lapsed into that which is <hi>less
good,</hi> then detained in that which is
<hi>absolutely evil.</hi> And it is but a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
gullery and mistake, while they
are so hugely taken with so small
matters, they being in the condition,
as I may so say, of Children and
Fools, of whom it is observed, <hi>That
a small thing will please them:</hi> though
it be a doubt whether these things
be so small and contemptible, if that
be true that the Divinest of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have asserted, That the whole
World and the parts thereof are but
so many Symbols and Sacraments of
the Deity; every thing being either
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, some more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<hi>image,</hi> or at least some <hi>picture,
shadow,</hi> or <hi>footstep</hi> of the <hi>Divinity.</hi>
Upon which if our eyes be stayed
and our Affections entangled, as it is
a real testimonie of our approvement
of the excellency of the Archetype,
so are we in some meaner sort religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
we adoring thus and doting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these congruous Gratifications we
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:55306:160"/>
receive from these particular Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of that perfect Good, untill we
are called up to an higher partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of him. But that even those
that seem to flie from God seek after
him in some sort, is apparently neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
there being nothing but <hi>Himself,</hi>
or <hi>what is from Him,</hi> in the World:
otherwise he could not be that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely-perfect
Good, whose <hi>Goodness,
Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> fills all things.
And I think there is no perceptive
Being in the whole Universe so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged
from its Original, but it is
either courting or enjoying these or
some of these Attributes in some rank
and measure or other, they ever try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and proving what they can doe
in matters of either <hi>Pleasure, Wit,</hi> or
<hi>Dominion.</hi> And the sincere and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distracted
fruition of any one part of
any of these has so mightily taken up
the minds of some men in complexion
fitly framed for such delights, that they
have sacrificed even their Lives, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties
and Fortunes, to these slighter
glimpses of the great Godhead, whom
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:55306:161"/>
they thus unwittingly and unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seek to adore, and so become in a
sort religious Martyrs for a <hi>part,</hi>
which they that make profession of
their love and honour of the <hi>entire</hi>
Deity seldome are persuaded to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe.</p>
                  <p>Now sith it is something of God
that the mindes of all Spirits (even
of those that seem to be in actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against him) are set after, it
is a very hard thing to find out how
he should look upon himself as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>esteemed,
whenas all the Creatures
are mad after something or other
of His, most religiously prizing it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
above their own Beings. For it
is onely their ridiculous mistake to
cleave to that which is of less worth
and moment, and therefore deserves
laughter and pity more then fury and
revenge. Not to adde what a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
and idiotick conceit it is, to phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
God in the similitude of some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
tetricall person, impatient of and

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:55306:161"/>
him, nor any is intended against
him; but men out of a debasing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
or Laziness of spirit take up
with smaller good things, when they
may be more welcome to greater.
Which Solution as it may well satisfie
<hi>Hylobares</hi> touching his Querie, why
God Almighty did not at the first
appearance of Sin straightway with
sulphureous Thunderbolts strike it
dead upon the spot; so it may be

                  <p>Nay, if you mean no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise

but it beginning to be late, it had
been better expressed in shorter

                  <p>I hope I shall very briefly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
it to the rest, but I know not
how far he may be in love with his
own Lunacy. That there is no Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or harm in any of the Animal
Functions or Passions, I easily grant
him, and it may be the least in the
sweetest. For I was before convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by <hi>Philotheus</hi> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
substantially evil in the World.
But it is immensely manifest, that those
things that are good in themselves,
yet by misapplication or disproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may cause that which is unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
naught. As in a Musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
whose Strings are good and the
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:55306:163"/>
Stick good, yet if they be touch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
when they are out of tune, what
more harsh and intolerable? And
so may the exercise of the Animal
Functions or Passions, though good
in themselves, yet if they be either set
too high, or exercised upon undue
Objects or in unfitting circumstances,
become very nauseously evil. To
spit is one of the Animal Functions,
good and usefull in it self, and to spit
into the mouth of a Dog and clap
him on the back for encouragement,
is not indecorous for the man, and
gratefull also to the Dog: But if any
one had gone about to spit into <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phophron</hi>'s
mouth, and clap him on
the back to encourage him in that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pturous
Oration he made, he would
have thought it an intolerable absurd
thing, and by no means to be suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

                  <p>Why, so far as I see, <hi>Hyloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
that was needless; you making
as if Dame <hi>Cynthia,</hi> aliàs <hi>Diana,</hi> had
spit into my mouth already, and clapt
me on the back, as one of her Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-dogs,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:55306:163"/>
and so put me into this

                  <p>Something like it, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi>
it may be. But now you are out of
this career, how do you like this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the exercise of the <hi>Animal</hi>
Functions, That men and women
should stale and dung (like Mares
and Horses in a Stable) in any room
or company they came into? It is
something a course Question, <hi>Cupho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phron,</hi>
but very substantially to our
purpose.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>But they then but exercise
their <hi>Animal</hi> Functions. And were
that quicker sense revived in us
whereby we discern <hi>Moral</hi> good and
evil; Adultery, Drunkenness, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Fraud, Extortion, Perfidious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and the like, all these would
have infinitely a worse Sent to our
Souls, then this which you say is so
stinkingly evil can have to our Noses.
And yet in all these things there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but an <hi>undue Vse</hi> of the <hi>Animal
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:55306:164"/>
Faculties.</hi> And forasmuch as <hi>Order</hi>
and <hi>Proportion</hi> and the right <hi>Congruity</hi>

which are the most <hi>Intellectual</hi> and

and <hi>Contradiction</hi> that can be
made or devised against the <hi>Divine
Intellect</hi> or <hi>Eternall Godhead.</hi> For
although the Faculties of the Soul of
man be but gradually differenced as
to Goodness, that is to say, that some
of them are better then other some,
others onely less good: yet the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity</hi>
and <hi>Disproportionateness</hi> of
the Use of them are <hi>diametrically op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite</hi>
to the <hi>Congruity</hi> and <hi>Proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nateness</hi>
of their Use, and have the

                  <p>Excellently well argued,
<hi>Hylobares I</hi> and it was as seasonably
intimated at first, That there is a <hi>sense</hi>
in a man, if it were awakened, to
which these <hi>moral inc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ngruities</hi> are as
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:55306:164"/>
harsh and displeasing as any incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Object, be it never so nauseous,
is to the outward Senses. But a mere
<hi>Notional</hi> or <hi>Imaginary</hi> Apprehension
or Conception of these <hi>Moral</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities
and Incongruities does not
reach that due <hi>Antipathy</hi> we ought to
have against Sin and Wickedness:
whereby also we do more lively un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
how contrary and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
they are to the Will of God.
But besides this fallacy in general,
<hi>Hylobares,</hi> there were severall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Passages, in my minde, very
rash and unsound; but especially
that, which makes our inordinate
Adhesion to some parts of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
a Religious Worship or Service
of God.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>There may be some shew of
wit in such like conceits and expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
but undoubtedly, O <hi>Sophron,</hi>
such exorbitant Adhesions to the
Creature is so far from being the <hi>due
Worship</hi> of God, that it is <hi>down-right
Idolatry.</hi> For neither the whole
Creature nor part is God himself.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:55306:165"/>
And therefore to love them more
highly and affect them more devoutly
then the pure Godhead, that is to say,
to love them <hi>most of all,</hi> is to doe that
honour to them which is onely due
to God. Which is to play the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later.</p>

                  <p>That is very true, <hi>Bathyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>

                  <p>That also, O <hi>Sophron,</hi> is very
perversly and un-Platonically done of
<hi>Cuphophron,</hi> that, whereas the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi>
from that Notion of things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
some Similitude or at least some
Shadow of the Divinity in them,
would draw men off from the doting

might approch nearer the pure and

more fully and beatifically; he by a

them in the present enjoyment of
these smaller perfections, and fix them

it was onely a sudden Rapture,

That the minde of Man is as free as

their language, and that he cannot

compell our Will to any thing, but
what-ever we take to must be from
our own free Principle, nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to deal with us without our
selves: As a man that is fallen into a
deep Ditch, if he will not so much as
give his fellow his hand, he cannot
pull him out. Nor may this seem
more incongruous or inconsistent
with the Omnipotency of God, then
that he cannot make a Square whose
Diagonial is commensurate to the
Side, or a finite Body that has no figure
at all. For these are either the very
Essence or the ess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ntial Consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the things spoken of, and it
implies a contradiction they should
exist without them. So we will for
dispute sake affirm, that Liberty of
Will is an essential Property of the
Soul of Man, and can no more be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from her, then the proper Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of a Geometricall Figure from
the Figure; unless she once deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,

For, to speak <hi>Pythagorically,</hi> the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits

the Souls of Beasts uncapable of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

of, if we consider how unbecoming
it would be to the Wisedome of God
to be so over-shot in the Contrivance

some part of it, as being at a loss
what else to doe, and if they should all
lapse, to annihilate them all.</p>

                  <p>I know not what to think of
it. Besides, if that were true that
some Philosophers contend for, That
all the whole Creation, as well par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Souls and Spirits as the Matter
and Universal Spirit of the World,
be from God by necessary Emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
this <hi>middle vertible Order</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be turned out of Being. But that
the Stability of God's Nature and

the most exquisite Wisedome and
Goodness, would be to me the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Paradox of all.</p>

                  <p>Why, who knows but that
it is better for them to exist, though

for the Universe, that so they may be

and obscurest shadows of the Divine
fulness, then to be suddenly annihilated
upon their first Lapse or Transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?

at all.</p>

                  <p>But I much question how
this will alwaies consist with the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Justice. For I think it as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
that the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi>
should alwaies act according to the
<hi>Simplicity</hi> of its own nature; as it is
unnatural for the Beams of the Sun to
be reverberated to our eyes from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Bodies variously surfaced in the
same form of Light, and not to put
on the face of divers Colours, such as
yellow, green, red, purple, and the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:55306:171"/>
like. For as the various Superficies
of Bodies naturally causes such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versification
of pure Light, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
it into the form of this or that
Colour; so the variety of Objects
the Divine Goodness looks upon does
rightfully require a certain modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and figuration of her self into
sundry forms and shapes, (as I may
so call them) of Vengeance, of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity,
of Justice, of Mercy, and the
like. This therefore is the thing I
contend for, That free Agents, such
as Men and Angels, may so behave
themselves in the sight of God, that
they will become such Objects of his
Goodness, that it cannot be duely
and rightfully expected that it should
act according to its pure and proper
benign form, dealing gently and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with all the Tenderness that may
be with the party it acts upon; but
it must step forth in some of those
more fierce and grim forms, (I speak
after the manner of men) such as <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi>
and <hi>Iustice.</hi> And I will now
put a Case very accommodately to
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:55306:171"/>
our own Faculties. Suppose some
Vertuous and Beautifull Virgin, roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
descended and Princely attired,
who, venturing too far into the solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Fields or Woods, should be light
upon by some rude Wretch, who,
first having satisfied his Lustfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
upon her by a beastly Rape,
should afterwards most barbarously
and despightfully use her, haling her
up and down by the Hair of the
head, soiling her sacred Body by
dragging her through miry Ditches
and dirty Plashes of water, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
her tender Skin upon Briars and
Brambles, whiles in the mean time
some Knight-Errant or Man of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Vertue (but of as much
Benignity of spirit as God can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to humane nature without
Hypostaticall Union) is passing by
that way, and discerneth with his
astonished eyes this abhorred Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle:
I now appeal to your own sense
and reason, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> whether it be
enough for that <hi>Heros</hi> to rescue this
distressed Virgin from the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:55306:172"/>
injury of this Villain, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
her from any farther harm; or
whether there ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
also some exquisite Torture and
shamefull Punishment worthy so hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
a fact, and proportionable to
the just indignation any noble spirit
would conceive against so villainous
a Crime, though neither the wronged
person nor punished party were at all
bettered by it.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> I
should be in so high a rage against
the Villain, if I were on the spot, that
I should scarce have the discretion
how to deliberate to punish him so
exquisitely as he deserved; but in my
present fury should hew him a-pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as small as Herbs to the pot. I
should cut him all into mammocks,

                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> you
cannot but confess that <hi>Goodness</hi> it

justly and becomingly be sharpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into <hi>Revenge:</hi> Which must be still
the less incongruous, in that the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge</hi>
                     <pb n="303" facs="tcp:55306:172"/>
is in the behalf of <hi>injured

thereby but that she is revenged.</p>

                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>To this case that Notion of
<hi>Punishment</hi> appertains which the

                     </gap>,<note place="margin">Noct. Att. l. 6. c. 14.</note> as <hi>Gellius</hi> observes;
which nothing concerns the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
or amendment of the puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed,
but onely the Honour of the
injured or offended.</p>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Right, <hi>Euistor.</hi> But in the
mean time it is manifest from hence,
as I was making inference to <hi>Hyloba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res,</hi>
That the Divine Goodness may
step forth into Anger and Revenge,
and yet the Principle of such Actions
may be the very Goodness it self.
Which therefore we contend is still
(notwithstanding that evil which
may seem to be in the World) the
measure of all God's works of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
even when <hi>Sin is punished
with Sin,</hi> and Men are suffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
into Baboons and Beasts.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>I grant to you, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> that
a man may behave himself so, as that
all that you affirm may be true, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:55306:173"/>
that even the highest <hi>Severity</hi> may
have no other Fountain then <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
But where <hi>Goodness</hi> is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent,
as it is in God, how can it
consist therewith not to prevent all
occasions of Severity and Revenge,
by keeping his Creature within the
bounds of his own Laws, and by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
to all men and Angels such
an irresistible measure of Grace, that
they could never have possibly been
disobedient to him?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>To this, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
That God having made a free
Creature, (and it is impossible to
prove he did amiss in making it)
Omnipotency it self (if I may speak
it with reverence) is not able to
keep off certain unavoidable respects
or congruities it bears to the Divine
Attributes: As it is a thing utterly
unimaginable that even the eternall
Intellect of God should be able to
produce a finite Number that did not
bear a certain proportion to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
finite Number first given. This
free Creature therefore now made,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:55306:173"/>
necessarily faces the severall Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of God with sundry respects.
And this native Freedom in it chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges
of his Wisedome, that she shew
her best skill in dealing with a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that is free with as little vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
done to its nature as may be.
Which we see the Wisedome of God
has practised upon Matter, as I noted
awhile agoe. And yet the deface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of rightly-organized Matter is
as real an entrenchment upon or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
of what is Intellectual or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
(I mean the Divine <hi>Idea's</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
as Vice or Immorality. As
the Divine Wisedome therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not the terrestriall Matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the bounds of its own natural
capacity, to fend all Animals Bodies
from Diseases and Death; no more
should the Divine Goodness univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally
in <hi>all</hi> free Creatures <hi>irresistibly</hi>
prevent the use of their own nature.
And therefore being free, they ought,
according to the congruity of their
condition, be put to the triall what
they will doe. And if the miscarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:55306:174"/>
be upon very strong Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that did even almost over-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
the strength of the free Creature,
this state of the case is a meet Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God. But if it
have strength enough, and has been
often and earnestly invited to keep
close to and to pursue after those
things that are best, and yet perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
slights them and shuffles them
off, the party thus offending is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
object of the Divine <hi>Slight</hi> and
<hi>Scorn;</hi> &amp; it is but just that such an one
be left to follow his own swindge,
and to finde such a fate as attends such
wilde courses. For it seems a kinde of
disparagement, to pin Vertue and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Grace upon the sleeves of them
that are unwilling to receive it. It
would be as unseemly as the forcing
of a rich, beautifull and vertuous
Bride upon some poor slouching
Clown, whether he would or no.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>But God may make them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>That is, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> you
may give the Clown a <hi>Philtrum</hi> or
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:55306:174"/>
                     <hi>Love-potion.</hi> But is not this still a
great disparagement to the Bride?
Wherefore for the general it is fit,
that God should deal with free Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
according to the freedom of
their nature: But yet, rather then all
should goe to ruine, I do not see any
incongruity but that God may as it
were lay violent hands upon some,
and pull them out of the fire, and
make them potent, though not irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible,
Instruments of pulling others
out also. This is that Election of God
for whom it was impossible for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
that have arrived to a due pitch
of the Divine Life. But for those
that still voluntarily persist to run on
in a rebellious way against God and
the Light that is set before them, and
at last grow so crusted in their Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness,
that they turn professed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
of God and Goodness, scoff
at Divine Providence, riot and Lord
it in the world, with the contempt of
Religion and the abuse and persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them that profess it; that out
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:55306:175"/>
of the stubborn Blindness of their
own hearts, being given up to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness,
Pride and Sensuality, vex
and afflict the consciencious with
abominable Tyranny and Cruelty; I
think it is plain that these are a very
sutable Object for <hi>Divine Fury</hi> and
<hi>Vengeance,</hi> that sharp and severe Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification

                     <hi>Hylobares,</hi> though
we should admit that the whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Divine Providence is nothing
else but the mere disburthening of
his overflowing Goodness upon the
whole Creation, and that he does not
stand upon the terms of Justice and
Congruity, or any such punctilio's, (as
some may be ready here to call them)
but makes his <hi>pure</hi> Goodness the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of his dealing with both Men and
Angels; yet I say that it does not at
all contradict, but that God may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
Sin in the World, he having the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:55306:175"/>
privilege of bringing Light out of
Darkness, and the nature of things
being such, that the lessening of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
in one is the advancement of it
in another: As it is in the Motion of
Bodies, what agitation one loses, is
transferred upon another; or like the
Beams of the Sun, that retunded from
this Body are received by another,
and nothing is lost. So that in gross
the Goodness of God may be as fully
derived upon the Creation, though
not so equally distributed to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Creatures, upon his permitting
Sin in the World, as if he did forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
and against the nature of free
Creatures, perpetually keep it out.
This is that therefore that I would
say, that the Vices of the wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and exercise the Vertues of the
just.</p>
                  <p>What would become of that noble
Indignation of minde that holy men
conceive against wicked and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
people, if there were neither
Wickedness nor Blasphemy in the
world? What would become of those
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:55306:176"/>
enravishing Vertues of Humility,
Meekness, Patience and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
if there were no Injuries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
men? What had the Godly
whereupon to employ their Wit and
Abilities, if they had no enemies to
grapple with? How would their
Faith be tried, if all things here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
had been carried on in Peace and
Righteousness and in the Fear of
God? How would their Charity and
Sedulity be discovered in endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to gain men to the true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God, if they were alwaies
found so to their hands? Terrestriall
Goodness would even grow sluggish
and lethargicall, if it were not shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
and quickned by the <hi>Antiperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis</hi>
of the general Malignity of the
World.</p>
                  <p>There are no generous Spirits but
would even desire to encounter with
Dangers and Difficulties, to testifie
their love to the parties they are
much endeared to; and it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
great accession to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments,
that they have suffered so
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:55306:176"/>
much for them. But if the World
were not generally wicked for a
time, no Soul of man could meet with
any such adventure, and the History
of Ages would be but a flat Story.
Day it self upon this Earth would
be tiresome, if it were alwaies Day,
and we should lose those chearfull
Salutes of the emerging Light, the
cool breathings and the pleasing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
of the Rosie Morning. The
Joys and Solemnities of Victories and
Triumphs could never be, if there
were no Enemies to conflict with, to
conquer and triumph over. And the
stupendious undertakings of the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of Mankinde, and the admirable
windings of Providence in her Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick
Plot which has been acting on
this Stage of the Earth from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the World, had been all
of them stopped and prevented, if
the Souls of men had not been lapsed
into Sin. And the sweetest and most
enravishing Musicall touches upon the
melancholized Passions (so far as I
know) of both men and Angels had
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:55306:177"/>
never sounded in the consort of the
Universe, if the Orders of free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
had never played out of tune.</p>
                  <p>Nothing therefore of the Divine
Goodness seems to be lost, whenas
the very Corruption of it, as in a
grain of Corn cast into the ground,
makes for its encrease; and what of
it is rejected by some, is by the Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God so unavoidably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
upon others. But that it is
best that all should partake alike of
the Overflowings of God, will, I
think, be no less difficult to prove,
then that all Subordination of estates
and conditions in the world should be
taken away, and that God should not
have created any of the more vile
and contemptible kinde of Creatures,
such as the Worm, the Fly, the Frog,
and the Mouse. Wherefore it being
so disputable a Point, whether it
be not in it self as good that there
should be those that are rightly called
evil and wicked in the World, as that
there should be such and such viler or
more mischievous Creatures on the
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:55306:177"/>
face of the Earth, it is an unexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
piece of Rashness to conclude,
that the Permission of Sin is any such
Argument against the Goodness of
that Providence that guideth all
things. For why should she <hi>general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
force or certainly determine the
Faculties of men that are naturally
free, and so perpetually keep them
off from acting of Sin, whenas Sin it
self is so pompously led captive by
the power of Righteousness, and by
the admirable Wisedome of God
serves for the equal advancement of
his intended Goodness?</p>

the best Objects, there should not

and Godliness more easie and
passable to poor toiling Mortals, who
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:55306:178"/>
are so pittifully tired and wearied out
in their pious Prosecutions, that they
often forfeit not onely the Health of
their Bodies, but even the Soundness
of their Minds, and are given over
either to miserable Mopedness or
Distraction. The other in brief is,
The externall Adversitie of the Just,

                  <p>That it is an hard thing for
us Mortals, whose abode is in houses
of Clay, to arrive to any due pitch
of Purity and Goodness, experience
does so frequently witness, that it
cannot be denied. But that this is
no real blemish to the benignity of
Providence, if a man look more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into the nature of the thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
he may easily satisfie himself from
manifold reasons. For, first, If we
had any Modesty in us, we may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well suspect that the Pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
we undergoe in the process of
our Regeneration is but a just pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:55306:179"/>
of our former Sins, in which
they that stay the longest come out
with the greatest Sorrow and di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>icul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
2. Besides, In other things we
hold it not indecorous, that matters
of greatest price should be purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
with answerable pains. For what
has God given us severall Faculties
for, but to employ them to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our own good? 3. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
By this means of God's acting
according to our nature, not by his
absolute power in some mighty and
over-bearing miraculous way, the
Acquisition of the Holy life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Mystery, and men to the
great gratification of one another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
the Method and, as I may so say,
the artifical Process thereof. A thing
of greater moment then the finding
out the most sovereign Elixir or the
Philosopher's Stone. 4. The tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>someness
of the Fight makes the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
more pleasant and sensible, and
the continuance of the Quarrell fixes
more deeply upon our spirits an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy
against Sin; and the hardness
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:55306:179"/>
we finde in winding our selves out of
the bondage of Wickedness will more
strongly establish us in the Kindgdome
of Vertue. 5. It is a meet triall of
our Faith and Sincerity, and entire
Affection to God. For when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
our selves hold on notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all these Combats and Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances,
we are assured in our selves
that we are in good earnest, and that
we shall at last obtain, if we faint not.
6. And that therefore we ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to examine our own Sincerity,
then accuse Providence. For if our
love to Goodness be sincere, and not
lazy and phantasticall, it will hold
out with patience; which Vertue is
exercised and increased by these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Trialls. 7. We are also to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
our Faith and opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
God's will and power, whether
we think him as well willing as able
to help all those that sincerely seek
after him; which is essentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous
to the Divine Nature and
Goodness; and whether we believe
that through his power we may be
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:55306:180"/>
inabled to get the conquest over all
the Enormities of the Animal Life.
And if we think God is not so good
to his Creature, let us consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we could serve the Creature so,
if we were in God's stead. If we
could, it is the wickedness of our
own Nature that has thus infected the
Notion of God in us, and so our own
evil spirit is our Fury and Devil that
at last may chance to drive us into
Madness. If we could not deal thus
our selves, how foolish a thing is it
not presently to collect, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be more benign then God, and
that therefore the fault is in our
selves that we are no better? More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
we are to consider, that Clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Serenity of Minde is not to
be had without the forsaking all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Sin; and that if we hope o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
it is an Indication of our
own Hypocrisie, that we would hold
a League with both Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
at once. And therefore we see
as touching religious Distraction, that
we our selves may be the causes of it,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:55306:180"/>
and that it is but the just result of our
own Insincerity. But for down right-Madness
proceeding from Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
it is natural Disease, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
the Physician rather then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Philosopher or Divine.
8. and lastly, The great Desertions,
dark Privations, desperate Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Enfeeblements of Minde and
Body, or what-ever other Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences,
as they seem to be, occurr in
this process towards the due pitch of
Regeneration and Newness of life,
they very effectually and naturally
make for that most precious and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
piece of Piety, I mean Humility;
whereby the Soul is so affected, that
she very feelingly and sensibly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges
that all the good she
does or knows is wholly from God
her Maker, and that she is nothing
of her self. Wherefore she is just to
God, in attributing all to him; and
milde and meek-hearted towards
men, even to those that are yet out
of the way, being conscious to her
self, that the ordering of her ways
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:55306:181"/>
is not from herself, but that God is
her strength and the light of her
paths. Wherefore there being such
genuine advantages in this slow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of them that move towards what
is truly good, and that congruity to
our Faculties, and to the nature of the
things we seek after, it seems to me
as unreasonable that God should use
his absolute Omnipotency in making
men good in a moment, so soon as
they have a minde to be so, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
he should make the Flowers sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
start out of the Earth in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
or load the Trees with Autum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

                  <p>The Story then in brief is
this. That a certain <hi>Eremite</hi> having
conceived great jealousies touching
the due Administration of Divine
Providence in externall occurrences
in the World, in this anxiety of mind
was resolved to leave his Cell, and
travell abroad, to see with his own
eyes how things went abroad in the
World. He had not gone half a
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:55306:182"/>
day's journey, but a young man o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertook
him and joyn'd company
with him, and insinuated himself so
far into the <hi>Eremite</hi>'s affection, that
he thought himself very happy in
that he had got so agreeable a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion.
Wherefore resolving to
take their fortunes together, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
lodged in the same house. Some
few days travels had over-past before
the Eremite took notice of any thing
remarkable. But at last he observed
that his Fellow-traveller, with whom
he had contracted so intimate a
Friendship, in a house where they
were extraordinary well treated stole
away a gilt Cup from the Gentleman
of the house, and carried it away
with him. The Eremite was very
much astonished with what he saw
done by so fair and agreeable a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
as he conceived him to be, but
thought not yet fit to speak to him
or seem to take notice of it. And
therefore they travel fairly on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
as aforetimes, till Night for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them to seek Lodging. But they
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:55306:182"/>
light upon such an house as had a very
unhospitable Owner, who shut them
out into the outward Court, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
them all night to the injury of
the open weather, which chanced
then to be very rainy. But the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remite's
Fellow-traveller unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
compensated his Host's ill enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with no meaner a reward
then the gilt Cup he had carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
from the former place, thrusting
it in at the Window when they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
This the Eremite thought
was very pretty, and that it was not
Covetousness, but Humour, that made
him take it away from its first Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The next night, where they
lodged, they were treated again with
a deal of Kindness and Civility: but
the Eremite observed with horrour
that his Fellow-traveller for an ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall
strangled privately a young
Child of their so courteous Host in
the Cradle. This perplext the minde
of the poor Eremite very much; but
in sadness and patience forbearing to
speak, he travelled another day's
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:55306:183"/>
journey with the young man, and at
Evening took up in a place where
they were more made of then any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
hitherto. And because the
way they were to travell the next
morning was not so easie to find, the
Master of the house commanded one
of the Servants to go part of the
way to direct them; whom, while
they were passing over a Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
the Eremite's Fellow-travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
caught suddenly betwixt the legs
and pitched him headlong from off
the Bridge into the River, and
drowned him. Here the Eremite
could have no longer patience, but
flew bitterly upon his Fellow-travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
for these barbarous Actions, and
renounced all Friendship with him,
and would travel with him no longer
nor keep him company. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the young man smiling at the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
zeal of the Eremite, and putting
off his mortal disguise, appeared as
he was, in the form and lustre of an
Angel of God, and told him that he
was sent to ease his minde of the great
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:55306:183"/>
Anxiety it was incumbred with
touching the <hi>Divine Providence.</hi> In
which, said he, nothing can occurr
more perplexing and paradoxicall
then what you have been offended at
since we two travelled together. But
yet I will demonstrate to you, said
he, that all that I have done is very
just and right. For as for that first
man from whom I took the gilded
Cup, it was a real Compensation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of his Hospitality; that Cup
being so forcible an occasion of the
good man's Distempering himself,
and of hazarding his Health and
Life, which would be a great loss to
his poor neighbours, he being of so
good and charitable a nature. But I
put it into the window of that harsh
and unhospitable man that used us so
ill, not as a Booty to him, but as a
Plague and Scourge to him, and for
an ease to his oppressed Neighbours,
that he may fall into Intemperance,
Diseases, and Death it self. For I
knew very well that there was that
Inchantment in this Cup, that they
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:55306:184"/>
that had it would be thus bewitched
with it. And as for that civil per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
whose Childe I strangled in the
Cradle, it was in great mercy to him,
and no real hurt to the Childe, who
is now with God. But if that Childe
had lived, whereas this Gentleman
hitherto had been piously, charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
and devoutly given, his Minde,
I saw, would have unavoidably sunk
into the love of the World, out of
love to his Childe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he having had
none before, and doting so hugely
on it; and therefore I took away
this momentanie life from the Body
of the Childe, that the Soul of the
Father might live for ever. And
for this last fact, which you so much
abhorr, it was the most faithfull
piece of Gratitude I could doe to one
that had used us so humanely and
kindely as that Gentleman did. For
this man, who by the appointment
of his Master was so officious to us as
to shew us the way, intended this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
night ensuing to let in a company
of Rogues into his Master's house, to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:55306:184"/>
rob him of all that he had, if not to
murther him and his Family. And
having said thus, he vanished. But
the poor Eremite, transported with
Joy and Amazement, lift up his
hands and eyes to Heaven, and gave
glory to God, who had thus unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
delivered him from any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Anxiety touching the ways of
his Providence; and thus returned
with chearfulness to his forsaken Cell,
and spent the residue of his daies
there in Piety and Peace.</p>

can the Wicked escape <hi>Punishment,</hi>
when Wickedness it self is one of the
greatest Penalties? or how can they
be said to be <hi>prosperous,</hi> who have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
succeed according to their own
scope and meaning? For every man
means well, as <hi>Socrates</hi> wisely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines;
but it is the perpetuall unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of the Wicked that he does that
which is ill. So great is his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and Impotency, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach the mark he aims at; but
wishing the best to himself, as all
other men do, yet notwithstanding
he really prosecutes that which is
worst. And therefore with the wise
he can be no Object of Envy, but of
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:55306:186"/>
Pity. And it is an unmeet thing that
any sentence concerning Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
should be carried by the
Votes of Fools. When a Drunken
man breaks Glass-windows, ravishes
women, stabs men in the streets, and
does many such Villainies as these, I
appeal to you, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> what Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
or Prosperity is there in this,
(though he were not to be punished
by the Magistrate) having done that
which indeed he had no true minde
to doe, but did heartily detest and
abhorr when he was sober? This is
the true state of all Wicked men
whatsoever; let their power be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so high, they act like Drunkards
or men in a Dream, such things as
they will be ashamed of so soon as
they are sober or awakened.</p>

                  <p>Now as it is evident, <hi>Hylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bares,</hi>
that they are punished in the
forfeiture of that high Happiness that
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:55306:186"/>
consists in the peace and joy of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd
Minde, wherein resides the true
Knowledge of God, and a living sense
of the Comeliness and Pulchritude of
Grace and Vertue; so likewise there
is an Infliction of internall Pain to
their very Senses. For what Torture
can there be greater then that Rack
of Pride, those Scorpion-stripes of
Envy, those insatiable scorching
Flames and Torches of Furies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed
Lust? what then strangling
Cares, then the severe Sentences of
their own prejudging Fears? what
Dungeon more noisome, horrid or
dismall, then their suspicious Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
and oppressing loads of surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
Grief and Melancholy?</p>
                  <p>Again, it is farther manifest that
the Wicked are plagued even in this
life; for they are a mutual plague
and scourge one to another, and take
the office of Executioners and Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by turns. For all the noise of
Injury and Injustice in the World is
ordinarily nothing else but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
that wicked men abuse one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:55306:187"/>
Wherefore why should it be
expected that Divine Providence
should forthwith take vengeance of
the Executioners of his own Justice?</p>
                  <p>But for those few Righteous that
are in the World, they are bettered
by those things that seem to the Idiot
and unskilfull the onely Evils that
Mortals can fall into. But the Infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of the Godly is commonly this,
that they will scramble with the men
of this World for such things as are
the most proper Happiness of those
that are wicked. For they fighting
with them thus as with Cocks on
their own Dunghill, it is no marvell
they come by the worst; for this is
<hi>their hour and the power of Darkness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is manifest that the
Peace and Impunity of the Wicked
is very serviceable for the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the Vertues of the Righteous,
whereby they may discern their own
Sincerity or Hypocrisie, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
whether it be the pure Love of
Piety that puts them in such a garb,
or the desire of the Praise and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:55306:187"/>
of men; whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of their Faith in God and of
future Happiness be formal, or real.
For if it be real, what will not they
be able to undergoe? and what an
high Cordial must it be unto them,
to have an unfeigned sense and belief
of that great Compensation they are
to receive in the World to come?
Not to mention what a great satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
the consciousness of constant
Sincerity is to the Soul of a man even
in this life also. Wherefore the
strokes of the Confusion and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
Disorder in the World do in a
manner miss the Righteous, and hit
heavy onely there where they should
doe, upon the Ungodly themselves.
But what reaches those that are dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more just, they are in all reason
and modesty to look upon it as either
a Punishment of some Reliques of
Vices in them, or as an Exercise of
their Vertues, that God may be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify'd
in them. Wherefore if any
thing harsh happen to a good man, he
will forthwith examine himself if his
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:55306:188"/>
heart be clean: which if it be not,
he is to look upon it as a Chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
if it be, he will bear it and
embrace it as a Triall from God, and
as an occasion whereby he may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie
the Power of God in him. But if
he doe not thus, it is a sign his heart is
not clean, and therefore why should
he grumble that he is punished?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That Tyranny, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Perjurie, Blasphemy and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
Lust has been notoriously
and exemplarily punished by a kinde
of Divine Vengeance, and above all
the expectation of men, even in this
Life, in severall persons, is so noted in
History, that I need name no Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
But to pursue every Monstrosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of Wickedness with present Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
here in this World, were not
to make men good, but to hinder the
wicked from mischieving and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
one another, and from exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Vertues of the righteous.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, In that Wickedness is not
so constantly and adequately pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
in this Life, there is also this
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:55306:188"/>
Convenience in it, That it is a shrewd
Argument to any indifferent person
that understands the Nature and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes
of God, that there is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to come hereafter in the other
Life.</p>
                  <p>To all which I adde in the last
place, that the affairs of this World
are like a curious, but intricately-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived,
Comedy, and that we cannot
judge of the tendency of what is past
or acting at present before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of the last Act, which shall
bring in Righteousness in triumph:
who though she has abided many a
brunt, and has been very cruelly and
despightfully used hitherto in the
World, yet at last, according to our
desires, we shall see the Knight over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Giant. And then I appeal
to you, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> whether all things
have not been carried on according
to the natural Relish of your own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.
For what is the reason we
are so much pleased with the reading
<hi>Romances</hi> and the Fictions of Poets,
but that here, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, things
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:55306:189"/>
are set down as they should be, but
in the true History hitherto of the
World things are recorded indeed
as they are, but it is but a Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that they have not been as they
should be? Wherefore in the upshot
of all, if we shall see that come to
pass that so mightily pleases us in the
reading the most ingenious Plays and
Heroick Poems, that long afflicted
Vertue at last comes to the Crown,
the mouth of all Unbelievers must
be for ever stopped. And for my own
part, I doubt not but that it will so
come to pass in the last Close of the
World. But impatiently to call for
Vengeance upon every Enormity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that time, is rudely to overturn
the Stage before the entrance into the
fifth Act, out of Ignorance of the
Plot of the Comedy, and to prevent
the solemnity of the general Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
by more petty and particular
Executions. These are briefly the
six Heads, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> which I might
have insisted upon to clear Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from this last Allegation, had
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:55306:189"/>
there been any great Difficulty in the
matter.</p>

                  <p>Be if so, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> yet
these acts are sometimes necessary for
men also. Nor is it inconvenient to
drink to my next neighbour <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi>
not onely to fortifie him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the nocturnall Vapours, but
likewise to recruit his Spirits, which
he may have over-much expended
in his long and learned discourses.</p>

                  <p>The fresh Air, <hi>Philopolis,</hi>
moistened with the Moon-shine, as <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phophron</hi>

                  <p>It is ordinarily the pure ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
of Temperance to have so. But
yet my palate is something more surd
and jacent. However I will trie. I
promise you it seems to me very
good, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> and such as <hi>Cato</hi>
himself would not refuse a Cup of:
which makes me with the more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
drink to my next neighbour,
even to <hi>Sophron,</hi> to chear him after
his conceived Fears and Affrights tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the Success of this Dispute con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Providence.</hi>

                  <p>The good Success, <hi>Bathyno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi>
chears me more then all the Wine
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:55306:191"/>
in <hi>Athens</hi> can do. And therefore not
so much to be cheared, as out of my
present Chearfulness, I will, readily
pledge you one cup. For Sobriety
is not in drinking no Wine at all, but
in drinking it moderately.</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor do I think that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Drinking consists in one Cup,
but in drinking no more then is for
the Health of both Soul and Body.
And one Glass will serve me for that
end at this time.</p>

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>See the virtue of good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
the mere steam of whose vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
Atoms has so raised <hi>Sophron</hi>'s
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:55306:192"/>
phancie, that it has made him seem

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>It is marvellous good Wine
indeed. I warrant you, <hi>Euistor,</hi> this
will rub up your memory to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
if the recalling how many Cups
grave <hi>Cato</hi> would take off at a time,
may warrant our drinking at any time
more then is needfull or convenient.
I pray you tast it.</p>

                  <p>I thank you, <hi>Sophron,</hi> I should
willingly pledge you, though it were
in worse liquour. They have all of
them had each man his Glass but <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobares,</hi>
but have excogitated such

drank to, that I finde I need to have

                     <hi>Hylobares,</hi> seem too
light for the serious Discourse we
have had so many hours together.<note place="margin">The marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture in <hi>Hylobares</hi> of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berness at once.</note>

                  <p>But I'll assure you, <hi>Philopolis,</hi>
my thoughts were never more seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then while I was piping these easie
Airs on my Flagellet. For they are
so familiar to me, that I had no need
to attend them, and my minde indeed
was wholly taken up with Objects su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to our late Theme. And even
then when I was playing these light
Tunes, was I recovering into my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
as well as I could, some part
of a Philosophick Song that once I
had by rote, (both words and tune
and all) which has no small affinity
with the Matters of this day's Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>It is much, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> you
should be able to attend to such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
things, so light and so serious,
at one and the same time.</p>

                  <p>That's no more, <hi>Philopolis,</hi>
then <hi>Euistor</hi> did in his Story of the
Angel and the Eremite. For I look
upon the twisting of a man's Musta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chio's
to be as slight and triviall a
thing as the playing on the Flagellet.
And yet I believe he was at it at least
twenty times with his fore-finger and
his thumb in his rehearsing that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Parable, though his Minde,
I saw, was so taken up with the
weightiness of the sense, that his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
seemed as devout as that of the
Eremite, who was the chief Subject
of the Story.</p>

                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>I pray you, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> take
this Glass of Wine for a reward of
your abusing your Friend so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somely
to excuse your self, and see if
it be so good for the rubbing up the
memory as <hi>Sophron</hi> avouches it. For
then I hope we shall hear you sing as
attentively as you have regardlesly
whistled all this time.</p>

                  <p>The Wine is very good, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istor,</hi>
if it be as good for the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
But I believe I had already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called

more of those Verses to minde

for the credit of <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
I easily acknowledge may be
from the mutuall recourse and mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of our exhaled Atomes, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Particles,</hi> as <hi>Cartesius</hi> more judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously
calls them: for these Particles
are not indivisible. Some also are
ready to quarrel one another at the
first meeting, as well as <hi>Hylobares</hi> and
I to be merry: and you know some
Chymicall Liquours, though quiet
and cool separate, yet mingled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether

that the Glass will grow

                  <p>This is learnedly descanted
on by <hi>Cuphophron:</hi> but, by the favour

rather resolve the Probleme into

to <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi>
(if a man be sincere and faithfull,) I
see not how any one is excluded from
the most substantial Happiness hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Nature is capable of. But for
other Knowledge, if it were every
man's, it were scarce the enjoyment
of any man. But the confident Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of the rude and the unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
Paradoxicalness of the skilfull
do fitly furnish out the Stage of
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:55306:200"/>
things, and make more for the sport
and pleasure of life, and enhance the
price and compensate the labour of
finding out or apprehending the more
abstruse Theories in Philosophy.</p>
                  <p>But this peculiar <hi>Philosophicall Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi>
is but a very small accession to
that <hi>Moral Happiness</hi> which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
to all men, if they be not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to themselves; as, <hi>To be loyall to
a man's Prince, To be true to his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
so far as it is true, To deal faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with all men, To be kinde to his
Neighbors, To relieve the oppressed, To be
an hearty lover of God and of the whole
Creation.</hi> A man thus affected, and
armed with so much Prudence as not
to deny or assert any thing beyond
his clear comprehension and skill in
speculative matters, but to admire
and adore the ineffable Wisedome of
his Creatour, this man, I say, is a more
complete, perfect and unexceptiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
person, and more solidly happy,
then any Philosophers I know that
have left their Writings to the World
as a lasting Testimony of their Wit,
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:55306:201"/>
                     <hi>Des-Cartes</hi> himself not excepted;
whose gross Extravagancies (such
as making Brutes mere <hi>Machina's,</hi>
the making every Extension really
the same with Matter, his averring
all the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the World to
arise from mere Mechanicall causes)
will be more stared upon and hooted
at by impartial Posterity, then any
other pieces of wit he may have light
on can be admired or applauded:

                  <p>That the face of things,

dismally, I cannot but acknowledge:
but the Causes being found out, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:55306:202"/>
ought to cease. For that
Mankinde is in a <hi>lapsed</hi> condition it
cannot be denied, nor that a great
part of the <hi>invisible Powers</hi> are sunk
into the <hi>Animal</hi> life with them. Now
that which is the most high and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
in the <hi>Animal</hi> life will not let
its hold goe so long as it can hang on.
Whence the most <hi>Active</hi> Spirits in this
Region get the Dominion over the
more <hi>Passive,</hi> and the Kingdome of
the Prince of the Air has proved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large over the Nations of the
Earth, they being so deeply lapsed
and immersed into the <hi>Animal</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
Wherefore we cannot expect
but that both the <hi>Rulers</hi> and the <hi>ruled</hi>
having fallen from the holy Light and
the Divine benignity of the Aethere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
nature, that the effects of that
Government and the garb of their

and <hi>ridiculous;</hi> a judicious
sense of true Pulchritude and Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
not being able to reside in so dark

their envious <hi>Guardians</hi> caring more

to tyrannize over them and to make
sport with them, then to spare them
or to be true <hi>Guides</hi> to them in any
thing. All therefore that can be
done is, to mitigate as well as we

of this strange Theatre, which strikes

<hi>viz.</hi> That this <hi>squalid Face</hi> of things

                  <p>In the mean time it is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
the noting in general, That there
being this Lapse in mankinde, it is
far better that their Obliquities and
Deformities in Manners and Religion
be very much varied, then that they
should be every-where one and the
same. For that would make <hi>Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression</hi>
look more like a <hi>due and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
Law of Life and firm Reason:</hi> But
now the freeness of the internal spirit
of man, that is so active and refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive,
having broken the <hi>Animal</hi> Life
into such varieties of Fooleries and
Vanities, whether National, Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
or Personal, we become a mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:55306:203"/>
Theatre one to another, and are in
a better capacity of censuring what is
evil in our selves by reflecting upon
others; the Deformities we espie in
others being nothing else but a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive
Parable touching our selves.
For the whole Mass of mankinde is
like a company fallen asleep by the
Fire-side, whom some unlucky Wag
has smutted with his sooty and greazy
fingers, and when they awake, every
one laughs at the false Beards and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
strokes in other mens Faces, not
at all thinking of his own. But assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly
it is a very easie intimation to
him to reflect upon himself, and to
look into the Glass whether he be not
smutted also. Wherefore seeing there
must be Faults in the world, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
it is more agreeable to Reason
and Providence, that there be a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
of them, though the strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
thereof surprises us, then that the
Jar should be alwaies on the same
String; that Folly and Wickedness
may not seem familiar to us in every
place we meet with it, but that we
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:55306:204"/>
may be astartled at the new and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
guizes thereof in others, and
thereby take occasion to examine if
we have nothing akin to it in our

                  <p>I do not deny but that
some Nations may goe stark naked,
as questionless there may be many
with little or no Covering on them,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:55306:204"/>
the parts of Modesty excepted: but
as to these latter, that this is any such
Flaw in Providence, I understand not.
For the Clemency of the Clime under
which these people live, the goodly
Structure of their Bodies, the true
Shape and Symmetry of Parts, their
prodigious Agility, Strength, and
Nimbleness in Running, Swimming
and Dancing, their freedom from
care of providing, and the trouble of
putting on and putting off their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
their long Lives, unwrinkled
Skins, easie Child-birth, virgin-like
Breasts, and unsophisticated Venery,
the imposture and gullery of fine
Clothes, (like pernicious Sauce) ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
begetting in them a false appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
nor administring occasion of
Lascivious phancies; I say, these are
so considerable Concomitants of the
Nakedness of these people, (which
Historians joyntly take notice of)
that it may not onely apologize for
this seeming Barbarity, but put us to
a stand whether they be not either
more rational or more fortunate in
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:55306:205"/>
this Point then the Civilized Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
I am sure, some Sects of the
Civilized World look upon it as a
piece of Perfection to imitate them,
if not to out-doe them, as the <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>
and such like. And those two
severer Sects of Philosophers, the
<hi>Stoicks</hi> and <hi>Cynicks,</hi> will abett
them in it, who contend there is no
Turpitude in any thing but Sin;
from which they willingly acquit
the works of God and Nature. <hi>That
more general shame in mankinde, of
having their more uncomely parts seen,
is undoubtedly an indication by God
and Nature, that we are born to higher
and more excellent things then these
corporeall pleasures.</hi> But to be ashamed
to be naked, and yet not to forbear
those Sins that this Shame was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a Bar to, such as Whoredome,
Adultery and Sodomie, is to turn
their Clothing into Cloaks of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie,

                  <p>It is not, I must confess, so
sightly. But who knows but that
there may be some usefulness of it,
as in the <hi>Amazons</hi> cutting off their

I know not whether Jet or Ivory
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:55306:207"/>

from them, (which is both whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

that require secrecy in that Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

will onely give one step back tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Ornaments. Is not that Brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which <hi>Americus Vesputius</hi> records
in his Voiage to the New-found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>world
very ghastly tragicall?
For he saies sundry of those Nations
had quite spoiled their Visages, by
boring of many great Holes in their
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:55306:208"/>
Cheeks, in their Chaps, in their No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Lips and Ears; and that he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
one man that had no le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s then
seven Holes in his Face, so big as
would receive a Damask prune. In
these they put blew Stone, Crystall,
Ivory, or such like Ornaments.
Which I the easilier believe to be
true, having spoke with those my
self that have seen <hi>Americans</hi> with
pieces of carved Wood stuck in their
Cheeks.</p>

                     <hi>Cuphophron</hi> scratches his

this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ill <hi>Cuphophron</hi> has excogitated
something better. That which is rare
(we know) is with all Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and what is precious they
love to appropriate and transferr
upon themselves as near as they can:
whence rich men eat many times not
what is wholesomest, but the hardest
to be got. So if there be any thing
more costly then another, they will
hang it on their Bodies, though they
cannot put it into their Bellies, such
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:55306:208"/>
as their Ear-rings and Jewells. But
these <hi>Barbarians</hi> seem to exceed them
in the curiositie of their application
of these Preciosities, they fully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting
them into their very Flesh,
as if they were part of their natural
Body.</p>

                  <p>Well, <hi>Sophron;</hi> but how rude
and sottish are they in the mean time,
that they thus cruelly wound their
poor Carcases to satisfie the folly of
their Pride and Phancy?</p>

                  <p>But the boring of the Face
and the slashing of the Skin I believe
will prove more tolerable, then the
cutting and piercing of the Heart
with Care and Anxiety, which the
Pride of more civilized places causes
in men of high Spirits and low For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
Besides, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> it may be
our ignorance to think they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe
so much Pain in the prosecution
of these phantastick humours. For
these Holes and Slashes may be made
in their Bodies when they are young,
like Incisions on the Bark of a tree or
a young Pumpion, that grow in big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:55306:209"/>
with the growth of these Plants.
And how safely and inoffensively
such things may be practised on young
Children, the wringing off the Tails of
Puppets, and Circumcision of Infants
used by so many Nations, are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

those <hi>Barbarians</hi> seem so far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Degeneracy in this, that they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
resemble the <hi>Primevall Simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
of the <hi>Golden Age,</hi> where there
was neither Judge nor Gaoler, but
common Liberty prevented all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Injury. Here Adultery was
found impossible, there being onely
difference of Sexes, no distinction of
the married and unmarried state, or
appropriation of any single Female
to one solitary Man. Which some
eminent Sages of <hi>Greece</hi> (to omit the
suffrage of some of the more spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally-pretending
Sectaries of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Age) have look'd upon as a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
part of the most perfect platform
of a Commonwealth their wisedom
could excogitate. Assuredly the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Nature is so wire-drawn
through so many ceremonious Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:55306:210"/>
and confined by the religious tie
of Marriage, whether the parties can
well hit it or no, that her vigour is
very much broken, the Generations
of men weakned, and their days
shortened, in most parts of the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
World: whenas those Tenants
in common you speak of seldome are
sick, and ordinarily live to an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

then the <hi>health and strength of

for his Pains, as you may reade in the

to the Custome of the Province of
<hi>Camul</hi> belonging to the Great <hi>Cham,</hi>
where the Master of the house, in an
high strain of Hospitality, commits his
Wife and his whole Familie to the
Stranger, to use his Wife and all he
has with the same liberty himself
doth; and that his Enjoyment may
be entire, quits his house for the
time, that the Stranger may seem to
have no Corrival? as <hi>Paulus Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>

                  <p>This is marvellous pretty,
<hi>Euistor.</hi> But I conceive the Custome
comes from hence, in that they take
Marriage to be no part of <hi>Religion,</hi>
but of <hi>Nature,</hi> and look upon their
Wives merely as the best Chattel
they have, and therefore in an high
strain of Friendship offer them to be
enjoy'd by their Friends. In which

                  <p>I think that his lying with
the Queen the first night pretends to
an auspicious Consecration of her
Womb to future Fertility; and that
his five hundred Crowns are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of this religious performance.</p>

                  <speaker>Euist.</speaker>
                  <p>But it is a strange act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,

                  <p>The direction of the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Euistor,</hi> is all in all. The Priest
does not intend to commit Adultery,
but to consecrate the Womb. But
what blemish is this in Providence,
that Paynim-Priests are as crafty as
some of the Christian, who upon Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Pretences too often promote
an Interest of the World and the
Flesh, as these <hi>Calecut</hi>-Priests seem
to doe, they both reaping the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of lying with the Queen, and
strengthening the Interest of the
Priesthood by mingling the <hi>Sacerdotal</hi>
with the <hi>Royal</hi> seed, the first-born of
the Queen being in all likelihood as
much the Son of a Priest as Heir to
the Crown?</p>

they of <hi>Arcladam</hi> give this reason for

The <hi>Essedones</hi> celebrate the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals

Feasting and Joy, eating their Flesh

(which is the manner of their Buriall

as drink their bloud in the field. In

eat their own dead. But in the Island

at the bottom of some of these.
For the Parricide that is committed
by the <hi>Sardoans</hi> and <hi>Berbiccae</hi> seems to
arise out of Compassion to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
they not enduring to see so sad
a spectacle as helpless and wearisome

uncurable by any thing else but
Death. And those of <hi>Iava,</hi> that sell,

the <hi>civilized Nations</hi> after <hi>Mony,</hi> who
ordinarily murther the Owner to

therefore were more ignorant, but

Columbus</hi> tells us of <hi>Cannibals</hi> not
far from the Island <hi>Hispaniola,</hi> that
eat Man's-flesh, and salt or souse it as
we do Beef, Pork, Bacon, and Brawn:
That they geld those they take
young, as we do Capons, to make
them eat more tender; and keep Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
alive to breed on, as we do Hens
to lay Eggs. This Island of <hi>Cannibals</hi>

Nor can I devise what may be said
in the behalf of so high Barbarities.
Onely it is to be noted, That these
sad Objects are more a torment to
the well-natur'd living then any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mischief to the dead: and that
flaying of men of their Estates and
Livelihood, or taking away their
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:55306:219"/>
Lives, is an harder Cruelty to the
sufferer: and that it is not so much
the conscience of <hi>Decorum,</hi> as quea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziness
of stomach, that makes our
modern <hi>Europaeans</hi> abstain from their
Enemies Carcasses. Besides, whether
is it more barbarous out of scorn and
hatred to kill men to feed their Dogs
withall, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> used the
poor <hi>Indians,</hi> or for the <hi>Indians</hi> or
other <hi>Barbarians,</hi> out of an appetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
liking of Man's-flesh, more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
to bury it in their own
bowells? a Funeral-solemnity that
some of them use, and think it the
last good deed they can doe for their
deceased Friends. Wherefore we
can onely make this deplorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
That the unmercifulness of
the <hi>Europaeans</hi> is not less, but their
Hypocrisie more, then that of the
uncivilized <hi>Indians.</hi> For that horrour
they profess and abhorrency from
the Flesh of dead men (which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct,
questionless, God and Nature
has implanted in us as a bar against
all Cruelty to our kind) does not

whom this substantial Cruelty seems

it intolerable in Providence, that she

those seeming Cruelties are but the

of him out of all that he has. Which
I speak to shame the civilized Nations,

which they themselves judge the

                  <p>Why, it is the worshipping
the very <hi>Devil</hi> himself. Which that
the Pagans did, is manifest from their
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:55306:223"/>
Temples and Images, from the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their Priests, and from their
Sacrifices. The <hi>Peruvians</hi> worshipped
two carved Idols, a <hi>black Goat</hi> and a
<hi>long Serpent,</hi> both of them perfect
<hi>Symbols</hi> of <hi>Satan,</hi> and such as himself
loves to appear in. In the City of <hi>Goa</hi>
their Pagods or Idols are of so dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
a form, that no man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
how ugly and deformed they are:
yet these they consult as Oracles, and
by the power of the Devil have An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
from them. The <hi>Chinois</hi> also
worship a Devil-Idol standing on an
high, but something duskish, place
of their Temples, having two huge
Horns on his Head, with a most terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Countenance, with sharp Claws
in stead of Hands and Feet, and his
Head uglily starting out from the
midst of his Breast, as <hi>Gotardus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
him. But the most horrible
description of a Temple is that of
the King of <hi>Calecut</hi>'s, where they
worship his God <hi>Deumo:</hi> for the true
God <hi>Tamerani</hi> he serves not, because,
though he made the World, yet he
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:55306:224"/>
has given up the Government of it,
as they con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eit, to <hi>Deumo.</hi> This Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
has its Entrance garnished with
numbers of Devils made in Wood
artificially turned and carved. In the
midst of the Chappel there is a Seat
like a Throne of Brass, with a brazen
Devil sitting upon it, with a Crown
on his Head, like that of the <hi>Roman
Pontife,</hi> (as <hi>Ludovicus Romanus</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
it) out of which come three
Horns. There are four others also
that turn in after such a manner, as
that they seem to support his Head.
He has also four Teeth standing out
of his foul wide gaping Mouth, and
a threatning Look, with terrible
staring Eyes, and Hands with croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
Nails like to Hooks; but his
Feet not unlike to a Cock's. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
corner of the Chappel is likewise
placed a Devil made of Brass, with
such art, as that he seems to be in
the midst of Flames wherein Souls
are scorched in most direfull manner,
whom the Devil also is devouring
up, putting one Soul into his mouth
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:55306:224"/>
with his right hand, and reaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath
at another with the left.</p>

the particular Instances that <hi>Euistor</hi>
produced of the most ugly Usages
amongst the barbarous Nations. I
shall onely rehearse certain brief
Heads that will serve in general to
break the force of such Arguments
as either others offer or offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to our thoughts, to invalidate
the belief of such an Exactness of
Providence as we plead for, and
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:55306:243"/>
boldly pretend to inferr, that <hi>if there
were a God, these things could not be

                  <p>But that you be not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
so easily imposed upon, let me
desire you to remember those Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations
that I was ever and anon
thinking on all this time you were
discoursing.<note place="margin">The First Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> As First, That <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
may write things that are false,
whether they pretend to be Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
themselves, or take thing up
upon the reports of others. Old
men and Travellers may lie by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
as it is said in the Proverb.
Wherefore either negligent enquiry,
or the vanity and affectation of telling
strange things, may fill Histories with
many false Narrations; and so though
<hi>Euistor</hi> did not intend to deceive <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phophron,</hi>

<pb n="443" facs="tcp:55306:243"/>
his wit in severall Objects that
never had any existence but in the
pages of Historiographers. And
therefore I could not but smile to see
how nimbly <hi>Cuphophron</hi> analyz'd the
Politicks of that Custome of the
high-Priest's lying with the King of
<hi>Calecut</hi>'s Bride the first night, as if it
were a design that the Son of a Priest
and the Heir to the Crown should
concurr in one person: whenas the
<hi>Sons</hi> of the King do not succeed in the

contradicting one another, or

makes things so uncertain, that no

I am sure <hi>Epicureans</hi> and <hi>Atheists</hi> are
very circumspect how they believe
any Stories about Apparitions or
Witches, though never so true, lest
they should be disturbed in their

in the Barks of Trees, which grow
with the growth of the Tree they
are carved on. But it may be in a

meaning of these Parables, as the
Stock or Bark of a Tree does of the
person whose name it bears. And to
tell the rude people of the mysticall
meaning of their Traditionall Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories,
as if the Story were but a
Parable, but the Mystery the Truth,
would be as harsh to their minds, as it
would be hard to a Tree, if it had

man whose name it bears carved on
it, in lieu of the Name which it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
and which has grown and

Civility as can be, they being without
Government, Laws, or Clothing, yet
their Humanity and Kindness to
Strangers is said to exceed all belief;

they receiving them when they were
landed with all expressions of Joy

with Mirth and Junkettings, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them every thing they found
pleasing to themselves, and doing all
honour and respect imaginable to
them, inviting them by their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and Hospitality no less then
eighteen leagues into their Country,
and entertaining them thus liberally
nine daies from place to place. And
as they waited on them in such nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
companies, if they saw any of
the Strangers wearied, they would of
themselves ease them by carrying
them in their Hamocks, and were
wonderfully officious in conveying
them over Rivers, by sleights and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices
they had, for both their ease
and safety. Happy he that had the
opportunity of shewing his Kindness
to any one of them, in getting him
on his Back or Neck to swim over the
River with him. With these high, but
natural, strains of real Civility and
Humanity did they conduct the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:55306:252"/>
also back again to their Ships.

                  <p>This is <hi>Hypermetaphysicall,</hi> O

That God is so the Essence and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of all things, that they are but

                  <p>I have recovered it. Now
I say, whatsoever is represented to
the Soul is not God himself, but some
exteriour manifestation: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
is more eminent and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary,
Nature from religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
has easily extorted venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereto, it being as it were a
more sensible appearance or visible
stirring of that great Godhead that
inhabits this august Temple of the
World. Wherefore God and his holy
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:55306:256"/>
Temple filling all places, the passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Motions of all Creatures are a
kinde of <hi>Divine Worship,</hi> they every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
seeking and crouching to him
to enjoy some Benediction of him, or
else singing his Praises in triumphant
Accents, and in transporting expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of their present Enjoyments;
some even wasting themselves in the
complacency they take, though in but
smaller matters which he bestows on
them, or rather permits them to
take them, though he could wish
they would make choice of better.
But these, though small in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
seem great to them that are
pleased with them; these lesser com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
of the embodied Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of the Deity so filling their
pusillanimous spirits with Joy and
Rapture, that they even willingly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
all the rest, and turn as it were
Martyrs and Self-sacrificers to but so
faint a Shadow or scant Resemblance
of the first uncreated <hi>Perfection:</hi>
whose beautifull Nature is solidly
born witness unto by so ready and
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:55306:257"/>
constant a Profession, (though many
times with sad After-inconveniences)
and by so religious an adhesion to so
slender and evanid Emanations
thereof. Which Mistakes therefore
should in all likelihood move Pity
rather then Vengeance in the Deity,
whose meaner gifts are so highly
prized and received with such eager
Devotion. Wherefore as uglily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered
as the affairs of mankinde
seem, <hi>Hylobares</hi> has no reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
that God's Vengeance must be
presently poured down upon their
heads, they not so much reproching
him, as befooling themselves, by their
ill choice.</p>

of yesternight's Resverie
which he fell into when he had so
plentifully imbib'd the Evening-Air

him this second Intoxication. For
though his words pass the tongue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
glibly, yet the sense of some passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
seems very unsound to me, and to
be rather the wild fetches of Wit and
Phancy, then the suggestion of true
Reason: As that they that make such
an affectionate choice of meaner good
things, Pleasure, suppose, in stead of
Vertue, seem notwithstanding religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
to give glory to God, in that
they so highly esteem these lesser
shadows of that Fulness and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
that is in Him; whenas really it
is a reproch to God, to have those
things that are least like him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
by a rational Creature before
those things that are most like him,
as <hi>true Vertue</hi> and the <hi>Divine Life</hi>
most certainly is. This therefore is
extravagantly false and scandalous.
Besides that it is a gross affront to the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:55306:258"/>
Almighty, whenas he bids us make
choice of one thing, that we will
make choice of another.</p>

not, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> so we may enjoy the

his Dream, especially in such

                  <p>Well then, since it must be
so, Gentlemen, upon the permission
of <hi>Philopolis</hi> and the importunity of
<hi>Hylobares,</hi> I shall recite to you my
Dream as exquisitely and briefly as I
can. You must know then, first, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopolis,</hi>
of what an anxious and
thoughtfull Genius I was from my ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Childhood, and what a deep and
strong sense I had of the <hi>Existence of
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:55306:262"/>
God,</hi> and what an early Conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of approving my self to him;
and how, when I had arrived to riper
years of Reason, and was imbued
with some slender Rudiments of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
I was not then content to
think of God in the gross onely, but
began to consider his Nature more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
and accurately, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
and compare his Attributes;
and how, partly from the natural Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
of my own Minde, partly from
the countenance and authority of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture, I did confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that <hi>infinite Power, Wisedome</hi>
and <hi>Goodness,</hi> that these three were
the chiefest and most comprehensive
Attributes of the Divine Nature, and
that the sovereign of these was his
<hi>Goodness,</hi> the Summity and Flower,
as I may so speak, of the <hi>Divinity,</hi> and
that particularly whereby the Souls
of men become <hi>Divine;</hi> whenas the
largest communication of the other,
without this, would not make them
<hi>Divine,</hi> but <hi>Devils.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, being versed in
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:55306:263"/>
no other natural Philosophy nor Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysicks
but the vulgar, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
the Laws of the externall
Creation, whether visible or invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
should be sutable to that excellent
and lovely <hi>Idea</hi> of the Godhead
which with the most serious devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and affection I entertained in my
own breast, my Minde was for a long
time charged with inextricable Puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles
and Difficulties, to make the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi>
of the World and vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of men in any tolerable way to
consort or sute with these two chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Attributes of God, his <hi>Wisedome</hi>
and his <hi>Goodness.</hi> These Meditations
closed mine eyes at night; these salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my memory the first in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
These accompanied my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and solitary walks into Fields
and Woods sometimes so early, as
when most of other mortals keep
their Beds.</p>
                  <p>It came to pass therefore,<note place="margin">XXVIII.</note> O <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis,</hi>

that one Summer-morning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
rose much more early then

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:55306:263"/>
in a certain Wood (which I had a

thought fit to rest my self on the

by long motion of my Body, but
mainly by want of Sleep, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anxious
and solicitous thinking of
such Difficulties as <hi>Hylobares</hi> either
has already, or, as I descry'd at first,
is likely to propose; I straight way
reposed my wearie Limbs amongst
the Grass and Flowers at the foot of
a broad-spred flourishing Oak, where
the gentle fresh morning Air playing

round about me upon the dewy Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-suckles;

was most melodiously joyned the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced
Singings of the chearfull Birds
reechoed from all parts of the Wood;

together, you may easily phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,

                  <speaker>Bath.</speaker>
                  <p>While he was at any distance
from me, I stood fearless and unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
onely, in reverence to so vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Personage, I put off my Hat,
and held it in my hand. But when he
came up closer to me, the vivid ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
of his Eyes, that shone so
piercingly bright from under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of his black Montero, and the
whole Air of his Face, though joyn'd
with a wonderfull deal of Mildness
and Sweetness, did so of a sudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonish
me, that I fell into an exces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
trembling, and had not been able
to stand, if he had not laid his Hand
upon my Head, and spoken comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
to me. Which he did in a Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
manner, saying, <q>
                        <hi>Blessed be thou
of God, my Son, be of good courage,
and fear not; for I am a Messenger of
God to thee for thy good.</hi> Thy serious
Aspires and breathings after the
true Knowledge of thy Maker and
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:55306:265"/>
the ways of his Providence (which
is the most becoming employment
of every Rational Being) have
ascended into the sight of God; and
I am appointed to give into thy
hands the <hi>Two Keys of Providence,</hi>
that thou maiest thereby be able to
open the Treasures of that Wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
thou so anxiously, and yet so
piously, seek'st after.</q> And therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
he put his right Hand into his left
Sleeve, and pull'd out two bright
shining Keys, the one of <hi>Silver,</hi> the
other of <hi>Gold,</hi> tied together with a
Sky-coloured Ribbon of a pretty
breadth, and delivered them into my
hands; which I received of him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
low obeisance, and professing
my thankfulness for so great a gift.</p>
                  <p>And now by this time I had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
more then ordinary strength
and courage, which I perceiv'd in a
marvellous way communicated unto
me by the laying of his Hand upon
my Head, so that I had acquired a
kinde of easie confidence and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity
to converse with him; and
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:55306:266"/>
therefore, though with due Civility,
yet without all Fear, methought I
said farther to him, These are a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pair of Keys, O my Father, and
very lovely to look upon: but where
is the Treasure they are to open? To
which, smiling upon me, he straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
replied, The Treasures, my Son,
be in the Keys themselves. Then
each Key, said I, O my Father, will
need a farther Key to open it. Each
Key, said he, my Son, is a Key to it
self; and therewithall bad me take
notice of the Letters embossed on the
Silver Key, and there was the like ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice
in the Golden one. Which I
closely viewing in both, observed that
the Keys consisted of a company of
Rings closely committed together,
and that the whole Keys were all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spattered
with Letters very confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and disorderly.</p>
                  <p>Set the Letters of the Keys in right
order, then said he, and then pull at
their Handles, and the Treasure will
come out. And I took the Silver
Key; but though I could move the
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:55306:266"/>
Rings by thrusting my Nails against
the Letters, yet I could not reduce
the Letters into any order, so that
they would <hi>all</hi> lie in straight Lines,
nor was there any Sense in any Line.
Which when that aged Personage
saw, You must first know the <hi>Motto,</hi>
said he, my Son: That is the <hi>Key of
the Key.</hi> I beseech you then, said I,
O my Father, tell me the <hi>Motto.</hi> The
<hi>Motto,</hi> said he, my Son, is this, <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
fenestras, ut luceat domus.</hi> Having
got the <hi>Motto,</hi> I set to work again,
and having reduced those Letters that
made up that <hi>Motto</hi> into a right Line,
I, holding the lower part of the Key
in my left hand, pull'd at the Handle
with my right, and there came out a
Silver Tube, in which was a Scroll of
thin Paper, as I thought, but as strong
as any Vellum, and as white as driven
Snow.</p>
                  <p>Having got this Scroll, I took the
boldness to open it. The Figure
thereof was perfectly square, with
even Margins on all sides, drawn with
Lines of a sky-coloured blew, very
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:55306:267"/>
perfect and lovely. In the midst was
described the Figure of the Sun in
blazing Gold: About the Sun were
six Circles drawn with Lines of the
same-coloured blew. Two of these
Circles were very near the body of
the Sun; the other four more remote
both from him and from one another,
though not in equal distances. In eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of these Circles was there the
figure of a little Speck like a Globe,
but of two distinct colours; the one
side toward the Sun shining like Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
the other being of a duskish dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coloured
black. About those little
Globes in the third and fifth Circle
there were also drawn lesser Circles
of blew, one about the third, and
four about the fifth: and in each of
these Circles was there also a small
Globous Speck, of a lesser size then
those in the middle. Something there
was also about the Globe of the sixth
Circle, but I cannot remember it so
distinctly. Beyond these Circles there
was an innumerable company of Star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
Figures of Gold, of the same
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:55306:267"/>
hue with that of the Sun, but excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-much
less, which carelesly scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
some were found a pretty di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from the Margin, others to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Margin; othersome were
cut in two by the blew Line of the
Margin, as if it were intimated that
we should understand, that there
were still more of those golden Stars
to an indefinite extent. This Scheme
entertained my gazing eyes a good
time; for I never had seen such be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and was resolved to impress the
Lines thereof perfectly in my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
that I might afterwards dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
more readily thereof with this
venerable Personage. For I knew
the purpose thereof by the Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on the upper Margin, which was,
<hi>The true Systeme of the World.</hi> Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus satisfy'd my self, I rolled up
the Scroll again, and repositing it in
the Silver Tube, easily thrust in the
Tube into the other part of the Key,
and disordering the Line of Letters
that contain'd the <hi>Motto,</hi> all was
lockt up again safe as before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:55306:268"/>Having pleased my self so well with
opening this first Treasure, I had the
more eager desire to assay the other;
and knowing all attempt to be vain
without the knowledge of the <hi>Motto</hi>
or <hi>Key of the Key,</hi> I besought that
Divine Sage to impart it to me. That
I shall doe right willingly, said he,
my Son: And I pray you take spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of it. It is, <hi>Amor Dei
Lux Animae.</hi> An excellent <hi>Motto</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
said I; The Key is a Treasure
it self. However I set me to work
as before, and reducing the Letters
to such an order that a Line of them
did plainly contain this <hi>Motto,</hi> I pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
at both ends of the Golden Key,
as I did in the Silver one, and in a
Golden Tube continued to the Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of the Key there was a Scroll of
such Paper, if I may so call it, as in
the other, exceeding white and pure,
and, though very thin, yet not at all
transparent. The Writing was also
terminated with even Margins on all
sides as before; onely it was more
glorious, being adorn'd richly with
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:55306:268"/>
Flower-work of Gold, Vermilion,
and blew. And I observed that
twelve Sentences filled the whole <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
written with Letters of Gold.
The first was, <hi>The Measure of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
is the Divine Goodness, which has
no bounds but it self, which is infinite.
2. The Thread of Time and the Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Vniverse, the same Hand
drew out the one and spred out the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
3. Darkness and the Abysse were
before the Light, and the Suns or Stars
before any Opakeness or Shadow. 4. All
Intellectual Spirits that ever were, are,
or ever shall be, sprung up with the
Light, and rejoyced together before God
in the morning of the Creation. 5. In
infinite Myriads of free Agents which
were the Framers of their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,
it had been a wonder if they had
all of them taken the same Path; and
therefore Sin at the long run shook hands
with Opacity. 6. As much as the Light
exceeds the Shadows, so much do the
Regions of Happiness those of Sin and
Misery.</hi>

mind orderly upon them, to commit
them all perfectly to my memory, (for
I did not expect that I might carry
the Keys away with me home) by
that time I had got through the sixth
Aphorism, there had come up two
Asses behinde me out of the Wood,
one on the one side of the Tree, and
the other on the other, that set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braying
so rudely and so loudly, that
they did not onely awake, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
affright me into a discovery that
I had all this while been but in a
Dream. For that aged grave Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonage,
the Silver and Golden Keys,

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:55306:269"/>
awakened by the loud

                  <p>I believe <hi>Cuphophron</hi> takes it
very ill of you, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> that the
old grave Person you met with in
the Wood was not a thorough-paced
<hi>Cartesian,</hi> or else he is in a very Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pticall
mood: which I do not desire
to be in, especially in so weighty
Points as these concerning <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
And therefore let me intreat
you, <hi>Bathynous,</hi> to unlock that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
I propounded last to <hi>Philotheus,</hi>
by virtue of your <hi>Golden Key.</hi>

                  <p>You must excuse me there,
<hi>Hylobares;</hi> I would not be so inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to <hi>Cuphophron</hi> as to make him
a false Prophet, who so expresly
foretold a while agoe, that the Fates
had designed that honour solely for
<hi>Philotheus.</hi>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>And it seems, in the like
Complement to <hi>Cuphophron,</hi> I must
again resume my not unpleasant bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of serving <hi>Hylobares;</hi> which I
shall doe according to the best skill I
have.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philop.</speaker>
                  <p>I pray you do, <hi>Philotheus;</hi>
for I am very ambitious you should
work upon <hi>Hylobares</hi> a perfect Cure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>I shall endeavour it, <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis.</hi>
But I must first take the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to chafe the benummed part, and
soundly chide <hi>Hylobares</hi> that he is not
cured already, nor has been sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sensible of that Clearness and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
for the Unexceptionableness of
Divine Providence which has been
hitherto produced. Which I must
profess I think to be such, that those
that have not some peculiar humour
or phancy, or labour not under the
burthen of their own Idiosyncrasie,
cannot but be fully satisfied with,
without the flying to any such high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swoln
<hi>Hypothesis</hi> as that <hi>Systeme of
the World</hi> represented in the <hi>Silver-Key-Paper,</hi>
or <hi>Pre-existence of Souls,</hi>
                     <pb n="500" facs="tcp:55306:274"/>
which is part of the <hi>Golden</hi> one. So
that any farther Solution of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Difficulty, were it not for <hi>Hylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bares</hi>
his own fault, and the peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of his own Phancy that still mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
him, were plainly unnecessary
and superfluous. How many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of sober and intelligent persons
have been fully satisfied touching the
Accuracy of Divine Providence
without any such far-fetch'd Helps?</p>

                  <p>Which is a shrewd Indicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that those Arguments, distinct
from these more aiery <hi>Hypotheses</hi>
and finely-contrived Phancies, are the
more natural strength and arms, as it
were, of humane Understanding, (by
whose strokes it bears it self up in
these profound Mysteries from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
into Infidelity or Atheism;) but
those more big and swelled <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>

the more earnestly beg of <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theus,</hi>
that he would use all the Art

                  <p>Let us then but assume out
of the <hi>Golden-Key-Paper</hi> that which is
so clearly contained therein, the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
of Humane Souls,</hi> and all

                  <p>Because supposing Humane
Souls were created in the Morning
of the World, and in such infinite
Myriads, there has been time enough
since that for as many and more then
hitherto have peopled the Earth, to
have transgressed so hainously before
their entrance on this Stage, that
by a just <hi>Nemesis</hi> measured and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dify'd
by the <hi>Divine Goodness</hi> it self
they may be contrived into the worst

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>This reaches the Point home
indeed, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> and does perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pull up by the roots all pretension
to this last and greatest Scruple, if we

                  <p>Why, did not your self
call this Dream of <hi>Bathynous</hi> a <hi>Divine
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:55306:276"/>
Dream,</hi> before I came to make this
important use of it? And every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Dream is a true Dream. But
you serve me just so as <hi>Cuphophron</hi>
did <hi>Bathynous.</hi> Whiles it seemed to
serve his turn to credit <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s
Philosophy, so long it was a <hi>Divine
Testimonie;</hi> but when it proved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
then there was little certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Dreams. This seems a piece of

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>But I hope in my self the
more pardonable, O <hi>Philotheus,</hi> by
how much more important a thing
it is that the ground of a man's belief
of the Goodness of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
should be solid and unshaken,
then that <hi>Des-Cartes</hi>'s Principles
should be deemed a piece of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Wisedome. <hi>Cuphophron</hi>'s vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the Dream proceeded out
of a partial zeal in the behalf of the
<hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy: my distrust of
it, out of an excess of desire it should
be true. For I must confess, if this
one Point in it of <hi>Pre-existence</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to me certainly true, all my
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:55306:276"/>
Doubts and Difficulties touching the
Moral Evils in the World will sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
melt into nothing. Nay, if I
could believe <hi>Bathynous</hi> his Dream
to be a Divine Dream, the first A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorism
in the Golden-Key-Paper
puts all our Controversies to an end,
it declaring <hi>the Measure of Providence
to be the Divine Goodness, which has
no bounds but it self, which is infinite.</hi>
Wherefore it was the most calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Accident that could ever have
befallen the Philosophicall Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> two unlucky Asses
so rudely broke off <hi>Bathynous</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with that venerable Sage,
who, I surmize, in that intended
Discourse would have communicated
the Reasons and Grounds of these
Conclusions to <hi>Bathynous.</hi> For true
Reason is so palpable and connatural
to a Man, that when he findes it, he
feels himself fully satisfi'd and at ease.</p>

                  <p>I commend your Caution,

let me offer to your considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Point of which I presume you

that is, <hi>The Possibility of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
of the Soul;</hi> I demand of
you, if you be not very certain of that.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes surely I am; I see no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you are not certain
but that the Soul does pre-exist.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> you
make your self obnoxious both <hi>to
Providence,</hi> and <hi>to my self. To Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
in that you bring in uncertain
Allegations and Accusations against
her, and so soil the beauty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of her waies, that are so justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable
where they are perfectly
known, by opposing Phancies and
Conceits, such as you your self ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
you are not certain of.
<hi>To me,</hi> in that you covenanted with
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:55306:277"/>
me at the first, never to alledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
<hi>Hypotheses</hi> against known
Truth.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>This is true, <hi>Philotheus;</hi> you
make me half ashamed of my Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
But in the mean time I do
not finde my self in that full ease I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be, while as well the Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence
of the Soul as her Non-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existence
is an uncertain <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>

                  <p>If you cannot finde <hi>Divine
Providence</hi> perfect without it, it is
your own fault that, as to your self,
to save you from sinking, you do not
make use of it as a true <hi>Hypothesis.</hi>
And forasmuch as you finde it so hard
to discover Divine Providence to
be perfect without it, that is no small
Argument that the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> is
true.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>I must confess I think it is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, it were in it self, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobares,</hi>
a solid Argument, supposing
Providence cannot well otherwise
be salved; as it is for the <hi>Copernican
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:55306:278"/>
Hypothesis,</hi> that nothing else can give
a tolerable account of the Motion of
the Planets. And I must tell you
farther, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> that this <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
of the Soul's Pre-existence is not
the <hi>single</hi> Dream of <hi>Bathynous</hi> sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the grass, but was deemed a
Vision of Truth to the most awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Souls in the world.</p>

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>That's very good news, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus;</hi>

                  <p>If the Dream of sleeping
<hi>Bathynous</hi> be a mere Dream, the

hold the Soul of man to be an

                  <p>How then comes it to
pass that you, being of so Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall
a Genius, should miss of the
Pre-existence of the Soul? For there
being no other considerable Opinion
in view but <hi>Creation, Traduction,</hi> and
<hi>Pre-existence;</hi> Creation of pure Souls,
and the Infusion of them into impure
Bodies, and in such horridly-impure
Circumstances as sometimes happens,
is a repugnancy to the Purity of
God, who is supposed then to create
them: but Traduction a derogation
and contradiction to the <hi>Spirituality</hi>
and <hi>Indiscerpibility</hi> of the Soul it self.
Wherefore it necessarily remains,
that these two being such absurd O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:55306:280"/>
the third must take place, and
that the Souls of men do pre-exist.</p>

                  <p>Indeed, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> you seem
to me hugely over-curious in such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions
as these. Is not the whole
World the Alms-house of God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
which he had a right to build
when he would, and to place us his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leemosynary
Creatures in it no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
then he pleased? He does but <hi>utisuo
jure</hi> in all this. And it is an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous
Presumption, to expect that
he should not act according to his <hi>own</hi>
minde and will, but according to the
<hi>groundless enlargements</hi> and <hi>expansions</hi>
of <hi>our</hi> wanton and busie Phancies. So
long as we see that the things that
are are well and rightly administred,
and according to the Laws of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and Justice, it is a marvellous
piece of Capriciousness to complain,
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:55306:281"/>
that such things with the unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
Oeconomie of them began no
sooner, nor reach no farther.</p>

               <sp>

                  <p>You speak very gravely and
soberly, O <hi>Sophron,</hi> and that which
has very solid sense at the bottom, if
rightly understood. For God has no
obligation from the Creatures to
make them sooner, or more, or lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the like. So that if he had
made the World no larger then the
vulgar phansy it, a thought sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
above the Clouds, or had stay'd
the making of it till a year ago, or
had not made it yet, nor ever inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to make it; he did in all this but
<hi>uti suo jure,</hi> as you speak. But in that
he has made it much larger and soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
to what leading Attribute in God
is that to be imputed, O <hi>Sophron?</hi>
                  </p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Surely to his mere Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,

                  <p>You acknowledge then his
<hi>Goodness</hi> the leading Attribute in the
Creation of the World, and his
<hi>Wisedome</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to contrive
and execute what his <hi>Will</hi> actuated

                  <p>But this is a marvell of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells
to me, That the Goodness of
God being Infinite, the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
should be so narrow and finite as
commonly men conceit, if there be
no Incapacity in the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that thus streightens them.
That one small share of the Divine
Goodness should be active, but that
infinite Remainder thereof, as I may
so speak, silent and inactive, is a
Riddle, a Miracle that does infinitely
amaze me.</p>

which I perceiving, it forced me
to mention the <hi>Golden Key of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
to you. For we do not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly
and ostentatively produce
those Keys, but at a dead lift, when
no other method will sati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ie him
whose minde is anxious and solicitous
touching the Waies of God; that by
these <hi>Hypotheses</hi> he may keep his
Heart from sinking.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>It is a very laudable custome,
<hi>Philotheus,</hi> and such as I find the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of already. For I find the very
first Difficulties of this last and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Head I intended to propose, to
melt away of themselves in virtue of
that light from the <hi>Golden Key,</hi> I
mean that of <hi>Pre-existence.</hi> For I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have propounded it as an
Objection against the Goodness of
Divine Providence, That, whereas
the Soul can live and subsist out of
this terrestriall Body, (for so it does
after death) she should not be crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:55306:283"/>
before this terrestriall Mansion,
and enjoy her self before she come
into the Body, as well as afterwards.
But this Doctrine of <hi>Pre-existence</hi> has
plainly prevented the Objection. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
Objection also, touching the
<hi>Messias</hi> coming into the World so
lately, is in my own judgement much
enervated by this <hi>Hypothesis.</hi> For
who knows but the Demerits of
Humane Souls were such, that it was
consonant enough to the Goodness of
God, not to communicate the best
Religion to the World till that time it
was communicated?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>That is no inept conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>Hylobares.</hi> But besides, it is a
strange Presumption to determine
when it is just fit time for Providence
to use her strongest Effort for reclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of straying Souls: And to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
them as soon as they have
strayed, is next to the keeping them
forcibly from ever straying, which is
to hinder a free Agent from ever
acting freely. Wherefore seeing the
Souls of men were to use their own
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:55306:283"/>
liberty, there were certain pompous
Scenes of affairs to proceed upon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
supposition, whether they stood
or fell, and not all presently to be
huddled up in an instant. And what
Light Providence brings out of the
Darkness of Sin, I did more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
intimate unto you in our yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's
discourse.</p>

                  <p>To expect that the <hi>Messias</hi>

                  <p>No Art nor Oracle that I

offers rather toward a detection of
the <hi>infinite Vastness</hi> of the World then
of the <hi>Finiteness</hi> thereof. How vastly
distant then are those little fix'd Stars
that shew but as scattered Pin-dust in

are they one beyond another?

whenas this Systeme exhibits so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
more to our view. For we can no

there will be a defect of men to

these men will want the means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
for that they are in a lapsed

                  <p>It is a less Puzzle then that
about the Salvation of them of the
New-found World upon Earth, I
mean those of <hi>America,</hi> who heard
not the least whisper of either <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
or of <hi>Christ</hi> till within this Age or
two. In what capacity of Salvation
were they then, O <hi>Sophron,</hi> for some
thousands of years together, who yet
are certainly of a lapsed race? <hi>(whenas
whether all Souls that enter into thicker
Vehicles in any part of the Vniverse be
lapsed, is uncertain.)</hi> And we cannot
deny but that vast Continent has
been inhabited, as also the adjacent
Islands, all that time, though they
heard as little of <hi>Christ</hi> as they that
live in <hi>Saturn</hi> or the <hi>Moon.</hi>

                  <p>That cannot be deny'd, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotheus.</hi>
But you know either your
self or some of us has answered this
Point already, That those <hi>Americans</hi>
that lived sincerely according to the
Light they had, God might impart
more to them, and finally in some
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:55306:287"/>
extraordinary way or other commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
the knowledge of <hi>Christ</hi> to
them to their eternall Salvation. For
you know a just and honest Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
if the Debt be satisfy'd by a
Friend, though unknown to the
Debtour, yet he will free him from
all Suits at Law and Arrests, and
what-ever other Troubles or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
attend a Debtour whose
Debts are unsatisfy'd. Whence the
Passion and Atonement of <hi>Christ</hi>
might take effect with the sincere <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi>
though they knew nothing
of the History thereof. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
being <hi>reconciled by the death</hi> of
<hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5. 10.</note> they should be much more
<hi>saved by his life,</hi> as the Apostle

                  <p>It is very well and piously

                  <p>Because there is more El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-room

merely with Brutes; That is no

Goodness,</hi> no more then it would be
against the accuracy of Policy in a
great City to see all the Gaols there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
devoid of Prisoners, and that they
were left to the sole possession of Bats
and Cats, of Rats and Mice, and such
like Vermine. It were rather a sign
of a more exquisite Government and
good disposition of the People, that
there were now found no such Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalls
amongst them. And for the
pretence of having some rational

good quarter; what rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are there that rule among the

                  <p>But in the mean time I am
very serious in my conference with
<hi>Philotheus,</hi> which your Raptures
have thus interrupted. The scope of
whose Discourse on this Point is, to
shew that these other Earths may
not be inhabited by any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
then such as are essentially un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable
of true Religion, though he
may haply allow them to doe such
Venerations (those in the Moon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

to our Earth as the <hi>Cerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pithecus</hi>

natural Idolatry, and that, it may be,

even in this utter incapacity of true
Religion, and consequently of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
their condition in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
being much like that of Brutes.
Which <hi>Hypothesis</hi> once admitted, (and
it is such as it is hard to demonstrate
to be false) the present Difficulty I
must confess does quite vanish. But
because from the prejudice of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
and habitual experience of our
own Earth's being inhabited by Men
properly so called, we have such an
invincible propension to think the
same thing comes to pass in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Earths or Planets; I beseech
you, <hi>Philotheus,</hi> ease my thoughts
touching their means of Salvation
in this state of the Question, if you
can.</p>

For they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Suffering of the <hi>Messias,</hi>
till such time as the Christians brought
it thither, and fetch'd away their
Gold.</p>

                  <p>You know it is night with

                  <speaker>Hyl.</speaker>
                  <p>But they might have taken
hold then of the miraculous Eclipse
of the Moon, which was every whit
as prodigious and conspicuous, these
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:55306:291"/>
two Luminaries being then in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
and <hi>Christ</hi> was crucified about
Noon.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cuphophron</hi>'s conceit is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but over-slight and humourous
for so solemn and serious a matter.
The summe of my Solution of this
Difficulty, <hi>Hylobares,</hi> is this: Lapsed
Souls, where-ever they are, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
into Sincerity, are saved as we
are saved, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Humanity,</hi> or <hi>Humane Divinity,</hi> of
the Son of God: which is the inmost
and deepest <hi>Arcanum</hi> of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion. And it is the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
of the Christian World, that they
have this Mystery so plainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly
communicated to them by the
preaching of the Gospel. But the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy
of the said Mystery may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
derived to them that never hear it
sound externally and historically to
their outward ears. For the Spirit of
the Lord passes through the whole
Universe, and communicates this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
to all Souls, where-ever they
are, that are fitted to receive it, in a
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:55306:292"/>
more hidden and miraculous way,
such as himself and at what time
himself shall please to make use of.
This I think the most sober Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the present Difficulty, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposition that there are any
Men properly so called that inhabit
those Planets or Earths you speak of.
Which, whether there be or no, is
uncertain to us; and therefore the
Allegation of such Uncertainties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
certain Testimonies for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite
Goodness of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
(as I have often intimated)
ought to be esteemed of no value.</p>

                  <p>My Scruple is onely this, How
it can consist with the infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God, which you say is the
Measure of his Providence, (since
that Humane Souls can <hi>pre-exist</hi> and
enjoy themselves before they come
into these terrestriall Bodies) that
they were created no sooner then <hi>cum
Mundo condito,</hi> which is not six thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand

have enjoy'd themselves infinite mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions

                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>If we rightly understand
the nature of the Soul, <hi>Hylobares,</hi>
this is no such hard Probleme. For
you must understand it may be an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential
Property of the Soul, either
vitally to actuate some material Vehi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:55306:293"/>
or other, or else not to act at all.
Wherefore it had been a frustraneous

                  <p>This may be true for ought

touching the Divine Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
in that she has not thought fit
that the corporeall World should be

an infinite time before, and
ought so to have been, that Humane
Souls might so early come into play,

case stands thus. If you heartily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here

you ought, I will declare you as sound

the less needfull. But if in a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall

                     <hi>Cartesianly</hi> enough, I warrant
thee, <hi>Hylobares;</hi> you shall see else if
I do not. And I will smartly say at
first, That the World was to begin so
soon as God was, his Omnipotency
being coeternall to himself; and
therefore what-ever he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in any moment, he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
as soon as he was, which was
from everlasting. Wherefore the
Matter might have been created from
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:55306:295"/>
everlasting, and, having a due mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Motion imparted to it, might
within a little time after have fallen
into the contrivance of <hi>Vortices</hi> and
<hi>Suns,</hi> according to the description of
the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy; that is, say
I, <hi>Mechanically,</hi> with <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> but
<hi>Bathynous Spermatically,</hi> from an old
<hi>Pythagorick</hi> Dream in a Wood. But
it is not material now which way it
was. For whether way soever, in
process of time, after these Suns had
shone through the Universe with a

sith it was possible it might doe
so, (but infinite Myriads of years la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,)
that the infinite Goodness of

but that he has been infinitely
less good then he might have been to
the World and to humane Souls, if
they have continued but six thousand

                  <p>Was there not a first six

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>According to my <hi>Hypothesis</hi>
it began from everlasting, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <p>That's true, O <hi>Cuphophron;</hi>
but you answer craftily, and yet you
plainly imply that there was a first six
thousand years, though we cannot
come at them: but that is because
we begin at the wrong end. By the
same fallacy you may conclude that
there is not a last six thousand years,
beginning your account from everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:55306:296"/>
as you call it, because your
numbring will finde no <hi>Exitus</hi> to us.
And yet we are, suppose at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the last moment of the last
six thousand years; and so we shall be
alwaies of some last six thousand, or at
least have been so in such divisions.</p>

                  <p>Wherefore, <hi>Cuphophron,</hi>
pitch your animadversion on the right
end, that is to say, on the beginning
of this infinite Duration, as you
phansie it, I mean, on that Intervall
of time wherein all the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
was either <hi>lucid</hi> or <hi>transparent,</hi>
there being nothing but <hi>Suns</hi> then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your <hi>Cartesian</hi> Hypothesis,
no <hi>Earths</hi> or <hi>Planets:</hi> was that time

                  <speaker>Cuph.</speaker>
                  <p>I must confess it seems to me
incredible that it was so. Methinks
within less then an infinite <hi>Series</hi> of
time some of the <hi>Suns</hi> should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped
with Spots, become <hi>Comets,</hi>
and afterwards <hi>Earths</hi> or <hi>Planets.</hi>

                  <p>Well then, if that Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
of time was finite, it had a finite

you mean, <hi>Philotheus.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Philoth.</speaker>
                  <p>I mean so, and would from

a first six thousand years as well

it could; and God, who is Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
could as early create Planets

then a Cure. I am not onely at
perfect ease touching all Doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Divine Providence, but in an
ineffable Joy and Ecstasie, rapt into
Paradise upon Earth, hear the Musick
of Heaven, while I consider the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>Reason;</hi> and the <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse,</hi>
so well accorded by the skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
voice of <hi>Philotheus.</hi> How light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

how transported are my Spirits, how
triumphant and tripudiant, that I am
ready even to skip out of my skin for
Joy!</p>
