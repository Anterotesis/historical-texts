            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Agents and Factors for the <hi>Plantations,</hi> being lately required to give
in their Reaſons, for their refuſing to make their <hi>Negro's</hi> Chriſtians,
(as <hi>if any Reaſons againſt Chriſtianity</hi> could be admitted!) they, it
it ſeems, proved ſo maſculine and ſtrong, that the Deſign was inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given up for impoſſible. Of theſe Reaſons ſuch as they are,
<note n="*" place="margin">Being no other then wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I had before taken notice of <hi>Page 101, 102, 104, 109, 139. &amp;c</hi> of the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro</hi>'s Advocate.</note> I have here given a Specimen; and in Anſwer thereto,
(that the World may judge of their Impoſſibility, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
ſee how eaſily our People are to be ſatisfied in a buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
(even) of this Weight and Moment;) have oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
againſt them only theſe three Propoſals, as ſufficient to
compleat the whole Work if duly followed: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That our
Planters Intereſt in their <hi>Negro's</hi> and other Slaves, be ſecured. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That
the <hi>Miniſters</hi> there, be both obliged and encouraged (the <hi>only thing wanting)</hi>
to preach to their People, touching this Duty. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That their <hi>Negro's Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day-Labour</hi>
and <hi>Polygamie</hi> be prohibited. By the <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe, Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
pretence of Intereſt will be removed; and all Colour for complaining upon that
account, would be waſht off. Now why this ſhould be oppoſed or denied, I ſee not.
For what Inconvenience or Prejudice can enſue to the Owner (or to us) by have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Right ſecured? And his <hi>deareſt Mammon</hi> being ſafe, his Thoughts
will be more at eaſe, and he may then be at leaſure to attend upon the Duties of
Religion, and to ſerve Chriſt. Or how, in the <hi>Second</hi> place, can the <hi>Miniſters
preaching</hi> hurt him, ſince at the end of the <hi>Sermon</hi> he will be left to his former
Liberty; nothing of Force or of Compulſion being in the leaſt required, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded?
Only twill be preſt upon his Conſcience, and the neceſſity of it will be laid
before him; <hi>but whether he will hear, or whether he will forbear,</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
as much at his own choice, as it did before. Tho it may not be doubted, but
that whileſt ſome of the looſer ſort ſhall, with the <hi>Athenian Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
Act.</hi> 17. only <hi>mock,</hi> and make ſport, (or, which is worſe, Obſtruct our
Endeavours; others, like the devout <hi>Areopagite,</hi> will be affected with the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Doctrine, and perſwaded to <hi>cleave</hi> unto it, and to <hi>obey the Truth;</hi> And
then our Labour will not be wholly loſt. But rather from theſe ſmall beginnings,
<hi>a great Door and effectual will be opened unto us,</hi> notwithſtanding the <hi>many
Adverſaries:</hi> And this <hi>little Leaven</hi> may in time grow ſufficient to ſeaſon, not

that Chriſtianity ſhould be without Followers, if allowed but Scope and
Liberty, and a free Courſe, tho other Means and Encouragements ſhould be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
And for the <hi>Third,</hi> The profit from thence ariſing, is ſo ſordid and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and withal ſo utterly inconſiſtent with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

(eſpecialy<note n="*" place="margin">Who have ſo high a Veneration for the <hi>Sunday,</hi> even beyond all other Chriſtians.</note> ours) that, no conſiderate or diſcreet
Perſon who owns this, can do leſs than <hi>abhor</hi> (pardon
the Expreſſion, I hope, it will not be offenſive in this Caſe)
and be aſhamed of that. Thus theſe inſuperable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are, we ſee, in a Moment put to flight, and a moſt ſmooth and eaſy Path is
chalked out to this Work, notwithſtanding the Impoſſibilities. So that nothing
beſides a <hi>Supine Sloath</hi> on the one hand, or direct <hi>Irreligion</hi> on the other, can
cauſe any further Stop to our <hi>Negro's</hi> Chriſtianity; and we ſhall be for ever left
without Excuſe, ſhould it be any longer neglected, or oppoſed. And God may
juſtly take it out of our hands, and transfer it to others, who will do it. And
then thoſe <hi>Myriads</hi> of People, who, if by us initiated into <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> might
(ſo far) have been a Strength and Defence to our Religion (in this time of its
diſtreſs,) being firſt Inſtructed in a way ſo oppoſite thereto, will afford the ſame
Advantage againſt it. <hi>So that to neglect or hinder</hi> this Work is a manifeſt
<hi>betraying of the Proteſtant Intereſt,</hi> and no leſs an <hi>advancing of Popery:</hi>
which they that do, can be no other than open <hi>Enemies to the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
Nor in the laſt place, can the <hi>Miniſters</hi> be diſpleaſed hereat, but rather
be invited to give God thanks for the opportunity. For, if this be not needful,
neither is their other Preaching; and all the World may as well be ſaved without
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Negro's.</hi> But if without becoming

&amp; the moſt abſolutely neceſſary, this neglect being

and great ſtep will be to procure (what I but juſt
mentioned) their <hi>Owners conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> thereto: not altogether, as is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
out of <hi>Intereſt</hi> (it being already ſecured to
them by Laws of their own;) but by reaſon of the
trouble, and the fancied <hi>needleſsneſs</hi> of the Work;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34507:4"/>
and to prevent all danger from their Slaves being furniſht with
knowledge, conſequent, they conceive, thereto. However, becauſe
they pretend the other (and ſomething there may be in that too,)
to take off that <hi>pretence,</hi> it will be requiſite,</p>
            <p>1. That a<note n="*" place="margin">Such a Law could not, as has been feared, be any <hi>Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> for <hi>Slavery,</hi> where it has before been always practiſed; and they having already made Laws among themſelves for the ſame purpoſe. * Till ſuch a Law may be obtained, the <hi>Bermudian</hi> Caution of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentures</hi> for ninty-nine Years Service might be uſed, that is, if they think their own Laws not ſufficient.</note> Law be enacted to confirm ſuch
Laws of theirs, as are or ſhall be hereafter made
to <hi>ſecure their juſt Intereſt</hi> in their Slaves; That they
may thereby be continued in their preſent State of
<hi>Servitude,</hi> notwithſtanding their being afterward
<hi>baptiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That all <hi>unjuſt</hi> Intereſts, and <hi>ungodly</hi> Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
ariſing from their Slaves <hi>Sunday-labour</hi> and
<hi>Polygamie</hi> (neither of them ſufferable among
<hi>Chriſtians)</hi> be upon ſevereſt Penalties prohibited;
and this as well to the <hi>unbaptiſed,</hi> as to the reſt.
Nor will this (but much leſs the other) be <hi>grievous</hi> to the Slave,
as is <hi>pretended;</hi> There being ſome of them that live <hi>ſingle;</hi> Others that
content themſelves only with <hi>one Wife;</hi> And the reſt taking the
Libertie of <hi>more,</hi> only out of a <hi>Licentious</hi> and rambling <hi>humor,</hi> and
by their <hi>Maſter</hi>'s <hi>Connivance</hi> and Toleration; Who eſteeming them
but as <hi>Cattle,</hi> and deſirous of their <hi>Encreaſe,</hi> are apter to encourage,
than to reſtrain them from it. But having ſuch an <hi>abſolute</hi> Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Command over them, might with a bare check, or but a
frown, break them of it. And this may be inferred from the
<hi>Virginia Negro</hi>'s; who, tho imported from the ſame places, are not
(ſo far as I could learn) addicted to <hi>Polygamie;</hi> but rather of
themſelves chooſing to follow the Cuſtom of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to whom
they are Slaves there.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>pretences</hi> being thus fairly removed,<note place="margin">§ IV.</note> if any <hi>Averſion</hi> ſtill
remains, (as 'tis to be feared there will, and that for the trueſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

be invited thereto by good <hi>Sermons</hi> &amp; <hi>Books,</hi> Preacht
and Writ upon this Subject, and by diſcourſing
with them in <hi>private.</hi> As alſo by the Example of
the <hi>Miniſters</hi> themſelves in their <hi>Families.</hi> And laſty, (and which will
do more then all the reſt) by <hi>Encouragments</hi> from the <hi>Government.</hi>
Likewiſe, it might be remembred, what I have heard affirmed, that
there is a certain Clauſe, always inſerted in their
<hi>Charters</hi> and <hi>Patents,</hi> for<note n="*" place="margin">Whether this be ſo or not, I am ſure, 'tis the chief <hi>reaſon</hi> Aſſigned by moſt of our Writers and Hiſtorians for God's goodneſs to us in theſe Diſcoveries.</note> the <hi>Propagation</hi> of

Men) in the leaſt complyed with; but rather with their <hi>utmoſt</hi>
care and <hi>vigilancie</hi> obſtructed by them.</p>
            <p>Another way,<note place="margin">§ V.</note> and which 'tis poſſible might prove moſt effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
would be to get this impiety decryed here in <hi>England,</hi> where
our <hi>Planters</hi> have an extraordinary <hi>Ambition</hi> to be <hi>thought well of,</hi> and
thereby to <hi>ſhame</hi> them into <hi>better Principles.</hi> Now this is to be done;
Firſt, by ſending ſome <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>diſcreet</hi> Men, (Perſons of <hi>Eſteem</hi>
and <hi>Repute</hi> with the more <hi>eminent</hi> Merchants here, who trade into
thoſe <hi>parts,)</hi> to perſwade and convince them of the Duty and
Neceſſity thereof,<note n="*" place="margin">This they would do of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, were but that neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity § 1. once reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on.</note> and to invite them to endeavour the <hi>procuring</hi> of
ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> as I have before mentioned. Alſo by <hi>Sermons</hi> at <hi>Court,</hi>
and in the <hi>City, eſpecially this enſuing Lent;</hi> this being as much (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
a great deal more) needing to be repented of, becauſe as
likely to <hi>provoke God</hi>'s <hi>Wrath,</hi> as other ſins. And laſtly by the
<hi>Miniſters</hi> frequent inveighing againſt this <hi>impietie,</hi> in other of the
chief <hi>Cities</hi> and Sea-port <hi>Towns,</hi> to which the <hi>Traders</hi> from thoſe
places do moſt reſort. But above all a <hi>General Faſt</hi> to implore the
<hi>divine Benediction</hi> upon this Work, would give the World ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
and ſo inflame the publick Zeal at the news of this ſtrange
<hi>Irreligion,</hi> that nothing can be ſuppoſed more conducive to the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying</hi>
of it. For hereby each <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> Mouth muſt upon
every occaſion be opened againſt them, and ſo in a ſhort time would
force them to yield. And when in the <hi>Plantations</hi> it ſhould come
to be underſtood that their <hi>impiety</hi> was ſo <hi>decryed</hi> and <hi>odious</hi> here, it
would go near to fall even of it ſelf. Beſides the <hi>Quakers</hi> (who with
the <hi>New-England and Men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> are the <hi>only</hi> Witneſſes of this Truth in thoſe
Parts; and whoſe Meetings the <hi>Negro's</hi> are therefore ſtrictly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited)
might be ſomething inſtrumental hereto, and would be
good enough to help to diſpute them out of their <hi>brutiſh</hi> Gentiliſm.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Miniſters</hi> in the Plantations,<note place="margin">§ VI.</note> it will be requiſite that
they be obliged <hi>each firſt Sunday</hi> (at leaſt) of every Moneth, to preach
to their Charges upon this Subject, and earneſtly to preſs it upon
their Conſciences, But more eſpecially to be <hi>exemplary</hi> therein in
their <hi>own Families;</hi> both <hi>Catechiſing</hi> and <hi>Baptiſing</hi> their Slaves,
(where they have any) as ſoon as they ſhall be found fit, and that
openly in the <hi>Church,</hi> for the Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mple of others.</p>
            <p>And that no <hi>Awe</hi> nor <hi>Fear</hi> may remain upon their Spirits, it will
be requiſite that a ſufficient Maintainance be ſettled upon them for
life, without dependence upon the <hi>Arbitrary</hi> favour of <hi>Veſtries.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:34507:5"/>
The ſeveral Governours alſo ſhould be obliged to protect them
therein againſt abuſes. But to put the ſharper edge upon their
Zeal, ſome <hi>certainty</hi> of Preferment ſhould be propoſed to them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their return for <hi>England,</hi> after ſome 5 or 7 Years continuance
in this ſervice there. The want whereof (at leaſt in the <hi>Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance)</hi>
both will, and has been, the great occaſion of this ſad
neglect hitherto, and the very bane of all <hi>Religion</hi> in thoſe parts.
It being apt to be lookt upon as want of Diſcretion, for Men to
draw upon themſelves nothing but ill uſage there, to be certainly
entertained with <hi>worſe</hi> here; and as one ſaith, to adventure the
<hi>getting of broken Heads in the Churches ſervice, afterwards at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to be rewarded with that which ſhall break their Hearts too.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
there ſhould ſome regard be had of their <hi>Degrees</hi> in the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities;</hi>

it being but an an ill <hi>Encouragoment,</hi> and no way becoming <hi>Chriſtian</hi>

whereby the reſt ſeeing them continued as they were, that
Opinion would ſoon vaniſh: As may be concluded from the like
Experiment upon another like fooliſh perſwaſion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> of their
<hi>returning into their own Country upon their Death;</hi> confuted by fixing

which were a madneſs to ſuppoſe. Nor is it to be imagined

from harbouring ſuch <hi>idle</hi> Hopes and vain <hi>Imaginations,</hi> if before em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by them.</p>
            <p>3. As for their pretended Averſion to Chriſtianity, the contrary
thereto is known of moſt of them. And tho it is to be confeſſed that
ſome are more careleſs and indifferent (having bin taught by
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to be <hi>needleſs for them)</hi> yet for the <hi>general</hi> they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
to be rather <hi>ambitious</hi> of it. Nor, I dare affirm, can any

            <p>4. As to their (alike pretended) <hi>Stupidity,</hi> there is as little
truth therein: divers of them being known and confeſſed by their

<hi>Education.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. One thing more there remains to be added, of which, tho
they may be moſt afraid, yet they carefully keep it to themſelves,
and that is the poſſibility of their Slaves Expectation, not of <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

they ſhould have, whether made Chriſtians or not;) As, That
their frequent <hi>Emaſculatings, Amputations</hi> of <hi>Leggs,</hi> cropping off of
<hi>Ears</hi> (and of <hi>Heads</hi> too), <hi>ſcant Allowance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for Food</hi> and <hi>Cloaths,</hi>

And this is the true meaning of their ſecond Objection, wherein

ſhall ſtill be urged, (as no doubt but there will)
and this Work upon that <hi>ſtale pretence</hi> muſt be

make ſome few demands: As, what thoſe <hi>difficulties</hi> ſhould be, which are
ſo much greater, it ſeems, than thoſe our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> encountered with, even
in <hi>Pagan</hi> Regions, and happily overcame? Whether we ever <hi>tryed</hi> how
<hi>difficult</hi> the Work was, thereby to ſatisfie our ſelves, whether (indeed) it
be ſuch as it is apprehended (or, at leaſt, <hi>pretended?)</hi> And whether ſuch a
trial would not juſtify us more, than thus, without trying, to conclude it
<hi>Impoſſible?</hi> But if it be <hi>impoſſible,</hi> why do we <hi>pray</hi> for it, ſince all ſuch <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
muſt be vain &amp; ſuperfluous and therefore unlawful; and why then are
they not razed out of our <hi>Liturgy?</hi> But is it <hi>impoſſible</hi> for us to endeavour the
ſecuring of our Peopl's <hi>Intereſt,</hi> Or for the <hi>Miniſters</hi> there, to preach to them,
and to preſs the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of this <hi>Duty</hi> to their People; Which <hi>they have before
Vowed to do, ſealing the ſame with the bleſſed Sacrament, at their Ordinations;</hi>
Or to <hi>begin</hi> at <hi>home,</hi> with thoſe of <hi>their own Families?</hi> Or ſuppoſe they
ſhould be ſtill backward, are there no ways to <hi>ſtir them up,</hi> and to provoke
their <hi>Induſtry,</hi> as well to this, as to other (leſs neceſſary) Works; Or
cannot they be minded thereof by Letters and <hi>Precepts (Valeant quantum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere
poſſunt)</hi> armed with ſuitable Motives and Arguments to <hi>excite</hi> their
Zeal, never omitted in any caſe elſe, where the deſign has been thought
<hi>worth the pains</hi> and trouble of attempting? And why ſhould the promoting
of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> (under a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Government, and even in <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,)
be now ſo much harder, than heretofore it was amongſt <hi>Heathens</hi> &amp;
<hi>Perſecutors?</hi> or for <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> than for <hi>Papiſts?</hi> and for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> than for the
<hi>New-England</hi> Men? Or, that having formerly been able to reduce the
wildeſt <hi>Out-laws,</hi> it ſhould prevail nothing upon better People, pretended<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
(at leaſt) its <hi>Friends,</hi> and (outwardly) <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of it; And who (eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially

thereof made out to them) muſt have far leſs pretence of Reaſon for op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing

            <p>Now if theſe things be <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> or <hi>Difficult,</hi> I muſt then confeſs, that

hitherto, let this Work ſleep and reſt till another Age, when the <hi>Times</hi> ſhall
prove more <hi>auſpicious,</hi> and the <hi>Powers</hi> more <hi>favourable,</hi> and thoſe obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Difficulties</hi> and <hi>Impoſſibilities</hi> ſhall be all removed; That is, till the Evil
be grown maſter eſs, and the <hi>Curſe of God,</hi> now in the purſuit, has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken

               </hi> who already have, and are hereby ſtill in danger to periſh through
