            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE SVMME OF THE Charge Given in by Lieutenant Generall <hi>CR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MWEL,</hi> Againſt the Earle of <hi>MANCHESTER.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THAT he the Earle of <hi>MANCHESTER,</hi> hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies been indiſpoſed, and backward to ingagements. And againſt the ending of the Warre by the ſword; And for ſuch a peace to which a Victory would be a diſadvantage; and this declared by principles expreſt to that purpoſe: And a continued ſeries of cariages anſwerable. And ſince the taking of <hi>York,</hi> (as if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had now advantage full enough) He hath declined what ever tended to futther advantage upon the Enemy; neglected and Studiou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly ſhifted off all opportunityes to that purpoſe, as if he thought the <hi>King</hi> to low, and the Parliament to high, eſpecially at <hi>Dennington</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. He hath drawne the Army too, and detained them in ſuch a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as to give the Enemy freſh advantages; and this before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with other Armies, by his owne abſolute will, againſt, or without<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Councell, againſt many Commands from the Committee of both Kingdome; and with contempt, &amp; vilifying of the Commands. And ſince the conjunction, ſomtimes againſt Councells of war, and ſomtimes perſwading, and deluding the Councell, to neglect one op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>protunity, with another, and that againe with a third, and at laſt when no other pretence would ſerve; by perſwading that it was not fit to fight at all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this expect a larger, and yet nothing but truth, and what is ſufficiently proved, at a ſelect Committee, of the Houſe of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons, whereof Mr.</hi> Lyſle <hi>had the Chaire, with charge, with the prooffes therevpon; was reported to the Houſe, and there debated, and a home Vote thereupon paſſed; above a yeare agoe, before the Houſe was recruted with new Members; Whereupon a potent</hi> Northerne <hi>Knight, one of</hi> Mancheſters <hi>ſpecial friends &amp;c. Made a very earneſt motion that Lieu. Gen.</hi> Crumwell <hi>might with his horſe be ſent immediatly to relieve</hi> Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, <hi>as you may read in the</hi> 35. <hi>page of</hi> Englands BIRTHRIGHT; <hi>by meanes of which the Charge hath lyen dormant ever ſince, although it may be ſpoken upon very good grounds, that it is a charge of as high a nature as ever was given into that Houſe, and therefore it is hoped that either Lieu. Generall, or ſome of the honeſt new Members, will diſcharge a good conſcience, by presſing the reviving of it, that ſo Treachery may receive, its due deſert, and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome have Iuſtice upon its Enemies.</hi>
