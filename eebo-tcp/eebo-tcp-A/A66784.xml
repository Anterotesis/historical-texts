            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>ABout twenty years now paſt though I had then <hi>temporal poſſeſſions,</hi> which I might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have given and bequeathed, I compoſed and intended for your <hi>Legacy, A Soliloquie</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> which I had ſpread in Writing before GOD on your behalves; and I believe it ſhall continue for ever in his view: But, there being but one Coppy thereof, both you and I were deprived of that <hi>Compoſure,</hi> when the Book for which I here ſuffer was taken out of my Cloſet. Therefore, being now likely to be ſo ſeparted from you, how much ſoever it may concern our temporal or ſpiritual well-beings, that I may thenceforth perhaps ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee you more. I ſend you this Sacrifice of Praiſe and Prayer, next following, to be inſtead of that which is loſt; for it contains in effect ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, (as to the Petitionary part) of that which was ſpread before GOD (as aforeſaid) in a larger Scrol. Take it into your ſerious conſiderations, and lay it up among your Evidences; For it will ſpeak to your advantage, when I can ſpeak no more for you; when other men who can ſpeak for you, will not; when many perhaps will ſpeak

Be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to your Mother, the enjoyment of whoſe Company, will more then recompence the loſs of mine; For GOD hath endowed her with ſo much maternal prudence and love, that by her counſel, (if you deſpiſe it not) your <hi>Poſterity</hi> may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued on the Earth untill <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes to gather together his <hi>Elect.</hi> Remember the counſel of your <hi>earthly Father,</hi> that the promiſe made by your <hi>heavenly Father</hi> to the <hi>Rechabites</hi> may be inlarged to you and your Poſterities; For, your and their perſonal obedience to GODs Covenant made with all <hi>Mankind</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſu,</hi> will be required (according to that aſſiſting Grace which he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth) toward the accompliſhing of what I have prayed for concerning you.

been as wary as poſſibly I could, ſo to uſe my <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> at all times, and in all places, that I might not offend a weak believer: And, we have ſo many among us, who diſſent from each other, that it makes the performance of that duty very difficultly inoffenſive; and hath put me to more trouble in the fleſh, and occaſioned more outward inconveniences, by infringing my juſt <hi>private liberty,</hi> then many of thoſe ſufferings put together, which are very grievous to other men. I dare, and do openly profeſs, (tho ſome think it needleſs) my belief and judgement, as oft as I ſee juſt occaſion is given: yet I do not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily ſeparate my ſelf from any Perſons or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, who are not apparently and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wicked in their lives or doctrines; but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from their damnable errors and ſins only, as much as I may: yea, my Conſcience makes me afraid, I may juſtly offend by not complying in ſome things <hi>Indifferent,</hi> Civil or Divine, which are not repugnant to Gods revealed Word, though not thereby commanded.</p>
            <p>Where I know not any weak brother to be then preſent, whom I may thereby offend, (and when I am thereto inclined for no carnal reſpects) I can communicate with any profeſſing belief in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> either in <hi>Humiliations, Thanksgivings, Breaking of Bread</hi> in commemoration of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours Paſſion, or in <hi>Prayer,</hi> where nothing is ſo idolatrouſly or ſuperſtitiouſly injoyned or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that it derogates from the honour of God, or is contrary to the Canon of his <hi>Word,</hi> or may in my underſtanding ſeem deſtructive to true <hi>Piety</hi> or <hi>Morality:</hi> For, all other ſuch deficiencies or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95694:23"/>
as we may ſuppoſe to be in the outward worſhip of God, do but exerciſe <hi>love, humility,</hi> or <hi>meekneſs,</hi> and I look upon them where ſuch be, as I do upon mine own failings or performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Whatſoever, where I come, which I find to be ſo done or ſpoken, that I may abſolutely conform thereunto, without offence to God and mine own Conſcience, I therein joyn; and when ought is acted or ſaid, whereto I cannot fully aſſent, I lift up my heart in ſecret prayer to God, beſeeching him to vouchſafe pardon to me, and them for what is ignorantly offended in; and to rectifie both mine and their erroneous underſtandings, who are then preſent: which practice of mine, if not worthy to be exemplar, I hope deſerves, at leaſt, a charitable cenſure.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the quarrellings amongſt <hi>Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours,</hi> are about matters of leſs moment then tithing <hi>mint,</hi> and <hi>anniſe,</hi> and occaſion the neglect of weightier matters, as it will appear, if well heeded; as alſo, that moſt of our Conteſts ſpring from <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> though pretended for <hi>God;</hi> and tend more to ſatisfie the ambition and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, then to advance his honour or true piety. For, it is evident, that a <hi>ſuperintendency</hi> over divine Rites, and the Worſhip of God, is unduly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by many, ſurreptitiouſly obtained, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſterially uſurped by ſom who had no lawful call thereunto; yea, &amp; viciouſly exerciſed (in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) by all thoſe who endeavour to compel men (otherwiſe then by loving compellations) either to the omiſſion, or to the uſe of this or, that <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> or <hi>Form of Prayer,</hi> againſt their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. They who think no <hi>Oblation</hi>'s accepted
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95694:23"/>
of God, but thoſe <hi>ſet forms,</hi> or extemporary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions which they affect, are equally guilty of a ſuperſtitious errour: For, both the one and the other, may be compleat or defective, warrantably or unwarrantably exhibited, according as they are performed. <hi>Extempory Prayers</hi> are <hi>ſet forms</hi> to all who hear them, except to the <hi>ſpeakers</hi> onely; and perhaps alſo, to ſome of their knowledges, who ſpeak them, the greateſt part of thoſe Prayers are <hi>ſet forms,</hi> and otherwhiles, in that regard the more acceptable: For, that <hi>form</hi> which the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God hath at any time dictated, never leaves it to be leſs effectual then it was at firſt, if it ſhall at any other time be offered up on the like occaſion by thoſe, who with the ſame devotion, and a true ſenſe of what is wanting, ſhall faithfully pray for it in the ſame words.</p>
            <p>Some have affirmed in my hearing, that by declaring my private judgement touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters controverted, I expoſed my ſelf to more ſufferings, then were neceſſarily adventured: yet I do not ſo believe: For all that I have publickly affirmed in ſubjects of that nature, whereupon troubles enſued, was by me intended for <hi>Gods Glory</hi> and the common good, (though turned to my perſonal detriment in appearance) and they have hitherto, brought upon me no miſchief, which God hath not converted to my ſpiritual advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; whereas, many of thoſe things, which my Cenſurers practice and profeſs, have occaſioned uncharitable ſeparations, without any benefit to themſelves or others; yea diſturbed their own and the publick tranquility, to the daily enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of breaches, and to the hazzard of an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95694:24"/>
irreconcileable <hi>Diſcord;</hi> if the probable <hi>evil conſequents,</hi> be not timely prevented, by an amicable declaring what we are perſwaded in our own heart, as we finde juſt occaſion; and by leaving other men to the ſame Liberty, until they ſhall be as conſcientiouſly inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiſe: and then perhaps many will ſuſpect their own diſcretion as much as now they do mine; and make it to themſelves queſtionable, who required their former <hi>actings</hi> or <hi>ſufferings,</hi> at their hands. Let this be conſidered by all thoſe <hi>Cenſurers</hi> of my open heartedneſs, to whom this ſhall come; and let my friends be many or few, as God pleaſeth; for my truſt is in him onely; his honour is my chief aim; from him I cannot conceal what I believe; and from men (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things relating to his Service, and the peace of his Church) I will not; nor diſſemble my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: as it ſhould more appear, if it were always, as free for me to publiſh my thoughts, as I am to write them, at this preſent.</p>
            <p>It is for ſuch reſpects, queſtioned by ſome, <hi>What I am as to Religion?</hi> and of what <hi>Society</hi> I profeſs my ſelf to be; whereto I anſwer, that I profeſs my ſelf a <hi>Catholick Chriſtian:</hi> miſtake me not; I do not mean a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> which are terms contradictory to themſelves, being ſo united; becauſe, the addition of <hi>Roman</hi> to <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> deſtroyes that <hi>Denomination.</hi> I am a member of that <hi>Church</hi> which is <hi>Univerſal,</hi> and of every <hi>particular Church</hi> in thoſe places where I reſide, ſo far forth onely (and no further) as it is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Church Catholick,</hi> profeſſing and practiſing in purity, the <hi>Faith, Doctrine,</hi> and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95694:24"/>
               <hi>Diſcipline</hi> thereof. I am not of <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollo's,</hi> or <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> or any <hi>Society,</hi> but as they are of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> whom I deſire to know (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid he did) not onely as he was in the fleſh, but as he is ſpiritually to be known alſo; and to avoid that dividing into <hi>parties,</hi> which from the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> time until this day, hath tended more to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> and confirming of <hi>Errors,</hi> then to edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>good life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſeparate from no <hi>Church,</hi> adhering to the foundations of Chriſtianity, not wilfully profeſſing and practiſing what may be deſtructive thereto, though there be ſome defects or corruptions therein. I joyn not in doing or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving what is not approvable in my underſtanding, yet am as far from a <hi>diſaffectionate ſeparation</hi> on my part, as from ſeparating my ſelf from my ſelf, or a limb from my body, though painful and loath ſome unto me, by a wound or ſome diſeaſe: For I ſhall cheriſh it until it ſo corrupts and gangreens, that it may deſtroy my whole body; and then I ſhall willingly be rid of it. In like manner, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>love</hi> upon Gods good pleaſure toward me and every weak member of <hi>Chriſts myſtical Body,</hi> I will endeavour to preſerve my ſelf and them in unity, and leave the anatha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizing or judging others to him onely, whoſe members they are, or pretend to be.</p>
            <p>The Title of a <hi>Catholick Chriſtian</hi> aforementioned, I affect not out of ſingularity, but admit of it by way of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction onely, to anſwer their queſtionings, who ask of what <hi>Religion,</hi> or of what <hi>Church</hi> I am: And I profeſs an abſolute adherence to the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> onely, becauſe that onely is infallible, and the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> of God upon earth, wherein his <hi>Myſtcries</hi> are preſerved in purity; and wherein I may have aſſurance of ſalvation by continuing therein. I wave the confining my belief or practice to any one <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Congregational Society</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not out of a factious inclination, or petulent diſeſteem of any: But having a deſire to be inſtrumental in uniting men diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting in judgement both unto God, and to each other in <hi>Love,</hi> I conceive that endeavour would be ſuſpected of partiality, and not ſo effectually proſecuted, if I made my ſelf a party with any one Fraternity more then with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: ſome of whom ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95694:25"/>
Cammel; or ſo preſume of their infallibility, that they exclude all as Reprobates, who diſſent from them in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> having alſo more affection for thoſe who are zealous in the <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Formalities</hi> which they approve, (though held in unrighteouſneſs for carnal ends) then they have for them, who are conſcientious profeſſours of the <hi>Truth</hi> in godlineſs and ſincerity, according to their meaſure of faith and underſtanding, if they diſſent from them but in a Crotchet. For theſe and ſuch like reſpects I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not my ſelf to be bound up with any <hi>Congregation,</hi> as aforeſaid) but ſo far as the <hi>Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> and the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of <hi>Charity</hi> towards all men may be preſerved: as alſo the <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Credit</hi> of all <hi>Societies</hi> profeſſing <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſo far forth as it ought to be; for though he may have ſomewhat to alleadge againſt them, (as he had againſt the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> to whom he wrote by St. <hi>John)</hi> they are all in ſome degree <hi>Nurſes</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> And many thouſands have had, and have in them, <hi>initiations</hi> into that which is beſt approvable. Our <hi>National Church</hi> was my firſt <hi>Nurſe,</hi> and I confeſs with thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I from thence firſt drew nouriſhments, ſtrengthening me towards eternal life; that I had there alſo, <hi>dry Nurſes,</hi> ſome of which fed me wholeſomely, and ſome to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering my being poiſoned or ſtarved. But I have but one <hi>Spiritual Mother,</hi> which is the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned.</p>
            <p>There are other <hi>Objections</hi> whiſpered; ſome againſt my late publiſhed Meditations upon the <hi>Lords Prayer;</hi> ſome againſt my Tract, entitled, <hi>The Perſecution of the Tongue among Brethren,</hi> a manuſcript not yet publiſhed; and ſome others, which I ſhall by Gods aſſiſtance, vindicate as ſoon as I have leaſure, from miſapprehenſions; and make it evident, there are many who have heretofore complained of ſeverity in thoſe, by whom they were perſecuted for their Conſciences, who would quickly (had they power an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their will improve it into that <hi>Perſecution,</hi> which is the <hi>Mark</hi> of the BEAST in the forehead, or in the hand. But, having for juſt cauſe, added this here, I will conclude for the preſent, heartily beſeeching GOD, that his <hi>Peace</hi> may be eſtabliſhed and continued among his <hi>Saints</hi> for ever.</p>
