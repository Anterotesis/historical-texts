         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE multitude of bookes which now adayes are printed with purity and elegancie of tongues and languages, are ſo aboundant, that it cauſeth many to reiect the reading of ſuch as they ought to haue alwayes in hand for edification and profit of their ſoules, and not for curioſitie, in regard that though al good and true doctrine, ought to be highly eſteemed as the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſoule (the foode wherofis, the intellectuall vnderſtanding of the truth:) yet ought the diſcret and Chriſtian Reader to conſider how different is the fruit collected of one booke, before an other, that with the greater profit he may diſpoſe of his houres, and keep his cogitations employed, and that as bookes encreaſe, ſo may augment in him diſcretion and iudgement of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them: that ſo he may of each of them gather ſome fruit. And certainly I admire that, ſith when we ſee avenimous beaſt we are terrified and tremble, for feare of his poyſon: how we are ſo ſenceles, as with delight to read heretical or diſſolute bookes, conſidering that they corrupt good manners, and induce to vices and vanities: which are alſo moſt ſubtill venime, wherto making the leaſt approach, it taketh ſuch roote in vs, and doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb facs="tcp:27206:4"/>
ſo budde foorth, that empoyſoning our ſoules, it becometh incurable. And which is yett worſe, we permit our ſelues eaſily to be infected, becauſe the ſcope and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſuch bookes are pleaſing vnto vs, as being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to our appetite and to our laſciuious inclinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and thus according to the cuſtome, preſenting poyſon vnder a ſweet or alluring bayte. And therfore if the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and carefull Chriſtian, deſire to obſerue any due courſe in his reading, ſith it ſo much importeth him, lett him vnderſtand, that next to the doctrine of faith, and the counſels of holy ſcripture, no other can euer ſo much aduance him to purchace vertues, and hate vices, as the frequent and ordinary reading of the conuerſation and life of the holy ſeruantes of almightie God, conſidering with all that is a natural thing, that to attempt a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous enterpriſe, we are therein much mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re induced by example then by any perſuaſions of whom ſoeuer: though we acknowledg them to be certainlie true. None could be found that would reſolue ioyfully to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the vertue of pouerty, humility, chaſtity, faſting, and other penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiall labours, if he knew not that others, not only with wordes exteriourly, but really with worc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes haue embraced the ſame: Neither was it for any other cauſe, that our Lord IESVS Chriſt would perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naly come into this world, but by example to shew vs the way of our ſaluation, and his holy wil, becauſe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples &amp; aduertiſſementes of his faithfull ſeruantes, would not ſuffice to retire vs from our euill conuerſation and
<pb facs="tcp:27206:4"/>
way, and to ſetle vs in his, no not the preceptes which he had giuen in the firſt written law. But when he began to walke this way, how many were there that would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagny him, very ſeriouſly ſeruing him euen till their death, and this only for his loue? The Church therfore knowing right well the glory that redoundeth to almightie God, and the fruit which men gather by the memory of the life of our lord IESVS Chriſt and of his ſainctes, doth euery day propoſe and ſett them before our eyes, in the diuine office, in the ſacrifices and ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that it should not be tedious vnto vs to follow and imitate them whome we prayſe, and whoſe memory we honour, and that likewiſe we should not eſteeme it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourious to walke that way, which alone conducteth vs to eternall life. Hereof mayeſt thou conſider (deuout Reader) what vſe, almightie God maketh of his elect, in fauour of vs, becauſe we are (ſaith S. Iohn) coadiutors to the ſaluation of ſoules, we may hence alſo conceiue how greatlie we are obliged to the trueſeruantes of God, who haue ſo put themſelues to paines in the exerciſe of vertues, that they haue left the way open, that ſuch as ſeeke it may finde it, and by their examples haue taught vs which it is, and with whath force and induſtry we may attaine vnto true glory. Thoſe of former ages guided on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by naturall light, did vſe exceeding diligence, to induce and animate themſelues by the examples of their famous predeceſſours, vſing them as ſo many ſpurres vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, to the end they might in no time be defectiue in the
<pb facs="tcp:27206:5"/>
obligation they had both to their natiue country, and to their owne honour: and indeed the milke wher with they nourced their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their publique ſchooles, was the generous actes of their anceſtours, which were red vnto them in poemes, and orations, that by meanes of thoſe examples, the children might be affected to vertue, and enflamed with deſire of glory, although it was more vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne then vertuous. This is of ſuch force, that euen at this preſent, many of our Chriſtians following the ſame pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, cauſe their children to spend the moſt entiere parte of their age, in committing to memory, the heroyicall actes of the ancient Grecians and Latines. But would to God that too many did not employ and waſt all their life in this ſtudy, and that many others were not more affected to Homer, Cicero and Virgil, then to IESVS Chriſt. O extreme indignity of Chriſtians.! deſeruing sharp reprehenſion and eternall punishment, in regard that they glory to be imitatours of the ſuperſtitious Gentils, who as they wanted faith, and the true light illuminating the hart of Chriſtians, ſo was not their vertue true and ſolid, but exteriour and vaine. And although that in that time of obſcure darcknes, they gaue to men ſome ſparckle of light, ſome litle knowledg of vertue, more with wordes then with effect, theſe Pagans neuertheles perſiſte in obſcurity euen in the cleare day of the true light of our lord IESVS Chriſt, the ſoueraigne truth and perfection, and are vnworthy to be honoured in compariſon of true Chriſtians, who being illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated

For though anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity haue exceedingly honoured great ambitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnes, that deſired to leaue ſome memory and renowne of themſelues in this world after their death: yet our holy mother the Church doth farre more exalt and make more glorious our Sainctes continually in the predicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, feaſtes, and ſolemnities, which for them and in their honour are celebrated; beſides that we beleeue that they liue and gloriouſly raigne in heauen, in the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Lord.

When was there euer found in any time among the ancient naturaliſtes, ſuch conſtancie, ſuch faith, temperance, magnanimity, ſweetnes, mercy, iuſtice, fortitude, and loyaulty, as hath bin found in our Chriſtians, who by no kinde of threates or faire ſpeeches of Tyrantes, could be induced, to leaue their obedience vnto God, could neuer be corrupted by any promiſe or recompence, nor haue bin inclined by any kinde of flatteries or fauours, but perſiſting firme &amp; conſtant in the truth, haue nothing eſteemed nor feared the terrible and horrible tormentes, were they neuer ſo barbarous, nor in the extremity of them, or death it ſelfe, but haue alwayes remayned immoueable and inuincible in true vertu &amp; piety, not deſiring reuenge or detriment to the perſecutours or executioners, but pardon and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, praying vnto God for them. And all this, not att their death only, but euen in their life. For there is no kinde of vertue, wherin the ſainctes haue not excelled, ſome in purity of virginity, others in continencie, with

To this end it is that our Creatour doth dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new and regarnish his Church, with new examples of his ſaincts, that Chriſtians becomming weake &amp; feeble, might reſume force to meritt their ſaluation, in ſeruing almightie God from the bottome of their hart.

If thou affecteſt ſcience, of theſe thou shalt learne, the true knowledge of the fraudes and deceiptes of the world, and eſpecially true wiſdome, which is, firſt the knoledge of God, then of thy ſelfe: If thou apply thee to the actiue or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue life, thou shalt here finde a great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of morall vertues, and of contemplations more then humane, of communion and diuine vnion: breifely if thou make profeſſion of Chriſtianity as thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, thou shalt here clearly ſee figured in two tables, what it is to be a Chriſtian, and with what partes he ought to be qualified that maketh profeſſion therof. And that in the doctrine and in the examples of ſainctes, two thinges are neceſſary to our ſaluation: ſo that thou shalt here finde a remedy very proper and conuenient to all they deſires, and for all thy neceſſities. Now writing the life and examples of the Frier Minors the eſpeciall ſeruantes of God, by them, I meane the diſciples of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S.

            <head>THE PREFACE WHERIN IS DECLARED THE intention of the Holy Ghoſt in the inſtitution of the holy Order of the Frier Minors.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is with great reaſon, that learned men writing bookes of hiſtories or doctrine for the publike good, doe ordinarily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them with certaine introductions, which we call proemes or prefaces, to diſcouer their intention to the Readers, which wanting they cannot haue perfect knoledge, nor reape much fruit of what they read. Though in deed, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to remayne only depriued of theſe fruites and benefittes, were a leſſe inconuenience, and in ſome ſort ſupportable, if they did not ſome times conceiue euill impreſſions, that induce them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the good doctrines and profitable exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples which they read: and this proceedeth of their ignorant temerity, which cauſeth them to condemne thinges worthy of praiſe, and falſly to cenſure that which they vnderſtand not, which vice as is it reprehenſible, ſo is it detrimentall and deteſtable in all kinde of doctrine, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the ſacred ſcriptures and liues of ſainctes: And therfore we ſee that God, in all his worckes, would prepare men as it were by certaine proemes, that they might vnderſtand them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them with ſuch intention as he meant to performe them, as when he purpoſed to renew the world, by meanes of the vniuerſall deluge, he conferred thereof with the iuſt Noe an hundred and twenty years before, commanding him the edifice of the arck, to
<pb facs="tcp:27206:10"/>
thend that worck might be knowne, not only to thoſe that then liued, but alſo to ſuch as should ſucceed them afterward Neither did he vpon any other conſideration deferre to giue children to the Patriarch Abraham, but that he should the better vnderſtand, and with greater reuerence receiue the grace which was figured vnto him in his ſonne Iſaac. I am of opinion that for the ſame reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect he was forty dayes in giuing the law to the people of Iſrael, bountifully imparting vnto them many notable fauours in the meane time, and with ſuch excellent miracles deliuering them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeruitude of Egipt, that they might by theſe meanes diſpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to acknoledge him alone for God, and completely to obſerue his law. I may alſo inferre the like of the forty yeares that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned that people in the deſert, that it was vnto them as it were a diſpoſition the more deerly to priſe and eſtimate the ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired land of promiſe. For this ſelfe ſame cauſe did God vſe Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes among his people, were it to thereaten them with punishment and chaſticementes, or to giue them hope of the benefittes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours which he intended vnto them, or to teach them the manner to demand and meritt his grace. And finally all the old teſtament, the ſacrifices, ceremonies, and myſteries, haue bin nothing elſe but as a certaine proeme or preface of the new, that it might be deſired and hoped, vnderſtood by them, and receiued by vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true light of the holy Ghoſt, and not with a humane and fallacious ſpiritt</p>
            <p>Intending therfore to imitate thoſe diuine and humane exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, it ſeemed to me expedient to add a preface to this worck, that the readers might diſpoſe them to read it with a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and auoid the enormous vice of ingratitude, not duely recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the diuine graces: and that alſo they might receiue therof a beneficiall fruit. Which I haue found ſo much more neceſſary to this worck, as the holy Ghoſt in the inſtitution of the Order of the Freer Minors, is more remote from the ordinary intention and diſcourſe of the world: for Mounting aboue the common obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the preceptes, he hath deſigned it to a degree of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:27206:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more high then the Euangelicall Councells. It is not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full not with ſtanding, that I ſearch farre to find the proeme requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to diſcouer and manifeſt vnto you the intention of the holy Ghoſt and the eminencie of this Order, ſith him ſelfe ſemeth to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue diſigned it both in the old and new teſtament. We read in the prophet Ieremie, that when the Hebrew people were obſtinate in their ſinnes, and that they opened not their eares to the wordes, which on the part of the almighty, were by the Prophetes preached vnto them, God ſaid to Ieremie: Goe to the houſe of the children<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Icrem.</hi> 35.</note> of Rechab, and conduct them with thee to the temple, and giue them wine to drincke. Wherto Ieremie obeyed, and hauing brought the Rechabites to the temple, in to the houſe of one of the principall Officers, before him and many others, he offred them wine in cuppes or veſſels, and bid them drinck. But they anſweared him: Know Ieremie that we haue neuer drunck wine, nor will we drinck any, becauſe we haue bin forbidden it by Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadab the ſonne of Rechab our Father, who commanded it vnto vs in theſe termes: You Rechabites ſhall neuer drincke wine, nor your children, you ſhall not build houſes, you ſhall not ſow, you ſhall not plant vignes, nor poſſeſſe any, but you ſhall dwell all your life, in tentes and pauillions that you may liue many dayes on the earth, wherin you are pilgrimes: And in this ſort doe we obſerue it, obeying that which our father hath commanded vs. The Rechabites hauing giuen this anſweare to Ieremie, he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently the ſpiritt of God, that ſaid vnto him: Ieremie goe to the people of Iuda, and of Hieruſalem, and thus ſpeake vnto them O obdurate and obſtinat people, will ye neuer obey my law, and follow my commandementes? the wordes of Ionadab the ſonne of Rechab are they of more force then mine? He would that his children and their poſterity ſhould neuer drinck wine, and to obey their father, they haue not dranck any, and you would neuer obey my commandementes. I will therfore ſend you a punishment worthy of your rebellion, according as I haue threatned you: but I will not ceaſſe to fauour the Rechabites, becauſe they haue obeyd the commandements of their father.

expreſſe, ſo farre foorth as the ancient eſtate would permitt it, and ſo particular for the Religion of the Frier Minors of the B.Fa.S. Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ncis, that it hath litle need of farther expoſition then to be red and conferred with the expreſſe wordes of his rule, which are theſe. The Frier Minors haue not any thing proper, neither houſe, nor place, nor what ſoeuer other thinge, but lett them liue in this world as pilgrimes and ſtrangers, and lett them ſerue God, who hath redeemed vs in pouerty and humility and ſeeke almoſe with out shame or dishonour: conſidering that our lord Ieſus-Chriſt would be poore for vs. Now by the liuely example of this Order, and by the ſo great auſterities and ſtrict obſeruations; our lord reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the frenſie and folly of the Chriſtians; who forgetfull of the pouerty of our Redeemer Ieſus-Chriſt, and of his ſeruantes, doe ruine themſelues by auarice, by delicacies and diſſolutions. We hope that God will neuer permitt vs to want perfect Religious of this Order, that shall admonish vs of our duety by their example, before the eyes of his diuine Maieſtie.</p>
            <p>But S.Iohn the Euangeliſt and Prophett in his reuelations doth more particulerly demonſtrate the time and eſtate of the glorious Fa. S. Francis and his holy diſciples, ſaying: And I ſaw, when the Angel had opened the ſixt ſeale, there was made a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and the ſunne became black as it were ſackcloth of haire: (which is a garment made of the haire of a horſe and of very groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe woll) and the whole moone became as bloud: and the ſtarres fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen fell vpon the earth. After theſe thinges I ſaw foure An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtanding vpon the four corners of the earth, holding the four windes of the earth that they should not blow vpon the land, nor vpon the ſea, nor on any tree. And I ſaw an other Angell aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the riſing of the ſunne, hauing the ſigne of the liuing God: and he cryed with a loud voice to the foure Angels to who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it was giuen to hurt the earth and the ſea, ſaying, hurt not the earth and the ſea, nor the trees, till we ſigne the ſeruantes of our lord in their foreheades. This Propheſie occording to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Vbertinus, was preached by S. Bonauenture att Paris in a Prouinciall chapter, as already verified in the Perſon of the holy
<pb facs="tcp:27206:11"/>
Father S. Francis, adding that he was by diuine reuelation aſſured, that S. Iohn the Euangeliſt in this paſſadge, had his eye on S Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, and on his ſacred Religion. The ſame is affirmed by Brother Iohn of <hi>Parma,</hi> who was a right holy and Religious man, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous by many miracles that God wrought by him.</p>
            <p>But for the more eaſie intelligence hereof, it muſt be vnderſtood that by the ſeauen viſions of S. Iohn in his Apocalipſe, are ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the ſeauen ages or eſtates of the Church. The firſt age was, of the foundation therof, made by our Lord IESVS Chriſt and his Apoſtles in <hi>Iurie</hi> which began at his preaching, and continued till the Martyrdome of the Apoſtles. This was figured by the firſt viſion of the ſeauen Churches, in the firſt and ſecond chapter. The ſecond age was of the confirmation of the faith, with the bloud of the martyrs shed thorough all the world by Pagans and Idolators, which began att the perſecution of Nero, figured by the ſecond viſion of ſeaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeales, in the 5. chapter. The third age was doctrine, in the ſame being declared the myſteries of our faith, and all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies clearlie refuted. It began in the time of the Emperour Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantin, who aſſembled the Councell of Nice, againſt the hereſie of Arius, figured by the third viſion of the ſeauen trompettes, in the ſeauenth chapter. The fourth age was ſolitary and Eremeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call life, performed with long and great auſteritie of life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of ſpiritt, till the time of S. Antony, figured in the fourth viſion of the woman clothed with the ſunne, in the twelueth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The fift age was when the holy Church began to abound in temporall riches, as well Religious as Clearkes, it began in the time of Charles the great, figured by the fiſt viſion of the ſeauen golden veſſels, in the fifteenth chapter. The ſixt age of the renoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Euangelicall life, is of the warre againſt the ſectes of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techriſt, performed by the voluntary poore, who poſſeſſe not any thing in this life, it began in the Seraphicall Father S Francis, author and inſtitutor of the Frier Minors, figured by the ſixt viſion of the abhominable and puiſſante woman of Babilon, in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteenth chapter. The ſeauenth age shalbe hereafter, both in a merueillous repoſe, and participation of warre, which is to come
<pb facs="tcp:27206:12"/>
in earth, and shall shortly come in perfection in the generall reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of all the ſainctes of God: it shall haue his begymning in death before the comming of our Redeemer IESVS Chriſt to iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, it is figured in the twentith chapter of the Apocalypſe, when the dragon shall finally be condemned, and the elect glorified.</p>
            <p>So that in the firſt age did florish the perfection of Prelacie and the Paſtorall care of the Church, thoſe were the holy Apoſtles. In the ſecond floriſhed the eſtate of Martyrdome, by the combatt and triumph of the Champions of IESVS Chriſt. In the third floriſhed the Voice of Preachers and Doctours, the trompett of the diuine wiſdome. In the fourth the ſanctity and ornament of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue life, in thoſe that liued and led an Euangelicall and celeſtiall life on earth. In the fift floriſhhed the zeale of iuſtice, by which one diſcendeth to a commune and leſſe perfect life in the zealous &amp; iuſt inſtitutors of Reguler eſtates. In the ſixt florished the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of the imitation of IESVS Chriſt, reformed by the Church in the true imitators of Euangelicall life. In the ſeauenth afterward shall floriſh the taſt and ſwetnes of the glory which God ſhall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate vnto his elect, for the wearyſome, labours which one shall haue voluntarily and affectionatly ſuffered here on earth, as farre foorth as humane infirmity, ſhall haue ability to ſupport, and God shalbe pleaſed to inſpire into vs. And our Lord hath ordayned theſe eſtates and theſe ages, according to the neceſſities of the holy Church againſt his ennemies the diuels, and againſt wicked men their followers, who together maintaine ancient warre againſt his Church, though tolerated by God for the greater glory of the elect: for none shalbe crowned but he that couragiouſly combatteth. So was the firſt eſtate againſt the carnall, and groſſe intelligences &amp; ceremonies of the Iewes. The ſecond againſt the idolatry of the Pagans. The third againſt the Arrians and other heretikes. The fourth againſt the carnall and deteſtable ſect of Mahomet. The fift againſt the life of looſe Chriſtians dishonoring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. The ſixt againſt the peſtiferous poyſon of Antechriſt. The ſeauenth againſt the army of deuils and their ſectatours, who in theſe latter dayes shall trouble the Church more then euer. We ought neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
<pb facs="tcp:27206:12"/>
to conceiue, that though the ſaid eſtates be thus ſeparated, and each one haue his particuler property, yet the one participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the quality and property of the other, they come in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine manner to entermingle together: by reaſon that there euer haue bin, and shalbe in the Church of God, Prelates, Martyrs, &amp; Confeſſors, all affectionate and perfect imitatours of IESVS Chriſt. It is a matter well worthy exceeding deepe conſideration to weigh with what profound wiſdome, theſe Eſtates haue bin ordained by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>Firſt our Lord IESVS Chriſt, as cheife and foundamental ſtone of his Church, together with his glorious Mother, his Apoſtles and primitiue Church, conſtituted and founded the firſt eſtate; out of which was afterwardes to iſſue all perfection in the enſuying Eſtates. In which aroſe the firſt battell, our Redeemer IESVS Chriſt, oppoſing againſt the ingratefull Sinagogue, poſſeſſed of the deuill, wherein as our Capitaine he entred the field of combatt for vs and fighting valerouſly, gott a glorious victory, leauing to the world a new manner of fight, to vanquish our ennemies, and to attaine an eternall and immortal glory in heauen: and as he was true God and Lord of all, it was expedient, that, to the confuſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Sinagogue, and for the greater manifeſtation of his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotencie, and clemencie, by meane of his Apoſtles preaching, he should be knowne to be the true Redeemer and Lord of all the world and of all nations. But whereas they were all Idolators, and addicted to moſt abhominable vices, by perſuaſion of the deuils, whome they ſerued, the valliant combat of the champions of IESVS Chriſt was neceſſary (I meane the holy Martyres) to bring idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and infernall vices to ruine. Att the end of which conflict the world was to acknoledge IESVS Chriſt, as it began to doe vnder the Empire of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtantin, when it pleaſed God, to giue ſome peace and repoſe to his Church. And becauſe a more cleare knoledge of the faith of the moſt ſacred Trinity, and of the diuinity and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of IESVS Chriſt was expedient, the order and dignity of Doctours, illuminated by the holy Ghoſt, did then florish. In like ſort alſo, becauſe our ſpirittes cannot arriue to the depth of the
<pb facs="tcp:27206:13"/>
myſteries of faith, and that many preſume ouer much on the ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litye and force of their witte, many (particulerly of the Grecians) did by diuine permiſſion iuſtly fall into errour, therfore the want and neceſſity of Doctours did grow and encreaſe, who obtayned glorious victories ouer the heretikes. And becauſe the knoledge of diuine thinges, doth litle or nothing auaile, if the life be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the doctrine, in the fourth eſtate which was litle dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in time from the third of the Doctours, did floriſh that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueillous, celeſtiall and angelical life, of Hermites in the deſerts ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Arabia, Paleſtine and Egypt, very commodious and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient places, where, with great abſtinence, watchinges, prayers, diſclplines, contemplations, and other pious exerciſes, they did ſubiect the flesh to the ſpiritt, which they held perfectly vnited with God. But by reaſon that the malice and infirmity of humane nature cannot long ſupport and endure ſuch a ſublimity and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of life: and conſidering that the fall from ſo emin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t an eſtate draweth together with it a conſequence of enormous ſinnes, a coldnes of the loue of God, and ſometimes Apoſtaſie: the ſame ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, together with hereſies that branched out, ſo that there was yet need of violent chaſticementes. And therfore were the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians sharpely afflicted and chaſticed, by no leſſe cruell then bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous nations, ſuch as were the Hungarians, Gothes, Vandales, Lombardes and other, yea we yet ſee the order and abhominable ſect of the barbarous Mahomet, by reaſon of falſe Chriſtians and heretikes, to ruine, bring to ſeruitude and ſclauery a great part of the Chriſtian Prouinces. This was the fourth warre wherby, in regard of the extreme coldnes of the deuotion of Chriſtians, the Church was greiuouſly afflicted. Yet did not God therfore leaue his Church deſtitute of holy perſonnages, vnder whome in ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable a time, she was ſupported, as in the dialogues of S. Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doth manifeſtly appeare.</p>
            <p>Now our Lord IESVS Chriſt defending his Church, he aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and retired the pureſt and moſt entier part therof, into this part of the world which we call Europe, in the time of Charles the Emperour &amp; king of France, by whoſe meane God ſecured, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:27206:13"/>
ſetled in tranquility the eſtate of his Vicar att Rome, the capitall citty of the Empire, and gaue peace to the Church, the ſaid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour attempting great enterpriſes, and obtayning glorious victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries ouer the Barbarians, Pagans, and Sarrazins. In that fift eſtate, humane infirmity was with very great reaſon condiſcended vnto, and to that effect was inſtituted a more lardge &amp; tollerable life, to th'end that ſuch as were not capable of the hight of Martyrdome, or of contemplation, might neuertheles finde place of fauour with God, in a meane or indifferent eſtate, eccleſiaſticall perſons poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing their temporall goodes peaceably as did the ſeculers: And becauſe many could not, euen in that meane eſtate, ſo ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine themſelues as to liue vertuouſly according to their duety, God rayſed againſt them holy men and zealous of his honour, that should reprehend and check their vices and diſſolutions: which cauſed them to raiſe rebellion and perſecution euen againſt their owne Prelates, and ſo Chriſtians abuſing the benefitt of peace and temporall proſperity, the Eccleſiaſticall no leſſe then the ſeculers, looſed the reines to infinite vices, as to auarice, ſimonie, vſury, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, diſcord, and adultery, without any remorſe of conſcience or feare of God: ſo that retayning as it were the only name and faith of Chriſtians, they in other reſpectes liued meerly as Pagans. This carnall and licencious life tooke ſuch roote, that all memory of ſpirituall life and the imitation of the life of IESVS Chriſt ſeemed to be vtterly extinguished and raced out of mennes hartes, and therfore it was expedient for him to reforme the Church by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the memory of his moſt ſacred life. It ought not to ſeeme ſtrange not with ſtanding, that the diuine prouidence which ſweetly and prudently gouerneth al thinges, would graunt to his Church, eſtates and temporall riches: for the ſame hath bin expedient for diuers conſiderations, and principally to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that IESVS Chriſt is the almighty Creator and Gouernour of all, that to him all creatures owe ſeruice, &amp; that with all thinges &amp; of all, he may be ſerued in his Church, againſt the hereſie of the Manicheans: beſides, it is to make appeare, that the new teſtament doth not reproue the eſtate and quality of Princes,
<pb facs="tcp:27206:14"/>
nobles, and riche perſonnes, though himſelfe being in the world, did chooſe an eſtate of life in pouerty, croſſes, and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly he would that Eccleſiaſticall Prelates should poſſeſſe titles of honour, dignities and temporall richeſſe, that the potent of the world might learne of them the manner to humble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to be liberall, gracious and affable to their ſubiectes, to execute iuſtice exactly towardes the guilty, &amp; ſometimes to shew mercy: to th'end alſo that the rich might learne not to employ their goodes in worldly and tranſitory vanities, nor much leſſe in pleaſures and contentmentes of the fleſh, but to beſtow them in charitable vſes of piety, of mercy, and of a moderate and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate life: for of all this, did the Prelates of that time, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding charity, abſtinence and liberality, giue a right worthy example, diſtributing the patrimony of IESVS Chriſt, among his poore.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the imitation of the life of IESVS Chriſt, might be better knowne and more readily embraced in pouerty, croſſes and contempt of all tranſitory thinges, men hauing by experience ſeene, how many euils and ſinnes ſucceeded in his Church, by meane of honours and temporall richeſſe, and that euen the blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded worldlinges might be aſſured that the ſtate of life which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe did chooſe in this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is moſt ſecure and moſt perfect. Fiftly, and finally, to condiſcend vnto the imperfection and infirmity of many, that being incapable of the excellent and Apoſtolique po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty, wrought their ſaluation by this more large way: whence may be conceiued that God hath alwayes ordeyned the eſtate of his Church, according as he knew it moſt expedient for his elect, ſo that wheras the Church hath bin enriched with temporalities it was by the moſt prudent counſaile of the holy Ghoſt. This magnificence of richeſſe and temporall eſtate, auaileth much for triall of Prelates and Eccleſiaſticall perſonnes, for by the ſame appeareth whither they be humble in honours, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in abondance, and amiddeſt their flowing ſubſtance, poore in regard of their will. But alas! few by this triall haue proued
<pb facs="tcp:27206:14"/>
ſuch: for contrarie wiſe they haue become licencious, and haue conuerted that into intollerable tranſgreſſion, which was giuen vnto them for inducement to exerciſe themſelues in all piety and vertue.</p>
            <p>Now this fall, towardes the end of this latter age and eſtate of temporall proſperity, is merueillous punctually declared by S. Iohn in the fift chapter of his viſions, where he introduceth the Angell ſpeaking to the fift Church of Sardis: Thou art eſteemed to liue, but thou art dead. Then by way of threates he ſaith, that in regard of the great euels and litle good which she did, if she did not amend, she should in short time be punished and damned. And in the opening of the fift ſeale, it is ſaid, that the ſainctes out of great zeale required vengeance on ſinners: and att the ſound of the fift trompett it is ſaid, that a ſtarre (therby being vnderſtood the principall of the eſtate of the Church, ſeculers and eccleſiaſticals) fell as vpon the earth with ſo greedy a deſire of terreſtriall thinges, that the pittes of the bottomles depth did open, as if he would ſay, all kinde of ſinnes and vices (as are pride, auarice, cruelty, murders, and other infinite enormities) did, by their euill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ouerflow the earth: and vpon that occaſion, the name of God hath bin from that time blaſphemed, and many hereſies haue thence ſucceded, and likewiſe warre betweene kingdomes and peoples one againſt an other, ſchiſmes and diſcorde among Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates one againſt another, and betwene Prelates and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes, and all this to the great ſcandall of Chriſtians, which did ſo much exceed the other precedent diſaſters, in regard that it was domeſticall proceeding of the cheefe ſpirituall and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall perſonnes of the Church.</p>
            <p>In the dregges of this fift age, was all the Empire of Federic the ſecond, a violent perſecuter of the Church and of the Prelates, in ſo much that he brought the Sarrazins into Italy, and there planted them, who by their incurſions com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a great murder of the Chriſtians, ſaccagementes, ruines, and burninges of Churches and monaſteries, to ſatiate their barbarous infidelity. The ſunne was then obſcured,
<pb facs="tcp:27206:15"/>
to witt our holy Father the Pope, who was depriued of the reuerence from each one due vnto him, and the moone became bloudy by the perſecutions, impriſonmentes, &amp; death of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals and Prelates, that were ſo much afflicted by the ſaid Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Federic, and his adherentes. And the ſtarres fell from heauen, that is, many eccleſiaſticall perſonnes, betraying the Church of IESVS Chriſt, adhered to the Emperour. The deuils there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, miniſters of the wrath of God, made readie themſelues to reuenge ſuch and ſo many enormities ouer the world, in all the foure partes of the earth, and to this purpoſe they induced men to vnwonted ſinnes, labouring to preuent with punishment the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne mercy: &amp; doubtles if our Lord IESVS Chriſt had not fauoured his Church, by a new byrth and reformation of ſpirit, she could not haue auoyded an horrible chaſticement. God omitted not to reueale, to his vicares on earth, and to many faithfull Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques, for their conſolation, this neceſſity, and the remedy he intended to the ſame. He manifeſted inviſion to Pope Innocent the third, the Church of S. Iohn Lateran as ready to fall, but that it was ſupported and ſuſteyned by the shoulders of two poore men. So when afterwardes the glorious Father S. Francis, and after him S. Dominick came to demanded permiſſion of the ſaid Pope to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute their Orders in the Church, he knew by illumination of the holy Ghoſt, that they were the two poore men whome he had ſeene in his dreame or viſion, ſupporting the ſaid Church: and therfore was he the more eaſily induced to accord their requeſtes. So that the Church was att that time filled with brutish people, that were all ſclaues to their concupiſcences, and as terreſtiall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, full of auarice, and with other cruell and horrible monſters, hauing their face and conuerſation vtterly deformed &amp; corrupted, with infinite vices: but particulerly with hypocriſie and hereſie which then raigned.</p>
            <p>Albeit that God as iealous of the honour of his Eſpouſe, was exceedingly moued and offended att ſo many enormities, yet did he not therfore in his greateſt fury, omitt to shew his mercie: for in the middes of his Church he rayſed the Orders of begging
<pb facs="tcp:27206:15"/>
Friers, flowing with men of famous ſanctity, that should roote out auarice, banish allurements and carnall pleaſures, reiect ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and terreſtriall dignities, shame hipocriſie, defend truth, ſtirre vp the fire of charity, reforme other peruerſe habitudes, and imitating and following the exampe of IESVS CHRIST, should boldy reprehend the euill deportements and abuſe of ſome in the Church, should by the word of God awaken &amp; induce the people to pennance, should with admirable vertue confound the malice and great errours of miſcheuous heretikes, and by their inſtant and ſeruent prayers, should appeaſe the iuſt wrath of God. Among whome as it were being figured by Enoch and Elias, S. Francis and S. Dominick particulerly, were ordayned and depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this employment. And as S. Antonine in his hiſtory recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the holy Father S. Dominick in ſpiritt ſaw God exceedingly moued againſt the world, which he intended to punish. But, that the glorious Virgin demaunded pardon for the Church, preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vnto him two men, who by the diuine prouidence were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deputed to preach pennance to ſinners, to moue them to amendement, which were the glorious Father S. Francis and S. Dominick, by whoſe prayers God was appeaſed: and it happened afterward, that theſe holy Fathers entring into the Church of S. Peter att Rome, did in ſpirit know one an other to be Brothers and companions, deſigned to this affaire: wherefore in great charity they mutually embraced one an other.</p>
            <p>Theſe two origines and inſtitutors of two perfect rules in the Church of IESVS CHRIST, were, to witt S. Dominick, as a cleare Cherubim, that with the reſplendent light of wiſdome, and predications, ſpred the winges of his doctrine ouer cloudy obſcurities of the world, which by this his ſo great ſplendour, did giue light and diſcouer the errours of heretikes, and conducted the hartes of the faithfull in the ſecure way of true peace. And the bleſſed S. Francis, as an other Seraphim, aſcending out of the eaſt, purged with that kindled fiery coale, IESVS-CHRIST crucified, and entierly enflamed with the feruour of heauenly loue, he ſcattered this diuine fire ouer the world,
<pb facs="tcp:27206:16"/>
both the one and the other leauing to their beloued diſciples, the ſaid Properties, though in each of them, and in certaine of their perfect and legitimate iſſue, the ſplendour of ſcience, and the feruour of charity, were merueilous well connexed together. But by reaſon that all the euils of that time proceeded of the vnbridled greedines &amp; abondance of temporall ſubſtance, and with all, that men did employ and glutt themſelues in vanities, and in loathſome ſenſualities: the holy Father S. Francis touched with the holy Ghoſt, would cutt off euen by the very roote, and farr remoue from himſelfe and his Order all temporall richeſſe, as a reformer of this fift age, and as one whom the holy Ghoſt had deputed to beginne the ſixt age and the ſixt eſtate of the Church, propoſing to the eyes of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the life of IESVS CHRIST crucified, not written or read in paper, but engrauen by the induſtriou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> labour of theſe perfect imitatours: as far foorth as humane infirmity could imitate the ſame. It may in verity be affirmed, that S. Francis was formed of God, as the firſt man, who after the firſt fiue dayes of his workes, was with a mature counſaile made the ſixt after his image and ſimilitude: ſo likewiſe IESVS-CHRIST in the ſixt age of his Church formed S. Francis, according to his image, and in ſimilitude of his life and croſſe, in as much as humaine fragility did permitt And this was done for a new augmentation of his elect. He was likewiſe figured by the Angell, of whome we haue formerly ſpoaken, that he cryed with a loud voice vnto the foure Angels, to whome was commanded to hurt the land and the ſea, in theſe wordes: Doe not any hurt, till we haue ſigned the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes of God in the forehead: that is, till we haue raced out the accurſed ſignes and characters of the beaſt, which are the vices and ſinnes of men, and haue imprinted, not only in their hartes by penance, but euen in their liues, the ſignes of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, which is the holy Croſſe, the true ſigne of the elect: which office is conueniently applied vnto S Francis, as to him that carryed the title, ſeale, and figure of the life and paſſion of our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, as well in following the ſteppes of
<pb facs="tcp:27206:16"/>
his conuerſation in the hight of contemplation, as in excellent and miraculous workes, as alſo in the ſinguler priuiledge of the communication of his moſt ſacred ſtigmates.</p>
            <p>Who can euer explicate or conceiue, with what reſemblance the holy Ghoſt in the life of this holy man, hath repreſented vnto the Church, the life, croſſe, humility, and perfection, wherein our Lord IESVS CHRIST ought to be imitated? And it was doubtles expedient for the great neceſſities of the Church. When our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer IESVS CHRIST came (as S. Auguſtin ſaith) the world was in extreme neceſſity, it is therfore very reaſonable that we yeld him infinite thankes, he hauing releiued vs againſt ſo many diſaſters. But who is he, I pray you, that had not bin ruyned and ouer whelmed by the violent torrent of the malice and ſinnes of the world, if the croſſe of our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, and his diuine aucthority had not with ſuch burning feruour bin preached in the middes of the world? for we now relying there vpon, are firme in God, and ſecure againſt the violence of malice and enormitie. The eſtate of the world was ſo wretched and miſerable, that there was need of a diuine redreſſe, by whoſe aucthority man might be induced to voluntary pouerty, to continence, charity, iuſtice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and true piety, with all other excellent vertues, which are the way to eternall ſaluation, and the end of Chriſtian profeſſion. It ſeemed then that in the fift age, the world was retourned in manner to the like neceſſity, as it was in before the comming of IESVS-CHRIST, ſo deeply had it buried in forgetfulnes the good which he had procured it: for it did againe wallow in his former ancient iniquities, in ſuch ſort that the charity of God was as it were conſtrained to be once againe crucified before the eyes of ingratefull men, who ſeemed to haue forgotten that incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible benefitt, not for the Redemption of ſinnes, for his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſufficied for infinite worldes, but to renew in the memory of men, the way to heauen, which is no other then the croſſe and paſſion. And it not being expedient to reiterate the ſame, becauſe IESVS CHRIST, as glorious and immortall, is no more capable of death, his diuine wiſdome found this meane, liuely and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb facs="tcp:27206:17"/>
to repreſent in his ſeruant, the ſtandard of the croſſe, his paſſion, and his woundes, to renew them in the memory of men, that they might follow the perfection of the Euangelicall eſtate, which himſelfe by his moſt holy life had taught vs.</p>
            <p>This ſeruant elected for ſo great a myſtery, was the glorious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Francis, in ſuch neceſſity deputed to make a ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouation in the world, of the life of IESVS-CHRIST, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the eies of the faithfull in his perſon, and in the perfect Religious of his Order. And in regard that the life of IESVS CHRIST and his perfection doth particulerly shine, as the ghoſpell teacheth vs, in the paſſion and the croſſe, that is in moſt profound humility, in moſt ſtrict pouerty without any mixture of temporall ſubſtance, in feruour of charity and compaſſion of ſinners, in worckes of our ſaluation, auſtere and difficult, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in interiour perfection of charity, wherwith our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, our head conioyneth and vniteth vs with God: and for better perfomance of this vnion, he counſaileth vs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of temporall richeſſe, and the abdication of proper libertie and ſenſualities. The holy Father S. Francis walked this way of the Counſailes of IESVS-CHRIST, ill vnderſtood of the world, and inſtituted a rule and direct path tending to perfection and to vnion with God, wherein walking himſelfe, and teaching more by effect then by wordes, he shewed to the world the true way of penance and ſaluation.</p>
            <p>According therfore to the opinion of S. Bonauenture, may be obſerued three merueillous effectes, wherfore God ſent S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis into this world. The firſt was, to preach penance, as an other forerunner of IESVS-CHRIST, in the deſert of pouerty, becauſe Chriſtians had already forgotten it, and therfore he inſinuated vnto them the neceſſity they had therof, by reaſon of the blindnes that their enormous ſinnes had procured the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The firſt name alſo that this holy Religion had, was Preachers of penance, which title and miniſtery was giuen them by Pope Innocent the third, in the firſt confirmation of the Order: therfore was it that S. Francis did inſtitute the third Order, called of Penitents. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<pb facs="tcp:27206:17"/>
matter he was to be employed in by the holy Ghoſt, was, for himſelfe and his diſciples by profeſſion and rule to renouate the Euangelicall life and perfection, the which to effectuate he inſtituted with the ſpirit of IESVS CHRIST, and ordeyned the rule of the Frier Minors, which he being deſirous to found with exceeding deepe foundations of humility, he would that his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren should be called Minors, that is the leaſt of all other. Many holy Fathers haue florished in this Order, who haue bin glorious in ſanctity &amp; doctrine, as S. Antony, S. Bonauenture, S. Lewis the bishop, S. Benardine, and many other Confeſſours and Martyrs of IESVS-CHRIST. S. Francis did alſo inſtitute the Apoſtolicall rule and life of S. Clare and hir Diſciples, who by their ſanctity and example, drew an innumerable multitude of Virgins that eſpouſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to IESVS-CHRIST. Finally the third thing that this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphicall ſainct was to attempt, was to teach all faithfull Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, voluntarily to take vp and carry on their shoulders the croſſe of our Sauiour IESVS-CHRIST, demonſtrating vnto them that with pouerty and the croſſe, they should gaine and gett poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of true incorruptible richeſſe, and with labour should at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine true repoſe that with humility is gotten true glory, and with the familiarity and frequent communication which is had with our Lord IESVS-CHRIST, is purchaced his loue and amity. The ſtigmates alſo and woundes of our Redeemer were imprinted in this glorious S. Francis, not only in his ſoule, but euen viſibly in his body, that the carnall might haue no excuſe of not following IESVS CHRIST crucified in his ſeruant Francis. Now out of theſe obligations which this holy Father had, as out of a new ſpiritt of IESVS CHRIST there proceeded in him that nouelty of ſo merueil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous worckes, in all ſortes of vertues, as thoſe exceſſes of humility &amp; contempt of himſelfe, the auſterity of diſcipline, wherwith he afflicted his body, the great feruour he had of the ſaluation of his neighbour, wherby he entierly employed both himſelfe and his to reforme Chriſtians, &amp; to reduce them into the way of obedience vnto God &amp; his law. Theſe things are vnderſtood of few, &amp; alſo of few priſed according to their worth, by reaſon that they ſeeme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
<pb facs="tcp:27206:18"/>

The deuout Chriſtian then, ought now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund humbly of this ſoueraigne God, as of the author of this worck, the light of his grace, wherby being freed of humane iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and conceiptes, he may vnderſtand, taſt, and gather the<note place="margin">1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.</note> fruit of the ſpiritt of IESVS CHRIST, ſo bcuntifully communicated to S.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE grace of our Sauiour IESVS-CHRIST hath appeared vnto vs, in theſe later dayes particulerly in his ſeruant Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, to whome the Father, of mercy and light, would by his benignity impart ſuch benedictions, and ſo excellent fauours, that, as by the diſcourſe of his life appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, he did not only draw him out of the darckenes of the world, to ſetle him in the true light, but he made him great, in the merites of the perfection of all vertues. And hauing extraordinarily communicated vnto him many note-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy myſteries of the croſſe, he merueillously eleuated and exalted him in his holy Church, wherin he gaue him a right eminent place and<note place="margin">The birth of S.

His Father was a rich Marchant, of an honeſt familie, called
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:27206:19"/>
Mariconi: his name was Peter Bernardone, taking for his name the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per name of his father the grand father of the ſaid Francis, called Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardone de Mariconi: his mother was called Pica, who was a very pious &amp; honeſt woman, who procured him in his baptiſme to be called Iohn, but his Father afterward att his Confirmation, would that he ſhould chaung his name, and was called Francis. Some affirme that he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Francis, becauſe he had with exceeding facility learned the French tongue. Before his birth, his mother endured very much being many dayes in labour of deliuery, in meane while there came a poore pilgrime to the doore of the houſe, who hauing receiued an almoſe, ſaid to him that brought it; cauſe that woman who endureth ſuch throwes of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, to be carryed into a ſtable, and ſhe ſhalbe incontinently deliuered.<note place="margin">He was borne in a ſtable.</note> Which being done, ſhe was inſtantly deliuered, and for that reſpect there was built in that place a chappell, where in memory of the birth of this S. the hiſtory of this miracle was depeinted: whome our Lord IESVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHRIST would in regard of his birth in a poore and contemptible place, make like vnto himſelfe. This chappell is now called S. Francis the litle. Francis was nourtured and educated of his parentes, as their<note place="margin">S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis his youth.</note> eldeſt ſonne. And hauing in ſhort time learned the French tongue, though it be very difficult, they putt him to learne Latin, as moſt vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall in ail Europe (for to merchantes it is of no ſmall importance to know many tongues) which hauing learned, and being of age capable to manadge affaires, he trayned him to his trafique, both in his citty and abroad. And though he where buſyed and employed in the vanities and folies of the world, yet was it not poſsible for the deuill to corrupt his good and naturall inclination, which God (who had ſowed the ſame in him as in a good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d) did alwayes conſerue in his hart. And therfore, albeit in his youth he haunted and conuerſed with his equals, and with them did honeſtly ſpend his time in diuers recreations; yet did he neuer permitt his pleaſure ſo much to preuaile, but that as an other Ioſeph, he moſt carefully preſerued the ineſtimable treaſure of his chaſtity. Yea negotiating with merchants, for the moſt part true miniſters of auarice, yet had he not for all that, ſo ſett vp his reſt and deſire on tranſitory ri cheſſe and ſiluer, as that thy could hinder him from the exerciſe of the vertues of mercy towardes the poore, to whom he alwayes ſhewed a<note place="margin">What a great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſe-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer he was.</note> natural inclination &amp; compaſsion to aſsiſt &amp; releiue them; which was a particuler grace, that God had giuen him, as an infallible note that he was of his eſpeciall elect; which augmenting and growing in him euen from his tender yonth, made him ſo milde and mercifull, that he could not deny the poore any thinge they demaunded him, particulerly when
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:27206:19"/>
the party in neceſsity did mention in his requeſt the loue of God. Notwithſtanding it one day chaunced that being earneſtly employed, he could not attend to giue an almoſe to a poore man that demaunded it for the loue of God. His buſines being ended, this true ſeruant of God, calling to minde that he had denyed a poore man, he ſharply chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and reprehended himſelfe, titling himſelfe, ill nourtured, diſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, inhumane and cruell, ſaying that if a freind, or an other man of honour had ſent to aske him any thinge, he ſhould haue neglected and layd aſide all buſines to giue him content and ſeruice; and yet he had not done ſo in Godds cauſe; and therfore he haſtened to finde out that poore man, to whome hauing giuen an almoſe, he asked him pardon. And to the end he might not thenceforward proue forgetfull in the like accident, he againe confirmed his vow, that as farre foorth as ſhould be poſsible vnto him, he would neuer deny that which ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him for the loue of God; and perſeuering euen till death in this vow, he continually encreaſed in diuine graces: wherupon he aſfir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that being ſeculer, he neuer heard word of the loue of God vttered, but that it molified and moued his hart. Francis then being yet yong &amp; worldly, was mindefull of God in this ſort, wherin many that eſteeme themſelues good Chriſtians and very ſpiritual doe not any way remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, conſidering that often times for a litle almoſe demanded of them by a poore creature, they feele interiourly an anxiety therof, and doe with choller diſdaynfully reiect him. This was the A. B. C. wherin S. Francis exerciſed himſelfe, with the greateſt of the houſe of God, and therfore he merited to obtaine of his diuine maieſty, mercy and fauour; for in that reſpect are the mercifull called bleſſed. So was he naturally liberall, remote from auarice, perhappes more then he ought, doeing it<note place="margin">The good nature of S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis.</note> to be eſteemed and honoured. Therfore did the yong men of his eſtate much affect and honour him, and in their ſportes and recreations did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinairily make him their capitaine, becauſe he did voluntarily and freely ſpend in muſique, bankets, garmentes and other youthfull folies. But one day conſidering theſe vanities, he thus diſcourſed, with himſelfe: Sith thou art ſo free and liberall towardes men, of whome thou canſt expect no other recompence but a litle vaine glory, how much more reaſonable were it for thee to ſhew this liberality towardes God in his poore people, to whome that which thou poſſeſſeſt doth appertaine, &amp; who doth afterward ſo bountifully and abondantly accept and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence the ſame? In this ſort mouing himſelfe, he thenceforward em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in almoſe and other charities, as much or more then in vanities.

with ſuch a benignite and patience, as made him gratefull and amiable to each one: by reaſon that his good partes and conditions<note place="margin">Predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ſanctitie.</note> gaue hope of ſome worthy matter in him. There was then in Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium, a very ſimple man but eſteemed to be inſpired of God, who meeting the yong man Francis, did alwayes caſt his cloake on the ground and ſpread it where he was to paſſe, ſaying before all the world: It hath bin thus ordayned: as if he would ſay of God, that the yong Francis is worthy of all honour and reuerence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">He was priſoner.</note> There being continuall warre betweene the citty of Aſsiſium and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſia, he was one day with many other of his fellow-cittizens taken priſoner by the enemies, and they were all conducted to Peruſia, where they remained priſoners for a yeare, till the citties were att accorde. In this his impriſonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t he ſhewed a right worthy proofe of his magnanimity, being amiddes ſo many afflictions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortes, ſo conſtant, temperat, and merry, that his companions did admire theratt, and often reprehended him for it: but he with alacrity anſweared them: What thinck ye, you my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? What countenance would you haue me to carry? Tell me I pray you, if we haue cauſe of ſorrow, ſith we ſhall in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from henceforward be more honoured of the world. Thus did he comfort and encourage them all in the priſon, and euen ſerued them; for the ſeruant which they had, being expulſed as ſeditious, he voluntarily ſerued them in euery thinge, and was vnto them a greatfull companion. By reaſon of theſe acceptable diſpoſitions, his conuerſation and accointance was deſired and ſought of euery one, and by this meane he was in manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to doe many vaine thinges that were litle pleaſing vnto him. So did he very vnprofitably conſume and waſt his age and time, his goods and graces of nature, till about the fiue and twentith yeare of his age, though God had endued him with ſo many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiues and rare conditions, not to abuſe them, but to employ them entierly in the praiſe and glory of his diuine maieſty: for though he did alwayes keep and preſerue aliue this ſparckle of the loue of God in his hart, yet did not the youthfull Francis (as being ouer much poſſeſſed with a care to augment and conſerue his wealth, and to enioy his recreations) vnderſtand the celeſtiall ſecrett of his great and diuine vocation, which was, with reiection of earthly conuerſations, to employ himſelfe meerly to contemplation of celeſtiall thinges, and to attaine and aſpire vnto them. And in deed he could not know them, till he felt himſelfe touched by the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:27206:21"/>
ſeuere hand of God, which hauing ſharply ſtricken him in his body, did by a long diſeaſe afflict him, and purged and illuminated him interiourly, therby to looſe him from the bondes of the deuill, the world, and the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>THe ſeruant of God Francis being cured of his foreſaid corporall ſicknes, and confirmed in his ſoule by new purpoſes and new<note place="margin">His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme charity.</note> feruours, hauing occaſion to walk into the feildes, he mett in the way a man that in his countenance and comportment ſeemed a gentleman, but was for the preſent in miſerable eſtate, poore, ragged and in ſhamefull condition. Francis beholding him, immediately repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented vnto his memory our moſt noble, but poore king, IESVS CHRIST being in the world, of whome he had ſo ſtrong an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, as if he had ſeene him before his eyes, and thence he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſuch a compaſsion of this poore man, that calling him aſide, he putt off his garmentes wherwith he was attired and cloathed him therwith. The night following, he ſaw in an imaginary viſion ſleeping, a faire lardge hall full of verie rich armures, all ſigned with the croſſe, and God for whoſe loue he had giuen his cloathes<note place="margin">A viſion which he had.</note> to the poore man, ſhewing them vnto him, who moſt aſſuredly promiſed him to giue all the armures which he ſaw to him and his, if he would vndertake the triumphant ſtandard of the croſſe, and couragiouſly follow him. Francis awaking, interpreted this viſion to be of temporall cheualry, wherein all Chriſtianity was then earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, for the conqueſt of the holy land, the Chriſtians being there vnto induced by the bulle of the <hi>Croiſadoe,</hi> wherin the Pope granted plenary indulgence to all them that would vndertake ſo Catholike an entrepriſe: called <hi>Croiſadoe,</hi> becauſe all the horſe and foot men did weare for deuiſe or badge, the croſſe on their caſſakes and mandillians. Now Francis hauing formerly had ſome deſire to ſerue God in this voyage, reſolued and prepared himſelfe there vnto, hauing conceiued a full ioye, and hope, to become a famous and honoured Capitaine, as God (according to his owne interpretation) had promiſed him. Being therfore demaunded of diuers whence proceeded that his exceeding
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:27206:22"/>
ioy, and the extraordinary contentment which he exteriourly diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; he anſweared them, that it was out of a firme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> aſſurance which he had, in ſhort time to become great. Hauing then compleately furniſhed himſelfe with armours, ſeruantes, horſes, and whatſoeuer ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, he haſtened to Apulia to find out an Earle who was elected one of the principall heades of the enterpriſe, ſuppoſing that ſeruing him, he might after ſome worthy exploytes of armes, be honoured att lenght with the Order of knight hood: but the firſt night after he was departed, he heard the voice of God, that finally ſaid vnto him: Francis, who can more benefit thee, or better aduance thee, the Maſter, or the ſeruant? a rich man, or a poore? He anſweared, without queſtion, the maſter, &amp; he that is rich. The voice replyed: Why then leaueſt thou the Lord, for the ſeruant; and for a very poore man, God that is moſt rich? Francis thereto as an other S. Paul, thus ſaid: O my God, what wilt thou then that I doe? Retourne (anſweared the voice) to thy contry, for the firſt viſion which thou haddeſt, ſignified a ſpirituall worck. and not a terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriall, which is to be accompliſhed in thee, not by humane fauour, in no ſort, but by diuine diſpoſition. Francis then being thus changed, thee next morning full of ioy and aſſurance, he ſpeedilie tourned his iorney towardes his contry, beginning to feele in himſelfe that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which perfect obedience and reſignation of ones ſelfe to God, doth cauſe and procure to the ſpirit, with hope that his diuine maieſty would giue him vnderſtanding of his further pleaſure. And thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward withdrawing himſelfe from worldly companies and entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, his endeauour and cogitation was only deuoutly to beſeeche the diuine clemencie, to make him worthy to know wherin he ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy himſelfe for his ſeruice. For although by the continuall vſe of his frequent and daily deuotions, he felt to encreaſe in himſelfe the flame of diuine deſires, and that by reaſon of his affection to the celeſtiall Hio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſalem, he thenceforward contemned whatſoeuer could detaine him from it, and that he already deſired to be entierly exerciſed in the ſeruice of God: he neuertheles did not yet vnderſtand in what mannr he ſhould be therin employed, he only by an interiour inſpiration concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that God reuealed vnto him that this ſpirituall affaire was to be enterpriſed and begun, by contempt of the world, and that the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarly of IESVS CHRIST began by victory ouer ones ſelfe. Being then thus retired into a ſolitary place, and by continuall prayers and ſighinges, demanding the grace of IESVS CHRIST to be directed into the true way, he heard a voice proceeding from a Crucifix that ſaid: Francis, if thou wilt know my will, it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:27206:22"/>
that thou hate and abhorre whatſoeuer thou haſt to this<note place="margin">A Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him.</note> preſent vainely affected and deſired: which if thou doeſt, thou ſhalt feele a new taſt and ſweetnes, in that which heretofore ſeemed to thee bitter and inſupportable; and that which did accuſtome to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thee, thou ſhalt diſdaine. Francis hauing heard this leſſon of IESVS CHRIST, and often interiourly reflecting theron, he chaunced one day as he trauelled one the plaine of Aſsiſsium, to meete a poore leaper, wheratt he was att the firſt apprehenſion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, beholding him with diſdaine and contempt, but inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently remembring the purpoſe and reſolution he had already made, to embrace perfection, and that to be a champion or warryer of IESVS CHRIST, it was neceſſary for him to ouercome him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, alighting from his horſe, he ran to embrace and kiſſe the leaper, and hauing giuen him a liberal almoſe, he mounted againe on his<note place="margin">He kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Leaper.</note> horſe, and looking about all that plaine he could no more ſet eye one that leaper: wherfore being repleniſhed with ioy and feare together, he gaue thanckes to God, and perſeuering in continuall prayer, teares, and ſighinges, he merited to be heard in his pious deuotions. Being one daye in prayer, as in regard of his great feruour, he was entierly as it were ſwallowed vp in God, IESVS CHRIST crucified appeared vnto him, by whoſe ſight, his ſoule al melted into compaſsion, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours<note place="margin">God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth vnto him.</note> of the paſsion of our Sauiour did ſo pearce his bowels and his interiour, that as often thenceforward as that dolourous paſsion was repreſented to his memory, could he with his vtmoſt endeauour ſcarcely ſuppreſſe his teares and ſighes, as himſelf a litle before his death recounted. This man of God then Francis by this viſion felt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed<note place="margin">

And from that hower, he was cloathed with the ſpiritt of the loue of God, of patience, humility, and piety, by which diuine loue, eſteeming no more, but rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning all his temporall goodes, and what ſoeuer he could euer expect of the world, he perceiued and felt in his ſowle, that God had diſcouered vnto him a hidden treaſure of infinite worth, for the fruition wherof, burning as it were, and rapt out of himſelfe, he determined to ſell al that he had, and to diſtribute the price therof amongſt the poore, making by this meane an exchaunge, of<note place="margin">

from prophane houſes and ſhoppes of merchandiſe, an other Matthew from danger of vniuſt exactions; and diſpoſed him to follow his ſteppes, reiecting al other poſſeſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to enioy the moſt precious pearle of Euangelicall perfection, whichwith his vtmoſt poſsibility he ſought, found, and purchaſed. And in teſtimony and aſſurance of a true, quiet, and full poſſeſsion therof, our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST made him a contract therof written on the parchement of his owne fleſh, ſigned and ſealed by the hand of the ſeller himſelfe IESVS CHRIST, with the ſeale of his moſt ſacred woundes: which he did to banniſh from the world by meane and example of this his moſt deuout ſeruant, the enormous and intollerable banckes and vſuries, and the fraudes in traffikes too commonly practiſed in the worlde, to the end to further poore Chriſtians in a deſire of buying the ſaid precious and celeſtiall pearle, by the traffike of penitence, of vertues, and of the glorious fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing and imitation of IESVS CHRIST.</p>

                  <p>FRancis being very carefull, and often conſulting with himſelfe how he might become more poore, to pleaſe IESVS CHRIST, renouncing the world, and forſaking whatſoeuer therof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertayned vnto him with diſtribution therof vnto the poore, there being no perſon to counſail him in this matter, but his Sauiour IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST, his diuine goodnes omitted not to viſitt him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by his holy grace: For departing out of the citty of Aſsiſium, with intention to ſeeke ſome ſolitary place, to mediate and performe his deuotion, he paſt by the ſide of a Church of S.

He being tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by the holy Ghoſt entred in, and falling on his knees before the image of the Crucifix, he felt his ſoule repleniſhed with an admirable conſolation of the holy Ghoſt; wherfore with an extreme feruour he thrice iterated this prayer vnto God: O high and glorious God, my<note place="margin">A worthy prayer of the S.</note> Lord IESVS CHRIST, illuminate and lighten the obſcurities of my hart, giue me, if it pleaſe thee, a right faith, an aſſured hope, a perfect charity, a knowledge of thee my God, in ſuch ſort that he may euer performe thy true and holy will, Amen. Beholding

afterwardes the Crucifix with a ſerious attention, his eyes filled and his face bathed with teares, he heard with his corporall eares a voice addreſſed vnto him from the Crucifix, which three ſeuerall times thus ſpake vnto him: Goe Francis, and repaire my houſe, that is ready to fall: This ſo merueillous voice did exceedingly terrifie him being<note place="margin">A Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſix ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine vnto him.</note> alone in the Church: wherupon vtterly amazed, and feeling in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the force and vertue of thoſe wordes, he fell into a ſound, but retourning att lenght to himſelfe; he incontinently prepared to obey and to reeſtabliſh that materiall Church, wherin he had preſented his ſaid prayer, not as yet vnderſtanding the ſence of the wordes of God to be, that he ſhould repaire that other Church, redeemed by his precious bloud. So that riſing from the ground and ſigning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the holy Croſſe, he retourned to the citty, where he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled all the marchandiſe that his Father had committed to his charge to traffike, and ſent it to Foliginum, where he ſold it all, and the horſe alſo wheron he rode, then haſtened to the ſaid<note place="margin">He ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his fathers marchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe to repaire a Church.</note> Church of S.

The preiſt anſwered that he would willingly entertaine his perſon; but would not accepte his mony, in regard of his Father and his kinred: and therfore the true miſpriſer of richeſſe caſtinto a windoe that there he ſaw againſt a wall, the purſſe wherin his mony was, which he there left in contempt as baſe earth, regarding nothing but to vnite himſelf with God, in the company of that Preiſt. His Father vnderſtanding all this, full of indignation and anger againſt him, laboured to find him out: but Francis getting ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſment therof, as yet a freſh ſoldier of IESVS CHRIT, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the threates of his Father, and to giue way to his choller, hid himſelf in a caue, where he continued certaine dayes, with abondance of teares continually praying God to vouchſafe to deliuer his ſoule from the handes of thoſe that perſecuted him; and that his holy will would ſo much fauour him, as being to effect the pious deſires which he had vouchſafed to inſpire vnto him. After he had a certaine time continued his prayers, he began to condemne himſelfe of litle courage, and therfore expelling all feare, he aroſe out of the caue, and went to Aſsiſium, armed with the magnanimity and vertu of the moſt high, to tread vnder foot the ſerpentes of worldly perſecution,

Now his Father hearing theſe cryes, and ſeeing his eldeſt ſonne thus abuſed, he ran as a roaring<note place="margin">Ill en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of his owne Father.</note> lyon, not to deliuer him from thoſe contemptible reproaches, but himſelfe to treat him more diſdainfully then all the reſt, as if he had bin no longer his Father.

But ſo far was the true ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST from being any way terrified, or withdrawen from his former pious reſolution, that on the contrary he became therby more firme and conſtant, and more accuſtomed to ſupport all; calling often to his minde that worthy ſaying of the Goſpell: Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution for iuſtice, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen; and that which our redeemer himſelfe ſaid: If any man come to me and hateth<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> not his Father and mother, and wife, and children, and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and ſiſters, yea and his owne life beſides: he cannot be my diſciple. The which ſpeculation was then moſt exquiſitely practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by God, in the perſon of his ſeruant Francis, who was not only derided of his freindes and kinred, but much more of his Father himſelfe. It might doubteleſſe be eſteemed a hart of flint<note place="margin">Treated as atheife</note> or ſteele, that was not moued to compaſsion to ſee him ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by his owne Father; and that admired not the cruelty of the one, and the patience of the other. But glorious Francis who had his ſpiritt vnited with IESVS CHRIST, by whome he was comforted, did in the meane time thus encourage himſelfe, that by theſe ſtrokes of the hammer of affliction, God would forge of him a merueillous and admirable veſſell, baked and purged in the fournace of moſt panifull croſſes and labours, to dilate and amplifie his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:27206:24"/>
glory and to renew his memory on earth. Certaine dayes then after yong Francis was committed to priſon, his father vppon occaſion of his affaires being gone out of Aſsiſium, his mother who was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with that her husband had done, conceiuing a naturall compaſsion of her ſonne, went to ſee him, and with the gentle and ſweet ſpeeches of a mother, endeauoured to perſuade him to obey his father, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying her wordes that were of them ſelues ſufficiently pregnant and effectuall, with abondance of teares. This certainly was no ſclender aſſault and combatt to the new champion, whoſe mother could no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing preuaile in that she deſired: for he lett her know that his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was more to God then to his father or mother, and beſides, that he was reſolued to follow the inſpiration which he had receiued of the holy Ghoſt: Then he tourned his ſpeech to his mother her ſelfe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting her to acknoledge the great benefitt which she had receiued of God, in that he called her ſonne to his ſeruice, and that therfore she ought to be thankfull vnto him.

Francis finding himſelfe att liberty, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted his mother, and prayed her to be no more afflicted in his regard, and then retourned to the fore ſaid Church to giue thankes to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Redeemer for what ſoeuer had happened vnto him. But his father being retourned, and not finding his ſonne in the place where he left him, hauing greiuouſly checked and iniuried his wife for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsing him, he ran vtterly enraged into the ſaid Church with reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to procure his baniſhment out of his contry, as a diſhonour vnto him, if he ſhould perſiſt in his former reſolution.

And as he walked on a mountaine, ſinging the prayſes of God in the French tongue, he was aſſaulted by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine theeues, who rudely examined him what he was and what he ſought there: to whome he anſweared as a Prophett: I am an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld of the great king.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:27206:26"/>
for the loue of God, which he receiued. Thence he went to the citty of Agubio, where being knowne vnto an ancient frend of his, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teously entertayned him into his houſe. And in regard that he was ſo naked, this frend couered him with a poore cloake, which ſerued him two yeares, carrying a ſtaffe in his hand, as an hermite, with ſhooes on his feet, and girt with a lether belt, which made him eſteemed to be Religious of the Order of S.

I will here to this purpoſe ſett downe one miracle, among diuers others which ſhalbe recorded in this hiſtory in their place. There was a man of the Dukedome of Spoletum that had on his face a moſt hideous and perillous ſoare, that had already conſumed and eaten one<note place="margin">Hecureth one of an vlcer in kiſsing it</note> of his iawes, and a great part of his mouth, and wheras no remedy could be procured to his infirmity, he vowed to goe to Rome to viſitt the ſepulchres of the holy Apoſtles, to craue their interceſsion, and to implore the mercy of God, that he would be pleaſed to deliuer him of that ſo greuious and loathſome diſeaſe. Now as he retourned to his houſe, hauing accompliſhed his vow, he mett the bleſſed Francis on the way, before whome this diſeaſed enclined himſelfe to kiſſe his feet,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:27206:26"/>
by reaſon that his countenance was exceeding venerable: But the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeruant of God not permitting it, ſtept back. The diſeaſed ariſing, the imitatour of Ieſus Chriſt embraced him, and kiſſed his face; which hauing performed with a merucillous compaſsion, att the very inſtant that horrible vlcere and the mouth being kiſſed, were incontinently cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I know not in deed which of the two is more admirable, either<note place="margin">His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the poore</note> the profound humility of the S. in kiſsing the wound, or the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his vertue in worcking ſuch a miracle. He did not exerciſe this charity only towardes leapers; but did alſo extend ſuch liberality to all poore peole, that ſometimes leauing himſelfe halfe naked to couer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he deſired beſides to giue his owne perſon, and eſpetially to poore prei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes,<note place="margin">He la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to keep the churches and their orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts in decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.

To this glorious Saint, pouerty ſeemed the moſt precious thing in the word, all his ambition was to poſſeſſe the ſame, in this reſpect only was he enuious if an other were poorer then himſelfe. Goeing on to offer his deuotions att S. Peters in Rome, among a great multitude of poore that were there att the dore, he eſpied one moſt wretched and miſerable, almoſt naked and vncouered, of whome he had ſuch compaſsion, and was ſo enflamed with the loue of pouerty, that puttning off his owne garment he gaue it to the poore Creature, and cloathed himſelfe with the others ragges, and took ſuch content therein', that he remayned all that day with thoſe poore people, with exceeding alacrity, reioycing in pouerty, in contempt of the glory of the world, learning by ſuch and the like worckes of charity, firſt to practiſe and performe, and then to teach, following the ſteppes of his true maſter IESVS CHRIST, whoſe life and doctrine he ſhould practiſe and teach to mortall men. Being one day of the winter ſo poorely cloathed, that much of the nakednes of his body appeared, and hearing the holy maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe, a Brother of his by chaunce mett him there, who ſcoffinglie asked him if he would ſell him for ſix pence of his ſweat.

                  <p>THis glorious Saint was ſo well grounded in the vertue of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and of the charity of IESVS CHRIST, that calling to his minde what had bin miraculously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded him by the Crucifix, which was, that that he ſhould reeſtabliſh his Church, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that he meant the ſaid Church of S. Damian, he retourned, as an obedient ſeruant, to Aſsiſium, purpoſing by almes to execute and accompliſh that, which he could not doe with the mony of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers merchandiſe, and this his deſsigne had good ſucceſſe. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ouer the citty (where he was alreadie knowne to be the ſeruant of God) he found mony among his freindes and kinred, and matter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the building of the ſaid Church. So aſſociating him ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe with the Preiſt that ſerued there, he began the ſaid reparation: wanting nether maſters, nor worckmen to this effect, he neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les without intermiſsion employed his owne perſon therin, that his body being already weakened, by continuall faſtes and ordinary abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, might be more ſubiected and chaſticed, as well by carrying burdenſome ſtones, as by the mortification he endured, in demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them, to whome he had formerly giuen. Thus by the grace of God and the deuotion of the faithfull, he ſo well endeauoured, that he accompliſhed the reparation of the ſaid Church: in which labour the ſaid Preiſt perceiuing how painfully he employed himſelfe for ſo holy an enterpriſe, alwayes reſerued ſomethinge to refectionate and releiue him. But the humble ſeruant of God could not long endure that, as being deſirous to ſerue, and not to be ſerued of any. Wherupon he ſaid once in himſelfe: Is it conuenient that thou haue alwayes a preiſt to<note place="margin">He will not liue but by almoſe.</note> ſerue thee? Is that the way of pouerty which thou ſeekeſt? and then he reſolued to be no longer ſerued, by preiſt or other perſon, and when he would eate, he tooke a diſh and went to the dores with other poore people to demaund almoſe for the loue of God: and with them did there eat what was giuen him. And albeit this was att the begining very ſharpe and difficult vnto him, yet in the progreſſe it was ſo pleaſing and contentfull, that he afterward affirmed to his Religious, that he neuer eat with ſo good an appetite as then. Being one day inuited to eat with a Prelate; he would eat nothing but

what he had brought with him of almoſe giuen att the dores. Saint Francis hauing finiſhed the reparation of the Church of S. Damian, went to repaire an other of S.

Now the hower being come of takinge their reſt, the honorable Bernard conducted the S. together with him into a chamber where there were two beddes, and each of them tooke one to lodge in: but the ſaid Bernard, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to proue ſome thing of this S. did ſubtilly fayne himſelfe inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to ſleepe: which the S. beleeiuing, roſe a lite after from his bed, fell on his knees, and directed his countenance and handes towardes heauen, entierly enflamed with diuine loue, and being ſo on his knees, he began to pray with theſe wordes: <hi>Deus meus &amp; omma.</hi> My God and althinges; O my God whoſe are all thinges, O my God who art all my<note place="margin">The pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of S.

receiued exceeding conſolation thereof, without euer vttering any other word that he could vnderſtand. The ſeruant of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted till the morning in this prayer, wherin his ſpirit was eleua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in extaſie, conſidering the great mercy which he had receiued of the diuine maieſty, and that he vouch-ſafed to vſe him for his ſeruice in this world, as he had vnderſtood by reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; Wherupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the importance of the affaire, he acknowledged his inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie and impotencie; and therfore inceſſantly played God to graunt him perfection requiſite to the enterpriſed worck, that he might ſerue him according to his deſire. Then with exceeding affection he ſaid: Thou art my God, and all my hope: all my force, my richeſſe, my life, my ioy, my ſatisfaction, and all that euer I can deſire; I poſſeſſe no other thing but thee. It is thou that haſt begun to fauour me with thy grace: graunt alſo, my moſt ſweet Lord, that I perſeuer therein, and that therwith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I be guided to my deſired end. And hereupon perſiſting in the profound conſideration of himſelfe, with a merueillous humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity reputing himſelfe to be nothing, he caſt him into the armes of the diuine &amp; celeſtiall loue, where he felt in his ſoule that ſweet communication of the grace of God. The foreſaid Bernard hauing then ſeene and heard thus much by meanes of a lampe, which he had left burning in the chamber, and knowing all to be true, the day appearing, and the holy man riſing from his prayer, Bernard ſpake vnto him in this ſort: O Francis, tell me I pray thee, what ought the ſeruant to doe, to whome the maſter hauing imparted many commodities behoufull for his vſe, he would no longer make vſe of them. The S. made anſweare vnto him ſaying. He ought to reſtore them to the party that beſtowed them on him. Bernard replyed: it ought doubtles ſo to be; and therfore, Francis my friend, I will for the loue of God diſtribute the temporall ſubſtance which till this preſent I haue enioyed, hauing receiued them as his gift, and this I will doe by your aduiſe; for I will obey and follow you in this, and in euery other thing that you ſhall command me.

Being then arriued att the Church, and hauing heard maſſe and offered their

deuotions, S. Francis comming to the Preiſt, prayed him to make the ſigne of the Croſſe on the miſſal, and then to open it, and the preiſt obeying, att the openning of the miſſal they lighted on the goſpell taken out of the 19. of S. Matthew: If thou wilt be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, goe, ſell the thinges that thou haſt, and giue to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen. Att which Councell the S. exceedingly reioyced, and for it thancked God many times. And as a perfect ſeruant of the moſt bleſſed Trinity, he demaunded of God that he would vouchſafe by three ſeuerall teſtimonies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the rule which they ſhould vndertake; and ſo they opened the booke the ſecond time, and lighted on the text of the ſame S. Matthew in the tenth chapter: Goeing thorough the world, you ſhall not carry any thing with you, neither ſiluer, two coates, ſhooes, nor ſtaffe: and this hauing confirmed them, they the third time opened the Miſſal, and found a text of the ſame S. Matthew in the ſixteenth chapter: If any man will come after me, lett him denie himſelfe, and take vp his croſſe, and follow me. S. Francis then tourning to his two new champions, ſaid vnto them: My Brethren, you haue now heard our rule, and theirs that will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here<note place="margin">Br.

Wherupon the ſaid Bernardus Quintaualle gott licence of S. Francis to goe to his houſe, where he ſold all his ſubſtance, and diſtributed it to the poore, without reſeruing any thing whatſoeuer. So making himſelfe worthy of the diuine vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he merited to be the firſt diſciple of this holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther.

A litle after which prayer, he miraculously arriued in short time where thoſe three great and true contemners of the world were. As ſoone as S. Francis ſaw him, he was ready to embrace him; but Giles falling to the ground, and reputing himſelf vnworthy of ſuch a fauour, beſought him with abondance of teares, to fauour him ſo much as to admitt him into his ſociety. The holy Father ſeeing the humility, the faith, and deuotion of a man ſo note-worthy, ſaid vnto him: My deerly-beloued Brother, acknowledge the great mercy which God ſheweth you, to receiue you this day for his ſeruant. Then he comforted him, and exhorted him to perſeuer in the vocation whervnto God had called him: And conducting him to his compagnions, he ſaid vnto them: Our God hath this day giuen vs a good Brother. They then very affectionatly and deſiredly embraced him, reioycing together with him att the ſecure acquiſition and election of the good which he had made: Then they went together to prayer, and next to dinner: afterward S. Francis called Giles vnto him to take him with him to Aſsiſium to gett an habitt: in the way they chaunced to meet a very poore woman that asked them an almoſe. S.

The Weſt was alloted vnto Brother Quintaualle, who being with his companion arriued att Florence, and not finding where to lodge, the night being come, they ſetled them ſelues againſt a wall, vnder a pent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, the maſter whereof refuſing to lodge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by reaſon of the ſtrange faſhion of their habitt, fearing that they were ſome lewd perſonnes and theeues, they all the night endured much cold, yea in great extremity in regard of the ſharpnes of the ſeaſon: neuertheles they continually prayled God: In the morning they went very early to maſſe, praying with deuotion. Now the miſtreſſe of the houſe vnder whoſe roufe they had slept the night, being preſent att that maſſe, knew them to be thoſe whome neither her husba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d nor her ſelfe would entertaine for a nightes lodgeing. She then ſaid to her ſelfe: Theſe men doubtles are no theeues as my husband did coniecture, for they ſeeme to be holy perſonnes. Theſe Religious in the meane time were beheld of each one for the nouelty of their habitt, but much more when they refuſed the mony which one preſent offered them for an almoſe. Eor therby were they knowne to be voluntarily poore for the loue of IESVS CHRIST. And therfore the man and woman that before refuſed to entertaine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by prayers conducted them to their houſe, by whome they were excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly edified, as wel by example of their life, as by the pious and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly diſcourſes wherwith they induced them to haue care of their ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les. Thus did theſe Religious paſſe Florence: The inconuenience of the night which they endured was litle in regard of that which befell them afterward: for both in reſpect of the ſtrange forme of their habitt, and for the auſterity of their life, they were moſt commonly iniuried and buffeted, becauſe almoſt euery one treated the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as ſenceles or diſtracted perſonnes. Some gaue them ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes and mockes, others caſt dirt att them, ſome pulled them by the cappuce, others cauſed children with clamours to follow them. Theſe iniuries were not only procured them by the malice of idle perſonnes, but alſo by the ſubtilty and inducement of the diuill, who thought by theſe ignominies to terrifie them, and make them deſiſt from theire holy reſolution. But they being armed with the grace and patience of IESVS CHRIST, did not, only ſupport the extremity of hunger, cold, and diſgraces, but euen did not by any exteriour ſigne appeare to be moued withall.

So farre alſo were they from replying to them that abuſed them, that receiuing their perſecutions as a great fauour, they ordinarily prayed to God for them: in ſuch ſort that theſe remonſtrances of patience and charity hauing bin by certaine weighed and conſidered, their vertue and ſanctity did conſequently appeare. They therfore repenting to haue offended them, repayred vnto them as to holy perſonnages humbly to require pardon: vertue being of ſuch force and efficacie, that albeit for a time it be reſiſted and contemned, yet in the end it doth alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quere and triumph ouer the enemies therof.

And did in deed with them attempt the iorny, reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with exceeding confidence and conducted by God himſelfe, who ſeeing their deſire vouchſafed to add more courage to that weak harted familie, who out of their ſimplicity feared, perhappes, they ſhould<note place="margin">A dreame of S.

And out of his aboundant clemency he permitted his ſeruant Francis, in a dreame, to ſee a tree of merueillous greatenes, comming to the foot wherof, he was by diuine vertue lifted from the earth, and raiſed euen to the toppe therof, which ſeemed to bend downe his braunches euen to the ground. Hauing interpreted this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be a manifeſt preſage of the fauour which he ſhould receiue of the Pope, entierly filled with a ſpirituall ioy, he recounted it to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:27206:42"/>
whome he ſo comforted, that with exceeding ſpeed they arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued att Roome: where vnderſtanding that Pope Innocent the third was att S. Iohns of Lateran, they all repayred thither. But they found him ſo employed in cogitations of trouble ſome affaires, that not hauing opportunity to heare them, he diſmiſſed them his preſence. Theſe poore people then much diſquieted, retired to the hoſpitall of S. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, where they were graciously entertained. But the Pope the night<note place="margin">A dreame of the Pope.</note> following had in a dreame this reuelation. He ſaw betweene his feet to grow a litle palme, which by litle and litle ſo grew, that it became a very faire tree. His holines muſing on this that exceedingly amazed him, ſought the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof, but the holy Ghoſt in the end illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, who gaue him to vnderſtand, that the palme ſignified the poore family of Francis, to whome he vouchſafed not to giue audience. He therfore in the morning cauſed S. Francis to be ſought, who was found in the ſaid hoſpitall, whence he was conducted to the Pope: att whoſe feet this bleſſed Father with all his company fell on his knees, and then humbly diſcouered what he deſired of his holines. The Pope<note place="margin">An other dreame and viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Pope.</note> ſeeing him, and conſidering him with more attention, called to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de what he ſeemed certaine dayes before to ſee as he was one night ſolitarily penſiue and heauy with sleepe, by meanes of waighty affaires which then did buſſy him, which was, that the ſaid Church of S. Iohn was ready to fall, and that there came afterward a poore man, miſpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the world, who ſo ſuſtayned the ſame that it fell not. The Pope then Beholding S. Francis, conſidering the purity and ſimplicitie of his ſoule, and in what ſort he contemned the world, how much he affected pouerty, the conſtancy of his firme reſolution touching the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelicall life, which he carryed written about him, and wherin he promiſed obedience to the Sea Apoſtolike, the zeale which he perceiued in him towardes the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſoules, the feruour &amp; freedome of ſpiritt for the ſeruice of IESVS CHRIST, he ſaid in himſelfe: This doubtles is the man whome I ſaw, who with his worckes of example &amp; doctrine ſhall helpe to ſupport and ſuſtaine the Church of God. Notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he differred to graunt his demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, by reaſon that it ſeemed to many Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals a matter rare, and exceeding humane forces &amp; abilities, to keep &amp; obſerue a profeſsion of ſuch rigour and pouerty. But whiles they were in the Conſiſtory thus irreſolute, the Cardinall Paul, biſhop of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bee named Iohn, a louer of the poore of IESVS CHRIST, inſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired of God, publikely vttered theſe ſpeeches: If we graunt not the demaund preſented vnto vs by this great ſeruant of God, as ſeeming vnto vs a thing ſtrange and ouer difficult, though in deed he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth only the forme and rule of the euangelicall life to be confirmed vnto him, we may iuſtly feare to offend our Lord
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:27206:43"/>
IESVS CHRIST, and the goſpell: for you know if any one ſhould affirme that ſome new or rare thing, vnreaſonable, or impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be performed were contained in the obſeruation of the euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall perfection and in the vow therof, we ſhould eſteeme him a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheamour againſt IESVS CHRIST the author of the goſpell. The Pope hauing well vnderſtood this propoſition, he tourned to S. Francis, and ſaid vnto him: My ſonne, pray vnto God that by thy interceſsion he diſcouer vnto vs his holy will, which being knowne vnto vs, we will freely and without any ſcruple approue thy demaund. S. Francis vpon this commandement departed, and with his accuſtomed feruour fell to his prayers, beſeeching our Lord that he would be pleaſed to inſpire the Pope to doe what ſhould be moſt for the glory of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine maieſtie, and to inſtruct him what ſpeech he ſhould vſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that which he ſo piously required. In this prayer it was miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously reuealed vnto him what he ſhould ſay, and was aſſured that<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabole which S. F. vſed to the Pope to perſuade him to confirme his rule.</note> the Pope ſhould condiſcendingly heare him. Being then ioyfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned to the Pope, he ſayd, that God had reuealed vnto him this ſimilitud. That a poore woman of right beautifull conntenance, and rare conditions, dwelling in the woodes, chaunced one day to be ſeene by her kinge, who admiring her ſo ſinguler beauty, reſolued to eſpouſe hir with hope to haue by her a faire and comely generation. And hauing in that ſort accepted her, ſhe in ſhort time brought him many children in that deſert, to whome being well growne, the mother ſaid: Know my children that the king is your Father, goe yee therfore to the Court, and feare not to conuerſe with the greateſt, and he will exalt you to a degree anſweareable to your diſcent. Theſe children leauing their mother, repaired to the Court, where being arriued and ſeene of the king, they weere by him with exceeding admiration att their beautie incontinently acknowledged to be his children: yet not withſtanding he demaunded them whoſe children they were: they anſweared, their mother was a poore woman, that liued in the vnco the deſert. But the king, who knew them before, and made them this demaund, only to proue the conſtancie of his children, being moued att lenght with a fatherlie affection, embraced them very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourously, and ſaid: Feare not: for if till this day I haue and doe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſtrangers, how much more reaſon haue I to maintaine you, you, I ſay, that are my moſt deere children? And this affection will I ſhew to all thoſe that henceforward ſhalbe borne of your mother my deerly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected wife. Applying which parabole, he ſaid: Holy Father, our rule and life is this poore woman, by the mercy of the king of kinges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for his eſpouſe, of whome he hath begotten many children, whome his diuine maieſty neither hath nor euer will faile to ſuſtaine:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:27206:43"/>
and as he hath a care to releeue ſtrangers, your holines need not doubt but he will alſo haue regard to maintaine and ſupport his true and ligitimate children, that the heires of the eternall king periſh not by hunger, who are borne according to his likenes, by vertue of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, of a poore mother, to witt, of the euangelicall pouerty, and nourced with his proper milk. And if the king of heauen promiſe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall kingdome to thoſe that follow him with faith and verity, how much rather will he giue them ſuch thinges as he ordinarily with ſo bountifull liberality beſtoueth indifferently on the good and the wicked?

But being one ſater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the euening gone thence, he went with a Brother to Aſsiſium, there to preach the ſunday as he was accuſtomed to doe.

The holy Father vpon this occaſion ſaid, that God would not that the firſt Brethren of the Order ſhould build an other church, to the end the foreſaid prophefie might be accompliſhed by the Frier Minors, who were to perſiſt in the perfection of Euangelicall pouerty, to encreaſe and multiplie ouer all<note place="margin">What re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t S.

And ſeeing with what liberality he gaue his mony to the poore his auarice therby encreaſed and therfore he ſpake to S.

But the S. admiring this demaund without making any reply, thruſt his hand into the purſe of Quintaualle and gaue him a handfull of mony, and then asked him if he were ſatisfied, or would haue more: wherto he anſweared that he would no more but was contented. And being retourned to his houſe, and finally perceiuing the diueliſh coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes, that had blinded him, he ſharpely reprehended and checked himſelfe, and exceedinglie commended the feruour and liberalitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Brother Bernard, and the ſanctitie of S. Francis, and as well in regard of this light of conſcience and true knowledge of him ſelfe, as that God had already elected and predeſtinated him to this new life of perfection; he had ſhortly after a ſtrange dreame three ſeuerall nightes together. He ſaw in a dreame the citty of Aſsiſium enuironned with a mighty and<note place="margin">A viſion of Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſter be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore he was reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious.</note> hideous dragon which ſeemed to intend the deſtruction, not only of the ſaid citty, but alſo of all the country neere: He ſaw alſo to proceed

For that time he ſpake not a word of this dreame, becauſe he did not perfectly beleeue: But conſidering that the Pope had confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the rule of S.

There was att that time one of the Order called Cruciferi who are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious wherof there are many in Italy, the greater part being gentil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: they are cloathed in violet, and perpetually carry a croſſe of ſiluer in their handes) his name was Mauricius who was greiuously ſick in an hoſpitall neere to Aſsiſium: where being diſpaired of and abandoned by the Phiſitions, he repoſed all his hope and confidence in God, and by meſſage vnto S. Francis, of whome he had a right good opinion, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously beſought him, that he would vouchſafe to pray to God for him. Which the holy Father hauing done, he incontinently tooke crummes of bread, which he ſteeped in the oyle of the lampe, that burned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the image of the virgin Mary, wherof he made a new kind of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, which he ſent to the ſicke perſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by two of his Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſaying vnto them: Carrye this Medicine to our Brother Mauricius, wherby God ſhall not only reſtore him to perfect health, but ſhall diſpoſe him alſo to be his ſeruaunt in our company.

Seuerin within the limites of Ancona, where he ſaw the ſaid S. miraculously croſſed with two glittering ſwordes, wherof thone reached from his head euen to the middes of his feet: and the other a croſſe from the left hand to the right; by which viſion, though he had neuer ſeene S. Francis, he notwithſtanding inſtantly knew him, and was then by God conuerted to the chaunge of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion, to abandon the world, and to vnite himſelfe with him, as well in that he had bin touched by the wordes of S. Francis, as tranſpearced with the ſword of the holy Ghoſt that iſſued out of his mouth. Hauing then miſpriſed and renounced the vanities of the world, he incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhered to the ſaid S. with a firme purpoſe to follow him. Which the holy Father preceiuing, who by the ſpiritt of God vnderſtood that his conuerſion was perfect and entierly chaunged from the inquietudes of world, to the peace and tranquility of IESVS CHRIST, he gaue him the name of Brother Pacificus. This man perſeuering in the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce of God, merited att an other time to ſee the holy Father S. Francis with the great Thau (which is a Greek letter made in forme of a croſſe) painted on his forehead with ſuch liuely colours, that they caſt as it were a diuine light vpon the face of the ſaid S. Att the very ſame time Brother Geniprus entred into the ſaid religion: he was a man endued with profound humility and patience, as in his life appeareth.</p>

                  <p>BRother Iohn a man of deep ſimplicity, was about that time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted after this manner. It happened that S. Francis goeing to preach in a church, and finding it foule and very vncleane, he ſwept it himſelfe. The report then incontinently ran through thoſe quarters, that S. Francis was arriued in that village, whervpon out of a great deuotion that the people bare him, many reprayed thither, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others the ſaid Brother Iohn, att that time a very ſimple man, who being at his labour when he vnderſtood of the comming of the S. leaſt his oxen, feild and plough to goe to ſee him, and was one of the firſt that came vnto him, whome he found ſweeping the ſaid church,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:27206:48"/>
and therfore ſaid vnto him: Brother giue me this broome, I will aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt you, and taking it out of his handes, he ended the ſweeping of the church. S. Francis ſoone after perceiuing the affluence of people there preſent, becauſe he preached to each ones great contentment, he reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe, and the ſaid Iohn inſinuating himſelfe vnto him, ſaid: I haue for many dayes had a deſire to ſerue God, and ſince I haue heard ſpoaken of you, this my deſire hath exceedingly encreaſed, but I knew not where to find you. Now ſith it pleaſed God that I haue this day mett you, I am reſolued to accompany you and to follow your commandements. The holy Father perceiuing his quality and good purpoſe, and exceedinglie reioycing in God to vnderſtand that by reaſon of his great ſimplicitie he ſhould proue a good Brother, he thus anſweared: My Brother if you deſire to obſerue our rule, and to conyoine your ſelfe with vs, it is precedentlie neceſſarie that you depriue your ſelfe of what ſoeuer you haue in the world, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing that which the goſpell doth counſaile vs, that you diſtribute it vnto the poore: for all thoſe of mine that could, haue done the ſame. Which this good and ſimple Iohn hauing heard, he retourned to the place whence he came from his labour, and looſing an oxe from the plough, he brought it to the S. and ſaid: I haue for ſo many yeares ſerued my father and his houſe, therfore though this be a very ſclender recompence, I will neuertheles, for the portion of mine inheritan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, content my ſelfe with this oxe, which, as mine I will giue to the poore, or will diſpoſe of him as to you ſhall be moſt pleaſing. But as the holie Father and he conſulted together what ſhould be done with this oxe, his kinred hauing notice that his reſolution was to leaue them, came all where he was, and did there ſo bitterlie lament, that the S. conceiued great compaſsion therat: and for their conſolation he ſaid: Prepare ſome thing ſpeedilie to eat and weep not, for I will recomfort you. So they went together to one of their houſes, where they did eat with the S. who after dinner, addreſsing himſelfe to the Father of the ſaid Iohn, ſaid vnto him: you ought not thus to diſquiett your ſelfe for that your ſonne hath a deſire to ſerue God, but rather ought you to reioyce theratt and to giue thanckes to IESVS CHRIST, who is content to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by one of your bloud: by meane of this yourſonne Iohn, you this day gaine all our Religious to be your children and Brethren. And he being the creature of God (whome to ſerue is to raigne hath) now ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de choice to ſerue his Creatour. But that, in this his ſeruice of God, you remaine not vtterly diſcomforted, I will that in regard of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty he leaue you this oxe, wheras according to the goſpell he ought to giue it to other poore people. His parentes did then ſhew themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:27206:48"/>
much comforted, eſpecially in regard of the oxe he left them, for they lamented him as much in reſpect of their pouerty, as their ſonne did of charity. By this meane S. Francis gayned his Brother Iohn, as Elias did Elizaeus, retiring him from temporall labour to the perfect la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<note place="margin">3. <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.</note> of the vigne of God. And becauſe the S. exceedinglie affected po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty in himſelfe and in others, being once cloathed, he euer after tooke him with him for his companion: which ſo augmented in him this his ſimplicity of hart, that whatſoeuer he ſaw the S. to doe, the ſame he ſought to imitate. For if he ſaw him in prayer, he would ſeeke ſome place where he might eaſily obſerue him, to conforme himſelfe vnto him euen in his very geſtures, ſo that if S. Francis were on his knees; or ſtanding vp right in prayer, or proſtrate with his face vpon the earth, or if he held his handes ioyned together on high, if he ſighed, if he<note place="margin">Meruei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicite of Br.

Francis once reprehending him for it, he thus anſweared: I haue promiſed to God to doe what ſoeuer I ſhall ſee you doe, and therfore I muſt endeauour to conforme me entierly vnto you. The holy Father admired and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether reioyced to finde him ſo conſtant in his ſimplicity, by meane wherof he ſo much att lenght profited in all other kind of vertues, that all the other Brethren held the perfection wherto he arriued in great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. But by reaſon that the world was not worthie of ſo pure a conſcience, God afterwardes called him to himſelfe. After his death S.

Francis anſweared: If thou deſire to enter into this order, goe firſt and acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh the ſaying<note place="margin">

He then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently went and diſtributed all his goodes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his kinred, being herevnto moued rather by paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the fleſh, then deuotion of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt: and then retourned to S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis, to whome he ſaid: Father I haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all that I had. The holie Father dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him in what manner he had diſpoſed therof: and he replyed that he had diſtributed it amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g his poore and needy kinred. S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis then knowing that this man had not<note place="margin">Seculer almoſe.</note> any feruour of ſpiritt, ſaid vnto him: Brother Fly, ſith thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they goodes to they kinred, gett thee home, and aſke no more to liue of almo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with my poore Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

                  <p>SAint Francis knowing that his religion was inſtituted of the holy Ghoſt in the church of God for a mirrour or looking glaſſe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſinners might behold and contemplate their deformitie, and how far different and diſtant they are from the liknes of God: he for this reſpect endeauoured to annoynt his Brethren with the vnction of IESVS CHRIST, by whoſe vertue he begatt them. So then being repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, his Order did not only encreaſe in nomber, but in vertue alſo and edification of the faithfull: and to the end that beſides their deuotion they might alſo be exerciſed in charitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and loue of their neighbour, ſith they were piously to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſe in the world, he would often louinglie ſitt downe with them, and in the name of God command, now one, then an other, to make ſome exhortation of that which the holy Ghoſt ſhould dictate vnto him; and this he pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed often. And one time of all other, they, whome he had enioyned to ſpeake, did all deliuer ſuch excellent and admirable thinges of the bounty and goodnes of God and of his ſecrettes, and this vnpremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated only by the vertue of obedience, that themſelues grew into admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therof.

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:27206:49"/>
his Brethren were rauiſhed in extaſie, and fell all in a ſound and as dead to the ground. Being retourned to themſelues S. Francis ſaid: My deerly beloued Brethren, we are much obliged to be thankfull vnto God, for that it hath pleaſed his diuine Maieſty, to manifeſt his treaſure by the mouth of the ſimple, and to appeare vnto vs to lett vs know that he was preſent, and that when it pleaſeth him, he maketh the mouthes of infantes, of the ſimple and mute, to appeare right elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. Theſe ſeruantes of God thus repleniſhed with ſo great a light of diuine grace, S. Francis ſent them to illuminate the world, and att their retourne they all repayred to our ladie of Angels, as their true mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and there they enioyed againe each others ſight with an extreame contentment, which ſo filled them with a ſpirituall exultation, that they eaſilie forgott the labours and contradictions which in their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiles they had endured. The other Brethren that ſtirred not from the Couent, though ſometimes they were employed in manuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours about the neceſsities of their houſe, neuertheles, the chiefeſt part<note place="margin">Greatfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of the firſt Freer Minors.</note> of their exerciſe was in prayer, for they very frequentlie prayed with feruour and teares. They aroſe att midnight watching to pray to God for themſelues and for all other ſinners. They had a very tender and mutuall loue to each other. The holy Father ſerued them as a mother doth her only ſonne: charitie ſo burned in them all, that it ſeemed very eaſy vnto them to ſpend their life, not onlie for the loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, but euen for the ſafty of one of their Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Two Brothers walking one day through the feildes, they mett a foole, that caſt ſtones att one of them: which the other perceiuing, he ſtept before his companion to receiue the ſtrokes of the ſtones. Theſe good Brethren did ſuch and the like thinges, being induced therto out of perfect charity. They reuerenced one an other, as maſters, and he that by his office, or age, was amongeſt them the principall, would appeare the moſt humble and abiect: they exerciſed themſelues in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, each of them being prepared to performe, not only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but euen the will, of his Superiour. They vndoubtedly beleeued that whatſoeuer was commanded them was the will of God, and by that meanes obedience was eaſy and pleaſing vnto them: that they might not be iudged by others, they accuſed and condemned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues: and if any ſo much forgatt himſelfe as to vtter a ſcandalous word to one of his Brethren, he would conceaue ſuch remorce and greife theratt, that he was not well, nor could repoſe, till he fell att his feet whome he had offended: to whome, with demaund of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,<note place="margin">Notable chaſtice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate words.</note> he acknowledged his fault, and herewith not content, he would pray the Brother offended to ſett his foot on his mouth, and tread
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:27206:50"/>
hard vpon it: In this manner chaſtiſsing themſelues, did they ſuppreſſe and trample pride vnder foot. This was not practiſed only among the ſimple Brethren, but among the Superiours themſelues: For in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer place one found himſelfe to haue with out reaſon offended any Brother, he commanded the offended to ſett his foot on his throat, that by this meane the malice and tyrannie of the deuill being ſuppreſſed, loue and fraternall charity might be conſerued among them. They alſo<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act.</hi> 2. &amp; 4.</note> armed themſelues againſt vices, and exerciſed vertues: beſide this, they vſed their habites, bookes, and other moueables in common, that none among them might preſume to call any thing mine. And albeit they were in deepe degree of pouerty, they were neuertheles in their hartes exceeding rich and moſt liberall, and very freely and ioyfully gaue what was demaunded of them, for the loue of God, fulfilling<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.</note> his word, who ſaith. Giue that Gratis which you haue receiued for nothing. If any poore people begged the almoſe which had bin giuen them, they gaue it them. He that had not what to giue to the poore that aſked him an almoſe, would giue them part of the habitt that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him. When the rich of this world came to viſitt them, to conferre with them of ſome ſpirituall matter, they ioyfully entertayned them, and delighted ſometime to frequent their company, ſo to finde occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to perſuade them to leaue their ſinnes, and to induce and moue them to doe doe pennance, When their holy Father was to ſend them into the world, they would inſtantly, and as a ſinguler father, craue of him not to ſend them into their owne country, therby to auoyd the conuerſation of their kinred and freindes of this world: becauſe this ſeemed vnto them a certaine kinde of retourne to the world. For what ſoeuer neceſsity that might befall them in their trauaile, they took nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gold, ſiluer, nor otherkind of mony, becauſe they ſingulerly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned it, and aboue all thinges, did from their hartes tread it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot.</p>
                  <p>Being ſo freed and exempted of all wordly deſires, they numbred themſelues with thoſe of whome Iſai ſaid: how beautifull and ſwift are<note place="margin">

Thus did theſe true Religious, circuit the world, by the ſtreight and ſharpe way of their pouerty, ſurmounting the hard ſtones of ſelfe deſires and euill inclinations, breaking the thicke cloudes of the ſinnes and depraued cuſtomes of worldly men, with great paine of their life, walking on the thornes of tribulations and contrarietyes, with exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples,<note place="margin">S.

The holy Father did alſo exerciſe his children in hauing care of leapers, ſo to plant in their ſoule a firme root of humility and mortification of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:27206:50"/>
themſelues: and therfore ordayned his Brethren to be att the hoſpitall of leapers when occaſion required, to ſerue and miniſter vnto them. If any Gentilman preſented himſelfe to be receiued into the order, among many things propounded vnto him, one of the principall was, that he ſhould ſerue leapers, and dwell in their houſe when he ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: conſidered withall that S.

When S. Francis ſent his brethren to any place, he gaue them this document. Haue alwayes humility and honeſtie in your company, and in the morning till the third hower, keepe ſilence ſtrictlie, and in the meane while offer your deuotion and pray to God in your hart. Vtter not wordes that are idle and without fruit, neither doe you giue eare vnto them: becauſe in whatſoeuer place you walke or be, your conuerſation ought to be no leſſe humble and modeſt then if you were in your oratory or cell, ſith that where ſoeuer we goe or be, we haue alwayes with vs our cell which is our body, wherof our ſoule is the hermite, which reſideth therin to pray vnto God and to meditate on his benefittes. And therfore if the ſoule reſt not in peace in this celle, that of the monaſtery will litle auaile vnto a Brother: Liue in ſuch ſort as no man be ſcandalized att you: but that each one by your ſweetnes be induced to peace, to benignity and concord: conſidering that to this end we be called, to witt, to cure the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to reduce thoſe that erre, into the right way, and to make vnion where there was diuiſion, faſtening them together with the ſweet nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the feare of God.</p>
                  <p>He afterward explicated vnto them the ſtate of the Freer Minors, ſaying: The Religion of the Freer Minors is a nett, that taketh the great fiſhes for God, and letteth the leſſer eſcape: and the life and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of the Freer Minors is a little flock and fold of ſheep, which the Sonne of God hath deſired his heauenlie Father to giue vnto him in this later time, which were a people repleniſhed with humility, and with ſo abiect a pouerty, that they were different from all other, and were content to poſſes no other thing in this world but himſelfe, in regard that his Father had giuen them vnto him. Herevnto he added that for this reſpect, God had commanded him in a reuelation to call<note place="margin">Why the Religious of S.

And albeit this hath bin vnderſtood in the perſon of all the poore of ſpiritt: yet was it particulerly ſpoaken concerning the Religion of the Freer Minors, who were to renew in the church the primitiue eſtate of the Apoſtles. Thus did the holy Father encourage them, without feare to trauaile ouer the world, ſecurely to denounce, and ſimplie to preach pennance, repoſing their confidence in God who had vanquiſhed the world, who would ſpeake for gayning of ſoules for them and in them, by meane of the holy Ghoſt.

And as one that had well<note place="margin">A memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſpeech of S.

In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Order, albeit he had not ſufficient almoſe of bread to releiue his Brethren, yet for the moſt part he demaunded no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, becauſe himſelfe and his Brethren were ſo attentiue and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the ſpiritt and to prayer, that out of forgetfulnes they omitted to demaund almoſe, and therfore refected themſelues with hearbes and rootes, which they did eate with exceeding good appetit, and great contentment. The holy Father in his health did very ſeldome, or almoſt neuer eate any meat dreſſed by fier. His ordinarie repaſt was bread and water, and if att any time he did eat of ſuch, it was of boyled hearbes, which he ſo mingled with aſhes or cold water, that looſing their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, they were worſe then raw, and drincking water, he toke only ſo much as he thought would ſuffice him, not to quench<note place="margin">S.

His ordinarie table was the ground, neither had his Brethren other during his life. He euerie day inuented and found ſome extraordinary manner of abſtinence, ſo atttentiue and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full was he to chaſtice the fleſh, and to render it obedient to reaſon, that it might not hinder the profitable progreſſe of the ſoule.</p>
                  <p>He deuided the yeare into diuers Lentes, all which he faſted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterelie, and firſt, the Lent which our Lord, faſted which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

Then, incontinently after Eaſter, he kept an other Lent, to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniſe the feaſt of the holy Ghoſt, in which he prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in example of the Apoſtles for ſo great a comming. An other he made in honour of the Apoſtles S. Peter and S. Paul: an other from the feaſt of the ſaid Apoſtles, to the aſſumption of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary. After this Lent, he faſted till the feaſt of S. Michaell the Archangell. Beſides the foreſaid Lentes, he very auſterely faſted the Aduent: He left it as a precept to all his Brethren to faſt it, from the day after the feaſt of Alſaintes, according to the ſame forme of the quality of meat which himſelfe vſed.<note place="margin">What poore are theeues.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Touching the reſt of his auſtere life, it may be conceaued by that, which he ſaid of himſelfe: I was neuer theefe in demaunding almoſe ſuperfluously: yea I haue alwayes taken leſſe of that which I needed, therby not to fruſtrate other poore: becauſe if I ſhould haue done otherwiſe, I ſhould haue condemned my ſelfe of manifeſt theft.

If in his ſicknes he were conſtrayned to eat fleſh, from the time of his recouery he would for pennance double his ordinarie abſtinence. In regard wherof, Brother Giles would commonly, ſay, that if S. Francis had a body ſound and ſtronge as he deſired, all the world together had not equaliſed him for ſufferance and patience in auſterityes. But becauſe the merite and nobleneſſe of vertue conſiſteth not only in the party of the body, but of the ſpiritt: therfore by how much his bodilie force did faile, ſo much were the feruours of his ſpiritt refortified, ſo that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded without compariſon, his naturall forces, and that was his great crowne: And therfore appearing one day to Brother Giles, and telling him that he deſired to ſpeake foure wordes vnto him, he anſweared and ſaid, learne firſt with thy ſelfe that which thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſay to me.

                  <p>THe bleſſed Father liued with an extreame rigour and ſharpnes of diſcipline, to conſerue the virginall ſplendor of chaſtity, very diligently enflaming the interiour and exteriour man. For this cauſe in the beginning of his conuerſion, he often times, during the winter ſeaſon, caſt himſelfe all naked in the middes of ſnowes or on the ice, that he might perfectly ſubdue his domeſticall ennemy the fleſh, and conſerue the ſhining robe of immaculate virginity, from the fire of ſenſuality, not permitting it long reſidence therin, as by this example ſhall appeare. Being one day in the hermitage Lautiauo, making his prayer in a celle apart, the deuill called him thriſe, ſaying: Francis, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, Francis: to whome thoughe the S. anſweared, yet knew he not who called him.

                     </note> the world whome God doth not pardon if he conuert himſelfe: but he that ſhall kill himſelfe by ouer rigorous pennance, ſhall neuer finde mercie before the face of God. The holy Father then knew the deceipt of the wicked ennemye, hidden vnder the ſweetnes of thoſe wordes: and he knew it the more apparantly, in that att the ſame inſtant by the loathſome breath of that foule dragon, which enflameth the coales of hell, he had a vehement temtation of the fleſh: which the louer of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie feeling, he diſcloathed himſelfe, and with his corde very ſharpelie beate himſelfe, ſaying: Goe to, Brother aſſe, this kindnes I muſt ſhew<note place="margin">Strange mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of S.

And if thou deſire to be gon, get thee now thus whipt whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt. Goeing then foorth of his cell, he threw himſelfe on the ſnow, and incontinentlie made ſeauen boules of the ſnow which he ſett before him, and ſaid: behold, my bodie, the greateſt of theſe boules is thy wife, and theſe four are two daughters and two ſonnes which ſhe hath conceiued by thee, and the other two are a man and maid ſeruant that are to ſerue thee, take them now and gett them cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for they faint with cold. And if this new ſolicitude be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to thee, content thy ſelfe to ſerue one ſole maſter, who is much more eaſy to pleaſe then this fleſh. Thus was the deuill confounded, the temptation croſled, and the holy Father was in ſuch ſort victorious, that the deuill durſt no more to viſitt him with the like tentations.</p>

By this ſo generous act of reſiſtance againſt the fleſh he left to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, a documente and example to reſiſt ſenſuall temptations, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by prayer, but alſo by corporall labours, with rigour and aſperitie, accompained with abondance of teares, and not deliciouslie as the worldlie and carnall would gladlie doe, and without any labour that might be any way troubleſome, nor much leſſe with cold purpoſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then actes of the will, wherin certaine ſpirituall perſonnes that are tender and delicate place their force and knowledg. Wherefore it is not to be admired, if they be alwayes feeble and imperfect, becauſe they ſhall euer proue ſuch, whiles they omitt the corporall exerciſe of the vertues, and of the ſteppes of their ſpirituall Father and maſter. To the end therfore that this example might profitt vs, God would that whiles the Seraphicall S. was employed heerin, a Brother that was in prayer ſaw and heard all that paſſed, by reaſon that the moone did ſhine: which being perceaued by the holie Father, he recounted vnto him the cauſe, which was the temptation, but with commandement, not to diſcouer it to any perſon of the world, during his life.</p>

It is as difficult for a man that is no more then perfect to preſerue himſelfe from theſe thinges, as to walke and goe bare-foot on burning coales without burning.

The king hearing this ſaid: How haſt thou dared, thou lewd fellowe, ſo vnchaſtly to behold my wife? thou haſt coueted the pourchaſe of what thou ſo attentiuelie haſt beheld. Therevpon he preſentlie recalled the other page, of whom he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded what his opinion was of his wife, he anſweared: Syr I eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me exceeding well of her: for ſhe gaue a very willing eare to what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liured in your behalfe.

If by chaunce he ſaw any loitring and idle perſon, that would eat of an others labour, he ſaid that he ought to be called Brother Fly: becauſe, not doeing any good, but diſtayning and hindering the good worckes of others, he ought to be reputed contemptible and abhominable.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of the inſtitution of the order, to giue example of exerciſe vnto his Brethren, he trauailed alone to ſeeke almoſe, wherin he extremelie laboured his body that was already very ſickly. He ſpent the night in watchinges and continuall prayers, and the day in reading the office, in ſeruing and preaching in the townes and villages, or in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:27206:55"/>
to leapers, or decking and triming the churches. It ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded afterward that many Brethren, who were not fitt to keep the quire, did liue of the labours of others, as of Brother Giles, Brother Gini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pero, and ſome others who were imployed in certaine profitable occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, to ſhuune the capitall ennemy of the life and ſoule: thence it proceeded that they had ſufficient almoſe for themſelues and for others. Neither would he permitt his Brethren to giue eare to newes and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeculer matters, that they came not, by omitting the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation and taſt of celeſtiall thinges, to employ themſelues in vaine and worldly thinges, which they had already abandoned. It was not permitted to any of them to relate what he heard abroad. All they that were nere S. Francis, were aſwell by night as day exerciſed in diuine prayſes: wherin they rather ſeemed Angels the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men. In this ſort did they maintaine the ſchoole of the holy Father, in labour and exerciſes of the ſpiritt. Among the ſaid Brethren it was held a great ſinne, for one to take his recreation and pleaſure in any other thing then the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſpiritt. The holy Father affirmed, that the negligent and sloathfull that applyed not themſelues to any exerciſe, ſhould be inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently vomited out of the mouth of God. And if he mett with any<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Apoc.</hi> 3.</note> ſuch, he would incontinently reprehend him, as one that by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was in continuall exerciſe, to the end that in his ſchoole none ſhould looſe any part of ſo great a benefitt as is time, which is giuen vs by our lord IESVS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>After his refection he accuſtomed with his Brethren to vſe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, to auoyd idlenes, that when afterwardes they were to pray, they might not, by meane of their vnfruitfull wordes then vttered, looſe the gifte and recompence which they had merited att the handes of God. So, the more to ſhunne idlenes, he gaue this rule, that by his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement all the Brethren that ſhould vtter any idle word conuerſing or<note place="margin">The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations of the Freer Minors which S.

But if he were firſt admoniſhed and reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by an other, the ſaid Pater noſter ſhould be for the ſoule of the reprehender. And if the culpable would not admitt the admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, mayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainning his ſpeech not to be idle, the holy Father ordayned, that he ſhould be obliged to redouble the ſaid pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and now to ſay twice the Pater noſter, once for the reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, and once for him that ſhould iudge his worde to be idle or vnprofitable. Now the prayſes which he orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be ſaid before and after the Pater noſter, he would they ſhould be vttered with ſuch and ſo diſtinct a voice, that it might be vnderſtood of all the Brethren there preſent, who ſhould then be ſilent to heare

the prayſe of God: and if any one then ſpake, he ſhould in like manner be obliged to ſay Pater noſter for him that was to praiſe. He would that all the Brethren entring into any houſe or other place: and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually meeting one an other, ſhould prayſe God, ſaying God be prayſed, or ſome like wordes. This Seraphicall Father was accuſtomed to giue theſe honoures to God with a moſt zealous feruour, and deſired that all his Brethren ſhould be carefull and religious in doeing the like.</p>

                  <p>THe holy Father extremely abhorred murmurers, the venimous fruit of murmures growing of the peſtiferous tree of idlenes, yea he ſhunned them aboue all other kind of vicious perſonnes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming them to haue a moſt mortall venime in the topp of their ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, wherewith they empoyſon men both preſent and abſent. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing one day heard a Brother offending the reputation of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he tourned to Brother Peter Catanio, and crying with a loud voice, he vttered theſe wordes: Diſcorde, beginneth to enter into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, if detractours be not chaſticed with diſcipline, and if theſe loathſome mouthes be not ſtopt, the ſweet odour of the good, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently be infected. Ariſe, ariſe ſpeedily, and dilligently examine the matter: and if thou finde the offended Brother innocent, chaſtice the murmurer ſharpely, that he ſerue for an example to all others. And ſo I will that all Gardiens and Miniſters be verie vigillant, that this peſtiferous infirmitie take not root in religion. To this purpoſe he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid, that whoſoeuer did fruſtrate his Brother of his glory and fame, merited to be depriued of the habitt of the order, and of all power euer to lift vp his eyes to God, till he had to his power reſtored the honour taken from his Brother. He further affirmed, that the crueltie of detractors exceeded that of murderers, in regard of the law of IESVS CHRIST, which is not accompliſhed but in charitie, and doth more oblige vs to deſire the good of the ſoule, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body.</p>
                  <p>In this reſpect the Brethren from that holie time, as obedient chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that deſired to accompliſh the iuſt will of their Father, were with their beſt induſtrie warie therof, becauſe to murmure, what other thing is it (ſaid the ſame holie Father) then with the gall of<note place="margin">

the defectes of their Superiours and of the Order. Therfore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the malediction of God, they wallow in filth like hogges, and ſeeke to lay falſe imputations on their Brethren, and to make them like vnto themſelues, who haue their conſciences exceedingly defiled and loathſome, their office is conformable to that of dogges, to bite, to barck, and to complaine of the order of the Superiours and of the diſcipline. The voice of the murmurer is thus: I want perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of life and true knowledge, I cannot attaine to taſt the ſweetnes of God, and therfore I cannot find place neere his diuine Maiſtie, nor repoſe with men.

Thoſe fellowes ſeeke to ſeeme vertuous, not to be ſo, and accuſe the vices of others, without indeauouring in the meane time co correct their owne.

                  <p>HE had an eſpeciall care that his Brethen in their prayers, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne offices, and corporall exerciſes, ſhould euer haue interiourly ſome ſpirituall ioy againſt the venime of idlenes and mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, &amp; as a ſigne that they were the habitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ieſus Chriſt. He did with all ſingularly affect in them this peace and alacrity of ſpiritt: he aſſured
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:27206:57"/>
them that this ſpirituall ioy was directly oppoſite to all kinde of deceipt and temptation of the deuill, and ſaid vnto them: that if the ſeruaunt of God did labour to conſerue in him interiourly and exteriourly the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity which ſpringeth of the purity of the ſoule as his proper fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, which is cauſed by the vertue of prayer, the deuilles cannot annoy him: for they will ſay, If this man be ioyfull in afflictions and trauailes, by what meanes can we procure him euill? And on the contrary, when the deuill ſeeth the ſeruaunt of God diſarmed of this ſpirituall alacrity, he hopeth with all to make him looſe the taſt of prayer, and of all his other good worckes, and eſpecially of the puritie of the ſoule: for he well knoweth with what temptations and by what slightes he can endom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and robbe the peace of the ſpiritt, and of the good diſpoſition which is in the ſeruaunt of God. But this miſcheuious beaſt ſhall haue leſſe power, when the ſoule ſhalbe dilligent to expell this heauines by the vertue of prayer, which as a moſt pleaſing odour hath power to chace far a way from her, this fierce and venimous ſerpent: but when the hart is oppreſſed with griefe and heauines, the deuill reioyceth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he very eaſily plongeth him into melancholy or into diſpaire, or perſuadeth it to wallow in worldly pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Thus did the holy Father exceedingly labour, to preſerue the ioy of the hart, which is the oyle of ſpirituall vnction, wherwith the holy Ghoſt annoynteth thoſe whom he hath ſanctiſied: and thereby preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the dangerous diſeaſe of idlenes and of ſpirituall diſtaſt, which the Sainct with ſuch dilligence endeauoured to exterminate, that when he felt it to breed in him, he had incontinently recourſe to prayer, as to a moſt aſſured remedy and preſeruatiue againſt ſo perillous a diſeaſe. He counſailed his Brethren in like ſort when they felt themſelues troubled, to haue inſtant recourſe to prayer, and being on their knees proſtrate on the earth before God, to ſay: Reſtore me, if thou pleaſe my God, that grace which thou wert pleaſed formerly to graunt vnto my ſoule, whereto I beſeech thee to giue that alacrity and raſt which it felt in thy holy ſeruice, and comfort me by the ſame that I do not periſh: and he admoniſhed them thus to perſeuer till they were heard, and that their former ioy retourned vnto them. For ſaid he, if the ſoule permitt it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe to be tranſported to heauines of ſpiritt, the vice of confuſion of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilon will grow in it, which ruſtieth the hart and ſilleth it with ſorrow, if it be not waſhed with teares. And know yee (ſaid this good Father) that the alacrity which proceedeth of a good conſcience and of vnion with God by prayer, is one of the principall giftes which one is to recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and receaued ought to conſerue. Labour then all of you to obtaine it, ſith I loue it for my ſelfe, and deſire it for you, both exteriourly and interiourly for the glory of God, and the greater confuſion of the deuill,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:27206:57"/>
who only and his haue occaſion to be melancholie: wheras we on the contrary ought to reioyce in God. I know well that the deuilles beare me enuie, and that they cannot, but againſt their wil, endure ſo many graces to be imparted vnto me by his diuine maieſty: and ſeeing they can not annoye me, they endeauour to trouble my fellow-brethren: but they leſſe preuayling therin, if it pleaſe God, they ſhall depart with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. If ſometimes they tempt me with slugiſhnes, idlenes, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines of ſpiritt, I free me therof, by conſideration of the alacritie of my Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Now it is here to be vnderſtood, that the holie Father being an Idea and paterne of all true modeſtie, he did not meane that one ſhould ſhew a vaine ioy of ſpeech, or of light laughter: for that is not the alacritie which the true ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST ought to haue (as ſome eſteeme) which is but a vanitie and a manifeſt ſigne of litle ſpiritt. S.

                     </note> vnto them, what was the ioy of the true ſeruantes of God, ſaying: That Brother may be called happy, who hath not his ioy but in worckes and wordes of charity, by example and document wherof men are induced to loue, prayſe and honour God. And on the contrary, wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched is the Brother that is delighted in idle wordes, wher with he mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth men to laughter: in whome, that is verified which the Apoſtle ſaith, that his religion is vaine and vnfruitfull. So that by ſpirituall ioy he meant the feruour, reſolution, readines and taſt of the will &amp; of the bodye prompt with alacritie to attempt all good: by which feruour and ioy, men are oftentimes more edified then by the very worckes they doe, be they neuer ſo good, if they ſeeme to be done with an euill will: becauſe they repreſent the idlenes &amp; anxietie of the will and the sloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes of the body in doeing well: ſo that they doe not edifie, but corrupt. The holy Father affected grauity in himſelfe and others, that the ioy of the ſpiritt might not ſeeme a certaine vaine mirth. He well knew by experience, that this grauity would ſerue him as a wall againſt the dartes of the deuill, becauſe the ſoule diſarmed therof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth light and vaine, and as a naked man amongſt potent enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that ſeeke all meanes to murder him.</p>

To the end alſo that the ſaid diſciples ſhould praiſe God with one hart, and according to the Apoſtle ſhould reioyce with the ioyfull, and mourne with the ſorrowfull, neuer permitting any roote of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, enuie, or any other diſordinate paſsion to enter into them: and that the greater ſhould be aſſuredly vnited in a true loue of charitye, with the leaſt, the prudent and wiſe with the ſimple, as true Brethren, and they that are in their country with ſuch as are come from farre. He one day propoſed to his Brethren an example, to this purpoſe, of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table doctrine and efficacie.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing, ſaid he, that a generall chapter were held of all the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren that are in the glory of paradice, and as there are both learned and ſimple ignorantes, that haue vowed to ſerue God, without any ſcience acquyred: lett commandement be giuen to a learned man, and to a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ignorant to make each of them a ſermon, the learned conſidering what he was to ſay, thus diſcourſed with himſelfe: where there are ſo many of perfect knowledge, it would be vnprofitable for me, to appeare learned, my auditours being incapable of further ſcience to premeditate to make election and ſearch of curious and ſubtill matters, before more curious then my ſelfe, would appeare ridiculous: but peraduenture I ſhalbe better and more voluntarily heard, yea and with more fruit, if I diſcourſe ſimply. Now the prefixed day being come, all the holy Saints aſſemble in the place deputed to heare the ſermon of the Doctour, who appeared cloathed with a rude ſack cloth, and his head couered with aſhes. Thoſe preſent more admired this habitt, then the wordes which were compendious, breife and ſimple in theſe termes: My Brethren, we<note place="margin">A briefe, but fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> haue promiſed great matters: but greaters are promiſed vs. Lett vs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly performe thoſe: and tenderly aſpire att theſe. The pleaſure of ſinne is breife, but the paine therof is without end. The labour of vertue is ſmall: but the glory gotten therby is infinite. Many are called: but few are choſen, and each one in the end ſhall receiue according to his deſerte. Theſe ſo pregnant and patheticall wordes, did ſo touch and moue the hartes of the audience, that they were conſtrayned to ſhed abondance of teares, exceedingly prayſing this Preacher, and eſteeming him a holy perſon. The ſimple ignorant then that was alſo to preach, ſaid to himſelfe: Sith this learned Preacher hath made vſe in his ſermon of my ſimplicity, I know what I will doe: I haue ſome verſes of the Pſalter by hart, them will I ſett foorth the moſt eloquently and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly that I can, ſith that the doctour hath preached like a ſimple man. The houre of his ſermon being come, this ſimple man roſe vp, and repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, he propounded his theme with
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:27206:58"/>
ſuch feruour, ſo ingeniously and clearly, yea with ſuch eloquence by the grace which God imparted vnto him, that his auditours filled with admiration, ſayd: Without doubt God doth ſpeake in the ſimple.</p>
                  <p>Now S. Francis expounded this figure in this manner: Our Religion, ſaid he, is a great and generall congregation, in which are vnited from all partes of the world a great nomber of men, vnder one ſame forme and rule of life: The prudent therein ought to make vſe of the grace that is in the idiotes, which is to be employed in worckes of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as true diſciples of IESVS CHRIST, and ſo to benefitt themſelues therby, when they ſhall ſee them exerciſed, with a liuely intention in celeſtiall vertues, and voluntarily to heare the myſticall doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, yea with a pious and holy enuy to reſemble them, and to cleare their ſpirittes of all preſumption, that they may be enriched of God, with the ſpiritt of humility and diuine theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie. On the contrary, the ſimple ought to be very carefull to make their profitt more of workes, then of doctrine and to conuert the ſcience which they ſee in the learned, into ſo much fruit, ſeeing the honour and reuerence which they exhibitt to the rule and to ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of life, whereas they being ſo noble and ſo learned, might liue in the world as Lordes, and yet they haue made themſelues litle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had true knowledge of the greatnes of God. Then he  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that in this worthy concord conſiſted true peace, in this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of hartes repoſed true ioye of ſpiritt, yea all the beautie and perfection of all their congregation, and that by this only meane they might become gratefull and pleaſing to the eternall Father, who as he had engendred them, and alwayes conſerued them in grace, would alſo afterward vnite them, together in glory.</p>

Take (ſaid he) a<note place="margin">Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of a dead body to one truly obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</note> dead man without ſoule and ſett him where you will, he doth not in any ſort contradict you, he reſiſteth not, if you chaunge his place he doth not murmure, if you ſett him downe he complayneth not, if you leaue him there, he doth there remaine: if you ſett him on a bench, he no more looketh vp then downe, if you cloath him with purple, he will not become the more proud: ſuch is the true obedient, that iudgeth not to haue chaunged place, and if any chardge be giuen him, the dignity maketh him not to forgett humilitie: but the more he is honoured, the more doth he eſteeme himſelfe vnworthy therof. Therfore, though this holy Father, as a good Euangelicall marchaunt, had by diuers meanes purchaſed diuine richeſſe, and employed the time preſent in meriting, yet would he not be ſuperiour, but a ſubiect: he would not command, but obey: that he might not only leaue vnto his Brethren the quality of a good Superiour, but of a good and obedient ſubiect alſo, that may liue a life of continuall martyrdome, when the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates are meere libertines. Therfore, when his Order began to multiply, he refuſed to be Generall therof, and did incontinently ſubmit himſelfe

to a Gardian whome he obeyed in all things, as in place proper we ſhall recount.</p>

Yet did he not forbeare as Prelate, to aduertiſe the Superiours of his Order, that they ſhould rarelie charge vpon obedience, becauſe one ſhouid not incontinently proceed with ſuch thundering rigour, which ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be the laſt, when no other meane can auayle: for one ought not vpon light acccaſion to lay the hand one the ſword. Then addreſsing himſelfe to his Brethren, he would ſay: He that will not obey with diligence, may be nombred among them that feare not God nor reſpect men. Now the one and the other of theſe opinions are true and worthy<note place="margin">What a rash Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious is.</note> to be marked, becauſe in a raſh man, auctority to command is no other thing then a ſword in the hand of one that is furious, &amp; there is no thinge more deſperate and incurable then a Brother without obedience: in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect wherof the holy Father deteſted pride as the originall of all kind of euils, and diſobedience as the eldeſt daughter therof. Not with ſtanding he did not reiect the humble penance of the diſobient Brother, when he performed the ſame, as by the enſuying chapter ſhall appeare.</p>

                  <head>How S. Francis ſent Brother Ruffinus to preach without the caepuce in vertue of obedience, and of the penance which therſore he inflicted on himſelfe.</head>
                  <head type="sub">THE XLI. CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>BY this that followeth there appeareth a merueillous order for gouernment: to witt, that the Superiour ought not to command vnto his ſubiects the thinge that himſelfe would not doe. S. Francis one day called vnto him Brother Ruffinus, whome he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to goe preach in the cittie of Aſsiſium, and to deliuer vnto the people onlie what God ſhould inſpire vnto him: but Brother Ruffinus making his excuſe, anſweared: Pardon me if you pleaſe, good Father, you know I am not apt to preach, becauſe I haue not any grace in my ſpeech as being too ſimple and an idiot. Which he ſpake with much hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie. And though in deed he had bin a diſcreet knight in the world, he was, neuertheles ſo chaunged in himſelfe by meanes of the grace of contemplation which he had receiued of God; that he was manie times out of himſelfe, and ſpake verie ſeldome, and yet that litle was with ſuch difficulty, that he ſeemed to ſpeake with exceedinge paine: but the S. reprehending him for not hauing inſtantlie obeyed, commanded him further vpon obedience, and gaue him for penance, to goe without his capuce.</p>
                  <p>The obedient Brother Ruffinus then, without farther contradiction, hauing put off his capuce, and falling one the ground demaunded his benediction, which hauing receiued, he went to Aſsiſium, and firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a church, there to make his prayer: which done, he aſcended the pulpitt, and began to preach. The people then aſſembled, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring to ſee him without capuce, and amazed att ſuch a noueltie, ſaid one to an other: theſe poore Freers doe ſuch auſtere penance, that there withall they looſe their witts. So whiles this good Brother preached, S. Francis conſidering the prompt obedience of Brother Ruffinus, and the rigour of his commandement, he began to check himſelfe, thus reaſoning the matter: What will haſt thou gotten, thou ſonne of Peter Bernardone, thou of ſo meane eſtate, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Brother Ruffinus, who is one of the principall gentlemen of Aſsiſium, to goe preach without his capuce? I will make thee to be an example of what thou haſt commanded to an other: and ſpeaking thus to himſelfe, he haſtiely tooke the capuce from his owne head, and taking Brother Leo for companion, he went to Aſsiſium. Being come into the church where Brother Ruffinus preached, the people that ſaw him without capuce, eſteemed him to be likewiſe fooliſh, beleeuing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:27206:61"/>
that the Br. Ruffinus and he were become ſottiſh, by meanes of their ouer ſharpe penance: many people therfore flocking thither, Brother Ruffinus in the beſt manner he could deliuered this ſpeech.</p>

Francis he diſcended from the pulpitt, to come vnto him: and the S. incontinentlie aſcended. The Church was then entierlie full of wordlie people: for ſome came thither to ſee the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of that life, others moued with compaſsion and deuotion, and others to deride them reputing them ſenceles: but the holie Ghoſt that was in S. Francis, cauſed him to vtter ſuch worthy and merueillous matters, of the contempt of the world, of holie and neceſſary penance, and of voluntary pouerty, of the deſire of the kingdome of heauen, of obedience, of the nuditie, ignominies, and paſsion of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and other like thinges, which he declared in ſuch manner, and with ſuch feruour, that they who formerlie derided the noueltie of his habitt, and reputed theſe Brethren to be out of their right ſences, did now bitterly weepe, and ſuch was that weeping, and ſo violent for the compaſsion which they had of the death of IESVS CHRIST crucified, and the feare which they conceaued of hell, that they began to crie for mercie, as if it had bin an other good friday (on which day the Paſsion is preached ſo patheticallie in Italy, that all the world cryeth mercie, as one would doe att the ſacking of a towne.) Wherfore the people being ſo edified and contrite, Brother Leo, who had brought with him both the capuces, gaue to each one his owne: &amp; they afterward retourned to their Monaſterie, prayſing God for his great mercie, ſith by the vertue of holie obedience, they had obtayned victorie ouer themſelues, and manifeſted how much they contemned the world. They had much to doe to be ridd of the people, that before reputed them for fooles: and now he that could touch or kiſſe their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittes eſteemed himſelfe happy. It appeared by the end of this worck, that the beginning proceeded of God, though it were wrought by an exceſsiue meane as the worcke of the Prophettes, not ſo much to be imitated, as for a ſigne of approbation of holy obedience, of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſelfe will, and contempt of the world: and that we might know what glorious end God giueth to the worckes of holy obedience, either ſecrett or manifeſt, as it pleaſeth him.</p>

                  <p>AMong many giftes and ſinguler fauours which the glorious S. receaued att the bountifull hand of God, one of the principall was that of pouerty, wherby he became a new man in the world, terrible to the deuil, and an example to all mortall people, by the loue and poſſeſsion wherof, he merited by diuine and ſpeciall priuiledge to haue principallitie in the holie Church. The ſaid S. had this particuler affection to holie pouertie, by conſideration how much it was eſteemed of the Sonne of God, whiles he conuerſed here below, and how it was then baniſhed and expelled out of all the world. He therfore deſiring with himſelfe to make his reſidence where holy pouerty was retired, renounced the world, and what ſoeuer he had proper, he gaue to the poore: and hauing for the loue of God forſaken his Father, his mother, his kinred and freindes, he remayned a perfect pilgrime on earth, to meritt to lodge in himſelfe holy pouertie ſo generallie abhorred. There was neuer auaricious of the world ſo greedy of monie and ſo carefull to keepe his treaſure, as Saint Francis was to keepe his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which he alwayes had in his eyes, and in his mouth, as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious<note place="margin">

He often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto himſelfe the pouertie of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and of his moſt ſacred mother, and practicallie taught it vnto his diſciples with great abondance of teares, aſſuring them that pouertie was the Queene of vertues, in regard that it appeared of ſuch excellent beautie in the king of heauen, and in the Queene his mother. Pouertie, ſaid he, is a principall way vnto ſaluation, as being mother and nourſe of humilitye, and the root of all perfection, whoſe fruit is of exceeding profitt and furtherance to euery one, albeit this verity be very ſecrett and vnknowne to the men of the world, it is without doubt the hidden treaſure, in the Euangelicall feild, the<note place="margin">

for he doth not perfectly renounce the world, that keepeth his purſe full of his proper iudgement and wil.</p>
                  <p>Thus diſcourſing of holy pouerty, he often reiterated the wordes of<note place="margin">

Then he exhorted his diſciples, that as poore people they ſhould build but poore cottages for their reſidence, where they ſhould remaine, not as in theire owne<note place="margin">The lawes of Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the Freer Minors.

The law of Pilgrimes, ſaid he, and their reaſonnable deſire, is to retire into the houſes of others during their voyage, conceating neuer to ſee the hower to arriue in their country, by reaſon of the great deſire they haue to be there, and to paſſe peaceably without medling in matters ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaynning to others. He called pouerty the foundation of his Order, whervpon all his edifice was grounded. Therfore he affirmed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he knew by reuelation, that the true entry of his Religion was this word of IESVS CHRIST: If thou wilt be perfect, goe, ſell the thinges that thou haſt, and giue to the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen: and come, follow me: In reſpect wherof he admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted noneinto his Order, if within the tearme of the yeare of probation they did not forſake what ſoeuer they poſſeſſed in the world. This he cauſed to be very exactly obſerued aſwell in regard of the ſaid wordes of IESVS CHRIST: as alſo that none ſhould ſearch in the<note place="margin">His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actnes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of the world.</note> treaſuries of Religion for any thing that he had putt there. And if any one demaunded the habitt of Religion not hauing made the ſaid renunciation, he would ſay vnto him: Get thee hence: for thou art not yet gone forth of thy houſe, thou haſt not forſaken that which appertayneth vnto thee, nor abandonned the feeble foundation, grounded on the ſand of affection vnto worldly goodes, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeſt of me the habitt, firſt accompliſh what thou oughteſt, and then demaund it. By the ſaid foundation he vnderſtood holy pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whome he ſometime accuſtomed to call mother, att other times eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe, and ſometime Miſtreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Goeing one day with ſome of his Brethren towardes Sienna, being verie neere the citty, he mett three women, ſo like in geſture, beauty and habitte that the one could not be diſcerned from the other, and all three with one voice ſaluted him ſaying: Holy Pouerty is welcome: which the S. hearing, exceedingly reioyced: as one that affected nothing more then to be called pouerty of each one, as he was then of the ſaid women, who incontinently diſappeared: which being ſeene and conſidered by the other Brethren his companions, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with admiration att ſuch and ſo vnwonted accident, they eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame not to want ſome great miſtery: and it doubtles was

eaſy to coniecture, that the ſaid three women (or perhaps Angels) did ſignifie the beautie and Euangelicall perfection of the three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall vowes, Pouertie, Obedience, and Chaſtitie, which IESVS CHRIST counſailed to the Brethren, all which did appeare to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall in the S. in all eminence and perfection.</p>

                  <p>The S. paſsing an other time by Bary in Apulia, ſaw a great purſe in the middes of the way which ſeemed to be full of mony: the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">An illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the deuill to a Freer Minor to teach him not to touch monie.</note> that accompanied him did exceedinglie importune him to take vp the purſe being therto induced by a pious zeale to diſtribute the mony which he beleeued to be therin, vnto the poore.

                  <p>WHen the holy Father began to haue encreaſe of Brethren, conſidering that God had giuen him ſo holy a company and ſo ſweet a conuerſation, he was exceedingly comforted, and ſo loued and honoured his children of IESVS CHRIST, that their neceſſary food failing, he ſent not them to the dores to ſeeke almoſe, but went himſelfe, which he did as wel that they ſhould not be troubled att any thing that might happen, or fearing they might be aſhamed to begge, becauſe it was then an vnuſuall thinge, as alſo that the world ſhould not giue them occaſion to repent and retourne back, againſt their holy vocation. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued this courſe till the holie winges of the loue of God and ſo holy pouerty were growne out, wherwith they were able to fly abroad and trauaile ouer the world, to become glorious in the labours of pouerty, the better to ſow the ſeed of the word of God among the people.

And albeit they were att firſt aſhamed, and that it ſeemed very hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult vnto them: yet aſsiſted by remembrance of the holy obedience which they had vowed, they found both this and euery other thing very

eaſy and pleaſant. And then ſeeing the holie Father ſo to paine himſelfe for them, they prayed him to leaue that labour vnto them. Wherto he anſweared: My beloued Brethren you ſhould not eſteeme it a difficultie to goe ſeeke almoſe from dore to dore for the loue of God, but to account it a great fauour of his. For who is he that would not more then willinglie goe to demaund almoſe, if he ſaw his Prince and Lord to goe before him, ſaying with himſelfe: What ſhall the diſciple be more worthy then the maſter, and the ſeruaunt then the Lord? ſhould it not be rather pride then ſhame? would not ſuch one deſerue rather puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then compaſsion?

We can neuer walke ſo ſtrict a way of pouertie, if we haue not firſt our Lord before our eyes as a begger whiles he liued in this world, and in like ſort all his diſciples. Therfore he ſaid by his Prophett Dauid: I am a begger and poore, God hath bin careful of me. Goe on then ſecurely after ſo worthy a Capitaine &amp; guide, to take poſſeſsion of that inheritance which IESVS CHRIST hath pourchaced vs, and hath left to them that according to his example leaue the world, and ſeeke to liue in pouertie, onlie for his loue: glorie of this inheritance and preferment, in regard that he hath giuen it only to his beloued. Know that many of the moſt noble and beſt learned men of the world ſhall adhere to our company, who ſhall repute it a great fauour in this manner to goe aske an almoſe.

But tell me, I pray you, what thing may there be had in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen or earth, that can equalize the price of the loue of God? The Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren being by their gracious Father thus induced, went with allacrity to demaund almoſe into the townes and other places: and being<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned to their Couent, they incontinentlie deliuered it to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gardian, who afterward diſtributed it in common.

                  <p>It happened one day that a Nouice was commaunded to goe to begge, but he refuſed to goe, alleadging that he ſhould be aſhamed. The holy Father vnderſtanding it, expelled him out of the Order with theſe wordes: What? Brother flye, wilt thou liue of the labour of the other Brethren, and reſt idle in the vineyard of God, as the drone, who without trauaile ſeeketh to eat the labour of the bees? The will of S. Francis was, that the Brethren ſhould often goe a begging according to their neceſsity, that they might meritt; and that being accuſtomed therto, they ſhould not be aſhamed when occaſion vrged them to goe. And ſo the more noble and the more honoured a Brother had bin in the world, the more ioyfull and content was he and the better edified, aſwell by this humility as by other ſeruices of obedience which he performed. Sometimes S. Francis encouraging his Brethren, would vſe<note place="margin">Why the Freer Minors are in the world. Mat. <hi>25.</hi>

Therupon the S. affirmed that to begge vnder the title of Freer Minor, was a thing of exceeding conſolation and recompence in the retribution of the iuſt; which forenamed title the maſter of the Euangelicall truth, particulerly ſpecified with his diuine mouth, when he ſaid by his Prophett: Man hath eaten the bread of<note place="margin">

Being one day inuited by the Cardinall of Hoſtia, who exceedinglie loued him, he firſt according to his cuſtome begged peices of bread, and hauing gott what was neceſſary, he went to the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſaid Cardinall, where he ſodenlie emptyed out all the ſaid peices of bread, and laid before him, next vnto whome was the place, of the ſaid Cardinall, who eſteemed himſelfe as it were braued thereby: yet for the preſent would ſay nothing therof. But the holy Father, thinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on what he had to doe, began to deuide his bread into many litle morcels, which he diſtributed among the noble men that were att the table, who receaued it very deuoutly, ſome of them preſentlie eating it, others kept it for reuerence. Which the Cardinall perceauing with much contentment, was ſomewhat appeaſed. Notwithſtanding after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection being retired into a chamber with S.

The holy Father anſweared him: nay I haue rather done you this day great honour, ſith that att your table hath bin honoured a greater Lord then your ſelfe, and one that is your maſter: beſides the ſubiect doeing that which his Lord commandeth him, he honoureth his maſter. For God had ſo much loued this royall pouerty, that he hath vouch-ſafed to accept her for his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe, to enrich vs her inheritours together with her, and by meanes of pouerty of ſpiritt which we ſhall haue here, to giue vs glory afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des in heauen.</p>

neceſſary for me to make my ſelfe a forme and example vnto my other Brethren: and beſides for that I well know that in this Religion, there are and ſhalbe many Brethren that ſhalbe minors in name and effect for the loue of God and by the light of the holy Ghoſt that teacheth them, with all humility to ſerue others in their neceſsity. I know likewiſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well, would to God it were not ſo, that there are and yet ſhalbe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, ſuch as ſhall haue no will to humble themſelues to aſke almoſe and to doe other ſeruile offices, be it either thorough ſhame or by corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manners.

He alſo taught them in all poore to conſider IESVS CHRIST: and therfore, meeting any poore on the way, were he neuer ſo miſerable, he did not onlie giue him (as to the perſon of IESVS CHRIST) what he had, though it were neceſſary to the entertainment of his owne life: but he euen eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it of right to be rendred as appertaining to the poore party: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will deduce and relate ſome few examples, of a great multitude which might be committed to writing of this holy Father.</p>

She went very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedlie and ioyfull to her houſe, and hauing cutt out a coat of that cloath, ſhe wanted yet a litle peice to finiſh the ſame: in which caſe not knowing what to doe, ſhe att length conſidered the liberalitie of the ſaid S. whome ſhe ſought out ſhewing vnto him the coat cutt out and what ſhe wanted. The holie Father ſeeing the neceſsitie of this poore old woman, tourning to his companion, Brother, ſaid he, behold the neceſsity of this poore woman: lett vs for the

                  <p>The S. being an other time in the Couent of Cortona, he had a new cloake, which the Brethren had made him: but ſeeing a poore man<note place="margin">Which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed diuers times.</note> that lamented his deceaſed wife and deſolate family; he endeauoured to comfort him: but the afflicted anſweared, that the occaſions of his teares were great and diuers; but that which moſt afflicted him was, the great chardge of his diſtreſſed familie that remayned deſolate and forlorne, by the death of his wife. The S. moued with compaſsion, gaue him his cloake with theſe wordes: I giue thee this for the loue of God: yet with this condition, that if it be required of thee, thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it not except thou be payed for it. Now the Brethren that had very latelie before giuen him this cloake, went whence he came, and would haue taken the cloake from the poore man: but he being emboldened vpon the wordes of the S. would not reſtore it, nor could they euer recouer it by other meanes, but by praying one to redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me it.</p>
                  <p>Retourning from Sienna, he found a poore man by the way and tourning to his companion he ſaid, it is neceſſary that I giue my cloake to this poore man, becauſe it is his: for it is lent me of God, with chardge to reſtore it to the firſt that I mett poorer then my ſelfe; and this man is much poorer, wherfore if I doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I ſhalbe a theefe: and therwith he gaue it vnto him: not withſtanding the conſiderations that his companion alleadged, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he endeauoured to perſuade him, that he was bound to ſatisfie his owne neceſsities before an others.</p>
                  <p>Comming neere to Peruſia, he mett a poore man whome he had formerlie knowne in the world, whome hauing ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and aſked how he fared, the poore man with greife, anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,<note place="margin">Likewiſe for the hire which a maſter detained from his ſeruant that cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him.</note> ill: then began to curſe his maſter, that withheld his hire, affirming it to be the cauſe of his diſpaire.

                  <p>GOeing one day to preach, he mett two of his Religious, that<note place="margin">He gaue his habit that was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him for the loue of God.</note> were French, with whome he a while diſcourſed. Theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being exceedinglie conforted both by his life, and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, according to what they had heard of him, did out of deuotion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde his owne habitt which he did weare, and that, for the loue of God: whoſe name he hearing, did inſtantlie diſcloath himſelfe, and gaue it vnto them, putting on an other which one of them did att that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent putt off: which he performed in obſeruance of his vow, which was incontinentlie to giue what ſoeuer ſhould be demaunded him for the loue of God, for reuerence to this Lord, whoſe will was to be termed, Loue: and therfore he was much offended and ſharply repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Religious when vpon any light occaſion, and without<note place="margin">Note that the loue of God ought neuer to be vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with out reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> edification of their neighbour, they named the loue of God, which ſhould not be named but to ſome good purpoſe, and that with great reuerence. The S. ſeldome or neuer weare a new habitt: for when he
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:27206:67"/>
had ſuch one made, he would incontinently chaunge it with ſome other Religious for a torne one, and ſometimes he would take a litle part of ſome ragged and worne habitt, and as much of an other, and ſo patching it together, you may imagine what manner of habitt it could be. But he no farther regarded then to couer his ſtomack that was infirme.</p>
                  <p>There came a poore man one day where he was, that aſked a peece of cloath of a Religious for the loue of God, to patch his garment. Which the S. vnderſtanding, he cauſed euery corner of the houſe to be ſearched, and being anſweared that none could be found, he retired into a corner, not to be ſeene, and ripped of that which couered his ſtomack, and gaue it the poore man. But not doeing it ſo dexterously, but that he was perceaued by the Religious, they cauſed him to reſtore it. But the holy Father would neither take it not permitt the poore man to depart, till there was an other peece of cloath giuen him.</p>
                  <p>Being in the Couent of our lady of Angels, a poore woman that had two children in his Order, came to demaund an almoſe, and he called Brother Catanius, to whome he ſaid haue we nothing to giue to this our poore mother? whereto the ſaid brother Peter anſweared: That there was nothing fitt for her, if not a new teſtament, wherin they read the leſſons att matines which might be giuen her if he thought good, conſidering that ſhe aſked almoſe and was in extreme neceſsity.<note place="margin">S.

Few bookes were then printed, in reſpect wherof they were deere. I haue alleadged this example to ſhew that this holy Father ſpared nothing from the poore that aſked it for the loue of God. Yea to performe this office of piety, if he chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to meet any poore people loaden on the way, he would diſburden them, and for a while carry their burden, that in the meane time they might take breath. He would haue all his Religious to honour the poore, as much as him ſelfe as repreſenting the perſon of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.</p>

And in that reſpect he excceedingly honoured Preachers, becauſe they alwayes rayſed ſome dead Brother vnto our Redeemer, and with a pious care endeauoured to reuoke the erring, and to confirme the imperfect in God.

                  <p>It only once happened that he ſtudyed his ſermon, and the reaſon was becauſe he was to preach before the Pope and many Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, by commandement of the Cardinall of Hoſtia Protectour of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.<note place="margin">Hauing ſeriouſly studied a ſermon he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite it.

He enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed this iorney with ſuch alacritie, that albeit he were very feeble and infirme; he notwithſtanding did alwayes ſo much out goe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that he ſeemed to fly. But being arriued in Spaine, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmityes did ſo oppreſſe him, that he could hardly trauell vnto S.

                  <p>In this iorney S. Francis was att Guimaranes a citty of Portugall,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:27206:73"/>
where it is ſaid that he rayſed the daughter of the maſter of the houſe where he lodged: thence he viſited the queene Vracca wife of king Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonſus the ſecond, who beheld him with great reuerence and deuotion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and was exceedingly comforted and edified by him. Proceeding after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on his iorney, he lighted on a riuer in the ſaid prouince of S. Iames, betweene the citties of Nonis and Orgogno, which he knew no meanes how to paſſe by reaſon there was not any houſe in that part nor perſonne to conduct him ouer. Not knowing then what to doe he had recourſe to prayer, and att the very inſtant whiles he was praying to God, there came a boy from the citty of Nonis, who hauing pitty of them, gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> encouragment ſaying, that hauing paſſed ouer his horſes that were loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with bread, he would vnload them and retourning, would conduct them ouer: which he performed, and hauing guided them to Orgog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, he lodged them in a houſe of his where he putt his bread, wherin he gaue them the beſt entertainement he could deuiſe: for which the holy Father gaue him many thanckes att his departure, and ſaid: God giue you the payment which he hath promiſed to good people: and ſo departed.</p>
                  <p>That very yeare (which is worthy admiration) this yong man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourning from Rome hauing viſited the Apoſtles S. Peter and S.

His prayer was not fruſtrate, for by the merittes of the bleſſed Father S. Francis, as by the conſequence is apparent, God heard him from heauen, and ſo he died in the very pilgrimage. His Father by letters from freindes being aduertiſed of his death, after much lamentation, procured the office of piety to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for his ſoule, att the end of which office, there appeared in the<note place="margin">Seuenty Frier Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors were miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Italy into Spaine att the ſeruice of a benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of S.

After they had ſung maſſe, the parentes of the deceaſed inuited them to eat with them, which they did, and then departed, and a great multitude of thoſe people conducted them very farre: the table was afterward found furniſhed with meate, as if they had not eaten. This miracle being perceaued, many ran after them to ſee if they could recouer them, and know the place of their reſidence, but they could neuer ſee nor heare of them. It was then iudged, that this was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the curteſy which the deceaſed had done to S.

did not sleep: for he vſed all the slightes he could deuiſe wherwith to confound the ſame. And becauſe he knew well that it entierly conſiſted in the head which was S.

Knowing therfore that all kind of vertue was compleat in the ſaid S. he alſo ſtirred all his miniſters againſt him, who notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding could no further preuaile then God would permitt.

The gloutonus Satan watched and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to procure ſome relaxation in the rigour of his diett, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and cloathing. The impatient Aſmodeus armed himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him to leuell att the patience of the holie Father. The loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and filthy Behemol aſſaulted him, preſenting ſenſualitie, often vnto him, with endeauour to defile the candour of his virginitie. Belzebub the captaine of the idle, omitted no time to tempt him with sloath, and by ſome apparant reaſons, to perſuade him to ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſome litle recreation: The perſecuting prince Leuiathan, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with naturall perturbations, diſcontentements, and diſguſtes, wherwith the fleſh afflicted the peace and charitie of the S. againſt which Golias and his army, the humble Dauid in the name and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his God, obtayned ſo glorious a victorie, that he might well ſing: Francis hath ruined and ſubdued an hundred thouſand enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and hath driuen away the deriſions and rebukes which the diuels procured vnto the Church by auarice and ſenſualitie. But God would that the deuill himſelfe ſhould by the mouth of the poſſeſſed, acknowledge the cruell warre that S.

                  <p>One time when God permitted him for his greater good to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the deuill drawe him into ſo deepe a melancholy of ſpiritt, that exteriourly there appeared many ſignes therof, he being no longer able to conceale nor moderate the ſame, in ſuch ſort as he ſeemed to be<note place="margin">S.

                  <p>Being an other time afflicted with the ſaid infirmitie of his eyes, in ſuch ſort as for the ſpace of fifty dayes together, he could ſee no light, he was placed in a very darck cell made of ruſhes, mattes, and earth: there did he endure ſuch exceſsiue greife, as he could not haue one ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of repoſe.

Which the woman ſeeing, though ſhe were ſinfull, began to cry out that ſhe had greiuously offended God, and his ſeruaunt: and falling one her knees demaunded pardon of him. Wherfore they that attended on the ſtears without the dore to ſee the ſucceſſe of their lewd deſigne, confounded and filled with feare and terrour, repenting their peruerſe Counſaile did alſo aske pardon, and relating all to the Emperour, himſelfe ſending for the S. did likewiſe craue his pardon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted him to be mindfull of him and his in his deuotions: thus in one inſtant he ſubdued the pleaſure of the fleſh that was lewdly offered him by the woman, and the deuill that had plotted the ſame, remained conquered, and the Emperour and his Courtiers clearly aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the S. his life was conformable to his wordes, and finally God was prayſed.</p>

the more they aſſaulted him, the more courage and vallour did he gett, ſaying: I will defend me, My God, from the fury of theſe wicked ſpirittes, vnder the ſhadow of thy winges and of thy graces. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metimes, euen being in the deſert, he vrged them by theſe wordes. Ye falſe and wicked ſpirittes make boldly what anatomie of me you will, for ſure I am you ſhall doe no more then my God will permitt you, whoſe creature I am, and for whome I am ready to endure as much tribulation as he will giue me, by your meane. The deuils no longer able to endure this notable conſtancie, departed vtterly confounded.</p>
                  <p>S. Francis remayning one day in a Churche of S. Peter, neere to Bolonia, deſired to repoſe awhile, to make his prayer afterward. He had ſcarcely enclined his head, but he began to feele his ennemies, wherfore making the ſigne of the croſſe, he went out of the Church and ſaid vnto them: yee deuils I coniure you in the name of God the Father almighty, that to this my body you doe what ſoeuer my God hath permitted you: for I am prepared to endure althinges for his loue, and becauſe I haue no greater ennemie then my body, reuenge me one it: which hauing ſaid, they fled vtterlie confounded.</p>

                  <p>A very ſpirituall Religious and one of the moſt auncient of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, very familiar with S. Francis being afflicted with carnall temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by extrauagant imaginations, in ſuch ſort as he was

                  <p>Brother Roger de la Marque, a Religious of pious conuerſation, was by diuine permiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo tempted of the deuils, that he eſteemed himſelfe forſaken of God: and becauſe no application did auaile him, he reſolued to vſe this laſt refuge: I will, ſaid he goe ſeeke out S.

Hauing thus determined, he tooke his way towardes the holy Father, who was att Aſsiſium in the Biſhops houſe who then was ſick, where he had reuelation of all this, wherfore he commanded Brother Leo and Brother Macie to goe meet him and to tell him in his name; that he loued him particulerly aboue all other of his Religion: which the ſaid Religious vnderſtanding, full of conſolation, he fell on his knees with the interiour of his hart giuing thanckes to God, for that he neuer abandoneth his ſeruantes, but doth euer giue eare to the prayers of thoſe that hope in him: and giueth them the helpe of his grace to perſeuer in his ſeruice.

                  <p>Brother Angelus was alſo ſo greiuously tempted that he durſt not be alone in the night, for feare of the deuils: but S.

                  <head type="sub">THE LXXVIII. CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>BRother Ruffinus the companion of S: Francis was one time ſo extremely and cruelly tempted, with a temptation of diffidence of predeſtination, that I doubt whither there could be a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whence may be collected what slightes the deuill doth vſe, to ſeeke the ruine of the moſt perfect, if God did not exceedingly aſsiſt them. Brother Ruffinus was a Religious of a pious and holy conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of very deepe contemplation; wherfore the deuill hauing te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with diffidence of predeſtination, made it ſeeme vnto him that all the labours, troubles and afflictions which he endured were loſt, with the time which he vnprofitably ſpent in Religion, by reaſon that he was not predeſtinate vnto glory: which temptation augmenting, though he omitted not to conuerſe with his Brethren, did neuertheles make him exceeding ſorrowfull. And becauſe he was fearfull and aſhamed to diſcouer it to any one, the deuill by diuine permiſsion did tempt him more and more. Wherfore aſſaulting him both exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly and interiourly, he one time appeared vnto him in forme of a crucifix, that ſeeming to haue compaſsion on him, ſaid: Poore man why doeſt thou afflict thee with ſo many abſtinences without fruit? what auaile thee ſo many prayers? ſith all the world toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot chaunge that which from all eternity hath bin orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the prouidence of my Father: wherby thou art not of the nomber of the predeſtinate, but of the reprobate. Wherfore I am moued with compaſsion of thy ſo great ſufferance: that att leaſt thou begin not they hell during they life, and albeit I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diuers time inſpited thee interiourly: I am now content to appeare vnto thee ſuch as I am, and by mine ordinary cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie to aſſure thee of that which onlie I doe know, ſith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie I doe damne and ſaue, which I doe to putt thee out of all doubt, and to the end thou no longer beleeue that other damned alſo, that ſonne of Bernardone, who ſhall goe to hell with his Father, and all they that follow him ſhalbe deceaued. And after theſe wordes he vaniſhed, leauing the poore Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ruffinus in ſuch heauines (a miſerie that doth proſtrate and ouetthrow the greateſt ſeruants of God) and in his ſpiritt ſo ſhadowed by the great princes of darcknes, that he was euen ready to looſe the faith he had in God and in his holy ſeruant:
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:27206:88"/>
to whome notwithſtanding the aforeſaid, he imparted nothing of his affliction.</p>

Francis: by which wordes Brother Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie eſteeming that he might be deluded by the deuill, amiably replyed ſaying. Oh God, brother Ruffinus what wordes haue you vttered? are you beſides you ſelfe? or doe you yeeld to be deluded by the deuill? Know you not that S. Francis is an Angel of heauen on earth? Is it not knowne vnto vs how many millions of ſoules God hath ſaued &amp; will ſaue by his meanes: how he hath illuminated the world, and how much ourſelues perticulerly are by him illuminated? howſoeuer ſith he hath expresly ſent for you, I will that you repaire vnto him, becauſe indeed I know that you are exceedingly deluded by the deuill.</p>
                  <p>Brother Ruffinus being by theſe wordes att length perſuaded, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther reply went with him, and came to S. Francis: in whoſe preſence appearing, the deuill loſt his prey. For after he had recounted vnto the S. all the circonſtances of his temptation by order, and had receaued demonſtrations of the S. to witt that the deuill did harden the hearts of men, and God on the contrary did ſoften and mollifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,<note place="margin">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed his ſinne in concealing his temptation S.

And if this horrible deuill retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to tempt thee, vſe theſe wordes vnto him: Thou baſe and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome deuill, open wide thy lying mouth, that I may fill it full of filth. Thus Brother Ruffinus retourning to his ſaid mountaine and celle the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to lament his paſſed errour, Satan preſented himſelfe vnto him in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of IESVS CHRIST crucified, and ſaid did I not forbid thee to beleeue Brother Francis? But brother Ruffinus intertupted his wordes, and anſweared: Thou loathſome and lying deuill, open that thy mouth, where out iſſue ſuch horrible lyes, that I may fill it with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany: which the falſe and proud deceauer hearing departed, making ſuch a terrible ruine of the ſtones of the montaine which he threw downe by groſſe heapes hurling the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſuch impetuoſity, that the ſtones &amp; flintes

                  <p>This ſtorme was heard euen to the place where S. Francis was, who with his companions went out to ſee whence proceeded this terrible noyſe. They were all exceedingly terrified, S. Francis excepted, who incontinently imagined the cauſe.

Francis to whome to the great ioy and contentement of all the hearers he recounted all the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon with exceeding admiration he demaunded for whome that ſeat was prepared, and he heard a voice that ſaid: this ſeat was one of the principall Seraphins, that fell into hell, and now it is reſerued for the right humble Francis. After this viſion, Brother Ruffinus had an extreme deſire to know wherin principally conſiſted that ſo great humility which was ſo meritorious in the bleſſed Father ſaint Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis: hauing therfore ſome diſcourſe one day with him he ſaid: My beloued Father, I hartely beſeeche you to tell me certainely what is your owne eſteeme and what opinion you haue of your ſelfe. Sainct Francis anſweared: Verily I hold my ſelfe for the greateſt ſinner of the world, and toe ſerue God leſſe then any other. Brother Ruffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus replyed vnto him: that he did not thinck he could ſpeake the ſame ſincerily and with a cleare conſcience; it being ſo that others, as was apparent, did committ many greiuous ſinnes, wherof by the grace of God he was innocent. To this S. Francis anſweared: If God had with ſo great mercy fauoured thoſe others of whome you ſpeake, I am aſſured that how ſoeuer wicked and deteſtable they may be now, they would farre more gratefully acknowledge the giftes of God, then I doe and would ſerue him much better. And if my God ſhould now forſake me, I ſhould perpetrate more enormities then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other. In regard therfore of this ineffable grace done vnto me, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe and acknowledge my ſelfe to be the greateſt ſinner that is. Brother Ruffinus by this anſweare was thoroughly confirmed in the viſion which God had ſhewed vnto him, hauing found good demonſtration of the meritt of the holy Fathers humility.</p>

beare him: where haue you learned, that if an other ſinner had recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or ſhould receaue the talent of grace which God hath giuen you, that he would more acknowledge it, and make better profitt therof then you haue done? Vpon what reaſon, vpon what doctrine, and on what ſpiritt is grounded the foundation of this feeble opinion which you ſeeme to haue of your ſelfe? For I firmely beleue that if<note place="margin">The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere.</note> God had knowne it, he would neuer haue beſtowed this grace on you, but rather on that other. The moſt humble Father to this obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction might well anſweare, that he had learned it of the doctrine of<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, who with his mouth hath ſaid, The ſpiritt breatheth where he will; and of S. Paul, that neither<note place="margin">1.

And wheras you beleeue, that if God had giuen it to an other, it had bin knowne that he had done this or more, your beleefe is falſe: for as the ſame S. Paul ſaith, it is in the power of the Potter, to frame one pott for honour, and an other for diſhonour,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> one for vſe of meat, and an other to ſerue for the chamber. Neuertheles it would be ridiculous, for the veſſell to complaine, and ſay: why is this honour giuen to him rather then to me? for thus it hath pleaſed him, becauſe he is the maſter.</p>

And this, I ſay, proueth, not that he maketh the faire, foule in eſſence, but in apparence only, by comparaiſon made of a thing imperfectly faire, with an other beautifull in the higheſt degree. It being ſuppoſed then that I haue yet in me ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me good (as it may be) neuertheles when I fix mine eyes on that diuine ſunne of iuſtice, I am enforced and conſtrained to behold the great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of ſunne motes of mine imperfections in his cleare beames, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron reflecting as one ought, I know my baſenes and mine imperfection to be infinite, and to become as a nothing in this mine accident all beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But becauſe that which is true cannot be otherwiſe: I retourne and reenter into my ſelfe, where conſidering the greatnes of my naturall ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenes, I acknowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nothing in my ſelfe but the grace of God that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:27206:91"/>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. In which reſpect I ought to humble my ſelfe, and beleeue that touching this point there is no man in the world, any way inferiour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. This equality layd, the force of humility doth after enter into<note place="margin">Pſal. 21.</note> his meritt: wheras among men we are all naturally equall in imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: therfore the truly humble doth honour and repute all other as greater then himſelfe, and that is the black colour, which the Sunne of his grace doth by his goodnes giue him, with which humilitie God himſelfe (made man) being cloathed, ſaid: I am not a man, but a worme, the contempt of men and out-caſt of the people. And if IESVS CHRIST ſpake this of himſelfe, who is the mouth of trueth, who can euer contemne a man and ſay that he doth falſely eſteeme himſelfe leſſe then other men. And therfore God doth farther ſay: learne of me becauſe I am meek and humble of hart; learne of me, ſaith he, becauſe he knew that proud humane ignorance, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue, I will not ſay teach, this doctrine more then humane by its appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent<note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> and ſophiſticall reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s. But learne of me, to wit, what God is, and what is ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: for I being the one and the other together, none can better know the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my ſelfe, what difference there is betweene thes two. Now of this conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> proceedeth true and perfect humility, and therfore it is greater in the bleſſed that clearly ſee the Sunne of iuſtice in his ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, then in themſelues walking in the pilgrimage of this world, wherin by faith and imperfect charity they receaue the diuine beames only by reuerberation and reflection in the cloud of their imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and therfore the nerer the true ſeruant approacheth vnto him with the vnderſtanding, the more humble he is. So, as the glorious virgin Mary was the moſt humble of all creatures on earth, euen ſo is ſhe moſt humble of all in heauen, though ſhe be att the right hand of her Sonne: becauſe the more ſhe doth participate of that diuine and infinite light, and doth more clearly and with greater glory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template that ſo great depth of the infinite and high diuine bounty, ſo much better doth ſhe ſee the goulfe of her litlenes, which in the end is to be a creature, which is nothing in compariſon of her Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, before whome ſhe bendeth her knees with farre more reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce then euer did the foure and twenty ancientes, whome S. Iohn ſaw proſtrate before the throne of the liuing God, becauſe ſhe<note place="margin">Apoc. 4.</note> hath a deeper knowledge of him then they. Therfore lett all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſon be ſilent, mute, and giue place in the certaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of true diuine humilitie, ſith it cannot penetrat the deep ſecrettes of God, by meane wherof, with a moſt miraculous ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration it then raiſeth a ſoule more high, when it moſt debaſeth her to the profundity of her conſideration, and then it procureth her
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:27206:92"/>
a crowne in heauen, and maketh her true Queene in that eternall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when it cauſeth her to be inferiour, slaue, and ſubiect to all creatures for the only loue of God, which being her foundation, it<note place="margin">What humility is.</note> is not to be admired if her building ariſe to ſuch an hight. For humilitie is no other thing then a profound and continual humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſoule vnto his diuine Maiſtie, cauſed by his diuine liberality. And therfore ſhe ought duely to conſider with what benignity his maieſty vnited himſelfe vnto vs, receauing into him our ſo baſe and abiect nature, wherof he would make vſe to raiſe and relieue our ſo extreme po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie: of this knowledge will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> grow and encreaſe in the ſoule the true loue and approbation of the obligation we haue vnto God. It cannot be expreſſed how inſatiable a thing it is to deſire alwayes to correſpond vnto IESVS CHRIST, in worckes, miſpriſing ones ſelfe for his loue, and euer deſirously giuing eare vnto the foreſaid voice. Learne of me, by the true doctrine whereof there arriueth vnto the ſoule by ſuch a humility, ſubiection, not only vnto God and his commandementes, but euen, for his loue vnto all creatures, and ſhe reputeth them her betters and ſuperiours, though they be ſinners, hauing her eye only one her baſenes or lownes, which is ſuch, as cannot be greater. So miſpriſing her ſelfe to the vtmoſt, ſhe ſaith with her Lord IESVS CHRIST. I am a worme, and not a man, the contempt of men, and the out caſt of the people. By which wordes the queſtion is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and reſolued.</p>

And for the ſame cauſe he would not that the ſuperiours ſhould be called Priors, but Miniſters and ſeruantes:<note place="margin">Matt. 20.</note> (A name impoſed by IESVS CHRIST, in the goſpell, when he ſaid, that he was come to ſerue) to the end that by ſuch a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, they might be alwayes mindfull both of their office and of their author IESVS CHRIST.

                  <p>IT is not then to be admired, if this holy Father exerciſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie, not only that his ſoule might be pleaſing vnto God, who is ennemy to the proude, and moſt liberall of grace, towardes the humble, but alſo that by meane of it, he might edifie his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and conuert ſoules vnto God, by way of humility pourcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that which otherwiſe he could not haue obtayned, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: Arriuing one day att Imola there to preach, and hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded leaue of the Biſhop, he gaue him anſweare that himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe could ſufficiently diſchardge the office of preaching vnto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.

Which the biſhop hearing, being ouercome with his humility, he embraced him, ſaying: that himſelfe and all his Religious ſhould thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a generall licence freely preach ouer all his biſhopperick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe humility deſerued it. I know hereby, added he, that it is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, if humility encline the will of man, ſith it enforceth euen the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent diuine will to condiſcend to the deſires of the humble, as the Angel ſaid to Iacob: If thou haſt bin ſtrong againſt God, how much more ſhalt thou preuaile againſt men? The holy Father then with this arme of humility deliuered many ſoules out of the handes of the deuill, and out of the throat of hell, as we haue ſeene and by the example fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſhall appeare.</p>
                  <p>Certainne Religious miniſtring vnto a leaper, as S.

Theſe good Religious vnable to ſupport thoſe blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that were ſo horrrible as would haue made an Infidell to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they went to the holy Father, who in perſon reſolued to viſitt him. And entring into the chamber of the ſicke, he ſaid: My Brother

God giue thee his peace, and he anſweared: What peace can I haue, ſith from the time that God did interiourly and exteriourly deprine me of it, I haue euer bin in cruell warre? S. Francis comforting him, replyed: My Brother and Freeind, you muſt haue patience: for theſe afflictions which you endure in body wil auaile to the ſaluation of your ſoule, if you patientlie ſupport them. But the leaper anſweared: how can I poſsibly haue patience, conſidering that myne afflictions are ſo permanent that they permitt me no eaſe day, nor night, and beſides your Religious doe exceedingly aggrauate the greife of mine infirmity: for not onlie they doe not aſsiſt and ſerue me, but they afflict me euen to death. The holy Father knowing by diuine inſpiration, that this wretch was tourmented by the deuill: went preſentlie to offer his prayers for him, which done, he retourned and ſaid vnto him: Goe to, my good freind ſith theſe Religious doe not ſerue you well, I will ſerue you my ſelfe.

                  <p>But there hapened a notable miracle, whiles the holy Father with his pitifull handes waſhed him, all the ſcurfes of his leapry one after an other fell off, ſo that the fleſh remayned cleane and neat as of a litle child: in fine, he was entierly cleanſed and cured within and without. The diſeaſed perſon therfore knowing this great miracle, began very bitterly to lament, ſaying: I am worthy not of one, but of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand helles, as well for hauing blaſphemed againſt God, as for the contempts, iniuries, and buffettes, wherby I haue offended your poore Religious, that ſo louingly haue miniſtred vnto me. And after his cure he remayned fifteene dayes in this lamentation, then he made a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall confeſsion, imploring the ayd of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. S. Francis left him not till fearing himſelfe, for the great concourſe of people that repayred to this miracle, he was conſtrayned to depart, ſo leauing the man in the grace of God, who ſhortly after paſſed from this world into an other. And incontinentlie, the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being in prayer, he appeared vnto him in heauen more bright then the ſunne, and ſaid: Father, know you me? The S. asked him, who are you?

                  <p>BRother Angelus being Gardian att Mount Caſal, three famous theeues haunted that place, doeing cruell murders thereabout, who being one day oppreſſed with hungar, came to him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding ſomewhat to eat. The good Guardian knowing them, not only refuſed to giue them almoſe, but began to check and reprehend them: alleadging that they feared not God nor men whome they ſo miſerablie slew, liuing by the labours of others, and leading a life more diabolicall then humane, robbing, diſhonouring, tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and cutting the throates of their neighbour as they did, and that he admired how the earth did ſuſtaine them, that it did not ſwallow them quick as they were: and ſo bad them haſt away, and withall rudely ſhutt the dore againſt them, wherevpon they in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme choller departed. S. Francis a litle after came with one of his companions vnto that place, to whome the Guardian recounted the precedent; whereto the holy Father anſweared, that he had done very ill, becauſe ſuch ſinners retourne to God and are conuerted, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by ſweet and pittifull wordes, then by ſuch reprehenſions which did rather harden them, and that therfore God ſaid, They that are in health, need not a Phiſition, but they that are ill att eaſe, &amp; that he came not to call the iuſt, but ſinners to repentance. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, added he becauſe you haue done againſt charity, the commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the goſpell, &amp; the example of IESVS CHRIST, I command you in vertue of obedience, for pennance to cary them to the mountaine where they are, this loafe of bread &amp; this flagon of wine, which was giuen vs by the way, &amp; when you come in their preſence, fall one your knees at their feet, and aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the wordes you haue ſpoken: &amp; when

they haue taken the bread, entreat them in my behalfe to Ieaue that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable kinde of life, and I will prouide for all their neceſsities, and vſe all the art you can deuiſe to induce them hither. The moſt obedient Guardian preſentlie went on, and the holy father in the meane while went to the Church to pray for them, whence he departed not till God had heard him.</p>
                  <p>Brother Angelus comming to the theeues, and hauing performed the commandement of S. Francis, whiles they did eat the bread, one of them ſaid to the others; Alas what ſhall become of vs ſottiſh wretches, what muſt be our lott, what horrible torments are prepared for vs in hell, for ſo many theftes and murders as we daylie perpetrat? neither yet haue we any ſcruple, much leſſe feare of God, or repentance for ſo many enormous ſinnes. And this Religious who hath brought vs to eat, is come thus farre, with ſo great humility to aske vs pardon for one only word iuſtlie vttered vnto vs, admoniſhing vs according to our deſert, in the meane while we wretched theeues and deteſtable robbers, neuer demaund pardon of God. Beſides this he hath ſheuen vs charity praying vs to repaire to that holy Father, who hath ſent vs releefe, who for the zeale he hath of our ſoules, doth ſo freelie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs alwayes to prouide vs all our neceſsities. They are true ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantes of God who haue already gayned heauen: but what ſhall we doe, who being children of the deuill, euery day heape ſinnes vpon ſinnes, conſidering withall that our ſinnes are ſo enormous as deſerue of God, rather puniſhment then pardon. Myne opinion therfore is, that it were very conuenient, ſith God doth ſeeme to call vs by this Religious, that we make no longer delay, nor abuſe the patience of his diuine maieſty, but that we repaire vnto him, and he will inſtruct vs in the direct way how to free our ſelues att length from hell, and euen to meritt mercy.</p>
                  <p>The other two theeues being of the ſame opinion, they went together with the Guardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the holy Father, in whoſe preſence being com they kneeled att his feete, ſaying: Father we haue litle hope, by reaſon of the enormity of our ſinnes, that God will vſe mercie vnto vs, but if you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure vs that we may yet finde grace, behold vs here ready to doe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you ſhall command vs. The holy Father receaued them verie amiably cheriſhed and encouraged them, affirming withall that they ſhould not doubt but God was very ready to pardon them, whenſoeuer they ſhould be reſolued to leaue their ſinnes, and that they ſhould reſt aſſured therof, otherwiſe they ſhould committ a greater ſinne then any other that they had formerly comitted: and therfore he promiſed and aſſured them God would pardon them all. Theſe three theues therfore being conuerted, did not only abandon their lewd life, but did perfectly
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:27206:97"/>
renounce the world, and became Religious of his Order, where liuing piously, two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a litle after paſſed from this life to a better. But the third liued many yeares after, wherin often conſidering the enormity of his ſinnes paſt, he was ſo penitent for them that for fifteene yeares to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether he faſted three dayes euery weeke, with only bread and water, beſides the lent and ordinary abſtinences of the Order, and was neuer cloathed but with an old habitt without tunicle, he diſciplined himſelfe euery day, and after mattins slept no more, but continued ſtill in prayer. In this time S. Francis departed to the glory which God had prepared him: and he ſuruiuing, perſeuering, and continuyng in the aſperity of life which he had begun, and in continuall and feruent prayers, had a reuelation from God of the paines of hell, and of the glory of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, ſuch as followeth:</p>

                  <p>THis theefe conuerted by S. Francis, being according to his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome one night after matines in prayer, he found himſelfe ſo oppreſſed with sleepe, that he could not ouercome it how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he ſtrayned himſelfe againſt it, ſo that he was enforced to fall into a deep sleepe, and was incontinentlie eleuated in ſpiritt by the Angel of God, that carryed him ouer an high mountaine all enuironned with groſſe cutting ſtones, vpon which the Angell that carryed him lett him fall, from the toppe of the mountaine euen to the bottome of the vally, where being vtterlie cruſhed, as he ſeemed and rather dead then aliue, the Angell called him and bid him ariſe: becauſe he had yet a long iorney to make. The Religious anſweared him: how is it poſsible you ſhould be ſo cruell as that, ſeeing in what plight I am, you would I ſhould trauaile? The Angel then tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him cured all his greifes: then goeing before him, ſhewed him a field full of ſharpe ſtones, thornes &amp; wild thiſſels, which he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him to paſſe through bare foot as he was. The Religious knowing no excuſe, paſſed through it, with ſuch paine as may be imagined. After that he forced him to e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter into a burning furnace which was at the end of the ſaid feild: for hauing refuſed to enter in, he cauſed him to be throwne in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:27206:98"/>
with a forcke, by the deuils there preſent. Hauing remayned ſome ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me in that eternall fire, there enduring that, which he alone that hath proued it can expreſſe, the Angel drue him out, and bid him prepare himſelfe to paſſe further: wherevpon he lamenting that without any pitty he would force him further, ſo burned and halfe dead as he was, the Angel touched him and cured his burning. Then he brought him vpon a bridge; that was in ſuch ſort made as he could not paſſe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out falling; for it was narrow and round, ſo that the feet could take no hold theron. Vnder it there ran a very ſwifte flud full of fearefull and terrible dragons and ſerpentes: the Religious therefore excuſed himſelfe, affirming that he could not paſſe it without falling: the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell bid him follow him and not to feare, but in his goeing, to ſett his feet where he ſhould ſee him ſtepp before. So was he enforced to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him euen to the middes of the bridge with a feare that freezed his breſt: but the worſt was, that being there, the Angel diſappearing, left him, and aſcended a mountaine, whereon was a very beautifull citty, leauing the poore Religious in ſuch feare as each one may imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne: who beheld vnder the bridge thoſe horrible dragons, that with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen mouth attended his fall only to deuoure him inſtantly.</p>
                  <p>He being in ſuch extremity, not knowing what elſe to doe, very fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly embraced the bridge, and began to lament and inuocate the name of IESVS, whome he beſought to haue pitty on him in that extreme neceſsity, and to deliuer him of that imminent perill. God hauing heard him, he ſeemed by litle and litle to haue winges grow out on his backe: wherevpon he began to hope, that his winges growing great he ſhould fly vnto his guide. Now wanting patience to expect the full growth of his winges, ſuch being his deſire to be thence, he endeauoured to fly: but he fell againe on the bridge, and his winges alſo were looſed from his<note place="margin">Pſal. 54.</note> backe. Wherefore embracing the bridge againe, he began to lament and with the Prophet to ſay: Who ſhall giue me winges of a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doue, that fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſo perillous and mortall eſtate, I may attaine a ſecure repoſe? Onely thou my lord IESVS CHRIST, my ſole hope and true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe. He had ſcarcely ended theſe wordes, but his winges did grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine: but he had no more power then before to expect the ſufficient growth of his winges<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of his extreme feare, ſo that he fell and loſt them againe. Then he prayed, and reſolued to expect till his winges were fitt to carry him, though euery hower ſeemed to him a thouſand yeares. So hauing attended till he knew them to be of ſufficient ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght and force, he mounted into the aire, and flew vp to the high mountai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne where his guide was, where they both together went towardes the gate of that ſupreme citty, wherinto the Porter admitting the Angell, made him ſtay without, aſking him who he was, and who emboldened
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:27206:98"/>
him to come there, He anſweared that he was a Frere Minor, and that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming ſo farre was not of preſumption or of his owne motion, but was conducted thither. The Porter replyed. Attend till I call S. Francis to ſee if he know thee. In the meane while the Religious vewed the wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les and ſtructure of that admirable citty, that were ſo luſtrious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendent, and with all tranſparent to behold all the iubilyes and exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations made by the Angels and bleſſed within, which to his exceeding contentement beholding, he ſaw the holy Father S. Francis comming and with him brother Bernard Quintaualle his firſt diſciple and other Religious his companions, trayned with an infinite number of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: who ſeeing him commanded the Porter to admitt him in which he did: and he was very amourously receaued by the holy Father, who ſhewed him all the meruailes wherof neither the eye nor eare, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of any mortall man is capable.</p>
                  <p>The Religious was ſo ſatisfied and content with this vew, and in his ſoule conceaued ſuch conſolation therof, that he no more reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred all his trauailes paſt, then if he had neuer endured them. S. Francis then ſaid vnto him. My ſonne admire no more: for it is neceſſary that thou retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne into the world: but greiue not, for God hath appointed thee a very ſhort time of ſeauen dayes only, that in the meane time thou mayeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the better: which ended I my ſelfe will come to thee, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the thither to enioy with me this immortall glorie. The bleſſed Father S. Francis with a very rich mantell, and his holy ſtigmates glitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as ſhinning ſtarres, with ſuch a ſplendour, that he ſeemed with his beames to illuminate the greateſt part of that great citty. The Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous did there know many SS. of S. Francis his company whome he had ſeene in the world, all whome he nomminated att his retourne. Att length hauing receaued the benediction of S. Francis, he awakened out of his sleepe and heard the bell ringing to the Prime for it was yet ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly morning, and he ſeemed to haue ſpent many yeares in his iorney; he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> recounted the viſion to his Guardian and the Religious, for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of all ſuch as liue in labours and afflictions: and to demonſtrate that whatſoeuer ſinners they be, God doth neuer abandon any one, but doth euer aſsiſt and preſerue them in all their tribulations, till he bring them to his kingdome. Now for confirmation of all the precedent, the Religious fell incontinently ſick, and with an admirable feruour of ſpiritt prepared himſelfe for his laſt houre. The ſeauen dayes expired, the glorious Father S. Francis came as he had promiſed and carryed the ſoule of this theefe into Paradice.

                  <p>THere were certaine theeues that had their reſidence on an high mountaine, whence they diſcended to robbe the paſſengers they found on the wayes, and ſome time very hungar conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to aske bread for the loue of God att the Couent of the Freer Minors, neere the borough of S.

But S.

An other day according to the good anſweare they ſhall giue you, you ſhall carry them other bread, wine, egges and cheeſe, which you ſhall preſent vnto them with the greateſt humility and kindenes that you can, then you ſhall ſay vnto them: Brethren we know wel what moueth you to liue in theſe mountaines, with ſo many inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, feares and perils both of body and ſoule, which you will vndoubtedly bring to ruine if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuer in this courſe.

Brother, theſe people performe not the leaſt part of what they ought to doe: Whereat his ſaid companion was more ſcandalized: S.

Which the biſhop and his followers beholding, they retourned without giuing him a word. So the holy Father reiected the honour, and a while after he entred ſecretlie into the Citty, where he edified more by example of pious life then by wordes of doctrine.</p>

                  <p>SIth we haue ſpoaken of the holy Fathers Marines, it ſeemeth now conuenient time, to make ſome mention of his ſo perfect prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is that there is no place more proper to ſpeake therof, then after the deſcription of his great humility, whereon as on a firme ſtone, and true foundation, prayer, to haue it penetrate euen to heauen, ought to be builded. Wherfore he merited to obtaine all the<note place="margin">The firſt condition of prayer to knowe ones own miſery. 3. Reg. 8.</note> conditions requiſite to a true and worthy prayer; the firſt wherof, is the knowledge of ones owne miſery, according to Salomon, when he ſaith: <hi>O liuing God, if any one acknowledgeing the wound of his hart</hi> to witt, his ſinnes, <hi>doth lift his handes to thee in this thy temple, heare him.</hi> Now who hath more perfectly knowne himſelfe? who hath more clearly confeſſed his fault, and who hath more humbly diſcouered it to God and men, then this glorious S. Therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> alſo were his prayers admitted before the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God, who fixeth his eyes on the<note place="margin">Pſal. 101. Iudith 9.</note> humble, and reiecteth not their pious prayers, as the Prophett ſaith. The deuout Iudith, affirmeth the ſame, ſaying: <hi>My God the prayers of the humble are alwayes pleaſing vnto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The 2. to keep the ſoule ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall thinges, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated vnto God Matt. 6.</note> The ſecond condition of prayer, is to keepe the ſoule euer ſeparated from terreſtriall thinges, and eleuated vnto God, as ſaith Iſodorus: If the ſoule will be illuminated with ſpirituall light, ſhe muſt prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently purge her ſelfe of the filth of worldly cogitations, and ſo ſhe may be neat and pure before her God. That prayer is pure, which is made without any mixture of worldly thoughtes, and that impure where the ſpiritt is employed in terreſtriall thinges. And therfore, IESVS CHRIST, leauing vs the forme of perfect prayer, ſaith: When thou ſhalt pray, enter into thy camber in ſecrett, that thou mayeſt leaue out all care excepting only of ſpeaking with God: ſhutt the dore of thy hart, that nothing enter in, to robbe his ſubſtance: call thy ſoule, and make her be in her ſelfe, without any diſtraction, and attentiue in God, and then thy prayer ſhalbe perfect before God, and thou ſhalt be heard. The holy Father S. Francis performed the ſame, for he ſo reiected all other care of the world to transforme himſelfe into God, that he had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance<note place="margin">The 3. co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> of himſelfe or of his worldly affaires. And therfore moſt commonly when he prayed, his body was eleuated into the aire, hauing nothing in it that could poiſe it downe to the earth.</p>
                  <p>God teacheth vs the third condition of prayer, by his Prophet Iſaie,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:27206:103"/>
ſaying. <hi>Giue thy bread to the hungry, and thy coat to him that is naked</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>and releiue each one in his neceſsities:</hi> then offer thy prayers to God, and he will heare thee, call him by this meane, and he will come vnto thee. On the contrary, he that ſhutteth his eares to the demaund of the poore, when in his neceſsity, he ſhall crye to God, he will not heare him. This piety and compaſsion was ſuch and ſo great in S. Francis, that he abſolutely gaue or beſtowed, his only coate, occaſion preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, yea, which is the moſt that may be, he deſired to giue entierlie himſelfe, for the only loue of God, as is formerlie alleadged. In regard of this extreme charitie towardes the poore, and for his example vnto the world, he alſo merited to be ſo interiourly affected of his God.</p>
                  <p>The fourth conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of prayer neceſſary to a Chriſtian, is to giue good<note place="margin">The 4. condition is to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto God. Prou. 28.</note> eare to God, if we deſire to be heard of his diuine Maieſty. <hi>for God will abhorre the prayers of him,</hi> ſaith the Sage, <hi>that hath not eares to heare his holy commandements:</hi> therfore the ſinner hath no cauſe to complaine that God doth not heare him, becauſe himſelfe did not firſt heare God: and if he heare him in one only thing, or two, or three, he proueth deafe in all the reſt. And therefore, on the other ſide, one <hi>Pater noster,</hi> or one <hi>Aue Maria,</hi> of a Chriſtian fearing God, is with greater reaſon heard, then a thouſand of a vicious and diſobedient perſon: the holy Father S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis obeyd God in ſuch degree of perfection that hauing called him by his grace, he did not only labour to accompliſh his diuine preceptes, but euen the Counſailes of his ghoſpell, without omitting the leaſt point: therefore alſo did God afterward graciously graunt him what he demaunded, ſo farre foorth as he permitted other creatures to obey him.</p>
                  <p>The fift condition is, that he that prayeth doe alſo ſeparate himſelfe<note place="margin">The 5. is to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from worldly conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation for euer. S. Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard. Matt. 26. Iohn. 18.</note> from the conuerſation of the world, not only when he would pray, but euen alwayes, if he will pray perfectly, and that he ſequeſter him ſelfe into ſome deſert and ſolitary place, if he will that his ſoule be alwayes diſpoſed worthely to pray vnto God: The contemplatiue Father S. Bernard, ſpeaking by experience ſaith: If the world delight thee, thou ſhalt euer be impure: Our Lord IESVS CHRIST hath alſo left vs example hereof, for he often went vp to the mountaine, and left his beſt beloued diſciples, to vnite him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone to his Father; So this glorious Sainct found himſelfe ſo much more gratified by the communication of the holy Ghoſt, as he was farther eſtranged from the rumours of the world, and farther ſequeſtred into ſolitary places, wherin, he was ſo farre from being ſubdued by cogitations of the world, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections therof, that he obtayned notable victories againſt the deuill.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:27206:104"/>
He ſhunned ſenſuall light, as diſtractiue vnto the hart, and hauing giuen ſome repoſe vnto his body in the beginning of the night, he ſpent the reſt in moſt deepe ſilence, &amp; in high contentment with his beloued God. The ſixt condition of perfect prayer, is, a feruent charity towards<note place="margin">The 6. is ardent charity.</note> God, without all feare, not like vnto that of the cold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> negligent, and new beginners; for this perfect charity expelling all baſe feare and labour, doth by loue vnite the hart of man with the goodnes of God. This loue was ſuch in the holy Father, that it continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie burned in his hart, as a liuing fire, the flame wherof dilated it ſelfe in charity, to the benefitt of his neighbour, through all the partes of the world.</p>

Luc. 18.</note> THe ſeauenth condition is perſeuerance therin, becauſe God ſaith we muſt alwayes pray, and not ceaſſe. Of this point it may be alleadged that the life of S. Francis was a continuall prayer vnto God, either for his owne ſaluation or his neighbours, deſiring to communicate his Redeemer IESVS CHRIST vnto all Creatures, that they might know and loue him, as he did, and that for his owne part, he might euer dwell with his diuine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But being, by the impediment of the weight of his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall body that was a ſtranger and remote from his true country, diſabled to enioy his beloued, he, by perſeuerant prayer endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with all poſsiblity, to keepe his ſoule alwayes vnited vnto him, which was not ouer-difficult vnto him, as hauing ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in himſelfe earthly afflictions, that he conuerſed in ſpiritt on high with the bleſſed, as a Cittizen of heauen, and familier in the houſe of God. Therfore prayer was vnto him a ſinguler re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment in his labours, an aſſured fortreſſe againſt temptations, and a remedy in neceſsities: for diſtruſting himſelfe, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per forces, induſtry, and knowledge, he had ſetled and repoſed all his hope in God, by meane of prayer, which he affirmed that euery faithfull Chriſtian ought aboue all other things to demaund of God in this life, conſidering that without it, one can make no<note place="margin">Feruour of S. Fr. in prayer</note> profitt nor progreſſe in ſpirituall life: and therfore, to be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto his Religious, he made alwayes to appeare exteriourly and interiourly, that trauailing or praying, being in action, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repoſing,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:27206:104"/>
his ſpiritt was continually attentiue vnto prayer. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeemed that he had not only dedicated his ſoule and body vnto his beloued God: but euen the very momentes of time, to the end that no viſitation of the holy Ghoſt ſhould by his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence paſſe, and be loſt, as not finding him diſpoſed to receaue it. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore when in his iorney he felt the ſame, he would ſtay and lett his companion paſſe on, to know with a very deep attention, what God inſpired vnto him. And when he was in ſolitary places, he filled the mountaines with ſighes, and bathed the earth with a flud of teares, he beat his breſt for the offences committed againſt his God. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he accuſed himſelfe as if he had bin before a Iudge, other times he demaunded mercy as a child, of his gracious Father: ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſweetlie diſcourſed as if he had bin priuately with his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous freind: he hath att ſuch time bin heard of his Religious to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate the clementie of God, by the great commiſeration which he felt in himſelfe of the death and paſsion of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, as if he had ſeene him crucified. He ſhewed exteriour ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture conformable to the interiour effect. Sometimes he held his mouth againſt the earth, now he was on his knees, then vpright on his feet, now he held his armes croſſed, then his handes ioyned towardes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. And praying after this manner, he was moſt commonlie ſeene enuirouned with a great light, and lifted into the aire in teſtimony of the interiour light and affection towardes God, and then did he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of the diuine ſecrettes, which he neuer reuealed, but when it was requiſite: for he ordinarily ſaid, that one did often looſe an ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable treaſure, for a very baſe price offending the giuer, &amp; with daunger neuer to haue it againe. For which cauſe when he retourned from his exerciſes, he in ſuch ſort compoſed and diſſembled his countenance, that he that had not much experienced it, would neuer haue ſuſpected that he had prayed in ſuch exceſſe of ſpirit. When he prayed with his Religious, he retayned his ſighes and all other geſtures: wherby he might be obſerued. He taught the manner to pray ſecretlie, then to ſay: My God I recommend vnto thee this conſolation which it hath pleaſed thee without any meritt of mine to graunt me: to the end I ſteale not this great treaſure. He aſſured them that by this meane they ſhould obtaine that God inuiting them, would ſay: Freind becauſe thou haſt<note place="margin">Luc. 14.</note> bin ſo humble aſcend now vnto an higher place.</p>

                  <p>Being one lent att an hermitage he attempted for exerciſe to make an oſier basket, but the time of prayer being come, becauſe in ſaying the third houre, the basket came to his minde, he tooke it and inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nentlie threw it into the fire with theſe wordes: I ſacrifice thee vnto<note place="margin">How he once ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity &amp; with what new fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.</note> God, in place of his ſeruice which thou haſt interrupted.</p>

But becauſe he had

and what the Religious ſhould doe in thriſe opening the Miſſall: his rule was approued by Pope Innocent the third, he knew that the will of God was he ſhould aſsiſt to the ſauing of ſoules.

Wherefore euery one being gone to reſt, he placed himſelfe att the feet of the holy Father, and that he ſhould not goe away without him, he tied their girdles together, to the end that if he aroſe he might be awakened.

                  <p>THe holy Father S. Francis had in ſuch ſort cleared his ſoule, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated and vnited it to our ſoueraine God, by the continuall exerciſe of prayer, that albeit he had no ouer-great vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of holy ſcripture, being neuertheleſſe illuminated by the beames of diuine reuelation, he did penetrate the ſublimity of the ſaid ſcripture, with an admirable intelligence of the diuine myſteries, by which, acquired ſcience remayneth excluded, the infuſed of diuine loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in his place. And therfore, what he read in holy ſcripture, he vnderſtood by diuine reuelation, as a dilligent diſciple of the holy<note place="margin">S.

                  <p>The Cardinall of Hoſtia, Protectour of the Order, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pope Gregory the ninth, ſecretlie requeſted him one time, for the conſolation of his ſoule to expound vnto him certaine profound places of holy ſcripture: I doe not, ſaid he, demaund this theologicall expoſition of you, as of a great doctour, for I know well you haue not ſtudied: But I require it, as of a man illuminated of the holy Ghoſt. The S. ſatisfied him, and gaue him ſuch contentment as he could deſire no more.</p>
                  <p>Being one day att Sienna, a Religious diuine asked him, how the Prophett Ezechiel is to be vnderſtood where he ſaith: <hi>If thou doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish</hi>

Wherein is duely to be conſidered, how much more a Religious is obliged herevnto by the light of his good life, ſeeing that it is here apparent that if he doe it not, he cannot eſcape the terrible iudgement of the liuing God: which prudent and true interpretation, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine affirmed to proceed directlie from heauen, and that himſelfe could not giue a more direct expoſition then was giuen by him, with the ſwift &amp; ſpeedy winges of the eagle ſoaring from infuſed ſcience. And affirmed with all that our interpretation was not ſuch, which proceeding
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:27206:118"/>
from our blinded vnderſtanding, goeth naturally, as a ſerpent trayling his body on the earth. The ſaid Religious did not try the holie Father in this matter onlie, but in diuers others alſo, in all which, he reſted fully ſatisfied, and exceedinglie admiring att the grace which God had giuen him, which was ſo great, that he could not only diſcouer and vnderſtand myſteries paſt, but (which God alone of himſelfe can doe) he diſcouered eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thinges to come, as if he had had them then before his very eyes, as by this example and them that follow, ſhall euidentlie appeare.</p>
                  <p>The holie Father being yet in the cittie of Sienna, he once demaunded a charitie for the loue of God of an affectionate freind of his, who direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie anſweared him he would not graunt it, but that he ſhould firſt tell him the certainty of his predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: a demaund doubtles verie ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge,<note place="margin">Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of S.

                  <p>Whiles he was in the ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p of the Chriſtians vnder Damiette, when he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to preach to the great Solda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he propheſied to the Chriſtians that if<note place="margin">Of the loſse of a battell.</note> they gaue battell they would looſe the feild. But they not beleeuing him, their fault of incredulity was payed by the loſſe of the bodie of the army that was putt to flight, where of one part was slaine. Retourning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on this ſide the ſea, and arriuing att Celano, he was inuited to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by a gentleman, where being, as according to his couſtume he prayed before his ſitting to the table, he ſaw in his God, on whome he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

He ſaw what ſhould ſucceed them for manie yeares after, as if it had bin preſent, onlie behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the vnſpotted and cleare mirour of diuine light, and his admirable ſplendour, by a diuine prerogatiue and eſpecially the ſucceſſes and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Religion, which he would ſometimes with abo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dance of teares co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate to his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions.

                  <p>The holie Father comming from beyond the ſea, with his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion Brother Leonard, a Religious of very worthie familie, and being by reaſon of his infirmities verie wearie and feeble, he had for ceraine

dayes the vſe of an aſſe. But the poore Brother Leonard that followed him a foote, being alſo very weary, began to murmure, ſaying to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe:<note place="margin">Of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious that mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured becauſe goeing a foot S.

The good Brother Leonard went on thus ſtill diſcourſing with himſelfe in his firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when as the holy Father S. Francis ſeeing in ſpiritt the ſecret mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure of his companion called him, and alighting from his aſſe, he ſaid: Brother and Freind, I confeſſe I haue litle diſcretion, to ſee you ſo wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to goe a foot, and my ſelfe to ride att mine eaſe: Gett vp therfore on this aſſe, now att leaſt whiles I remember me, conſidering that being in the world, you were farre more noble and more honnorable then my ſelfe.

                  <p>Two very ſpirituall Religious came expresly from Rieta to the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Grecio, to viſitt S Francis and to haue his benediction. But being there ariued, it was told them that there was no hope of ſpeaking with the holy Father, by reaſon that hauing taken his refection he was retourned to his cell, where he prayed and slept, and came forth but once a day to eat, it being lent and that being then ſo ſolitary, he would not haue his companio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, much leſſe any other Religious to diſturbe him, vnles he ſo commaunded. Theſe two poore Religious exceedingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, eſteeming themſelues by reaſon of their ſinnes vnworthy of ſuch grace, not hauing oportunity any longer to expect, becauſe their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour had commaunded them to retourne the ſame night to their Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, they haſtened homeward.

In the meane while S. Francis arriuing where this Religious was, he was aduertiſed of his proceeding; but he anſweared that he was exceedingly tempted and deluded by the deuill, becauſe confeſsion of the mouth was neceſſary, as contrition of the ſoule, and ſatisfaction of worckes. The ſuperiour of the place then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the ſainctity of the ſaid Religious, vnto S. Francis, alleadge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was not poſsible he ſhould be tempted of the deuill, conſidering the ſignes of ſanctity which he exteriourlie ſhewed.

Which the ſuperiour hauing done, the Religious putting his finger in his mouth, and ſhaking his head, by theſe ſignes declared, that he could not doe it, for breaking of ſilence. His ſuperiour would no farther vrge him: but the great prudence of S.

Two Religious of his companions meeting him atty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeculerly, conceauing great compaſsion of his blindenes, ſayd vnto him: O miſerable wretch and forgetfull of thy ſelfe, where is that thy ſolitarie and ſainct-like life, yea ſuch, as thou wouldeſt not conuerſe with thy Brethren, nor ſpeake in Confeſsion, for keeping of ſilence? thow now hauing loſt thy ſelfe in the world, abandoned our habitt, reiected thy vow, and broaken the rule, as if thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt no beleefe of God? but he gaue them ſo diuelliſh an anſweare, that he plainly diſcouered, he had not only chaunged habitt but alſo<note place="margin">One muſt beware of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</note> Religion, and interiour vertue. Theſe good Religious could by no meanes reduce him, though they laboured to reprint in his minde the obligation he had to God, and the perill of his damnation: and ſo in few dayes after he dyed, being in poſſeſsion of the deuill that held him choaked: becauſe he would not confeſſe.

                  <p>THe Cardinall of Hoſtia hauing on a time commaund S. Francis to repaire vnto him to Rieta, where then was Pope Honorious with his Court: and comming neere the citty he ſaw a great troup of people that came againſt him: wherfore ſtopping his iorney, he ſtaid in a Church, before S. Fabian, a lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue and halfe from the citty, where was a very poore Preiſt, that very curteously and in the beſt manner he could, entertayned him: But the Cardinals and many other of his Court, knowing whither he was retired, went thither to ſee him: by this viſitation; the vineyard of the poore Preiſt was waſtfullie gathered by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion of the trampling traine of the Cardinals and others, whereat he exceedingly complayned, repenting that he had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned S. Francis, in regard that for the litle good he had done him, he thought he ſhould incurre ſuch loſſe. The holy Father,<note place="margin">S.

Neuertheles as a pittifull louing Father, he called the Preiſt, whome, for his conſolation, he bad not to vex himſelfe nor to feare, for of the litle that remayned of his vigne he ſhould gather double the ordinary, though there appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red almoſt nothing. The Preiſt that firmely beleeued theſe wordes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued alſo to be recompenced according to his faith: for wheras he accuſtomed to haue three hogſheddes, he had then twenty, of verie good wine, as the holy Father had promiſed him: which (with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ioy and admiration) he related vnto him and to all the people thereabout, to the prayſe of God, and of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant Francis.</p>
                  <p>This holy Father being in the Prouince of Maſſa, on the Mount Caſal, within a deſert Church there employed in prayer, God reuealed vnto him that in the ſame Church were relikes of his ſainctes.

But theſe good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious forgatt it: Wherefore they being one day to ſay maſſe in the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, thinking to prepare the Alcare, they found vnder it certaine bright and glittering bones, that filled the place with a moſt delicious ſauour. Being extremely amazed, and diuiſing who ſhould putt them there, they remembred the commaundement which S.

So perceauing that no humane application auayled, and that Sainct Francis rightlie to the purpoſe was there, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe to be brought before him: at whoſe feet falling, he beſought him to make the ſigne of the croſſe vpon him: The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father anſweared: My Brother and friend, know that becauſe to this day thou haſt liued carnallie, and according to the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of thy ſenſuall appetites, without any reſpect of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:27206:121"/>
of God, he hath therefore ſent this affliction to make thee know and amend thy ſelfe. But now in his holy name I giue thee his<note place="margin">To a Preiſt curing him by the ſigne of the croſse.</note> benediction: and doe aduertiſe thee, that if thou alter not thy courſe of life, a greater miſerie will befall thee, for the ſinne of ingratitude. So hauing made on him the ſigne of the croſſe, the Preiſt incontinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie aroſe very ſound, and ſtretching himſelfe on his feet, the chine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, and the breſt plate gaue a cracke as a ſtaffe forciblie broaken. But by reaſon that this ingratfull fellow and ennemy of his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, retourned vnto his vomitt, being one day with diuers of his companions, committing their ordinarie ſinnes, about midnight the looſe of the houſe fell vpon him, and ſo being cruſhed and slaine alone, that the diuine vengeance might the more euidentlie appeare, according to the propheſie of S. Francis, he miſerablie ended his life.</p>
                  <p>Being att his Oratory in Grecio, it was told him, that the violent ſtormes did euery yeare deſtroy all the fruites of that place, that the wolues deuoured the cartell, and that the very inhabitantes could hardly be ſecure of their liues. The holy Father therefore hauing<note place="margin">To a country man.</note> compaſsion of theſe poore people, he made them a ſermon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he exhorted them all to amendement of life, as the ſureſt meane to appeaſe the wrath of God: to confeſſe and communicate, with a firme purpoſe to offend no more: affirming that by this meane God would disburden them of the ſaid puniſhment: which being effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he admoniſhed them to beware of ſinning a freſh, for then the chaſticement would be redoubled. This people moued by the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe holy demonſtrations, prepared themſelues with great contrition, confeſſed, communicated, did penance for their ſinnes and craued mercy of God: in reſpect wherof and in fauour of the prayers of the holy Father, God incontinentlie freed and deliuered them from the tempeſt and wolues, yea in ſhort time this people did not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire their dommages paſt: but became very rich. But alas! they could not long time perfeuer in this happy eſtate, which made them forget the behoufull admonitions of S. Francis: which procuring Godes wrath, he ſo chaſticed them with the rodde of peſtilence, that few among them remayned aliue: he alſo burned a great number of their houſes, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing all that S.

                  <p>As this holy Father preached in Apulia, a Religious that was fallen from his Order, repayred vnto him, fell att his feet, and with infinite teares demaunded him pardon: promiſing if he<note place="margin">To a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious fallen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his order.</note> would reſtore him the habitt, to correct his courſe of life.

For firſt the Gouernour, as if God had commanded him to repaire to the Biſhop, obediently haſtened thither, with as manie people as he could aſſemble, and found the Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop in a great hall with his Clergie: where being together, one of the Religious which S.

as to haue the chardge of gouerning ſo many thouſandes of Religious, to commaund and reprehend, to aduiſe and correct, to giue ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and to chaſtice the offenders.

And therfore, att the generall chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter held two yeares before he receaued of our Lord IESVS CHRIST his ſacred ſtigmates, he publikelie renounced the office of Miniſter Generall, not without the exceeding greife of all the Religious, who by all meanes refuſing, during his life, to admitt any other Miniſter, he was conſtrayned to conſtitute a Vicar Generall, that gouerned the Order in his name; To this effect, he made choiſe of Brother Peter Catanio, his ſecond ſonne in Religion, a man of great prudence, and very expert to gouerne: to whome the holie Father promiſed his cheiffeſt obedience, and beſides to him that ſhould be conſtituted his Guardian. Which all the Religious ſeeing, they began bitterlie to wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe eſteeming they ſhould continue as orphanes, without the ordinary gouernment of their beloued Father, who comforting them the beſt he could, his handes ioyned, and his eyes eleuated towardes heauen he ſaid: My God, I recommende vnto thee this family, which to this houre thou haſt recommended vnto me: For now, by reaſon of mine infirmities, other impedimentes, and iuſt cauſes to thee knowne, being vnable henceforward to haue care of them, I haue committed them to a Vicar Generall, and to other Prouinciall Miniſters, who ſhalbe obliged to yeld thee a very exact account of them att the terrible day of the great iudgement; if they chaunce to periſh by their negligence or euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.

The holy Father being on a time as it were oppreſſed with his infirmities, and hearing ſome ſpeake of the aforeſaid matters, and particulerly of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-much indulgence of the ſuperiours, and of the euill examples they gaue their ſubiectes, he lifted vp his head and cryed out, Ah! ah! couer me, couer me, who are they that withdraw the Religious from mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Order, and from my way, and my examples? If I once goe to the Generall chapter, I will ſhew my Brethren what is my deſire, and mine intention, that they permitt not themſelues to be deluded.</p>
                     <p>Being alſo an other time ſick, a Religious ſaid vnto him: O Father, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that att the beginning our Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſtriued to liue in al auſterity and pouerty, we were poore in our habitt, in our diet, in our dwelling, in our moueables, in our bookes, and in all our other corporal neceſsities, for which we tooke no care: by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this pouerty exteriour, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour daily proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good to better, becauſe we were al of the ſame feruour, of the ſame will, with one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpiring to the entier obſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But of later ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, it ſeemeth that the purity of this our firſt vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is much deminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed, vpon excuſe that it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no longer be obſerued as before, by reaſon of the great multitude of brethren: yea there are ſome that beleeue that the people are much more edified by this theire moderne and new

inobſeruance and mortification of their proper will and of their ſences, then they were when they all liued in ſuch deep auſterity of life: and they thinck it a matter more Religious to liue after this new manner, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the ancient and former, which they hold for crowned, as proceeding of ſimplicitie and holy pouertie, which were the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this our holy Religion. Now perceauing this, and beleuing that you likewiſe perceaue it, and are therewith exceedingly diſpleaſed, I meruaile you doe not labour with all ſpeed to hinder the further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe of this euill, nor doe correct it whiles you haue power, and meane to doe it.</p>
                     <p>S. Francis hauing with great affliction of ſpiritt heard this long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, thus anſweared: Our Lord IESVS CHRIST pardon you that which you ſuppoſe I ought to doe, which I am not obliged to haue care of, neither by chardge, nor by office: for whiles I was Generall, though from the beginning of my conuerſion I haue almoſt continued in ſicknes, I haue not yet failed either in cogitations or effectes, to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my duety, both by example and gouernment. But hauing well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that God did daily encreaſe the nomber of Religious, and that they already began to leaue the ſecure, ſtrict, and difficult way, wherin they firſt walked, and in ſuch ſortas you ſay ſtrayed from it, without correcting themſelues notwithſtanding all my demonſtrations, predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and good edification that I gaue them, I then reſolued to leaue the office of Generall, as I did, and though when I renounced it, I failed not att the chapter to excuſe my ſelfe by mine infirmities, as was partly true: alleadgeing that by meanes therof I could no longer diſchardge ſo burdenſome an office: Neuertheles my ſonne, I aſſure you if the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would now liue conformably to my rule, and to my pious intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I would againe accept the office of Generall, and would excute it ſo long as it ſhould pleaſe God to giue me life: conſidering that ſo, the care of that chardge would not be painfull vnto me, for certaine it is, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithfull ſubiect knoweth the good will of his ſuperiour, he ſtriueth to obey him in euery thing, ſo that it is no great difficulty to gouerne him, yea I ſhould reioyce and be exceedingly comforted, in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall progreſſe, and in the honour that therby redoundeth to his diuine Maieſty: and though I ſhould be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually ſicke on my bed, yet ſhould it not be tedious nor troubleſome vnto me to giue them content in all thinges: but becauſe I ſee I can no longer diſchardge mine office, which is ſpirituall, and oppoſite to vices, in correcting them either by loue, or by aduertiſſement, I will not retourne (to the chardge) to be their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, chaſticing them with the rodde of diſciplin, as the princes of the world doe iuſtly correct their rebelles: neuertheles I hope in God that the inuiſible ennemies the deuils, that are his executioners to chaſtice
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:27206:127"/>
the diſobedientes in this world and in the other, will alſo chaſtice the tranſgreſſours of the vow of their profeſsion; therby to their ſhame and forciblie, to make them retourne to their firſt vocation: to this effect I will not omitt to aſsiſt them whiles I liue, att leaſt by prayers and example, ſith otherwiſe I cannot, and to inſtruct them the ſecure way, which I haue learned of my God, as I haue formerly done, that they may haue no excuſe before his diuine maieſty. No further doe I hold my ſelfe obliged. Such was his anſweare, which ſatisfying the Religious, procured an ineſtimable greife to all the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: wherby it alſo manifeſtlie appeared, what reaſon the S. had to leaue them, and what occaſion they had to know themſelues, and by a pious acknowledgement of their fault and true repentance, to haue recourſe vnto him.</p>

heard thy feruent prayers: and becauſe I know with what ſolicitude thou and thy Religious procure the ſaluation of ſoules, aske me what grace thou wilt for their ſoules benefitt, and I will graunt it thee. The S. being by ſuch an anſweare emboldened, moſt humbly anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: My Lord IESVS CHRIST, I miſerable and vnworthy ſinner, with the greateſt reuerence I can, require of thy diuine maieſty, that it will pleaſe thee ſo much to fauour all Chriſtian people, as to graunt them a generall pardon and plenary indulgence of all their ſinnes; I meane to all them that ſhall enter into this church, confeſſed and contrite. I alſo beſeech thee, O glorious holy Virgin mother, and our Aduocatrix, that it would pleaſe thee to make interceſsion to thy moſt gracious ſonne for me and for all Chriſtian ſinners. Our Lady was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantlie moued with theſe wordes, and began in this ſort to pray our Redeemer in his behalfe: O my moſt high Lord and ſonne of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, I beſeech thee graunt vnto this thy faithfull ſeruaunt this grace which he hath demaunded with ſo great a zeale of the ſaluation of ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, which thy ſelfe aboue all other thinges diſireſt.

Our Lord ſodenlie anſweared: Francis that which thou demaundeſt is great: but this thy deſire conformable to mine, deſerueth much more, and therfore I graunt thy requeſt. But goe to my Vicar, to whome I haue giuen al power of vnbinding and binding here on earth, and in my name demaund it of him, which ſaid, he diſappeared.

But the Cardinals preſent, aduiſed the Pope to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well what he graunted: becauſe by that act he would deſtroy the indulgences of the holy land, and of Sainct Peter and S.

They replyed that att leaſt it were requiſit he ſhould limitt the ſaid indulgence to a certaine time, and moderate it to a certaine prefixed day of the yeare.

The Religious then ſaid: O ſimple people to endure heat, incommodities, and trauailes, without anie benefitt: for there is no ſuch indulgence as is ſpoaken of, or att leaſt there is no authenticall bulle of the Pope extant therof, I blame you not to goe of deuotion to that church of our lady: but for the indulgence I tell you your iorney is in vaine. And if you beleeue me, you ſhall ſaue much of the way: for there are here in this church far more indulgences then in that whither you goe, which if you be well aduiſed you may gaine, and ſo retourne againe. In confirmation of his ſpeech, he ſhewed them many priuiledges and bulles of Popes, of lardge indulgences graunted to that church. The Pilgrimes vpon theſe conſiderations beleeuing the Sacriſtine, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting the weariſome trauaile they had vndertaken to come ſo farre, followed his counſaile, and hauing offered their deuotions in that place, and gayned the indulgences there to be had, determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourne. Amongſt them was a verie deuout woman, that ſaid vnto them I meruayle, my freindes, you are not aſhamed vpon the opinion and diſcourſe of one only man, to looſe the meritt of your pilgrimage? Retourne you in Goddes name, if you thincke good, for my part I am determined to goe alone to viſitt our lady of Angels, though there were no indulgence in that church, and ſo to accompliſh my iorney ſo much aduanced: ſo went ſhe alone towardes Aſsiſium. But by the will of God, that ſhe might not trauaile alone, ſhe erred from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way, being therefor much troubled and ſollicitous how to finde the ordinary way, there appeared vnto her a right venerable old man all gray, cloathed in a long habitt Religious-like, who ſaid vnto her: Feare not my daughter, for I aſſure thee thou art in a ſecure way for thy ſoule, and know that thy companions ſhall inſtantlie ioyne vnto thee. She looking behinde her, ſaw them all, wherat ſhe was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ioyfull: being then together, this venerable old man told them, that they had done well to proſecute their attempted ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, becauſe the ſaid indulgence was true, and that himſelfe was preſent when the Pope Honorious confirmed it: and that he knew it alſo to be confirmed of God: though there were many that knew not all that, and that denyed it, and therfore bid them goe on confidentlie.

this accident, and hauing gayned the indulgence, they ioyfullie tooke their iorney of retourne. The aforeſaid woman by reaſon of a ſicknes that happened her vnto, remayned alone behinde: but dying afterward, ſhe ouertooke them in ſpiritt, and appeared vnto them on the ſea, and ſaid vnto them: Feare yee not, for I am ſuch a one your companion, that am dead att Aſsiſium. The Virgin Marie hath ſent me to aſſure you of the vertue of the plenary indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; wherebie I paſſed incontinentlie to heauen, without endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the leaſt puniſhment, which ſaid, ſhe diſappeared. Wherfore many of thoſe Pilgrimes that ſaw this woman on the ſea, retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often times with greater faith to gaine the indulgence, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the apparitions: ſo that though no bulles were ſeene, Sainct Francis not reſpecting them, many of diuers nations, repayred thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when neither warre nor plague did hinder them: for God who graunted it and promiſed to fauour it alſo with his grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the reuelation therof vnto many, did alſo inſpire ſoules to ſeeke the pourchace of their ſaluation in that holie church.</p>
                  <p>An old man, comming to gaine this indulgence recounted what he had heard ſpoaken by a Pilgrime that firſt doubted therof: to witt, that being in a ſolitarie place, where he recommended himſelfe to God, he ſeemed miraculouslie to ſee the Pope, the Cardinals, and S. Francis, conferring together; and that according to the geſtures and motions they vſed, it ſeemed that the Pope would giue the bulle of this indulgence to S. Francis, who refuſed it, and one of the Cardinals ſtanding vp, tooke a booke in his hand, wherin he read theſe wordes: <hi>A plenarie indulgence of all ſinnes att S.

Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were alſo graunted verie great graces to the ſaid holy Father, and prerogatiues generallie and particulerlie, for himſelfe and for others: and therfore, that the Religious might neuer forgett with what deuotion and reuerence they ought to reſpect that church,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:27206:133"/>
and that particuler memory might be had therof aboue all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable thinges of the Order: being one day ſicke in preſence of his Vicar Generall, and many other Religious, in manner of a teſtament he left theſe wordes: I will that this houſe and church of our Lady of Angels of Portiuncula, be duely reuerenced and honoured of my Religious, and that therein be the reſidence of the Generall of the Order; that he may prouide vnto this houſe a pious family, with greater deuotion and dilligence, to the end it may ſerue for example and mirour in piety and good conuerſation; and eſpecially that there be choſen very ſpirituall Preiſtes and Clarckes, to miniſter with deuotion, that the Religious and ſeculers comming hither to gaine this holy indulgence be well edified therby: and likewiſe I will that the lay Brethten be choſen humble and of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous life, and that they ſerue the Preiſtes, with much reſpect and reuerence. I will beſides that in this place be obſerued a perpetuall ſilence, and that if there be neceſsity of ſpeaking, they ſpeake only with their ſuperiours and among them, be very wary not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count worldlie matters, or other idle wordes, yea that themſelues giue no eare in ſuch thinges to ſeculer perſonnes, to the end that no worldly matter enter into this holie houſe, and that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious may the better conſerue their holy pouertie therin. And with all that this habitation be not prophaned by earthly diſcourſes: but that therein the time be alwayes employed in himnes, prayers, and pſalmes, the moſt ſecure armour for guard of the hart. And if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious herein already placed, become and libertine a obſerue not this Order and courſe of life, I will that the Guardian expell him, and put an other, ſuch as he ſhall thinck ſitt, in his place.

liued alwayes in this houſe, in higheſt purity, in perpetuall ſilence, and in extreme pouerty.

                     <p>Beſides all this, it was thought neceſſary, <hi>Ad perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi> for a perpetuall memorie therof, and for the aſſeurance and ſtabilitie of the order, to confirme the ſaid rule by Apoſtolicall authoritie. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Cardinall Vgolino, Protectour of the Order, prayed the holie Father S. Francis to abridge it, for it had bin much augmented by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of manie new accidentes that happened from hand to hand. He prayed him, I ſay, to moderate it in certaine thinges, that it might be more eaſy, to execute and to learne by hart, and that he would procure it to be for euer confirmed by an Apoſtolicall bulle. S. Francis vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, would know if ſuch were the will of God, as in all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of importance that he enterpriſed, he accuſtomed to doe: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking leaue of the Cardinall, telling him that he would ſhortlie giue him anſweare, he had recourſe to prayer, where he made ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to God, that he would reueale vnto him what he ſhould doe, who was rauiſhed in ſpiritt, and had this viſion: It ſeemed vnto him that he heaped together a quantitie of crummes of bread, which he was to ſhare amongſt many Religious, who together with himſelfe were as it were hunger-ſtaruen, and becauſe the crummes were too ſmall, he was carefull how to deuide them that they might not fall through his fingers: but he heard a voice that ſaid; Francis make one entier hoſte of thoſe crummes, and then giue it to them that will eat it. Which hauing done, it ſeemed vnto him that all they who receaued it not with deuotion, or miſpriſed it, were entierlie couered with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, which viſion, he not ſo plainelie vnderſtanding as he deſired, praying againe the day following, and perſeuering in demaunding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unſaile of God, he heard the ſame voice that ſaid: Francis the crummes of bread of the laſt night, are the Euangelicall counlailes, the hoſte the Rule, and the leaproſie malice, The holy Father then knew, that he ſhould vnite his rule, and compoſe it of the Euangelicall counſailes, compendious and myſticall.</p>
                     <p>Hauing therfore giuen anſweare to the ſaid Cardinall, that he would confine his rule, conformably to the will of the diuine Maieſty, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with him Brother Leo, and Brother Boniſius of Bolognia, he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp to the mount Carnerio, neere Rieta, otherwiſe called Fonte-Colo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo, where faſting with bread and water forty dayes and forty nightes, and perſiſting in continuall prayer, he wrote and compoſed his rule, as God reuealed vnto him, then came downe with it from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, as an other Moyſes, with the tables of the law, and committed it to the keeping of Brother Helias, who was his Vicar Generall, who
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:27206:135"/>
perceauing it to conſiſt of a greater contempt of the world, and of a more ſtrict pouerty of life, then was gratefull vnto him, ſo delt that the rule was loſt and periſhed, that it might not be approued and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Pope, with intention to make an other according to his fanſie. But the holy Father that would rather follow the diuine then humane will, making no eſteeme of the wiſe of the world, and kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing in ſpiritt the fayned cogitations of that Religious, reſolued to retourne to the ſaid mountaine, by faſting and prayer more copiously to obtaine the will and rule of God, for his ſeruantes the Frere Minors.</p>
                     <p>Now Brother Helias to interrupt this his ſecond attempt, called an aſſemblie of many learned ſuperiours of the Order, where <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e began to diſcouer his peruerſe intention, alleadging vnto them that Brother Francis intended to conſtitute a rule ſo ſtrict and auſtere, that was impoſsible to be obſerued, and that he would procure it to be confirmed by the Pope for euer. Which they hauing heard, they with one accord anſweared: that they yelded all authoritie vnto him: and that ſith he was his Vicar Generall, he ſhould go to him, and tell him that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended not to keepe the rule he made, but that it ſhould be for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone if he would. But Brother Helias fearing to be reprehended of S. Francis, incouraged them, and perſwaded them to goe with him: and ſo they wentin companie to the ſaid mountaine, and being called by Brother Helias, he knew his voice, and came out of his celle, and ſeeing ſo many Religious, he asked Brother Helias what they would, who anſweared: they are ſuperiours of the Order, who vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that you inſtitute a new rule, they and I fearing we ſhall not be able obſerue it, doe proteſt vnto you, that we will not oblige our ſelues therevnto. S. Francis made no other anſweare to this proteſtation, but falling on his knees, and caſting his eyes to heauen, ſaid; My God, did I not tell thee, that theſe people would not beleeue me? and att the inſtant a voice was heard that ſayd. Francis, as in this rule there is nothing of thine, but all commeth, and is of me, ſo alſo I will that it be obſerued. <hi>Ad literam, ad literam, ad literam,</hi> without gloſſe, without gloſſe, without gloſſe, I know the infirmitie of man, I know alſo my will to aſsiſt him. Therfore, they that will not obſerue it, lett them depart the Order, and permitt others to keep it: S. Francis then tourning to the ſuperiours, ſaid: haue ye heard, haue ye heard, haue ye heard? would ye know more? hereatt they were ſo confounded, that trembling as beſides themſelues, they departed acknowledgeing their errour and not replying one word, the holy father then retourned to accompliſh the rule, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierlie conformable to that which God had precedentlie reuealed
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:27206:136"/>
vnto him. This was in the yeare 1223. fifteene yeares after the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confirmed by Pope Innocentius.</p>
                     <p>The S. did afterward carry this rule to Roome, and deliuered it to Cardinal Vgolino his Protectour, who preſented it to Pope Honorius, together with the holy Father, who reading it vnto him, and the Pope conſidering the ſeuerity and rigour therof, ſayd: that it ſeemed to him very difficult to be obſerued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The S. anſweared: I beſeech your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe to beleeue, that there is not in it, ſo much as one word of myne inuention, but that our Lord IESVS CHRIST, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it, who well knoweth what is neceſſary and behoufull to the ſaluation of ſoules, to the profitt of Religious, and to the conſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Order. Therefore I neither can, nor ought, to alter any point therof. The Pope then, inſpired of God, and for the zeale he had to Euangelicall perfection, which by this rule, S. Francis planted in the church, ſaid to himſelfe: Bleſſed is he that, being inſpired by diuine grace, ſhall with fidelitie and deuotion obſerue this rule: ſith what is contayned in it is Catholicke, holy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: and ſo in perpetuall memory, by the inſuyng Apoſtolicall Breuy, he confirmed the ſame.</p>

                  <p>AS the three yong men (according to Daniel) were ioyfull in the flaming fire of the burning fournace, where Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſor had cauſed them to be throwne, as faithfull ſeruan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of God, becauſe they would not giue to his monſtruous ſtatua, the honour dew to God alone, and as they ſung prayſes to the Almightie, together with a fourth like vnto the ſonne of God: ſo there were three Orders and holy Rules founded by three holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonnages, S. Baſill, S. Auguſtin, and S. Benedict, in the burning fournace of temptations and worldly afflictions, wherwith the prince of the world, combatteth againſt the ſeruantes of God and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times ſurmounteth them, which holy perſonnes as men freed from the fire and from feare, haue with alacritie prayſed God, in the middes of it; Afterward there was ſeene the fourth, like vnto the ſonne of God, to witt. The Seraphicall and crucified ſeruant of IESVS CHRISTS. Francis, that gaue a fourth eſtate vnto the church, wherin men, being deliuered from the priſon of the world and taking more content in the honours and graces of God, might more free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie ſerue IESVS CHRIST. And ſuch was his intention in all the wordes of his Euangelicall rule, to witt, that they who had made profeſsion to imitate IESVS CHRIST, ſhould endeauour to become the moſt like vnto him in laboures of their life and exerciſes of ſpiritt, that poſsibly could be procured. He with the help of the holy Ghoſt, founded on that onlie and fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me foundation of IESVS CHRIST, the edifice of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in meruaylous hight and perfection. Therefore in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <note place="margin">The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the rule.</note> he ſaith: The life and rule of the Frere Minors is ſuch: to keep and obſerue the holie goſpell, liuing vnder holie obedience, without poſſeſsing any thing in proprietie, and in pure chaſtitie. The life, ſpiritt and wordes of the ſaid holy Father conſidered, his intention was, that the Frere Minors ſhould obſerue not onlie the preceptes of the goſpell, but the counſailes alſo. Neuertheles knowing and conſidering humane infirmitie, he would not oblige them to all. In the ſecond chapter, he<note place="margin">Iohn. 14.</note> teacheth to forſake and contemne the world, with whatſoeuer is in it, giuing them meanes to make ſuch renunciation as the goſpell teacheth, which is, to ſell what they haue and to giue it to the poore, that being deliuered of ſo great an impediment they might freelie ſerue IESVS CHRIST, and with him ſay. The Prince of this world is come, &amp; in me he hath found nothing. In the third he teacheth exerciſes to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe God by the diuine offices, and by faſtinges and ſeuere abſtinences, mortifications of the fleſh, good examples and edification of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and particulerlie of ſeculer perſonnes. He alſo teacheth them the vertue of penance, humilitie and charity, whereby they may with edification conuerſe with all people. In the fourth, he expresly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that he will not, his brethren ſhall haue mony vnder any pretence whatſoeuer: but that the Prouincialls ſhall ſupplie their neceſsities, knowing that auarice is daungerous to ſoules, and principallie to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious: and how true is the ſentence of IESVS CHRIST where he<note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> ſaith, that no man can ſerue God and Mammon. The holy Father ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would that richeſſe ſhould not onlie be remote, but entierlie and abſolutelie ſeparated from the Order. In the fift, he banniſheth from his ſocietie, idlenes, as contrarie to the true ſeruantes of God, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall ennemy of mennes ſaluation. In the ſixt, he rayſeth the ſoule fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cogitations of the world, and in as much as may be hoped or expected of him, leauing neither place nor affection proper in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby they might adhere to any cogitation of terreſtriall loue, to the end that they might<note place="margin">Philip. 3.</note> ioyfullie ſay: <hi>Our conuerſation is in heauen,</hi> as poſſeſsing nothing on earth. In the ſeauenth, he comforteth ſinners and ſuch as are ſick, teaching the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conditions of their Phiſicion, that can and will cure them, who is our lord IESVS CHRIST, who will mercy, and not ſacrifice, and who came not to call the iuſt, but ſinners, that they might be conuerted and<note place="margin">Matt. 9.</note> liue. In the eighty chapter, he teacheth the Superiours and all his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in what manner they ought to gouerne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Religious and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that they ſhould procure to haue alwayes a Generall ſufficient and worthy of ſuch a chardge. In the ninth, he teacheth his preachers, to fly pride, and arrogance in their life and doctrine, and to be humble and zealous of the ſaluation of ſoules, feeding them alwayes with holie and profitable doctrine, without which they can neuer produce fruit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounding
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:27206:140"/>
to the benefitt of the ſaid ſoules. In the tenth, he admoniſheth ſuperiours and ſubiectes to be verie carefull in the diligent accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhment of their obedience, and the obligation which is reciprocallie betwen them, but particulerlie that which they owe and is due to God, by reaſon of their profeſsion. In the eleuenth chapter, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth vnto his Religious, how they ought to ſhunne occaſions of ſinne and ſcandales, eſpecially women. In the twelueth and laſt, he teacheth them how they ſhould expoſe their life for the loue of IESVS CHRIST and for his law, among Infidelles: Then he concludeth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beginning, ſhewing that all conſiſteth in the faith and obedience of the Romane church, and in the obſeruance of the holie goſpell of our lord IESVS CHRIST, who is our <hi>Alpha &amp; Omega,</hi> that is, our beginning and our end. The holie Father S.

                  <p>But to the end that no impediment ſhould hinder the obſeruance of<note place="margin">In the 10. chapter.</note> this rule, the holy Father S. Francis hath putt into it this clauſe, that when they ſuppoſe they cannot obſerue it in ſome certaine place, they ſhall haue recourſe to the Miniſters: meaning that where the Religious know that the by reaſon of diſturbers, corrupted condicions of the places, or oblgations expoſed againſt the rule, it cannot be obſerued ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the true, not cloaked or erroniously interpreted intelligence therof, they may in ſuch caſe and ought to haue recourſe to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, who are obliged to putt them in ſuch place, as they may without any impediment and contradiction obſerue it. Brother Leo, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bonizzo, that were preſent with S.

S.

Francis that was very ſick, had a merueillous viſion, which is very conuenient for this place, for ſuch as are zealous of the Order, add no leſſe, for ſuch as diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with themſelues in the profeſsion and obligation which they owe to his diuine maieſty. Being then in prayer neere vnto the S. he was rauiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hed in ſpiritt, and was conducted to the border or ſide of a violent and impetuous floud, and deuiſing how he might paſſe it, he ſaw certaine Religious that entred into it, but by the force of the water were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſwallowed to the bottome, without any more ſight of them; and others that waded to the middeſt and almoſt ouer it, but by reaſon of diuers weightie thinges which they carryed on their ſhoulders, being ouercome by the violence of the water, were alſo drowned, without poſsibility of any mannes aſsiſtance. After theſe came other Religious vnburdned and without any weight: theſe were very poore, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the floud did eaſilie and without any perill paſſe the ſame. Now S. Francis knowing by diuine inſpiration that Brother Leo had had a viſion, and perceauing him much diſquieted, ſaid vnto him: Brother Leo tell me what God in this prayer hath manifeſted vnto thee. Brother Leo incontinentlie recounted vnto him the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the viſion he had, praying him to expound it, becauſe he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it not. The holie Father failed not to comfort him, ſaying:
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:27206:142"/>
know that all thou haſt ſeene is true, the floud is this world, which with extreme impetuoſity runneth to perdition; The Religious which are drowned in this floud, are ſuch as accompliſh not their Euangelicall profeſsion, and the ſtrict and voluntary pouertie promiſed, but doe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den<note place="margin">What perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity of life and doctrine ought to be in the Frere Minors.</note> themſelues with affaires of the world, which ſinck them to the bottome: the ſecond are ſuch as hauing begun the way of God, arriue to the middes, but being vanquiſhed by ſenſuality, and concupiſcence of terreſtriall thinges, forgetting their vowes, are by the violent ſtreame ouerwhelmed and drowned: the third are ſuch as hauing followed the ſpirit of God, and not of the world, haue not regarded to load themſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues with the burden of the earth, but haue bin content, with one only ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit to couer them, and a morcell of bread to ſuſtaine their life, and to followe IESVS CHRIST naked on the croſſe, and therfore without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perill doe paſſe to eternall thinges, whither they are called of God.</p>

Wherfore, O Father, doe you ſo leaue vs without a guide? Alas moſt deere Father, who ſhall comfort our feeblenes? who ſhall cure the infirmities of our ſoule? who ſhall giue moyſture to the dryed roote of our hart, that it perſiſt in charity? ſith theſe vertues were conſerued in vs, by your holy aduertiſementes, and by the example of your holy life, and by theſe vertues we moſt ſtrictly obſerued Euangelicall pouerty.

I giue my benediction to all them that are and ſhalbe in my Order, euen to the worldes end. And becauſe, by reaſon of my extreme weakenes I cannot ſpeake much, I declare my laſt will, and intention to all the Religious preſent, abſent and that hereafter ſhalbe in my Religion by theſe three laſt wordes only.

S. Francis was abſolutely contrary to thoſe that deſired and procured to haue priuiledges and exemption from the Pope, touching their life, becauſe it had bin reuealed vnto him of God, that how much the Religious were priuiledged, ſo much the leſſe fruit did they produce: he would that the intelligence of the rule ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his wordes, being ſo cleare as they were, to any vnderſtanding, prouided that it were free from paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: though they ſeemed very obſcure to ſuch as would not conforme their life thervnto, but endeauoured to wreſt &amp; draw the ſence to their libertine life: ſeeking againſt all equity to haue this their licentious life, called the life of Euangelicall perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: And to proue this to be true, we ſee that thoſe firſt children of the holy Father, ſo ſimple, vertuous, and pious, found no ſuch difficulties therin, and the reaſon was, becauſe ſeeking to imitate him, they ſimply vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and moſt dilligentlie obſerued this rule, which many that were learned neither could nor can vnderſtand with all their declarations and exclamations, of whome may be ſaid, and not without reaſon that they would not, or will not vnderſtand it, as it hath bin vnderſtood of thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>THe S. was alwayes a vigilant Paſtour, to gouerne the flock which God had committed vnto him, encourageing them to prayer, to faſtinges, and to the obſeruance of holy pouertie, and teaching them to imitate the higheſt maſter IESVS CHRIST, who began firſt to doe then to teach, himſelfe doeing the like, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring many thinges only to giue example to his children. Being one day att the Oratory of S. Eleutherius, neere vnto Rieta, he patched his habitt within and without with courſe and groſſe cloth, aſwell againſt the violent cold that then was, as for the indiſpoſition of his<note place="margin">He wold not that his habitt should be peeced against his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack to aſsuadge the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie therof.</note> ſtomach, which the ſaid patches did couer: he commaunded his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to doe the ſame. But feeling that this peecing did comfort his body, he preſentlie remembred the neceſsity of his Religious, of whome hauing compaſsion, he ſaid to his companion: conſidering that I ought to be a mirour and example to my children, it is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſarie that with them I endure cold, heat, &amp; al other neceſsities that they endure: therfore though I feele this peice much to aſſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge the greife of my ſtomackes infirmities, neuertheles conſidering that many of my Brethren may haue this infirmitie, who cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue this conſolation, I am enforced to ſuffer with them, to the end that when they ſhall ſee me alſo to endure, they may the more conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly ſupport their infirmities. This ſaid, he incontinentlie rent of the peice, by this meane giuing to each one an example of perfection. God ſhewed vnto him how gratefull vnto his diuine maieſty is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Prelates to their ſubiectes, ſuch as this was, in this admirable<note place="margin">How much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to giue good example to their ſubiects.</note> enſuyng accident.</p>
                  <p>Hauing made a iorney to the Cardinall Protectour of his Order, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon certaine affaires concerning the ſeruice of God, and after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch of them, hauing taken leaue of the ſaid Cardinall, before he departed the place, he went alſo to viſitt the Cardinall of S. Croſſe, a Prelate of exceeding great prudence and ſanctity, and one that loued him well, of whom alſo he was moſt graciouſly entertayned, as of him that eſpecially deſired his conuerſation. But vnderſtanding that he intended preſentlie to depart, and being exceedinglie troubled that he could no longer haue his company, taking occaſion of the time that was extreme rigorous to trauaile, aſwell by reaſon of the coldnes of the ſeaſon (for it was winter) as becauſe there was then riſen a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

tempeſt of windes one the feildes, he ſaid: My beloued Brother, this time is not fitt to trauaile in, therfore, I will that this day you reſt your ſelfe with me, and afterwardes we will diſpoſe ourſelues accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the time: in meane while, my ſoule ſhalbe ſome what comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; edified; And that you may take no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt me, I promiſe to entertaine you in quality of a poore begger, and to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue you to eat as to other beggers: for he knew that to be the thing which the S. eſpecially deſired. He beſides offered him a houſe, ſeparated from his palace and ſolitary, where with his companion he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine without trouble, and there performe all his ſpirituall exerciſes. Beſides all this, which much enclined the S. Br. Angelus was then with the ſaid Cardinall (he was one of the firſt diſciples of S. Francis) who much deſiring to procure contentment to this Lord, began alſo to perſwade the holy Father, telling him that neere therevnto was a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary towre, where he might as conuenientlie make his prayer, as in his Oratory. In the end S. Francis being ouercome by thoſe prayers, and by the time together, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with the ſaid Religious to ſee the toure, which contenting him, he told the Cardinall, that to ſatisfie him, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent for all that day to remayne with him: then he enioyned Brother Angelus, that he ſhould not permitt any perſonne to enter into the ſaid toure, whiles he ſhould be there, that with his companion he might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to his ordinary exerciſes without any interruption.</p>

Francis called his companion, who was in a chamber neere vnto, to whome he recounted how he had bin hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the deuill, ſaying. Brother, the deuils haue beaten me euen till this preſent, I will tell thee why, you muſt vnderſtand that the deuils are executioners, &amp; miniſters of the iuſtice of God, and as an earthly prince, when one hath committed an offence, or enormous fact, doth ſend the Prouoſt of the Marſhals to apprehend him, and then cauſeth him to be puniſhed: ſo God the Prince of princes by his Preuoſtes and executioners, doth chaſtice and correct, euen thoſe whome he loueth, when they neglect to doe their duety towardes his diuine Maieſty and their neighbour: and becauſe the imperfect Religious doth often ſinne by ignorance, when he knoweth not his ſinne, he permitteth him to be chaſticed by the ſaid Miniſters, to make him conſider by what way he walketh, and dilligentlie to obſerue in his exteriour and interiour, wherin he may haue offended: for God doth chaſtice in this preſent life, ſuch as he loueth, and hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſaue, leauing litle or nothing to correct in the other life, which is to be eternallie glorious vnto them. Therfore, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing now conſidered with my ſelfe, I did not imagine I had
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:27206:144"/>
offended him in any thing, his mercy conſidered, for which I hane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not ſatisfied him, according to humane fragilitie, by confeſsion and penance: and the rather becauſe by the grace which he hath giuen, I knew in prayer althinges, wherby I could pleaſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him: now nothing hauing till this preſent, bin reuealed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to<note place="margin">And wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ie: Neuertheles my Religious that now trauell ouer the world, enduring hunger, thirſt, and continuall labours, and others that are within their poore celles and Oratories, knowing that I am with the Cardinall, will take full occaſion to murmure, and ſay: we ſpend our dayes with ſo many miſeries, and our Father reſteth att his eaſe and in delightes and honours: And becauſe I know my ſelfe to be bound to giue them alwayes good example, hauing bin by God committed vnto them for Paſtour to that effect, and that my diſciples are much more edified by me when I am with them in poore Oratories, keeping them company in holy pouerty, then when I am with rich and honourable perſonnes, in place of corporall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, and that they more patientlie ſupport their neceſsities, when they ſee or heare that I ſuffer with them: therfore I ſay, I acknowledge to haue exceedingly failed therin. As ſoone as the day appeared, the holy Father went to the Cardinall, to whome he related what he had endured that night, then added: Men that know me not, repute me a S. but behold how the deuills, who know me well, doe handle and chaſtice me for my ſinnes. So taking leaue of him, he retourned to his Religious.</p>
                  <p>In this manner did S. Francis endeauoure to giue good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of himſelfe to euery one, not only in ſmall neceſsities and weake infirmities, but in the greateſt extremities and afflictions of his life, to take away all occaſion of murmure, and that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious might not iuſtlie ſay of him, that in his neceſsitie he could prouide well for himſelfe, but not for them, conſidering that he endured ſuch exceſsiue dolours in his perſonne, without procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any remedy, that the Religious who ſerued him, and they who knew it, could not containe their teares of compaſsion, and fought out ſome one, who by prayers or authority might commaund him to applie ſome neceſsary medicines.

                  <p>THe holy Father S. Francis being once ſo weakened with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that his Religious ſuppoſing he would dye, did viſitt him extraordinarily, beginning to feele the detriment proceeding of the loſſe of his preſence: In regard wherof they were very carefull to demaund him many matters concerning the ſerenity of their conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences, and the obſeruance of the Order. Now one of them who was very zealous of the rule and his profeſsion, made him this demaund: Beloued Father, you ſhall goe towardes God, and your family, who to this day haue alwayes followed you, ſhall remayne in this vally of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, forſaken of you their deere Father and aſſured Paſtour. But ſince it will come to paſſe, and that there is no remedy, I moſt earneſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, before your departure to aſsigne vs one of our Order, if there be any worthy and capable to accept the charge and office of miniſter generall, after you. The holy Father with groning ſighes and teares thus anſweared: my ſonne I know not if there may be found a Father of ſo great a family, a head of ſo great an army of God, a Paſtour of ſo great a flock, that would be ſufficient: but I will leaue you a paterne &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell, wherein may be ſeene what he ought to be. The Generall ought to be a man of great prudence, of laudable reputation, and of holy conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, a man without ſelfe-loue, and particular affection: becauſe if he ſhould more fauour one part then an other, a tumult and diſcention with ſcandale would proceed therof: a man exceedinglie addicted to prayer, and a continuall practiſer therof, and neuertheleſſe, he ſhould elect and chooſe certaine houres of the day and of the night, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifitt and contentment of his ſoule, that in other houres he may attend to the gouernment of the flock which God ſhall haue committed vnto him: the firſt houres of the morning, lett him repaire to the place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he is to pray and celebrate maſſe, recommending himſelfe and his flock vnto the diuine protection. He muſt alſo be a man that after muſt goe forth into a publicke place, where all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious may commodiously ſpeake vnto him, and muſt anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re them with humility, prouiding for each one according to his neceſsity, as to him ſhall ſeeme beſt: lett him be a man of courage,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:27206:145"/>
and conſtancie, that will no be moued with others wordes, but will gouerne with iuſtice, and therfore lett him not giue light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe to wordes that ſhalbe reported vnto him, but lett him firſt ſearch to know the truth, then lett him proceed according to iuſtice, and lett him not diſdayne to heare indifferentlie, the litle with the great, nor haue leſſe care of the one, then the other, a man all whoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions may be ſo many exemplar good workes, God hauing giuen him grace to appeare ſuch by his vertues: a man that hath imprinted in him the image of piety, of ſimplicity, and of patience, labouring to create vertue in himſelfe and others, exciting euery one by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to imitate him: a man aboue all other things deteſtinge mony, as that which is more able then any thing elſe, to corrupt our eſtate and profeſsion: a man euer mindfull that he is the head and light, ſett in an eminent place, that other Religious may ſee and follow him, to imitate him in his holy exerciſes: a man that is content, though he be Generall, with one only habitt, and one breuiary, where with to ſay his diuine office: one inck-horne and one ſeale, to prouide for the occurants of the Religious of the Order, a man not ouer much addicted to the curioſity of learning, nor ſeeking to furniſh his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie, to the end he doe not robbe the diuine office and prayer, of much time conſuming it in the ſtudy of learning: a man principallie of condition and conuerſation, ſpiritually to comfort the deſolate, as one that muſt be the remedy and refuge of the afflicted, for feare that this vertue and remedy not being found in him, it happen that his ſheep, by their labour and vexation, be att length ſurmounted by the deteſtable and perillous diſeaſe of deſpaire: lett him be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, a man fitt to humble himſelfe, according to the example of IESVS CHRIST, and ſometime to mortifie his ſence, and particuler opinion, though reaſonable, to gaine vnto God the ſoules of his ſubiectes, as did the Apoſtle S. Paul; a man that ſhutteth not the bowels of compaſsion againſt the Apoſtatats of the Order: who are as ſtrayed ſheep, to whome he ought neuer to deny mercie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering their temptations were very prompt, and lett him thinck that if God would permitt him to be tempted, he perhappes would fall into a deeper pitt: a man, that, if neceſsity ſometime conſtraine him to eate meat better then ordinary, he doe eat it publikelie and not in ſecrett, that others may in like ſort be in their neceſsities prouided for: a man that, being requiſite for him principally to giue light and luſter to obſcure the darckned ſoules, doe ſerious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conſider what he is to doe, that he may diſcouer the true and loyall path to paſſengers, amongſt ſo many crooked, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and confuſed wayes. A man not reioycing in the honours
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:27206:145"/>
and fauours of the world, nor troubled in iniuryes and afflictions: a man not defiling nor in any ſort mittigating the worthy forme of iuſtice by impartiality, by deſire of conſeruing his honour, or reputation, or for whatſoeuer other reſpect, not correcting him that deſerueth recompenſe, nor fauouring him that meriteth puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: a man that by his ouer-ſeuere rigour is not occaſion of the ruine or deſpaire of any ſoule, and that by his too tender compaſsion cauſeth not sloath and negligence in his ſubiectes, or by long ſufferance and indiſcreet indulgence, occaſioneth a diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in diſcipline: a man that doth know how to gouerne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to be of each one both feared and loued: a man, that att the firſt relation ſhall ſuſpecte the accuſations made againſt his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, till he haue duelie examined and gotten knowledge of the truth: a man, that with great feare of God, refuſeth the chardge of ſuch office, and the obligation of ſo great a Prelature, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging himſelfe inſufficient of ſuch dignitie, euer reputing honour to be a great burden. And finallie a man, that diſdayneth not, yea procureth, as I would doe, and ſeeketh to haue for his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, men adorned with holy vertues, whome he knoweth to deſire nothing for themſelues, but ſeeke only the honour of God, and the reformation of the order, the ſaluation of ſoules and of all the Brethren, and that both himſelfe and they, giue to each one good example of themſelues, comfort the Brethren in their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and appeare to all the Brethren a modell and patterne in the obſeruation of the holie goſpell and our rule, fuch ought to be my ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the Generall of the Frere Minors.

                  <p>THe holie Father S. Francis being ſick, wrote this letter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing to Brother Helias his Vicar Generall that gouerned and viſited the Order. Brother, God giue you his holy benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: I admoniſh you, to be alwayes patient in what ſoeuer you ſhall take in hand, and well diſpoſed to ſupport whatſoeuer accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t may giue you diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. And if you ſhould be iniuriously offended by any of the Religious or other, receaue all as proceeding from the hand of God, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting

to the world that you ſeeke no other thing but to loue them, and to procure them to be the true ſeruantes of IESVS CHRIST. And therfore exact no more of them then that which God ſhall gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue you, and herein I will know if you loue God, my ſelfe his ſeruant and your ſelfe, to witt, if whenſoeuer any Frere Minor in the world hauing committed neuer ſo enormous offence commeth before you, he depart not without mercy, and though you afterward vnderſtand that he ſinned a thouſand times, if yet you loue him more then you would my ſelfe: and though by reaſon of feare or reuerence he ſhould not require pardon, you encouraging him ſhall demaund if he deſire it: to the end that acknowledgeing his offence, he doe penance for it; and thus much to be practiſed eſpeciallie towardes the infirme. You ſhall not faile to admoniſh the Guardians to doe the like, and that they reſolue euer to doe it. And therfore when it ſhalbe knowne that one of the Brethren hath offended and forgotten himſelfe, lett not the other Brethren diſhonour him, nor murmure at him, but lett them haue compaſsion of his fragility, remembring that the ſicke and not the healthie doe need the Phiſition. If any Religious induced by the deuill, doe fall into any mortall ſinne, I will that he be obliged vpon obedience to haue preſent recourſe vnto his Guardian who ſhall ſend him to the Prouinciall, and he receauing him compaſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly, ſhall haue care of him and comfort him, as himſelfe in ſuch caſe would be conforted, and he ſhall haue no authority to giue other penance to the contrite, but to ſay only vnto him, depart in peace and ſinne no more.</p>

                  <head type="sub">THE XVI. CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>THe holy Father S. Francis, as he trauayled came one night to a towne very weary, and his companion alſo who was Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Macie: though as Religious liuing in manner of the Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, they had nothing with them to eat, and therfore, they begged it for the loue of God, and gott bread to releiue them: comming afterward to a fountaine that was nor far from the towne, they there found a very faire ſtone, as a table there expresly placed to eat vpon, wheron the holy Father hauing layd the litle bread they had, excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinglie contented in himſelfe, ſayd: O Brother Macie, wee are not worthy of ſo great a treaſure, and ſtill rayſing his voice he often ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ſame wordes: Wherefore Brother Macie reaſoned with him in theſe wordes: Tell me Father if you pleaſe, how call you this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pouerty treaſure, where there is only bread and water without napkin to eat vpon. The holy Father anſweared, yea, I call this a very great treaſure, where there is not any thinge procured by humane induſtrie, but all adminiſtred by the diuine prouidence. The bread hath bin giuen vs for the loue of God, the fountaine and ſtone<note place="margin">The prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty.</note> were created of God for vs: therfore will I beſeech him to giue vs grace to loue the treaſure of pouertie with all our hart, wherof he is the only adminiſtrator and diſtributer. They alſo receaued a refection more ſpirituall then corporall, and gaue thanckes to God for it. The next morning proceeding on their iorney S. Francis on the way diſcourſed verie profondlie of pouertie, thus ſaying to his companion: Brother If we well knew the worth of holy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertie, we ſhould finde it to be ſo diuine a treaſure and of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie, that we are not worthie to poſſeſſe it in ſuch baſe and vnworthie veſſels. For this is the vertue, wherbie theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtriall and tranſitory thinges are miſpriſed and trodden vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, that they may ſerue vs and not we them. This is it that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:27206:147"/>
remoueth the impedimentes betweene God and vs, that our ſoule may vnite it ſelfe to her Creatour: for it giueth her winges, by which, though ſhe liue on earth, ſhe conuerſeth with the Angels in heauen. This is the vertue that accompanied our Lord IESVS CHRIST from his holy conception, euen to the croſſe, that aroſe againe with him, and in fine aſcended with him to heauen. On it eſpecially God founded his holy church, not only in the Apoſtolike eſtate, but euen in all Chriſtians, who then renounced and ſold all they poſſeſſed, and brought the price to the feet of the Apoſtles. There on alſo, may beloued Brother, hath he foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our Religion. Which lett vs therefore pray him to ſupport on that Euangelicall foundation, and to cauſe to encreaſe in an infinite number of vertues, in imitation of his beloued Sonne our Lord and maſter, and that we may with more eaſe obtaine the ſame, lett vs procure to be our interceſſors, the glorious Apoſtles S.

                  <p>S.

Which ſayd, they diſappeared, leauing the holy Father S. Francis exceedinglie comforted, and recounting the whole to Brother Macie, they according to their duety together yelded thanckes to God.</p>

                  <p>SAinct Francis being in the Oratory of Rieta, a Prouinciall repay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him to celebrate with him the Natiuity of our lord. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Religious entending to honour the feaſt and the Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, prepared the table with a cloth and white napkins, fourniſhing it with neat veſſel and meat a litle better then ordinary.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that morning to eat with them in the refectory; and ſeeing that preparation, and that the table was rayſed from the ground, where it accuſtomed to be, he ſecretly went foorth and finding a begger att the gate, he borrowed his hatt and cloake, then taking a companion with him, they went out of the houſe, and in the meane time the Religious ſate downe att table: for he had ordayned that when ſoeuer he was not found in the Couent att the houre of refection, they ſhould not attend him. About the middes of their meale, the holy Father retourned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed as aforeſaid, and went directly to the refectory, att the dore wherof he demaunded an almoſe for the loue of God.

The S. receauing it diſcouered himſelfe and ſate downe on the ground before the Religious: but being approached to the fire, he ſighing ſaid. My beloued Brethren, this table ſo decently prepared, is not fitt for poore Religious, that ought euerie day to goe aske almes from dore to dore for the loue of God, it would better beſeeme you, to follow the example of humilitie of our lord then of any other: for to that end are we called; conſidering alſo that we haue promiſed to obſerue it: now doe I eſteeme me a Frere Minor, beholding my ſelfe ſitting on the ground. The feaſtes of God and his ſainctes, ought to be honoured with that holy pouerty, wherby they haue pourchaſed heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and not with theſe ſuperfluityes which they did vtterlie abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, as thinges that did ſeparate them from the loue of God. It cannot be expreſſed, how much the poore Religious were amazed, hauing heard and ſeene this act: for many did weep ſeeing their Father ſitting on the ground with that habitt with ſo great humility correcting the fault
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:27206:148"/>
which they had committed, wherof accuſing them ſelues, they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged their fault to the S. who bleſsing them bad them with all euer to keep their table ſo poore and hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble that the ſeculers ſeeing it, might<note place="margin">He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to obſerue pouerty.</note> not be ſcandalized, and that if any begger came, he might be inuited to eat with them. Beſides, he would that the bread which they begged ſhould be ſo limited, that there ſhould remaine none ſuperfluous in the houſe, but what ſhould only ſuffice the Religious; aſſuring them, that if they wanted, God would prouide for them, as by the enſuing mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle doth appeare.</p>

                  <p>NOtwithſtanding the premiſes, and by how much the nomber of Religious encreaſed, ſo much neuertheles did the nomber of true obſeruers of Euangelicall pouerty diminiſh, each one ſeeking to interprett the rule in ſuch ſort as he might not be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to this rigorous vow of pouertie: yea there were good Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious that were putt in doubt therof by the ſubtilities of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringers, as particulerly Brother Ricorio de la Marqueſe, who one ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me was very inſtant with ſainct Francis to be reſolued therin praying him to explicate his meanning concerning the obſeruance of Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call pouerty, as well paſt, as preſent, and to come; that if it pleaſed God he ſuruiued him, he might giue teſtimonie to the Religious his Brethren of his true intention, and with all concerning the boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes which the Preiſtes might poſſeſſe, though they affirmed that their bookes apperteined to the Religion and not themſelues. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father anſweared him: Know brother, that ſuch was my firſt intention and ſhalbe my laſt, if all the Religious would beleeue me, that none of them poſſeſſe any other thinge then one habitt, with the cord and linnen breeches, as the rule permitteth. Therfore to them that afterward affirmed that the holie Father S. Francis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not the ſame to be obſerued in his time, his companions anſwered

that among many wordes which the S. vſed to his Religious, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be written according as fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> day to day God did dictate vnto him in his prayers and reuelations for the good of the Order, he diuers times ſaid, that he ſupported many thinges by reaſon of the ſcandall which might happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> betweene his Religious &amp; himſelfe in the beginning of the Order, and albeit he ſaw that many waxed cold and relented he tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in caſe that it were not in an eſſentiall matter of Religion againſt the vow; becauſe he would not debate with the diſobedient: he excuſed himſelfe herein towardes God, alleadging vnto him, that to the end his word of the augmentatition of his ſeruantes might not proue vaine, he would in himſelfe ſupply for them, wherein they were deficient, which<note place="margin">S.

                  <p>To confirme his intention; I will relate what he one time anſweared to the Prelate of the Monaſtery of S.

The S. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared, that when neceſsity conſtrayned him, he ſhould ſell the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and rather disfurniſh the altare of the virgin Mary, then doe againſt the ſtrict vow of pouerty, and the obſeruance of the rule becauſe he was certaine that the glorious Virgin would be better pleaſed, that her terreſtrialll altare ſhould be disfurniſhed, then her celeſtiall Sonne ſhould be diſobeyed.</p>
                  <p>An other time, Many miniſters were erneſt with him, to permitt his Religious to poſſeſſe ſomething, if not in particuler att leaſt in common, wherewith they might ſupply their neceſsity, their number being ſo<note place="margin">God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth S.

                  <p>THe holy Father S. F. reſiding for the infirmitie of his eyes, nere vnto Sienna, there came a rich gsntleman to viſit him, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing giuen to the Frere Minors a place where to build a monaſtery, and deuiſing on the forme of this building, the holy Father ſaid to this man who was verie familier to the Order, Brother, will you know how the houſes of our Religious muſt be builded? you muſt obſerue this order: when my Brethren ſhall come into any place, where they ſhall haue no place of retire, and ſhall finde any one that will permitt them to build on his land, a houſe, a garden, and other neceſsities, they muſt firſt conſider how much land will ſuffice them, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes regard to our pouerty, and to the good example which we are bound to giue in our houſes, as well as in other thinges. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he would not that the Religious ſhould be many together in hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor that they ſhould make them great, it ſeeming to him a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult matter, that pouerty can be obſerued, where there is a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. After they ſhall haue conſidered the ſcituation, and the place conuenient to erect the Monaſteries, they muſt repaire to the biſhop of the citty, and ſay to him: My lord and Father, ſuch a one, for the loue of God, and for the benefitt of his ſoule, permitteth vs to build a houſe one his land: we firſt are willing to addreſſe our ſelues to you, who are lord and Paſtour of all this flocke recommended vnto you and euen of vs, and of all the Religious that ſhall haue reſidence here whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re we deſire with the benediction of God and yours, to build a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. And hauing receaued the benediction of the biſhop, lett them firſt of all take a cord, wherwith they ſhall meaſure the plott which is neceſſary for them to build the houſe, which they ſhall make poore: the matter ſhalbe, wood and ſtone, the celles ſhalbe litle, onlie ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

When Prelates, Preiſtes, Religious and other ſeculers ſhall come to our Oratory, the poore celles and litle churches will preach to them, and they ſhalbe much better edified then by faire or good ſpeeches.</p>
                  <p>An other time he ſaid: The Frere Minors will often build great and ſumptuous edifices, bringing to ruine our miſtreſſe pouerty which ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be cauſe of euill exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, murmure and importunity of the people. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<note place="margin">S.

In theſe reſpectes it is much better for them to haue litle churches, in them obſeruing their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, giuing to their neighbour example of true Religious. S. Francis forbad his Religious to build their Monaſteries of other matter then wood and earth, as doe the poore of this world. There were certaine Religious of contrary opinion, alleaging diuers reaſons, as that in ſome prouinces wood and bordes were deerer then ſtones and lime, and alſo that buildinges made of lime and ſtone were of longer continuance, and more ſure: but S. Francis to auoyd contradiction would giue them no anſweare, nor did he approue their humane reaſons. To demonſtrate that he dyed with this intention, he cauſed theſe wordes to be inſerted in his teſtament, that the Frere Minors ſhould be very carefull not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the houſes that are builded for them, if they were not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to their holy pouerty: that they ſhould be as for Pilgrimes, and that they ſhould liue in them as ſtrangers. He ſometime ſaid againſt certaine learned Prelates of the Order and wiſe in erronious worldly prudence, that were alwayes directly contrary in the ſtrict obſeruance of pouerty: Wretched be the Religious that are contrary to me in ſuch matters as I know to be the will of God, and are neceſſary for conſeruation of the Order: then he ſaid to his companions: Theſe contradictions redouble mine infirmities, for ſome Religious are alwayes contrary vnto me, by the authority of their erronious ſcience and prudence, in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto me by God, for the benefitt of the Order, aſwell preſent as to come, which they miſpriſe, deſiring rather to follow their owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, then the will of God.</p>

Therfore as gold is of greater value then any other mettall, and the ſituation of the head is much more eminent in the body then any other member, ſo the beginning of thy Order, is more precious, in regard of fraternall, and golden charity and Angelicall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and is of ſuch beauty and nobilitie, for the obſeruance of Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall pouertie, that it ſhall fill all the world with admiration. And the queene of Saba, that is the holy church with all her faithfull ſhall admire it and feele in their hartes an incomprehenſible ioy, beholding ſo beautifull a mirour of ſanctity and ſpirituall wiſdome, and all the firſt, builded on this firſt rock, ſhalbe glorified by his diuine maieſty. Becauſe they ſhall endeauour to imitate IESVS CHRIST and<note place="margin">The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond to the breſt and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of ſiluer.</note> his holy vertues. The breſt and armes of ſiluer repreſent the ſecond eſtate of thine Order: ſo much inferiour to the firſt as ſiluer is more ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe then gold: But as ſiluer is of value in regard of the faire colour and worthy ſound: ſo this ſecond eſtate of the Order ſhall haue many Religious Gentlemen of diſcent, famous for learning, and renowmed for their preachinges, who ſhalbe ſo honoured in the Church, that manie of them ſhall gett the cheifeſt dignities therin, as Abbeys, Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopprickes, Cardinalſhips, yea euen the Papacie: and becauſe the force of a man conſiſteth principally in the armes and breaſt, God will then fourniſh thine Order, with men of ſuch valure, and of ſogood conſcience, as ſhall defend it from the potent ennemies that ſhall then perſecute it, they ſhall likewiſe helpe to ſupport the holy church, againſt the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous fury of heretikes and ſchiſmatikes that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall take armes againſt it. After this, ſhall come the third eſtate figured by the belly of braſſe, which is without compariſon more baſe then the ſecond.

But in their greateſt glory, they ſhalbe yet confounded: for they ſhall only know the thinges appertayning to the earth. And though they be followed of many for their learning and eloquence, which they ſhall diſplay in the pulpitt, for which they ſhalbe extolled of many people that conſider only the exteriour barcke, neuertheles ſpirituall men ſhall litle eſteeme therof: for they ſhall perceaue them to affect ſenſualitie, not the honour of God and the ſaluation of ſoules. Alas, they ſhalbe reputed of God in the ſame degree, as the Apoſtle S. Paul mentioneth: that preachers without charitie are like to metall or belles that haue good ſound, but it nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth them: for according as they ſhall preach holy and ſpirituall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, they ſhall bring foorth ſpirituall children, and ſhall manifeſt to others the fountaine of life, but themſelues shall remaine wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered

The fourth eſtate shalbe ſterill and terrible.<note place="margin">The fourth in the leggs of iron.</note> ſignified by the legges of iron, for as iron doth mollifie braſſe, ſiluer, and gold, ſo this eſtate ſhalbe of ſuch malice and obſtinacie, in his owne opinion, that by negligence and vnaccuſtomed conditions, they ſhall forgett the good which they had built, that is the golden cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the firſt founders of the Order, the ſiluer verity of the ſecond, &amp; the preaching and voice of the third in the church of God. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the feet ſupport all the body, ſo they by the force of iron, and by a terreſtriall hipocriſie, ſhall ſuſtaine the body of the Order, and ſhall couer themſelues in their courſe cloake, and endeauour to make the world beleeue in exteriour apparence, that they yet liue in their former pouertie and humilitie. Theſe interiourlie shalbe rauening woulfes and to God knowne for ſuch, though to men concealed, be it that they endure afflictions by diuers tribulations as iron in the fire,<note place="margin">

But as his feet are not of pure iron, but of clay alſo, that ſignifieth hipocriſie, they ſhal employ themſelues in affaires and negotiations of the world, to pleaſe and intrude themſelues into the fauour of ſeculer perſons: notwithſtanding becauſe of the great contrariety that is betweene ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked clay, and iron, in ſuch ſort as it is impoſsible to vnite them together, there will ariſe ſuch a contrariety among the Religious of that latter time, that att length hauing litle reſiſted and their forces being weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, they ſhall begin to vſe the art of hipocriſie, being impoſsible to ioyne true pride with fayned pietie, att leaſt any long time, they being att length diſcouered to be miſpriſers of the diſcipline of the Order, and conſequently of the goſpell of IESVS CHRIST, firſt they ſhalbe diuided one from an other, as baked clay is ſeparated from iron, though they ſeeme to be vnited together: and therfore hatreds, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentions, partialities and tyrannies ſhall begin to raigne among them, and afterwardes the world perceauing ſuch impieties and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, they ſhalbe examined and chaſticed euen by the ſeculers, and this ſhall befall them becauſe they ſhalbe looſed from their head of the firſt charitie. And therfore they ſhalbe happy, who ſhalbe mindefull of the commaundements of God and of their Order: for they ſhalbe refined as gold in the fire, and though they be not knowne in the world, they ſhall neuertheles be much eſteemed of God, for he will neuer abandon

this Religion ſo that there ſhall alwayes remayne ſome competent nomber of vertuous: though in compariſon of ſo many lewd and libertines, they ſhall appeare very few: and this few ſhall be perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the world, which ſhall procure them a greater crowne with God Now the ſackcloth and cloake ſo courſe, wherof I ſeeme to be aſhamed, and diſquieted, is holy pouerty, which as it is the ornament of this Order, and the ſinguler foundation of all piety, ſo the baſtard children ſhalbe aſhamed therof, for their ayme ſhall not be to God, but to the world, and therfore, endeauouring to pleaſe it, they ſhall miſpriſe the habitt of God, and ſeeke faire and fine cloth, for the vſe wherof they ſhall importune the world, and ſhall pourchace it by way of ſimonie; and therefore happy ſhall they be that perſeuer to the end in obſeruance of their holy vowes: After theſe ſpeeches it diſappeared, and the holy Father S.

                  <p>God reuealed theſe thinges and many other to his ſeruant Francis, as head and Paſtour of his Frere Minors, concerning the chaunge of his Religion, which being founded in Euangelicall perfection, exceeding difficult to be obſerued according to the world, it is not to be admired, if it be fallen, and doe decline from its perfection; We all being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined and affected to worldly thinges, and to ſhunne alll ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and rigour, and all neceſsitie, and much more freindes to our owne will, then to the will of God, which according to our ſottish prudence, cauſeth vs to make no eſteeme of the commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of God, and to forke his moſt ſtrict way, though moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to our ſaluation, as in deed it is: and therfore degenerating more and more we fall from our firſt Fathers. On the other ſide alſo it is not to be admired if ſome of theſe ſo fraile veſſels compoſed of earth as we are, haue demonſtrated ſuch an inuincible conſtancie, in ſo ſtrict an obligation to obſerue the goſpell; and in themſelues to preſerue ſuch a treaſure; becauſe all that is the worck of God, to the end the world may know that the eminencie and glory of this Religion, proceedeth of the vertue and power of his diuine maieſty, and not of humane force and vertue: And therfore when to him ſeemeth time conuenient, he ſendeth reformations to ſupport the ſame.</p>

                  <p>BEcauſe the obligation of a Prelate towardes his ſheep, doth not only extend to giue them aduiſe and ſpirituall refections, but alſo to releiue them in their corporall neceſsities, the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther S. Francis was repleniſhed with an infinite charitie, and had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall care to prouide for the corporall wantes of his beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and particulerlie where ſicknes and neceſsitie were ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which charitie he exerciſed, not only of Fatherlie duetie, but of naturall compaſsion, which he euer had towardes the afflicted: which vertue he afterward redoubled to make it more meritorious: ſo that he referred all the afflictions of his neigbour, to the perſon of IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe loue they ought to be aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therfore, his hart melted, as if he had ſeen his God in them: for which cauſe, thoſe new and feruent warriers of IESVS CHRIST in the beginning of the Order, did ſo ſpeciallie exceed in leading ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere liues, and doeing worckes worthy of pennance, which may appeare by the enſuying example, together with the charitie of the Sainct.</p>
                  <p>As the Religious were one day a sleep, one of them began with a loud voice to cry: I dye: att which lamentation S. Francis inſtantlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, and cauſed all the other Brethren to ariſe, and to light a candell, then asking who was he that complained, the Religious anſweared him:<note place="margin">S.

The Religious hauing taken his Refection, the holie Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to teach his children the vertue of diſcretion, wherby they ſhould moderate the feruour of the ſpiritt, for conſeruation of the corporall forces in abſtinence, he ſaid. Brethren, learne and retaine in you this aduertiſement; that each one carefullie conſerue his naturall complexion and forces, and lett him vſe moderation in abſtinence, accordinge vnto them: for albeit ſome can ſuſtaine themſelues with litle food, it is not therfore reaſonable that others who cannot liue with ſo litle, ſhould keep the ſame abſtinence: for as we are obliged to forbeare ſuperfluous eating, for not damning our ſoule and conſuming our body: ſo ought we to ſhunne indiſcreet abſtinence, but muſt ſo vſe it as the bodie may
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:27206:160"/>
ſerue the ſoule: for God loueth mercy aboue ſacrifice, and lett euerie one remember what by charity I haue done, I haue only done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it as a pious worcke, and for an example of charitie, his extreme neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie requiring it. And therfore lett each one refraine to cauſe the like an other time, and eſpecially Prelates towardes their Religious. Which was exceeding carefully obſerued of the S. for though he were very glad that pouerty in all thinges, ſhould appeare in them, yet would he neuer that his Religious ſhould be fruſtrate of their due releife, and therfore when he ſaw they had not ſufficient to eat, himſelfe would goe to begge, as we haue heretofore made appeare.</p>
                  <p>For his owne reſpect, notwithſtanding his verie feeble complexion, he was euer very ſtrict and abſtinent, yea beyond reaſon, euen from the beginning of his conuerſion to his death. Yet he is not therfore to be reprehended, conſidering that one ought not to meaſure or limitt the life of the great ſeruantes of God, who are continuallie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in their actions by the holy Ghoſt, but we muſt permitt to worck in them, the ſpiritt and certaine exceſſes that are to be ſeene: it is ſufficient for vs to our confuſion to admire them, and therof to imitate what one can, for it was expedient, that, as many were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue, performing leſſe then their duety, God ſhould raiſe others that in their bodyes ſhould ſupply both for themſelues and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: and to the end that the holy Father might giue this good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of himſelfe, wheras in his ſickneſſes many thinges extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie were neceſſarie for him, he would rather depriue himſelfe therof, to giue example to others<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> and when there were any Religious ſicke, he was not aſhamed to goe into the villages to ſeeke fleſh, and their other wantes, which in their health he would not haue permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to vſe for any thing in the world. He did alſo ſeriouslie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them to remember that they muſt be Frere Minors, not only in their health, but euen in their ſickenes, and that therfore they ſhould not haue an inſatiable ſpiritt, nor admitt all the commodities that the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the world enioy, for ſo there would be no difference, nor ſhould they meritt before God, for whoſe loue they ought to be content to endure ſome inconueniences, yea euen in their ſickneſſes. Now though this holy Paſtour did zealously vtter theſe wordes: yet ſuch was his charity that ſeeing them ſicke he could not but releiue them, and ſeek to ſupply their neceſsities, and cheriſh them to his power, as by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may appeare. One of the moſt ancient Religious of the Order being ſicke, the S. moued with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſsion to ſee him ſo afflicted, ſaid to himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe; if this Religious had eate grapes, he would be better: then calling the Religious, he conducted him into a vineyard, neere vnto the Couent: whither being come, that the Religious might not be aſhamed, he began

firſt to eat grapes, then gaue to him, and made him ſitt downe, and ſo entertayned him that he aroſe as ſound as he had euer bin, the vertue of God worcking by the charitie of his ſeruant: which the ſaid Religious diuers times with teares recounted to his brethren.</p>

                     <p>SAinct Francis being att our Lady of Angels, was infinite times im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned by his firſt ſpirituall daughter S. Clare, to take his refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction once with her. Yet though ſhe were of ſanctity ſufficientlie knowne to all people, he would neuer conſent thereto: att lenght the glorious ſaincte fearing that when ſhe leaſt thought therof, God might call vnto him the holy Father, ſuch being the infirmities whervnto he was ſubiect, ſo that ſhe ſhould neuer enioy that conſolation in all her life, ſhe ſo much ſolicited all Religious that were moſt auncient and beſt beloued of the S. to obtaine ſo honeſt a requeſt in her behalfe, that they together ſo affectionately entreated him, as that in the end he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented therevnto: But to auoyd ſcandall and ill example to his Religious, and that they ſhould not therby challenge a conſequence of goeing to eat att the monaſteries of Religious women, he cauſed S. Clare to come with ſome of her Religious, to our Lady of Angels, where he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated her vnto God, and he very curteously entertayned her with all her Religious, then hauing with her made a long prayer vnto the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary, and hauing deuoutly viſited the altares, he made preparation according to his cuſtome vpon the ground, and att the ordinary houre, they ſate downe, where for the firſt courſe, he began ſo highly to diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of God, that himſelfe, S. Clare, and all the Religious were ſo rapt in extaſie, that they were no longer of this world: but hauing their eyes lifted vp, they were as it were out of themſelues.</p>
                     <p>Att that inſtant it ſeemed to the Burgeſſes of the citty of Aſsiſium, that they ſaw the houſe of our Lady of Angels, with althe circuit, &amp; the very Mountaines to burne: they ſeemed alſo to ſee an exceeding great fire ouer the monaſtery much more violent then the reſt: wherfore they all ran haſtely to quench it. But being come to the church, they found neither fire nor flame, but that of the holy Ghoſt, which they conſidered and very well perceaued, in the countenances and aſpectes of thoſe whome they found yet fitting and ſwallowed vp in God, with S. Clare, and all her companions: from whence awaking, &amp; all finally finding the grace of God, they did eat &amp; vſe litle other thinge,

So euery one departed, giuing thanckes to God, who alwayes offereth and preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himſelfe to them that in charitie vnite themſelues vnto him.

                  <p>THe true ſeruant of God, deſiryng to ſerue his maſter entierlie in ſuch thinges as ſhould be moſt gratefull to his diuine maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, in fidelitie and perfection of life, without reſpect to any kinde of conſolation temporall, or ſpirituall: there aroſe a doubt in his ſpiritt, wherof he diuers times conferred with his Brethren in this manner: My brethren I beſeech you by the charitie which liueth and is amongſt you, to tell me, what I ought to doe, and whither of theſe two exerciſes you eſteeme more to the ſeruice of God: either that I applie my ſelfe entierlie to prayer, or that I alſo labour in preaching, ſo to inſtruct the ignorant the way of God: I am of litle and ſimple ſtature, as you ſee, and cannot teach with wordes full of doctrine: and withall, hauing on the other ſide receaued a greater grace of God to pray, then to ſpeake, I would more willinglie applie me to continuall prayer: beſides that, I know by experience, that there is a great gaine, and a certaine augmentation of grace in prayer, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to preach is to impart and communicate to others, thoſe litle giftes which one receaueth of God; prayer is a luſtre of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and of the pious affections of the ſoule, and a collection of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall vertues, vnited to the true and ſupreme good: but preaching is to beduſt the ſpirituall feet: that is, the amourous affections of the hart towardes God, which ſerue as feet and foundation to all the ſpirituall edifice, a man by it detourning himſelfe from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:27206:161"/>
of life, and rigour of diſcipline. In prayer we ſpeake vnto God, and harcken vnto him when he ſpeaketh to vs, and leading a life in manner Angelicall, we more conuerſe in heauen with the Angels, then here on earth with men: wheras preaching, we muſt alwayes conuerſe with men, and liue among them, to conuert them, to tell them the truth, and to heare many worldly thinges of them: Neuertheles there is one thing in preaching verie contrarie to all theſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which maketh much in behalfe therof, and is worthy of great conſideration, diſcouering vnto vs that God maketh eſteeme therof, which is, that his only Sonne, who is ſoueraigne goodnes, the only modell of diuine wiſdome, deſcended from the boſome of his eternall Father, to enſtruct the world, to teach by his holy example, and to preach vnto men, the word of ſaluation, wherby he afterwardes ſaued the predeſtinate ſoules, waſhing them with his precious bloud, reuiuing them by his death, and maintayning them by his moſt ſacred body, in the holy ſacrament of the Euchariſt, not reſeruing any thing to himſelfe which he did not graciouslie giue vnto vs to further our ſaluation; In that reſpect we are obliged by his example to doe whatſoeuer we thinck may be pleaſing vnto him, to leaue all our affections, and for a time omitting prayer, to applie vs to prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.

                  <p>All the Religious anſweared, that they were not capable to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile and ſatisfie him therin: then calling Brother Macie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſaid: Goe to thy Siſter Clare, and in my behalfe will her with all her ſiſters, to pray vnto God, that he will pleaſe to teach me to performe his ſeruice in this point: and hauing done this meſſage, goe to Mount Subaſio, to Brother Silueſter, who by the holy Ghoſt is made worthy of diuine diſcourſe, and who by his merittes obtayneth of God what grace he pleaſeth; to him deliuer from me the ſame meſſage.

The S. of God ſtanding vpon his feet, hauing heard this anſweare which he deſired to heare on his knees, as a reſolution from the almighty, repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt; and enflamed in the loue of IESVS CHRIST, he anſweared Brother Macie, lett vs then goe Brother in the name of God, and ſo tranſported by the holy Ghoſt, he that very houre put himſelfe in iorney, hauing called Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Angelus for a third companion: he knew not whither he went, but committed himſelfe to the conduct of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued att a towne called Carnerio, two leagues from Aſsiſium where he preached to the people, with ſo great a feruour, and generall edification, that as well the men as women, hauing heard him ſo piously to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urſe of the contempt of the world, and ſeing that God ſpake by him, they were ſo moued, that almoſt all of them would haue abandonned their owne houſes and followed him to effect his holy counſailes: but that the S. inſpired of God, willed them not to ſtirre: but that they<note place="margin">The first occaſion and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the third Order of S.

                  <p>SAinct Bonauenture and S. Antony doe recount, that S. Francis being departed out of the ſaid Carnerio, before he came to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nammo, he ſaw on a tree a great nomber of birdes of diuers kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, and hard by them an other ſquadron, a matter indeed deſeruing conſideration, in regard that it ſeemed to ſignifie I know not what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing, as it happened. For the S. inſpired of God, cauſing his companions to ſtay behinde, went to preach to the ſaid birdes, and comming neere to the tree, ſaluted them in theſe wordes: The peace of God be with you: and they ſhewing ſignes of ioy, approached all to this predication: thoſe that were on the tree deſcended to the ground, and rancked themſelues with the other, and keeping a quiet ſilence, they ſeemed to expect when the holie Father would begin: Wherfore he thus diſcourſed vnto them: My Brother Birdes, ye are exceedinglie obliged alwayes to prayſe God your Creatour, for he hath giuen you winges, wherwith you lightlie fly in the aire and whither you will, a fauour that he hath not giuen to ſo manie other Creatures. He hath alſo ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and cloathed you with fethers, and they of diuers delectable and beautifull coulers: he hath created your bodyes light, and ſupporteth you without any paine of yours, permitting you to enioie the labours of men. He hath alſo giuen you a qualitie of ſinging verie delightfull: then he conſerueth and hath conſerued you from the beginning of the world: he miraculouslie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſerued you from the deluge, ſending couples of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie kinde into the arck of Noe, there to be preſerued: he hath giuen you<note place="margin">Matt. 6.</note> for habitation one of the foure elementes: therefore doth holie ſcripture ordinarilie call you the birdes of heauen, beſides that you poſſeſſe the

mountaines and hilles, the vallyes and plaines att your pleaſure, the fountaines, riuers, trees, and houſes for neſtes: it hath pleaſed God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his ſacred mouth to teſtifie vnto the world, that you neither ſpinning, nor in any ſort labouring, he hath care to cloath you, both ſommer and winter, and to giue you althinges neceſſary to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation. All which benefittes, are pregnant ſignes of the loue which God beareth you as his creatures. And therfore my Brothers and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, bleſſed of God, beware that you be not ingratefull vnto his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Maieſty; but prayſe him alwayes deuoutlie, with your ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes, ſith he hath giuen wherwithall.</p>
                  <p>The Sainct hauing ended his ſermon, all theſe birdes (which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable) began to open their billes and beate their winges, as if they would haue ſaid, we thanke you, but being vnable verballie, bowing their heades they manifeſted vnto him, their due reuerence, and that they expected his benediction to prayſe God, and ſo to depart. The holie Father was much comforted in beholding thoſe geſtures, percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing theſe creatures to be ſo obedient vnto their Creator; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for their farwell he gaue them his benediction, which hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued; they with one accord mounted into the aire, filling it with moſt pleaſing accentes, then did they diuide and ſeparate themſelues in the aire into foure bandes, conformable to the benediction which the holie Father had giuen them in forme of a croſſe. S. Francis retourned to his companions, who were as beſide themſelues ſeeing ſuch ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge meruailes in vnreaſonable creatures, he asking them pardon in great humilitie, for hauing made them attend, whiles he preached to thoſe birdes, whome he found ſo prepared to heare the worde of God. He thenceforward preached, to all creatures, exhorting them to prayſe their Creatour, that all the world might yeld honour, glorie and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to God.</p>

                  <p>THrough whatſoeuer townes and villages he trauailed, he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with ſuch feruour and ſpiritt, and with ſuch efficacie that there was no hart ſo obdurate but was moued to pennance. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that which is ſpoaken of the towne of Carnerio, it many times ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued, that there followed him more then thirty or fiue and thirty men conuerted to pennance by his diſcourſes, who did not only abandon va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, as the cuſtome is for ten or twelue dayes, but did vtterly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly forſake the world, following God in his Euangelicall pouerty. He admirablie confounded the blindenes of heretikes, and exalted the faith of the Romane Church, which he performed by the meane of the ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce which the holy Ghoſt had infuſed into him, and of the merueillous miracles which God wrought by him, who was alſo preſent &amp; fauorable vnto him in all his actions. He expelled diuels out of the humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes which they poſſeſſed, and cured all diſeaſes. Wherfore men and women, poore and rich, gentlemen and yeomen, Eccleſiaſticall and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, from all partes repaired to heare and ſee him diſcourſe, as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from heauen: many of his hearers, without any retourne to their houſes remayned with him to doe penance. His word was as a fire that penetrated the interiour of hartes, leauing him that felt it contrite and penitent, for he preached not with an eloquence and humane ſcience, but by the holy Ghoſt and by diuine reuelation. Therfore preaching al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes according to what IESVS CHRIST inſpired him, he vttered no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſame verity, with great zeale and without any feare or reſpect. He could not diſſemble among the great, nor much leſſe flatter them: but he reprehended their vices, and if they were guilty of publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke ſinnes he corrected them with ſeuere demonſtrations, exciting them to pennance, he preached the word of God with like attention to the meaner ſort as to great perſonnes, he as carefully inſtructed a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber<note place="margin">e</note> as a great, for which cauſe he was indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie heard of euerie one, as a man ſent them from God for their ſaluation, and ſo much the more in<note place="margin">S.

Each one was by this diſcourſe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly enflamed in the loue of God: but eſpecialy the ſaid Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Orla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de, who was much more ſatisfied by the preſence, doctrine, and ſpiritt of S.

Wherfore the ſermon being ended, he went to ſalute him and made knowne his deuotion vnto him; then told him that he earneſtly deſired (coſidering his affaires called him otherwhere) to ſpeake only four wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des vnto him in ſecrett, concerning the good eſtate of his ſoule. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Father graciouslie anſweared him that att his pleaſure he ſhould come to him after dinner, &amp; he would attend him; and being retourned, he a long time diſcourſed with the S. of what moſt troubled his conſcience, which the S. by the grace of God did inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently cleere; which done, the Count added: Father I haue a place in Toſcane, where there is a montaine of indifferent hight, called Auerne, which would be very conuenient for

The S. as preſaging his good, though att othertimes he appeared more nice in like pointes, very willingly accepted it, &amp; told him he would ſend two Religious to ſee it, and if they found it ſuch as he deſcribed, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would dwell therin, as afterward he did: and whiles he thancked him, he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded two of his Religious whome he ſent to vew it, that finding it conuenient, they ſhould make choice of a place for a chappell and ſhould take poſſeſsion therof, which they performed: S.

Which S. Francis perceauing, he ſaid to his companions: My beloued Brethren, I now firmely beleeue that it is Goddes pleaſure we ſhould here remaine, and therfore hauing giuen his benediction to the birdes, he proceeded to viſitt the mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine, where the two Religious meeting him, they ſhewed him the choice they had made for their reſidence: which did not content S.

The Religious companions of the S. and the ſhepheardes, were exceedinglie amazed att ſuch a nouelty, that ſheep, muttons, and lambes as reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould demonſtrate that they admired and reuerenced the S.

Being in the Oratory of Grecio, on preſented him with a leuerett, but he preſently ſett him att liberty, that he might runne away, but ſeeing that he would not runne away, but was only remoued from him, he recalled it, and the leuerett inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently lept on his legges, and he embracing it as his child, ſweetly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked<note place="margin">A leueret became tame vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.

Paſsing by the lake of Reite, to goe to the hermitage of Grecio, a fiſher preſented him on great deuotion with a water bird, which the S. ioyfully receauing, opened his fiſt, that it might fly away, but the bird ſtirred not: the S. lifting his eyes towardes heauen, remayned long time as in an extaſie, then comming to himſelfe as if he had retourned from ſome farre country, ſeeing the bird ſtill in his hand, he gaue it his benediction, and gently commanded it to goe whither it would: and ſo the bird hauing receaued his benediction flew merily away. In the ſame lake was giuen him a great fiſh aliue, which<note place="margin">As alſo a great fish.</note> hauing accepted, and thancked the giuer, he putt againe into the lake, the fiſh mounting preſently vpon the water, alwayes followed the S. by the riuer ſide, till he came to the place where the S. was to depart, and there ſtaying he began to ſport aboue the water, and would not depart till the S. had giuen him his benediction.</p>

Yea I aduertiſe thee that thou gayneſt much more by this charitie, then thou ſhouldeſt by prayer; for they that ſerue and aſsiſt me in ſuch neceſsitie, ſerue all the bodie of our Order and aſsiſt to mayntaine it. Therfore thou mayeſt ſecurelie ſay vnto God, offering this thy ſeruice: My God I ſpend my time in ſeruice of this man, for which thou art indebted to me, conſidering that I ſerue him for thy ſake. The S. ſpake this, to the end that being by the deuill ouercome of impatience, he ſhould not looſe his meritt. And therfore as we ſaid a litle before, ſeeing the imminent perill wherin he laboured, and the trouble of his Religious, he conſented that preparation ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to adminiſter vnto him the cautere appointed by the Phiſicion, though his vicare were not preſent.

                     </gap>ie then being prepared, S. Francis ſeeing the burning iron, had a naturall feare of the torment he was to endure: wherfore he mildlie vttered theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to the fire: My noble brother, moſt profitable of all other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res by the almightie created, I pray thee with my vtmoſt affection, haue compaſsion of me in this thine action, and vſe not thy rigour againſt me, ſith I loue thee ſo much for our Creatours ſake, of whome I demaund ſo much fauour, as to moderate thy feruour and heat in ſuch ſort that my feebleneſſe may ſupport it. Then he made the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of the croſſe on the fierie bullet, when in meane while the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious left him alone with the Surgeon, for great compaſsion they

had of him, and being vnable to behold his torment and endurance. Now the iron hauing bin applied the S. recalling them they retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to whome he ſaid: O weake of hart and more weake of faith! why did you fly? I would haue you know that I felt not any payne, yea if it be thought that the Surgeon haue not well made the cautere, I am content to haue an other made, then an other, till it be well made. The Surgeon and Religious being amazed att ſo ſtrang a miracle, wherby he ſaw force did faile to annoy but not to benefitt, in ſuch ſort that the S. held himſelfe immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueable without hauing his head held, and inſenſible of the hoat iron, he knew not what elſe to ſay but that in effect, there was no other good in this world, but to be the true ſeruant of almighty God.</p>

together in a cheſt which ſhe ſhutt vp, and then thought of dreſsing the dinner, till her maſter and miſtreſſe came, to whome ſhe related all, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing them the child.

                  <p>TO all Chriſtians Religious, Eccleſiaſticall, lay men and women that are in the world: Brother Francis their ſeruant and ſubiect in God, deſireth withall reuerence a true peace in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by the ſincere charity which is diſcended on earth. As I am the ſeruant of you all, ſo am I obliged to ſerue all, and to adminiſter vnto you the moſt ſweet word of my lord and Sauiour IESVS CHRIST: Conſidering therfore in my ſoule that by reaſon of the diuers infirmities that afflict my body I cannot by corporall preſence as I deſire, viſitt you my ſelfe: I haue thought good to ſupply the ſame by letters, and by them to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter vnto you the worde of IESVS CHRIST, who is the word of the eternall Father, &amp; the wordes of the holy Ghoſt, which are ſpiritt &amp; life.<note place="margin">Of the dignity of the B.

Ioan. 6.</note> I then admoniſh you Brethren, to confeſſe your ſinnes to a Preiſt, with all the dilligence you can poſsible, and att his hand to receaue the true body and bloud of IESVS CHRIST. For as our Lord ſaith: he that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not my fleſh, and drincketh not my bloud cannot haue eternall life. Lett vs then endeauour worthely to receaue ſuch &amp; ſo eminent a maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: for he that receaueth it vnworthely, in ſteed of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pourchaceth death. Beſides I exhort you often to viſitt the holy churches, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence Preiſtes, not ſo much in reſpect of themſelues if they be ſinners, as for reuerence of the function and dignity which they haue in being miniſters of the moſt pretious body and bloud of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST, which by them is offered on the altare, receaued, and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred vnto vs, without which none can be ſaued: by the holy wordes which they vtter, and miniſter, he diſcendeth from heauen to earth, and<note place="margin">Mat. 22.

I inuite you all my brethren, and you my ſiſters, to this loue: lett vs all with one accord loue God, &amp; with one pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re affection of our hart adore him, becauſe that is the thing which he<note place="margin">Luc. 4.</note> eſpecially requireth and demaundeth of vs, as himſelfe hath ſaid: the true adorers adore in ſpiritt and truth; and it is neceſſary for them that adore<note place="margin">Ioan. 14.</note> him, to doe it in that manner. Our lord ſaid to his diſciples: I am the way &amp; the verity, &amp; the life. No man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the Father but by me.

The Father dwelleth in a light inacceſsible, &amp;<note place="margin">Ioan. 1.</note> God is a ſpiritt, whome no man hath euer ſeene, becauſe he is a ſpiritt and therfore, inuiſible, but in ſpiritt, conſidering that he is a ſpiritt moſt pure, for it is the ſpiritt that giueth life, and the fleſh can doe nothinge. He may alſo be ſeene of euery true Chriſtian, in the Sonne, in that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance<note place="margin">Ioan. 6.</note> which is equall to the Father, and therfore all they that ſee our Lord IESVS CHRIST, according to the humanity, and not according to his diuinity, are condemned, as likewiſe are they who ſee the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is conſecrated by the wordes of our Lord, on the altare, by the handes of the Preiſt, vnder the formes of bread and wine, and doe not ſee him and beleeue in their ſpiritt, that it is the true and moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred body and bloud of our Lord IESVS CHRIST, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, the ſouueraine Lord giueth his teſtimony againſt them when he ſaid: This is my body and this is my bloud of the new teſtament,<note place="margin">Mat. 26. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. Ioan. 6.</note> which ſhalbe ſhed for you, and for many in remiſsion of ſinnes. He ſaith in an other place: He that eateth my fleſh and drincketh my bloud ſhall haue life euerlaſting. He that hath the ſpiritt of God, which dwelleth in his faithfull, he receaueth the moſt ſacred bloud and body of IESVS CHRIST: and all other that haue not the ſame ſpiritt, yet neuertheles preſume to receaue it, they eat and drinck their iudgement and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: therefore, yee children of men how long will you be ſenceleſſe, and haue your hartes ſo hardened? When will you compaſſe to know the truth, and to beleeue in the Sonne of God? who ſo humbly ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you euery day, as when he diſcended from his imperiall throne into the virginall wombe, he ordinarily commeth euery day vnto vs, in ſuch humble manner attired and ſo approachable? He euery day deſcendeth from the boſome of his Father into the handes of the Preiſt on the altare, and as he was knowne vnto the holy Apoſtles in true fleſh, in that very manner doth he communicate himſelfe vnto vs in the holy Sacrament. And as they with their corporall eyes ſaw nothing but flesh, yet with their ſpirituall eyes, they knew him to be God: euen ſo we with our corporall eyes, ſeeing the accidentes of bread and wine, ought to ſee and firmely to beleeue, that there is the moſt ſacred bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and true bloud of our Lord IESVS CHRIST on the altare.

Bleſſed is the ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST that loueth his Chriſtian brother as much being ſick as in health, and in aduerſitie as in proſperity. Bleſſed is he that loueth and honoureth his Brother both farre and neere, that ſpeaketh nothing in his abſence, but what with great charity he may ſay in his preſence.<note place="margin">Matt. 5.</note> God ſaid in the Goſpell: loue your ennemies and pray for them that hate and iniury you: He loueth his ennemie truely, that complaineth not of the iniuries which he hath receaued &amp; doth receaue of him, but of the ſinnes which himſelfe hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, and doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitt againſt God and his ſoule, and alſo he that is not content to haue the loue of God in himſelfe, if he doe not alſo make demonſtration therof by the ſame worckes vnto his neighbour, and much more vnto his ennemy. Bleſſed are the poore in ſpiritt, for theirs is the kingdome of heauen. There are many that endure diuers afflictions in their bodyes, in prayer and good worckes, and that mortifie it with abſtinence, and neuertheles for a slight word ſpoaken againſt their liking, or for hauing ſomething de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed them, they are incontinentlie ſcandalized and troubled. Such are not poore in ſpirit, though exteriourly they appeare ſo: for the true poore in ſpirit, miſpriſe and abhorre themſelues, and loue not only thoſe that afflict and iniury them, but euen thoſe that beat them. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed alſo is he that ſupporteth the infirmity and fragility of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as he would be glad to haue his owne ſupported: My faithfull, lett vs loue our neighbour as our ſelues: and they who ſee they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not loue them as themſelues, lett them loue them as much as they can, or att leaſt lett them not offend them.

Many when they ſinne or receaue any iniury, accuſe their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour therof, which they ſhould not doe: for each one hath his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which is the body, with the ſences therof, by which he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth. Therfore bleſſed is the ſeruant that hath ſuch an ennemie in ſubiection, and ſo keepeth it vnder, and watcheth it with ſuch pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:27206:175"/>
that he hath no cauſe to feare it: for whiles he vſeth this dilligence, no other ennemy viſible or inuiſible can annoy him, nor procure him to ſinne, in ſuch ſort that as S. Iohn Chryſoſtome ſaith: no man is hurt but of himſelfe. We hate our body in as much as it will committ ſinne: for liuing carnally, it ſeeketh to deſtroy the loue of God, together with the glory of Paradiſe, condemning it ſelfe and the ſoule perpetually to to hell; the greateſt ennemy therfore that a man hath, is his proper fleſh, which can thinck of nothing but that which offendeth it, nor feare ought in foreſight of that which is eternally to befall it, the humour and deſire therof is only to abuſe temporall thinges: and the worſt is, it vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth to it ſelfe all contentment, and glory, euen of that which is graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the ſoule, not to it, for it ſeeketh the honour of vertues, of prayers, watchinges, and temporall fauour, it will haue applauſe of teares, in fine it leaueth nothing to the ſoule that apperteineth to her.</p>

Our Lord God the ſoueraigne Prelat ſaid: I come not to be ſerued but to ſerue: And therfore ſuch as are conſtituted ouer others, ought to glory of ſuch Prelature, as if they were conſtituted to waſh the feet of the Religious.

O my brethren, it is a glorious, admirable, and deſireable thing to haue ſuch a Spouſe, Brother, &amp; Sonne in heauen: And more then that, a Paſtour who hath giuen his ſoule here on earth for vs his ſheep, and who continually prayeth the eternall Father for vs,<note place="margin">Ioan. 17.</note> ſaying: Holy Father, keep them in thy name, whome thou haſt giuen me, that they may be thine, and may be with me where I ſhalbe, that they may enioy my glorie and ſplendour in my kingdome.

it ſelfe confoundeth vices and ſinnes: holie wiſdome confoundeth the deuill with all his malices: holy ſimplicitie confoundeth the prudence of the deuill, the world, and the flesh: holy pouertie confoundeth enuie, auarice, and ſeculer deſires: holy humilitie confoundeth pride, with all worldly honoures, and what ſoeuer is in them: holy charity confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all diabolicall and carnall temptations and pleaſures: holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience confoundeth all naturall will and ſenſuall affection, ſubiecteth the body to obedience of the ſpiritt, rendreth and maketh a man hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſubiect, not only to all men, but euen to other irreaſonable<note place="margin">1.

The Apoſtle ſaith: the letter killeth but the ſpiritt giueth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe: they are killed by the letter, who ſeeke to know only, to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted learned and wiſe of the world: by this meane to purchaſe honours and richeſſe, with anxiety to aduance their kinred and freindes: and in a word, not for themſelues, but for the body or for others.

In this ſort it is, that the ſeruant of God may know if he really haue his ſpiritt: for if the fleſh glorie in the worckes it doeth, by meane of the grace of God as its owne, it is then a ſigne that he is of the deuill: But if in the ſaid worckes, he neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe repute himſelfe vile, and acknowledge himſelfe a moſt grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous ſinner, he is then truely of God, and God is in him: Happy is the ſeruant that neither ſpeaketh nor doeth any thinge, for hope of recompence in this world, but for the loue of God, nor lightlie ſpeaketh, what commeth to his mouth, but prudently and in due time, diſpoſeth his propoſitions and anſweares.

No man can doubt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, ſith this viſion was not as others, appearing only to the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour eyes, but it was effectiue and operatiue by an act not heard of, in the verie bodie of his Sainct, imprinting in him the verie woundes which he had, by meanes of his diuine beames, which from his two handes, his two feet, and ſide, he ſent into his handes, feet, and ſide, not ſpirituallie, or imaginatiuelie only, but ſenſiblie and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, opening his ſide, and pearcing his handes and feet; and this was not only for the preſent, but for an eternall teſtimonie he left him the nailes framed of his verie fleſh fixed therin, the heades of the nayles lardge appearing without in the paulmes of his handes, but round and of iron colour, and on the other ſides the pointes clinched, for the woundes were tranſpearced through both ſides, ſo that att the principall wound, wherby the handes were pearced from one ſide to an other with the ſaid nayles, on the ſide where the pointes of the nayle was clinched, there was ſuch a ſpace betweene the ſuperiour part of the hand, and the tourned clinch of the nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, that betweene the ſame one might putt in a finger; the like might be ſaid of the feet: ſo that thenceforward he could not ſtand vpon them but with extreme paine; in ſuch ſort that beſides the inceſſant running of the bloud, it was verie troubleſome vnto him; as alſo was the wound of his ſide which was verie lardge and open, the fleſh being there growen againe in forme of a cicatrice, which was of the colour of a roſe, as it was ſeene afterward by diuers, hauing touched the ſame, as in place conuenient ſhalbe inſerted.

But Brother Illuminato, truely illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, ayming att that which proued true, that Sainct Francis had receaued of God ſome reuelations of very great importance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially perceauing him to be as out of himſelfe, he thus anſweared: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued Father, who knoweth better then your ſelfe, that for the moſt part, and almoſt alwayes God giueth great reuelations to his ſeruantes not for themſelues alone, but for others alſo, as hath bin ſeene that it hath pleaſed him att lengtht to manyfeſt them all?

The bulle beginneth: The glorious Confeſſour: then afterward he ſaith: We by the tenour of theſe preſentes declare vnto all people, that the ſtigmates of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious S. hauing in his life time and after his death bin ſeene in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the ſame hath bin approued with his other miracles, by our venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Brethren, the Cardinals of the holy Church: wherfore we haue had iuſt occaſion to enrole him in the catalogue of SS.

It is admirable to conſider, that as in the two firſt yeares of his conuerſion, before he founded the Order, he carryed a ſtaffe, ſo he began againe to carry it two yeares before his death, that he might end by the walking ſtaffe as a true Pilgrime on earth, albeit he had left it vpon obſeruation of the worde of IESEVS CHRIST, who commanded his diſciples not to carry it in their iorney, ſignifying, that they ſhould not relye on any fauour of the world, vnderſtood by the ſtaffe or ſtalke of a reed more perillous then ſecure; and afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des he conformed himſelfe to the ancient fathers, who vſed it att their hermitages, as ſainct Paul the firſt hermite, ſainct Antony and others, and not to be ſinguler herein, he gaue leaue to all the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

Afterward burning with this ſeruent fire of charitie towardes God and his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he was carryed, as we haue formerlie ſaid, through cittyes and townes, where he preached with exceſsiue feruour, thirſting with an extraordinarie burning deſire to ſee the nomber of the elect of God accompliſhed; to which places he was ſo welcome and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tefull, that when he went from the people he was halfe naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe each one ſtriued to cutt part of his habitt, ſome with cicers, others with pincers or like inſtrumentes, carefullie keeping thoſe ſhreddes afterwardes as reliques, with moſt pious deuotion, for cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of diſeaſes and dangers of this life, others brought him bread to bleſſe, wherof afterward to make vſe in like neceſsities, hauing ſeene therof manifeſt experiences. Notwithſtanding all this, the holie Father had a violent deſire to retourne to that former humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and ſimplicitie of ſeruing leapers, and of not knowing the imperfections of his diſciples, as he was afterwardes forced to know them, and alſo of enduring auſteritie of life. To this effect he ſaid to his Religious: My Brethren, we muſt now begin to ſerue God for to this preſent we haue done nothing or verie litle. So he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his ſpiritt to performe great matters, not conſidering the weaknes of bodie, by reaſon of the great feruour of his ſpiritt, wherwith being carryed away, he deſired nothing but freſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>battes to gett victorie ouer the ennemie, and indeed, he that well conſidereth it, ſindeth that feeblenes nor tepeditie haue any place, where the port is alwayes open vnto true loue, which inuiteth and induceth to attempt impoſsibilityes. And ſo much the more by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he had accuſtomed his fleſh to obey the ſpiritt, and had ſuch a promptitude to obey God, that he was ſo farre from reſiſting, that he ſtroue and endeauoured to worcke aboue his forces. Wherfore God that knew his deſire, opened vnto him the meanes of meritt, ſo that he did not onlie deſire, with the ineffable doloures of his infirmitie, which did ſo afflict him from the ſoale of his feet to the crowne of his head, that he had neuer repoſe; he endured in each of his members an extreame and particuler paine; in ſuch ſort that in ſhort time he came to haue nothing but skin on his bones. In all theſe affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions he diſcouered his deſire of them, ſith that he was neuer heard to vtter ſo much as one worde of complaint, but he called his dolours his brethren, and his diſeaſes his ſiſters, yet he anſweared the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious, who being moued with compaſsion wiſhed him to pray vnto God, that he would pleaſe to appeare a litle more merciful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then he bad him ſtand att his right hand, for he had alreadie loſt his ſight.

But ſainct Francis intending to lay his hand on the head of Brother Bernard, knew either by the touch or by diuine reuelation, that it was Brother Helias, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſodenlie called Brother Bernard, who anſwearing him, he perceaued by his voice that he was att his left hand, and therfore croſſed his handes as did the Patriarch Iacob, and gaue them his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, yet alwayes naming Brother Bernard he ſaid vnto him: God giue thee his benediction, &amp; encreaſe in celeſtiall benedictions of IESVS CHRIST, as thou haſt bin firſt called to this holie Religion, to ſerue for an example of Apoſtolicall life, and to demonſtrate how one ought to follow IESVS CHRIST, in pouerty and in his croſſe: ſith thou haſt not only giuen all they terreſtriall ſubſtance to his poore, but haſt offered thy very ſelfe vnto him in ſacrifice.

                  <p>THe holy Father S. Francis, before he left his ſpirituall children, determined to leaue them his teſtament, that therin beholding the will of their holy Father, they might enable themſelues to effect it, to meritt the patrimony he bequeathed them in the Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call rule and profeſsion; which teſtament was ſuch: Firſt my Brethren I will imprint in your memory how God drew me vnto him, and how I ſtripped my ſelfe all naked before the biſhopp and renounced al my poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilityes in the world: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeeking to doe pennance, God gaue me this grace, that whereas I formerly abhorred to behold leapers (much more to ſerue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) I began to loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> extremely: ſo that what before ſeemed vnto me bitter &amp; inſupportable, was then pleaſing &amp; deſirable. After that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan ſimply to pray vnto God and to make vnto him this prayer: Moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Lord, we adore thee in this place and in all the churches that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the world, and doe honoure thee; becauſe by thy holy croſſe thou haſt redeemed the world. And his diuine goodnes gaue me afterwardes ſuch faith towardes Preiſtes, that liue according to the forme of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Romane church, in regard of their Order, that albeit they had perſecuted me, I would haue had recourſe to none but them ſelues. And If I had had the wiſdome of Salomon, and had mett the moſt ſimpleſt Preiſt in the world, I would neuer haue preached in his church againſt his will. And them and all other will feare, loue and honour as my Lordes and maſtes, and will remarck no ſinne in them, in whome I ſee the Sonne of God, obſeruing no other thing of him in this life but his moſt precious bodie and bloud which they conſecrate, receaue and only adminiſter vnto others. And will abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue althinges reuerence and honour theſe ſacred myſteries and beſtow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in precious places. As alſo I haue euer reuerenced the holy name of God, &amp; in whatſoeuer papers I haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it written, in vnſeemely places I haue gathered it vp, and doe pray euery one to doe the like, and to
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:27206:191"/>
putt the papers in honeſt places. I deſire alſo that all diuines be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſuch as teach the diuine worde, as they who truely giue vs the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt and life. Beſides I beſeech you to referre your ſelues entierly into the handes of the diuine mercie, who as he hath taught me to liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme of his holy goſpell, will ſhew you the like, if you follow the rule which his diuine Maieſtie hath cauſed me to preſcribe in breife and ſimple wordes, confirmed afterwardes by his holy vicar on earth. Now all they that preſented themſelues to liue in this Order, diſtributed their goodes vnto the poore, as the ſaid rule doth import, they contented themſelues with one coat, peiced without and within, and with a corde to girde them, with the linnen breeches, and we would haue no more. We haue for a time liued in this ſort, praying in deuotion, the Preiſtes ſaying their office, according to the vſe of our holy mother the church, and we the lay Brethren in our ſimplicity, ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting our ſelues to all for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauouring to gaine our liuing with the labour of our handes. Now I beſeech you ſo to doe alwayes. And if there be any ignorant, lett the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne and exerciſe themſelues, not vnder hope of gaine, but to giue good example and to ſhunne idlenes: and if ſuch ſuffice not to ſuſtaine you, I will that you haue recourſe to the moſt abondant table of our Lord IESVS CHRIST: that is, to demaund almoſe att the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, alwayes giuing the benediction which God att firſt reuealed vnto me, to witt: <hi>The peace of God be in this houſe, and in all them that dwell therin:</hi> Lett them neuertheles take heed that they receaue nothinge as proper to themſelues: for neither will I that there be receaued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon either houſe or church, that may be tearmed ours, but as ſhalbe agreable to the pouertie and ſimplicity of our Order, which we promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe to God in our vowes: But lett vs all continue in this life as true pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes and ſtraungers. I command all vnder obedience, that in what ſoeuer place they be, they doe not preſume to demaund any kinde of priuiledge, or exemption from the court of Rome, either themſelues or any perſon in their behalfe, for their Churches or other places, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder apparence of intention to preach, nor as being perſecuted in their bodyes: but if they cannot obſerue their rule, in ſome one place, lett not their demaund be therfore admitted, but lett them goe other where to doe penance with the benediction of God. I was alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to obey the Generall of this Order, and the Guardian that haue bin conſtitued ouer me ſince I renounced the chardge, in ſuch ſort as I would neuer attempt to make choice of my reſidence, nor to doe any thing without his licence, becauſe he is my maſter, And although I be ſimple and infirme, I would alwayes haue a Clerck to performe vnto me the diuine office as the rule importeth. I will likewiſe that all the
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:27206:192"/>
other Religious be obedient to the Generall, to the Prouinciall and Guardian, and that they all read their office according to the rule. And if any one be euer ſo hardy as to preſume to alter the office, or to hold opinion contrarie to the holy Catholike Romane Church, I will that all the other Religious in whatſoeuer place they be, ſhalbe obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by obedience to apprehend him and committ him to ſecure ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And lett none affirme this to be a new rule: for it is onlie a remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and an exhortation which I poore Brother Francis leaue you as a teſtament, that the ſaid rule may better and more Catholikely be obſerued; And becauſe I will that the miniſter generall, with the other miniſters and Guardians be obliged not to adde nor ſubſtract from theſe wordes, but that this my teſtament be putt with the rule, and be read to my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, Preiſtes and laitie: I doe further commaund all vnder obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, that none preſume to gloſe vpon the rule nor this preſent te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, affirming, that it muſt be vnderſtood after ſuch or ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: but as God hath made me vnderſtand it ſimplie, lett them alſo vnderſtand it ſimply without gloſe, and lett it be conſerued perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to the end. And I beſeech the omnipotent goodnes, that all they who ſhall religiously and exactlie obſerue theſe thinges, may here on earth be filled with the benediction of his Beloued Sonne, with the holy Ghoſt the Conforter, and with all the bleſſed Angels and Sainctes: and afterwardes on high in heauen with the benediction of the moſt ſoueraigne celeſtiall Father. And I Brother Francis, your wretched and vnworthy ſeruaunt in our Lord, giue my benediction to thoſe that ſhall obſerue it, as I haue formerlie ſaid in the behalfe of God the Virgin Mary, and all the Angels and SS. of God in heauen and in earth; in the name of the moſt ſoueraigne Father, of his beloued Sonne, and of the holy Ghoſt the Conforter, So be it, <bibl>Amen.</bibl>

Then were there teares redoubled, many of them did not eat all their portion, but did reſerue ſome part therof, which afterwardes was effectuall in reſtoring deſired health to ſuch as were diſealed: which done, this holie Father for his laſt aduertiſement, recommended that holy place to his Vicare Generall and to all the reſt, admoniſhing them neuer to abandon it, but that if they were extruded att one dore they ſhould enter in att an other, alleadging that the place was holie, and the true habitation of God, of the glorious Virgin Marie, of the Angels and Sainctes of the liuing God, and that therfore they had ſo miraculouslie multiplied the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, where they had bin illuminated in his ſeruice for the ſaluation of ſo many ſoules; wherfore he doubted not but whatſoeuer ſhould in that place be demaunded of his diuine maieſtie, with a pure and contrite heart, ſhould alwayes be obtayned, who alſo would not faile greiuously to chaſtice ſuch as ſhould offend in that ſacred place, being the true habitation by grace of the celeſtiall Court, the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.</p>

Then to make publike ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation that he had not any thing in this world, and with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re facility to wreſtle againſt his furious aduerſary in this laſt conflict and triall, wherin conſiſted the crowne, he with an exceeding feruour and<note place="margin">S.

                  <p>THe bleſſed Father S. Francis being the ſeruant and friend of the omnipotent, was Founder and Captaine of the Religion of the Frere Minors, a moſt ſinguler profeſſour of pouerty, a patterne of patience, proclaimer of the truth, a mirour of ſanctitie, and finallie the pourtraiture of perfection, according to Euangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrine; mounting by aſsiſtance of diuine grace with a due or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and meaſured progreſſe, from vertue to vertue, from mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner matters to ſuch as were more high and ſublime, as one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came rich by pouerty, high exalted by humility, liuing eternallie by mortification, moſt prudent by ſimplicity, ſhining and reſplendant by his honeſty. For which cauſe God would alſo illuſtrate this his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant with an extraordinarily glory and ſplendour after his death, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing his body entier, incorruptible, pure and ſhining, in ſuch ſort as he ſeemed to haue giuen in him in this world a perfect patterne of the generall reſurrection when our fleſh ſhall riſe againe for euer incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and immortall. There were ſeene the ſaid ſacred ſtigmates in his handes and feet engrauen by the ſupreme artiſan, after an admirable and incredible manner: for the nailes were in ſuch ſort framed of his proper fleſh, that drawing them one the one ſide, the ſinowes and arterye vaynes yelded, as alſo on the other ſide the ſaid arteries would ſtretch with a miraculous artifice. The like may be ſaid of the feet: the ſacred wound of the ſide was in forme rather round then otherwiſe; and of couler vermillion reſembling a naturall roſe, and all the other fleſh that was naturallie browne and very hard by meanes of diſciplines and inconueniences paſt, became in an inſtant, white, bright, ſoft and delicate as the fleſh of a tender child. There was not ſeene o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all his bodie (which to each one repreſented the firſt innocencie, and ſecond natiuity to come by reſurrection in glory) any other black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes then the heades of thoſe bleſſed nayles, which yet was a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes that equaled the ſplendour of a glittering ſtarre. In which reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it is not to be admird if his ſpirituall children themſelues, knew not which paſsion in them was grater, either the greife of the loſſe of
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:27206:195"/>
their holie Father, or the preſent conſolation to haue had ſuch and ſo excellent a Father, whome, by ſo many manifeſt ſignes they might aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly know not to haue abandonned them, but euen being in heauen did alwayes behold gouerne &amp; aſsiſt them. And doubtles the eminencie of this rare miracle, was ſufficient to breake the moſt obdurate &amp; obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heart, and to mollifie and ſoften it as waxe, with contrition and faith towardes God. The death of the holy Father being diuulged ouer Aſsiſium, and the neighbour places, there reprayred ſuch a concourſe of people to ſee his glorious body, that it was impoſsible to reſiſt them. Wherfore it was conſulted &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cluded not to admitt entrance vnto any, but to thoſe of Aſsiſium and ſuch as could not with ciuill curteſie be denyed, who entring att their eaſe, beheld and handled att their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the bleſſed ſtigmates of this holy ſeruant of God. Among other the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re arriued a noble man called Hierome natiue of Aſsiſium a learned man and of great authority, who as an other Thomas, doubting of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſtigmates before he ſaw them, could not ſatisfie himſelfe with tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and retourning his handes and feet, &amp; to moue hither and thither the hard nayles: and the more he conſidered the matter, the more he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired: therfore with his incredulitie he teſtified this truth to all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblie; ſo that the holie Father was rightlie inſpired of God, when he commanded the Religious to leaue his body naked a long time on the ground: that this ſo ſinguler grace of God might be manifeſted.

                     <p>IN the kingdome of Portugall, and citty of Liuarez, the lady of the place called Lopez, had for gouerneſſe a deuill, in diſguiſe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, by whoſe counſaile ſhe practiſed moſt horrible cruelties on her ſubiectes, and moſt enormous ſinnes in her ſelfe: but following the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of moſt women, ſhe was very deuout vnto the SS. &amp; particuler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to S. Francis and S. Antony of Padua. Now ſhe falling greiuously ſick, and by reaſon of her enormous ſinnes committed running into diſpaire, ſhe had no care of ſpirituall phiſicians, nor of other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes; whervpon the SS. mentioned hauing pitty on her, came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitt her, and hauing ſaluted her, began to comfort her, and to perſuade her to be confeſſed; but they litle auayled, for ſhe alleaged that her ſinnes were ſuch &amp; ſo haynous as could not be pardoned. And therfore the elder of the two SS. told her that if ſhe would confeſſe &amp; haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of her ſinnes, he would be conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to take her ſinnes on himſelfe, and to ſatisfie God for her, yea and would make her participant of all the good deedes he had done during his life, and finally would in the name and part of God promiſe her eternall life. Theſe wordes put her in good hope, whervpon of a wolfe ſhe became a meeke lambe, with exceeding contrition doeing pennance for all her ſinnes; hauing made a generall confeſsion to one of the two: And hauing receaued the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentes by their Miniſter, ſhe by their owne handes was veſted in the habitt of the Frere Minors; which done, they diſappeared; they who ſaw them, eſteemed them by their comportment and geſtures, to be S. Francis and S. Antony. A few dayes after their departure, this woman dyed very piously, and commaunded her body to be buryed in the Church of the Freere Minors, ſome league diſtant from the ſaid citty of Liuarez. That very night a foot man of hers retourning from abroad, as the day began to breake, there appeared a ſhaddow before him, and he coniuring it in the name of the liuing God, it anſweared that he was the deuill, that for fourteene yeares had ſerued the lady Lopez in ſhape of a woman: and that by right he had gotten and pourchached her; but that att the end of her life, there preſented themſelues vnto her two Religious wearing the Capuce whome ſhe much affected, who ſo preuailed that they conuerted her to pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for her ſinnes, and againſt all right, wreſted her ſoule out of his power, and carried it with them vnto glory: But that thou mayeſt know this to be true, (ſaid the deuill) when thou ſhalt come to Liuarez, where ſhe is dead, thou shalt finde a rumour

                     <p>AN other woman of Portugall named Sara, being verie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout to the ſaid Saintes, was cruellie tormented by her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; for beſides his queanes which he entertayned in his houſe, the bread and wine which he gaue her were iniuries and baſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes. Now being herevpon one day run into extreme deſpaire, ſhe faſtened a corde about the beame of her chamber, and hauing made a bowe to put about her necke and to hang her ſelfe, ſhe heard ſome ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delie knocke att the dore and calling to haue it haſtely opened, wherfore hiding here corde, ſhe found that they were two Religious, who prayed her to giue them entertaynement for that night in her houſe. She demaunded who they were, and how they were called; they anſweared that they were two-frere Minors of a farre country, the one called Francis, and the other Antony; ſhe preſently replyed, that ſhe would willingly entertaine them for the deuotion ſhe had to S.

Antony; and ſo hauing admitted them, ſhe did accommodate them a chamber wherin to sleep, reſoluing for that night to deferre to hange her ſelfe, for reuerence vnto thoſe ſeruantes of God. But the SS. about midnight appeared to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſaid: God hath ſent vs in his behalfe to aduertiſe thee, that if thou doe not conuert thee from thy ſinnes, ſhake off thy lewd retinue, and liue in peace with thy wife, who is very deuout vnto vs, thou ſhalt die within three dayes, and be buried in hell, ſith thou art cauſe that this euening ſhe would haue hanged her ſelfe, if we had not come to preuent her: ariſe therfore inſtantlie, and in token that this is true, goe ſpeedilie to thy houſe, and aske thy wife for the corde wherwith ſhe would ſtrangle her ſelfe.

                     <p>THere was a Frere Minor in Thoſchane, for his owne perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer of very auſtere life, who being rayſed to gouernement, perceauing many yong gentlemen daily to enter into Religion, and many other other deſirous to enter, if there were place commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to entertaine them, determined to erect a great and ſumptuous Monaſterie: Which hauing done, he left the litle houſe wherin he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly reſided.

The S. then ſaid, come only with me, I know well whither I am to goe; and ſo following him, he came to a Chapter, where it ſeemed to him that the S. called all the Religious by one and one, and that according to their manner, they confeſſed their faultes vnto him, yea and that he heard ſome to accuſe themſelues of carnall ſinnes, others of diſobedience, others to haue infringed their firſt vowe of pouerty; of whome the firſt and ſecond it ſeemed that the S. with compaſsion pardoned, only admoniſhing them to be wary the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>IN the primitiue time of the Order, there happened a very horrible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident on this ſubiect in England; which was thus, there being a Religious of ſainct Francis very contemplatiue, who for the merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of his deuotions was often rapt into extaſie: his Guardian ſeeing him ſo to remayne a whole day and weeping, ſaid vnto him, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you brother, vpon holy obedience to retourne to your ſelfe from the extaſie you are in. Hauing heard the word of obedience, he incontinently came to himſelfe, and tooke refection according to his neceſsity: hauing reſumed his ſpirittes, the Superiour commanded him againe vpon obedience to tell him what he had ſeene that cauſed him ſo bitterly to weepe, which ſeemed vnto him meerly extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for the property of mentall extaſie is to cauſe ioy, and not ſorrow and lamentation. The Religious thus conſtrayned, began to recount vnto him ſaying: O Father, I ſaw our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST ſitting on a very high throne with an incredible Maieſty attended with all his celeſtiall guard to execute his iudgement. Then in an inſtant I ſaw to appeare all degrees of men and women, and ſaw, which I would neuer haue beleeued, many Religious, and many Preiſtes alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as worldlinges among whome I ſaw a Religious of our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that had a delicate and ſenſuall habitt, who being demaunded of what Religion he was, he anſweared that he was a Religious of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſainct Francis. Wherfore the mighty Iudge tourning to S. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis asked him if it were true that this Religious were one of his. He anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared that he was none of his Religious, becauſe his woare no habit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſo fine and ſenſuall, but poore and patched, and ſo the wretch was ſodenly throwne into hell: after him came an other, accompayned with many ſeculer Gentlemen, the S. denyed him alſo to be any of his, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that his Religious applyed themſelues to prayer and other ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all exciſes, and not to vaine ſeculer conuerſations, and ſo he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned as the other, as alſo the third, becauſe he came with a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of curious bookes: after theſe there came one very expert in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing lofty and ſumptuous buildinges, who was ſent for an architect

                     <head>Here enſueth an order of the nine principall vertues of this glorious S. wherby he merited to obtaine ſuch worthy graces of God: Taken out of the ſecond chapter of the third booke.</head>
                     <p>AFter the miracles and apparitions which the holy Father S. Francis made to thoſe that were deuout vnto him, it ſhall not be amiſſe to recount alſo the vertues wherby he merited to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne of God ſuch graces and ſo notable giftes, which alſo he daily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth, according to what the bleſſed Brother Iuniperus his diſciple writeth therof. The firſt vertue then was his great contrition, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſatisfaction for his ſinnes, and his care to auoyd them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The ſecond, was the admirable affection he had towardes his neighbour, and the compaſsion he had of him in effect and in word, and eſpecially in his interiour; in that he eſteemed euery one farre aboue himſelfe, taking for his ground this argument, that hauing offended the ſoueraigne Creatour, who ſo much loued vs, as that for our loue alone he would take on him humane fleſh, he therfore participated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with euery creature, and ſo did voluntarily obey all, not only his Superiours, equals and inferiours, but, as faire foorth as was lawful and poſsible, all creatures. The third, was a ſeparation of heart, from all terreſtriall and tranſitory thinges; for he was vnited to IESVS CHRIST alone, who had created him, and whome alone he deſired: Wherfore he in ſuch ſort exerciſed himſelfe herein, that it was ſo eaſy for him to ſequeſter himſelfe from terreſtriall thinges, and to haue his ſpiritt alwayes addreſſed vnto God, that it ſeemed his fleſh had the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me will with his ſpiritt. The fourth, was the incredible pacience wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he endured all his afflictions and al the iniuryes that were laid vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, endeauouring to loue them that iniuryed him, mortifying his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſences, and receauing all as from the hand of God: for as he beleeued that all good proceeded from the diuine liberality, ſo did he beleeue that the affliction which he endured was for his ſinnes, and that God meant to chaſtice him in this lif &amp; not in the other. The fift was his loue vnto the good and the great compaſsion he had of the wicked, reputing himſelfe much leſſe then they; for he would ſay, that the end was not yet ſeene when the good might become wicked &amp; the wicked good. When he heard any one detracted, either he would excuſe him, or would ſhew
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:27206:204"/>
that he disliked it, ſo that he would putt the detractour to ſilence, or chaunge the diſcourſe. The ſixt, was that he loued to be reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for which he was verie thanckfull; Neuertheles he was verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to reprehend, though he were verie zealous of the honour of God, of the good of his neighbour, and of the obſeruance of the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le; yet to auoide obligation to reprehend, he renounced the office of Generall. The ſeauenth, was that he ſerued each one, with a pure will and very great affection; though he would neuer permitt himſelfe to be ſerued, but in extreme neceſsity; reputing himſelfe vnworthy to be ſerued: alleadging that IESVS CHRIST ſaid, that he came not to be ſerued, but to ſerue, And if any one in any neceſsity ſerued him, he would in his heart giue thanckes to God for giuing will and power to that Religious to ſerue him. The eight was, that he endeauoured to conſerue in his memorie, the graces which he had receaued of his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne maieſtie, as alſo the vniuerſall benefitts exhibited to al other creatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, for which he was alwayes thanckfull for himſelfe and all others. Att the end of this thanckeſgiuing, he ordinarily accuſed himſelfe, diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the knowledge of himſelfe and aſcending to that of God, repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe vnworthy to giue him thanckes, as by theſe wordes he often ſignified: But who am I, that preſume to giues thanckes for others, I, I ſay, that am not able to thanck him for the leaſt grace he hath done me, and am alſo ſuch an abhominable ſinner? The ninth and laſt vertue, was the guard of his tongue, which is the hight of all good, as being the verie gate of life and death, according as it is employed: without the guard wherof all good alſo is loſt. In reſpect wherof he was alwayes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry carefull that his wordes ſhould ſauour of truth, humility, pouerty cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, goodnes, benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, prayſe of God and his neighbour: &amp; ſo he me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited to be in like ſort bleſſed of God &amp; me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, world without end. <bibl>Amen.</bibl>

My Lord Duke, you muſt vnderſtand that I was one of the ſeruantes of the deceaſed Euſtergio of worthy and bleſſed memorie, Cardinal of the title of S. Euſebius Archbiſhop of Beneuentum: who approaching to the pangs and agony of death, yea arriuing to that priuation of naturall heat and vigour, that we much feared he could not liue a day: about midnight I heard him with a loud voice to cry: O S. Francis! then ſtaying a while, with groanes and ſighes he redoubled, O Francis! O Francis: wherwith he much amazed vs all: but none of vs durſt approach to aske him to demaund the reaſon for feare to trouble him, but were attentiue to ſee the ſucceſſe of this frequent inuocation. I, that exceedinglie loued him, wept bitterly with him, and for him mentally inuocated the Sainct to whome I haue euer had a particuler deuotion: but this had no other ſucceſſe ſauing that the next morning, when we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to prepare his obſequies, he began to amend: and the phiſitians likewiſe conceaued better hope of him, he hauing alwayes eſteemed me for one of his moſt affectionate ſeruantes, hauing bin then a very ſmall time abſent from the Court, to yeld due reſidence to an Abbey which he had beſtowed on me: knowing well that he had bin with his Holines to viſitt the body of the glorious S. Francis, and deſiring to heare the diſcourſe, as alſo knowing that att other times he had much deſired that I ſhould vnderſtand the ſame, but no occaſion was euer preſented to demaunde it of him: Now taking this occaſion of his frequent inuocation of the Sainct, I began firſt readily to aske him the cauſe, then att lenghth I freelie diſcourſed, and humblie reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted him breifely to relate vnto me, how he had ſeene that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body in his Church. Wherevpon he graciouslie anſweared me in theſe wordes: know Abbot, if thou wert not deere vnto me as I hold thee to be. I would not impart it vnto thee, much leſſe to any man in the world: we that were there preſent hauing expreſſe commaundement of his holines to the contrary: and therfore by reaſon of that prohibition I will not tell thee the place where it is, but am
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:27206:206"/>
well content to tell thee what I ſaw. Thou ſhalt then vnderſtand that<note place="margin">Pope Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colas the 5. went expreſly to Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium to ſee the body of S. Franc. the yeare. 1449.</note> in the yeare 1449. Pope Nicolas the fift, who with an ineſtimable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence gouerned the holy Church, goeing for certaine affaires of great importance to Aſſsiſium, or according to the opinions of ſome meerly and expresly to viſitt this glorious body, ſent Sir Peter of Noceſon his Secretary, to giue the Guardian of the place vnderſtanding therof, who aſſembling his Religious communicated vnto him the intention of his holineſſe. Vpon conſultation wherof they were exceedingly buſied, for fearing on the one ſide that his holineſſe would take and tranſport it to Rome: and on the other, not daring to contradict him, they knew not well how to reſolue to anſweare his holines: but that the ſaid Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary being very prudent and diſcreet, conſidering the anguiſh wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Religious were, made anſweare of himſelfe, and retourning to the Pope told him in their behalfe, that none of his predeceſſours not the holy Apoſtolick Sea hauing attempted the ſame, they knew not well how to reſolue, much fearing that he would depriue them of that precious treaſure of their Father: which the Pope vnderſtanding, he retourned his Secretary to ſecure them and putt them out of that doubt. The Religious then accorded that he ſhould freely come about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night: but moſt humbly beſeeching him to come attended only with two or three perſonnes. A biſhop of Fraunce that was then neere his Sanctity hearing this, was much ſcandalized, ſaying that this was as it were to contradict and to limitte the Apoſtolicall authority: and that if his holineſſe did what thoſe Religious required, it were to giue ill example to the world, and aduiſed him not to endure it. The Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe anſweared him, that hauing good intention, he would not haue it eſteemed euill without ſubiect: and ſo much the rather becauſe they had very great reaſon for it, being alſo requiſite to goe into holy places with great humility, wherby he hoped to obtaine of this S. that, for which he expresly went att that time. And therfore he choſe only the ſaid Biſhop, my ſelfe, and his ſaid Secretary, and commaunded the Guardian to take the like nomber of his Religious to be preſent with him att the ſaid viſitation. Now as we expected the hower, the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian preuenting it came about three of the clock att night vnto his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and hauing kiſſed his feet conducted him by diuers turninges to a groſſe wall but lowe, whither being come the three Religious which he had brought, began to breake the wall, ſo that thy made a hole fitt for vs to paſſe commodiously through: we then began there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that vnto the place where the body of S. Francis was, there was a long rew of ſteppes of marble, by which goeing we came co a tombe made in forme of a vault vnder earth, where the Guardian kneeling downe gaue a burning torch into the hand of his holines, that he might
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:27206:206"/>
the more ſecurely enter. Att the higher part of the vault we found a dore ſome what lowe, that was of braſſe very ſtrong, hauing three groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe barres of iron, with their lockes that ſhutt very curiously, and three great chaines of iron that croſſed the dore: which being opened, there iſſued an odour ſo precious and rare, that none of vs either felt or ſhall feele a ſweeter on earth. The Guardian then with his knee on the gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>und ſaid to his holines, that he might enter att his pleaſure, he entred alone (we remayning without where we diſcourſed of diuers ſpirituall thinges) and falling incontinently to the ground before the feet of the S. he began to ſigh, groane and weep ſo bitterly and ſo ſorely, that ſo perſiſting a good ſpace, we began to feare, that ſome accident had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him: We then determined to enter to withdraw him, but that hauing of himſelfe chaunged his lamentation into ioy, which was an euident ſigne that he had obtayned of this glorious S. ſome grace of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; he called vs all in, deſiring to ſee the ſaid place and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre with vs therof, and ſo entring we fell on our knees, and abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiating our deuotious to be leſſe troubleſome to his holines, ariſing vp, and lifting our eyes on high we remayned all amazed. O how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrutable, freind Abbott, (ſaid the Cardinall) are the wayes, of God! and how diſtant and different are his iudgementes from all humane pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence! who in his life hath euer ſeene or heard of a body ſo many yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res dead, to remayne and ſtand vpright on his feet without any reſt or ſtay? It is no baulme, nor any drith of naturall coldnes, but an only ſupernaturall and euidently diuine vertue, that thus ſupporteth this holy body as if it were liuing, in ſuch ſort as we haue ſeene it. We may well acknowledge that the hand of God is no more abbridged in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe then if he were liuing, ſeeing that he is truely liuing, aliue I ſay in God, aliue in vertues, aliue in miracles, and aliue in image, geſture and and fleſh: ſo that only breath, yea breath alone is wanting. But to tell your particulerly and by order: Know Abbott, that this place is made<note place="margin">The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable standing of the body of S. Franc.</note> in forme of a litle chappell with three arched vaultes, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſeemed to be miraculously made, were it in reſpect of the walles or pauement, hauing in the middeſt a ſtone wheron the glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the S. ſtood vpright on his feet as I haue ſaid, with his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the weſt, &amp; his eyes eleuated towardes heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which they very attentiuely beheld as he accuſtomed in his life. His handes were ioyned one in an other within the sleeues of his habitt, after the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner of the Freer Minors, &amp; reſted on his breſt. This body was in all partes as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier and exempt from corruption as the firſt day of his death. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of this vault, ſtood an other body likewiſe vpright, and cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in the habitt of S. Dominick, who ſeemed to pray with his handes ioyned on high, and his eyes fixed towardes the feet of S. Francis, and
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:27206:207"/>
they were ſo liuelie &amp; cleare, that to neither of both there wanted but ſpeech. They yelded ſuch and ſo gracious a ſauour that it could hardlie be ſupported: for it was ſo admirablie ſubtile and penetrant, that it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed our ſpirittes into extaiſe. Now the Pope hauing well ſeene and duely conſidered all this, fell againe on his knees before the ſaid body of S. Francis, then very reuerently lifted vp one ſide of his habitt, for the other ſide was faſt vnder his foot which he would not pull vp, becauſe it could not conuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie be done without ſtirring the whole body: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he contented himſelfe to diſcouer only the other foot, which was all bare without ſandale. O happy were our eyes, that then deſerued to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold<note place="margin">The ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates of S. Franc. appeared fresh on his body.</note> the ſacred ſtigmates which God himſelfe with his owne handes imprinted in his deerly beloued! Happy doubtles are the vnderſtandin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that can att their pleaſure contemplate them: for the wound was as freſh on the middeſt of ther foot, as if it had bin made att that verie hower, with the hard nayle vpon the bare fleſh: and the bloud appeared exceeding full of life. O happy were the ſoules that were held worthy to ſee in his ſeruant, what they could not ſee in their Lord IESVS CHRIST! and more when afterwardes they ſaw his ſacred handes, which his Holines diſcouered and ſaw pearced as the feet, and hauing alſo the like nailes: we alſo kiſſed them laying our impure lippes onthe ſacred bloud that was yet very freſh: which made vs to poore out teares, that ſo abondantly fell from our eyes, as that they hindered our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for we could not taſt nor enioy the ſame according to our wiſh: our eyes were ſo troubled that we often ſaw not that precious treaſure.

O thrice happy the mouthes of vs ſo greiuous ſinners, wherwith we were permitted to kiſſe that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred wound of his foot, with ſuch interiour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſolation as none could be more! But ſeauen fold more hapy the Pope who alone kiſſed the wound of his ſide, flowered as a freſh roſe, &amp; conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly his very mouth; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he graciously vttered theſe wordes: O moſt worthy &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of our redemption, wherwith the eternall God would that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to our Lord I.

differing from him only in this, that he receaued his woundes of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cked Iewes, and thou of our Redeemer I. C. O extreme benefite!

Of what maſter haſt thou learned to mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to ſo high a degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, that neuer S. of either ſex could equall thee in the giftes of God? The Pope vttered theſe and many other wordes, being rauiſhed out of himſelfe in the preſence of this S. of God, himſelfe together with vs ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinge the pauement of that holy place with abondance of our teares.

Making therfore ſome litle prayer more, and recommending our ſelues to the S. the Pope firſt goeing out we all followed, but not till we had opened the two vaultes in the two other arches, where we ſaw the two other glorious bodies of his diſciples, entier alſo and very odoriferous, but much leſſe then that of their maſter; hauing their habittes of ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth. Att the entry we ſaw the body of the bleſſed Brother Giles, then<note place="margin">Brother Giles alſo.</note> we came foorth, and the Guardian ſhutt the dores, praying his Holines to keepe the ſame in great ſecreſie: which he promiſed him, and comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs alſo the ſame. This, my freind Iames, was the cauſe of my inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that night, when I cryed, O Francis! Francis! hauing yet hope, yea very confident, that he wilbe protectour of my ſoule before God att my departure. But it ſeemeth indeed very admirable that this glorious S. had not procured his recouery, but that he might haue declared this his glory to many his deuoted freindes that much deſired to vnderſtand it: for this diſcourſe ended he began ſo to decay that he dyed the night following, leauing aſſured teſtimony of this truth, conſidering that it is not to be beleeued nor thought, nor is it probable, that aman eſpecially ſuch as this being in the conflictes of death, would for his pleaſure and without oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faine a falſe matter, the time ſo neere when he ſhould moſt ſtricktly render an account vnto God, who ſeuerely condemneth the culpable and ill-deſeruers, as he crowneth the ſainctes, his elected here on earth, but much more in heauen, there glorifiyng their bodies &amp; their ſoules with his glorious viſion eternally; whither I beſeech him by his grace to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct vs, where he is three and one, and liueth and raigneth world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end. <bibl>Amen.</bibl>

This glorious Father S.

ſublime and worthy a myſtery, wrought by his diuine maieſty in his faithfull ſeruant Francis; that this ſigne of the croſſe which he alwayes carryed imprinted in his hart, from the beginning of his conuerſion, might alſo exteriourly appeare in his body entierly vnited in the ſaid croſſe, and that as his ſoule was interiourly veſted with IESVS CHRIST, the habite of a penitent which he tooke repreſenting the image of the croſſe, the body alſo might in like ſort be inueſted with the ſaid ſacred ſigne, and that with ſuch colours and diſtinctions he might the more couragiously ſerue his God, as his principall Capitai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, in the ſpirituall warre and army, wherin God had ouercome the powers of ſpirituall ennemies. Yea and diuers miſteries of the croſſe, appeared in the S. from his firſt beginning in ſpirituall warfare, as in the diſcourſe of his life plainely appeareth, by the diuers apparitions of the croſſe which he had. And for farther aſſurance of the verity of ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable a fact, God did not only giue teſtimonies worthy of creditt, that ſaw and with their owne handes touched, thoſe holy ſtigmates during his life: but did manifeſt them euen by merueillous apparitions, and miracles wrought after the death of the glorious Father, as hereafter we ſhall orderly diſcourſe, beſides what hath bin formerly ſaid, vpon the doubt of Pope Gregory the ninth, in the nine and fiftieth chapter of the ſecond booke.</p>

The daughter did ſweare that ſhe had neuer ſeene them, and that they came there miraculously: But the ſoule of man often ſeeking occaſion to fall, calling the verity in doubt, there entred an other ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into the hart of this gentlewoman, contrary to the former; which was that the ſaid ſtigmates had euer bin in the ſaid image, but that ſhe had not well obſerued it. God intending not to haue his firſt miracle miſpriſed, added a ſecond, permitting the ſaid ſtigmates to vaniſh againe and the image to remayne as before, and ſo the firſt miracle was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Att the Citty of Lorio in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> there was a man named Iohn, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deuout vnto the holy Father S.

Now this miſerable afflicted thus lying in his bed, accompained only with his miſery, did in a manner continually weepe and often calling on the holy Father S.

                  <p>IN the citty of Potencia in Apulia, there was a Preiſt called Roger, a very venerable man, and Canon of the great church, who being by meanes of an infirmity, become very feeble, entred one day into a church to pray, wherein was painted the image of S. Francis, with the ſtigmates, which beholding he began to conceaue a doubt in himſelfe of the ſublimity of the miracle, as of an inaccuſtomed thinge and vtterly impoſsible; his hart being thus wounded with incredulity, he felt att the verie inſtant ſuch a greiuous pearcing of his left hand, within his gloue, that an arrow flyeth not out of a bowe with more force and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: wherupon being exceedingly amazed with the wound together with the ſtroake, and yet more with the ſecrett manner therof, he pulled of his gloue, to ſee with his eyes, the effect of that which he had heard and felt, and hauing neuer before had any wound in his hand, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration he beheld this new wound, whence began to proceed ſuch an extreme paine as he thought therof to dye: it was merueilous to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for in the gloue appeared no ſigne att all but only in the hand, that the wound made ſecretly in the hand might be correſpondent to that which was ſecrett in the hart. So for the ſpace of two dayes making publicke relation of the occaſion, and the ſecrett of his incredulity, he confeſſed and with oath affirmed that he beleeued the ſacred ſtigmates to be imprinted in S. Francis; he humbly recommended himſelfe vnto him, beſeeching him, by the vertu of his ſacred ſtigmates, and by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie of his interceſsion to procure the ceſſation of his paine. Att the end of two dayes his incredulity hauing bin ſufficiently puniſhed, God by the merittes of the S. gaue him eaſe, for the greife entierly ceaſſed, the heat of the hurt was qualified, and no ſigne of the wound remayned; ſo that ſecrett infirmity of the ſoule was cured by the manifeſt launce of the fleſh: and by diuine prouidence the body was cured together with the ſoule: the man remayning humble towardes God, deuout to his ſeruant S. Francis, and affectionate to the Religious of his Order. This ſo ſolemne miracle, was aſſured by autenticall letters from the Biſhop of the ſaid citty, ſealed with the ordinary ſeale, that thenceforward none might admitt any doubt of the ſacred woundes of the Sonne of God, diuinely imprinted in his ſeruant Francis, and that no mannes eye ſhould be euill to ſee that God is good, as if the liberality and gift of this grace, did not correſponde vnto the eternall bounty.</p>

The miſerable wretch therfore finding himſelfe reduced to that ruefull and pittifull eſtate, hartelie recommended himfelfe vnto God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually powred out teares; he implored the aſsiſtance of S.

For in the verie night of the holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſours feaſt, about the beake of day, the mercifull Father diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in to the priſon and called him by his name, willing him incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentlie to ariſe.

Being in this perplexity, he called out, and the keepers came running, who ſeeing the man thus vnchained, knowing well in what manner he was fettered; perceauing alſo the dores of themſelues to be opened, that were ſo ſurely faſtened, and the lockes with other iron implementes lying on the ground, they aduertiſed the biſhop therof, who goeing incontinentlie to the priſon, and ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uing ſeene and conſidered all circumſtances, knew manifeſtly that it was a worck of God.

But the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour conſidering the enormity of the fact wherof he was accuſed, deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by what tortures he could to wreſt out the truth of this accuſation &amp; by what torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to putt him to death when he ſhould haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the crime: and hauing determined to begin the next morning by torture to examine him: the gentleman the ſame night was viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Sainct Francis, who was enuironed with a reſplendant light which ſtill continued till the break of day, and this diuine light being gone, the priſoner was exceeding ioyfull, with hope ſhortly to be deliuered without any detriment.

                  <p>IN Poictou, in a village called Sime, there was a Preiſt named Sir Renald, very deuout vnto S.

                  <p>IT ſeemeth here to good purpoſe, in ſome ſort to declare the order and degrees, wherby the holy Ghoſt doth raiſe thoſe that are his to this great and high vnion of ſpiritt with God, as well for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re true relation and intelligence of the perfect contemplation and vnion<note place="margin">Lib. 14. chap. 18.</note> which the glorious Father S. Francis had with God, as for the greater comfort of the ſoules who deſire to follow and imitate his life and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. Now it is to be noted, according to the doctrine of S. Auguſtin, that men lay two foundations, the one of perdition which is ſelfe-loue, and the other of ſaluation which is the loue of God; or elſe that men haue two endes, ſome, in God, and others in themſelues, directing all their actions for themſelues; our will is gouerned according to theſe two endes: for if it conuert it ſelfe vnto God, as taking him for its end, the more it diſioyneth it ſelfe from creatures, yea from it ſelfe, the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer doth it approach vnto God by obedience and charity; and perhappes with diuine aſsiſtance, to the perfect contempt and abnegation of it ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe, and to transforme it ſelfe entirely into the loue of God which is our end, wherin conſiſteth all our perfection and glory. Our Maſter IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST left vs this rule in his holy ghoſpell, ſaying: If any man<note place="margin">Matt. 16.</note> will come after me, lett him deny himſelfe, lett him know how much he is deceaued that eſteemeth himſelfe of any worthe, lett him hate, and dye in himſelfe, that he may know me, loue, and liue in me, and I in him. And as the nature of fire is to aſcend on high, ſo the nature of a ſoule free and disburdened from the waight of ſelfe and naturall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, is to mount and aſcend into God, which is her proper place whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſhe was created, to repoſe in him bleſſedly perfect and eternall: As it is the nature of a ſtone by meane of his naturall waight to decline vnto his center; ſo is it naturall to the hart loaden with loue of it ſelfe and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures to fall by his owne fault into hell. Lett the ſoule then that ſhall haue placed all his end in God, and deſireth to aſcend to the throne of grace of the true Salomon IESVS GHRIST, who being a moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and peaceable king, fitteth art the right hand of his Father, in whome all the deſires of Angels and glorious ſoules are abſolutelie effected; lett that ſoule, I ſay, behold in this dayes exerciſe, the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Iacob, whoſe hight toucheth the heauen, and that ſhe the more eaſely, and with better order aſcend, ſhe may make ſeauen ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall degrees or ſteppes, which are ſo diſpoſed by Vbertin.

And becauſe it will ſeeme difficult to the penitent to performe this, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing repugnant to his nature, he muſt endeauour to prepare and enable his hart by pious cogitations and meditations, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and taſt of God, as to thinck on death, on the generall iudgement, on the feare therof, on hell and the paine therof, one Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicice and the glory therof, on the benefittes and graces of his diuine Maieſty, as well in generall as in particular beſtowed on all perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and aboue all, lett him not forgett the paſsion of our Lord IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST as a ſoueraigne benefitt of God beſtowed on vs, wherin conſiſteth all our conſolation and hope. When the ſinner calleth to minde his great ingratitude towardes God, in as much as lyeth in him by his ſinnes crucifying him againe, and after he had bin ſo deerly redeemed with his precious bloud and moſt cruell death, deſtroying himſelfe againe by yelding himſelfe to the deuill, to the great miſpriſe and contempt of his God, he cannot but carrie a great hatred to his ſinnes, and deſire to doe great penance: therfore that he no more erre from the way of God, he conſidereth how he ought to liue, he ſequeſtreth himſelfe frome idle and vnprofitable conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he ſmothereth peruerſe inclinations, and appetites, endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to gett an hatred of his owne affection, a contempt of the world, and finally a victory of him ſelfe to yeld himſelfe abſolutely vnto God, IESVS CHRIST taught this firſt degree to his ſeruant Francis. when appearing vnto him att the beginning of his conuerſion he told him that it was neceſſarie for him to chaung the corrupted and infected taſt which he had, and to make him finde taſt in that which till then he had miſpriſed, and that what ſoeuer he had ſound pleaſing ſhould proue diſtaſtfull and bitter. I know not indeed of what Sainct are recorded greater exercices in this ſeparation, deeper foundation of penance, and more labours then of him; and doubles it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for him, for he was to aſcend vnto ſuch a perfection, and to be an example in the church, to fly the world, to make his habitation in ſolitary places, and deſert woodes, to renounce monie, and his fathers patrimonie euen to this ſhirt, to diſplaint himſelfe from his kinred and freindes, from conuerſations, and ordinarie courſes of life, euen by the root, to tranſ-plant himſelfe into God, and with ſuch courage that it was not needfull for him to fly into the deſert

There groweth in the ſoule ſo extreme a hungar, and a ſuch a thirſt after this taſt, and after a triall of this diuine ſweetnes, that no creature or temporall conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation can ſatisfie her but God alone, whome ſhe loueth: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe neither can, nor doth yet deſerue to obtaine the food of the great, knowing her owne infirmitie and litle meritt, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth greedilie hungrie after temporall thinges, and beggeth the mites of the table of God, ſeeking them on earth, meditating on his life and conuerſation, worckes and examples, yea ſhe ſeeketh them in his creatures where his ſteppes, markes and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are repreſented vnto her, and in his Sainctes where ſhe fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth moſt euident teſtimonyes of her God, and often times ſhe heareth his voice and ſeeth his preſence, and this eſtate is like to that, wherof the eſpouſe ſpeaketh in the Canticles: I adiure you, if<note place="margin">Cant. 50.</note> you finde my beloued, to tell him that I languiſh and looſe my

ſelfe for his loue. It is alſo expedient in this eſtate to make ſimplicityes in worckes and wordes, for the great exceſſe of new deſires, as new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall wine: of theſe deſires, when thy are reall, doth grow, the imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the life of IESVS CHRIST, and of his humility, as much as may be, that he may be found and poſſeſſed: In that reſpect doth our Lord call himſelfe the path and way, for we muſt walke by him, and his ſteppes are, as himſelfe affirmeth, humility, meeknes, patience cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, prayers, and finally his croſſe and paſsion; for the ſeruant is not<note place="margin">Ioan. 14. &amp; 15.</note> greater then his Lord, nor the diſciple aboue his maſter. This is the ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of whatſoeuer may be ſaid or written. It is the light of the diuine will, wherin conſiſteth the rule and leſſon of true wiſdome. It is the ſhorteſt and ſecureſt way that we can walke, which openeth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couereth vnto vs the moſt eminent maſter of truth, wherin walking, he taught men what way they ſhould vndertake. Lett no man thinck that there is an other way more direct, to obtaine of God true charity, then that of labours and the exerciſes of vertues. This exerciſe conſiſteth in three pointes: the firſt, with a ſincere hart to demaund of God the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ones offences mortall, and veniall; together with an interiour ſorrow for them, and a ſhunning of all occaſions of mortall ſinnes, and diſtraction of ſpiritt: the ſecond, to deſire the good of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as our owne, for whome God hath ſo much endured, and to aſsiſt him corporally and ſpiritually in our prayers, praying for our freindes, and ennemies, and for all thoſe whome God will haue prayed for: the third, is to deſire with a firme reſolution to imitate the life of IESVS CHRIST in his conuerſation, as well in body as ſpiritt, and to demaund of God that he will vnite him to his ſonne, and that nothing may be found in his bowels but IESVS CHRIST crucified, demaunding alſo the vertues that may in anyſort make vs like vnto IESVS CHRIST, as pouerty, humility, and ſimplicity, for in this manner exerciſing our ſelues in theſe vertues, we attaine a true and feruent deſire, and a true thirſt of the loue of our Saulour IESVS CHRIST, and it wilbe no paine or trouble vnto vs to be exerciſed in them, therbie to obtaine the good which wee deſire.</p>
                  <p>The glorious Father S. Francis, aſcended to this degree, when with a feruent and perſeuerant deſire, demaunding and finding his deare and beloued Lord, the Euangelicall perfection, and the Apoſtolicall life were reuealed vnto him, and as if he had thenceforward began, he couered himſelfe with one only garment ſhaped in forme of a croſſe, deſiring no other thing then IESVS CHRIST crucified, eſteeming himſelfe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſatisfied with pouerty, humility, and miſpriſe, to imitate his Sauiour I. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe third degree, is Satiety, when the ſoule commeth to loath terreſtriall thinges, richeſſe, honoures, yea the repoſe of his owne life, reſpecting all as nought, conceauing a dislike to ſee, or ſpeake of any worldlie matters, for whereas the ſoule doeth loue &amp; deſire only God, and findeth no repoſe but in him, hauing experience that the creatures hinder his ſeruice, though louing them vnder pretext of deuotion, they all neuertheles ſeeme diſpleaſing, and withall kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing that all humane affections and motions, all liberall artes &amp; ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all ſubtility of ſpirittes, all exquiſite theologie, and other curious ſciences, cannot giue peace nor ſatiate our hart, if they be vſed with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, and that only the diuine loue can performe the ſame in an humble hart, and mortified in his proper deſires and opinions, which will not be ſurpriſed more or leſſe, in any other thing, nor affecteth other power or knowledge, then how to loue his God, and how to ridde himſelfe of all vaine cogitations, and of his proper complacence and curioſity to

comprehend lofty and ſecrett matters, and to proceed in a ſingularitie of life and exerciſes: the property of this eſtate, is to ſupport the tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the terrours and deceiptes of the deuils becauſe our ſoule reſiſteth<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> not fleſh and bloud only, but the ſpirittes and powers of darcknes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting all other creatures, yea himſelfe, and poſſeſsing God alone in his only deſire. Our ſoule hath an other property, not only ſeeking &amp; thenceforward finding her beloued in creatures, by meditations and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, framed by the vnderſtanding, but often, without attending and knocking att the dote, the feruent deſires &amp; enflamed ſighes which ſhe breatheth out for her loue, conducteth her in, and then ſhe conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with and freely heareth her God, becauſe ſhe incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie arriueth to that eſtate, wherof our Lord IESVS CHRIST ſpake: I call you no<note place="margin">Ioan. 15.</note> longer ſeruantes, but freindes: ſuch are the effects of feruent loues that tranſport the ſoule into God, to make her one ſpiritt with him and one will, and as this loue is ſupernaturall and diuine, incomparablie of more efficacie then the naturall, it doth conſequentlie with a faſtened knott and bond of charity, conioyne the ſpiritt with God: So that we may ſay, in this eſtate ſuch a loue worcketh three effectes or offices; The firſt, to depriue the ſoule of all kind and quality of loue, except the loue of God, that ſhe may no more be diſioyned from him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formablie<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> to thoſe wordes of the Apoſtle ſainct Paul: No man can hereafter ſeparate vs from the charity and loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. The ſecond is, to giue no place to idlenes, for as ſaith the moral ſainct Gregory. He that is idle loueth not, and therfore his worck is to labour with an appetite ſweet and ſauourous in God, and to run vnto him withall his hart, as to his ſoueraigne Good, and to keep his ſpiritt ſetled and combined in him, continually enflaming his deſires to a cruell and continuall warre, vpon ſuch diſcord, that can neuer haue peace with the cares, diſordinate paſsions, and naturall deſires, which labour to ſatiate him in other places, wheras this loue endeauoureth att leaſt to keep him alwayes concerning the memorie and the deſires, being ſeparated from all terreſtriall cares and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſations, with the feare of the ſtaine which veniall diſorders lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues in the ſoule, and the impediment which they procure to the continuall amourous affection of God, which cauſeth the ſoule eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to loue and deſire ſolitude, and to be ſequeſtred from all creatures; for as the Adamant draweth iron vnto it, ſo God, being loued, draueth vnto him the louer into a ſolitarie place, and ſeque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth him from humane conuerſation, that he may taſt diuine. The third office whence this ſecond proceedeth, is that this loue neuer ceaſſeth to growe no otherwiſe then fire, which hauing matter, neuer faileth to encreaſe. As then our Lord I.

<pb n="413" facs="tcp:27206:229"/>

                  <p>It is eaſie to be collected in diuers places out of the Legend, rule and life of S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis, how much this degree of loue and perfection made him alwayes ioyfull, and content in his pouerty: it there appeareth how much he abhorred and ſhunned the honours and contentments of the world, and with what vnion of ſpiritt he conceaued taſt and ſatisfaction in prayer; For this occaſion he would that his Religious ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ioyfull exteriourly and interiourly, as men contented in the true graces which they receaued of the mercie of God; this ſatiety which he had in God, hindered him from deſiring ſciences and honours for his Religion, as the greedy of this world deſire and procure, but he would that only the pouerty, and humility of his Lord I.

The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father knew that he had attayned this degree of vnitiue loue, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall memory, and diuine co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, which he had without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, as well in the Monaſteries as in hermitages, alone and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, were he employed in the doctrine of ſaluation of ſoules, or in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: And it was euen apparant that the holy Father S. Francis had obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this degree of perfection, in the conuerſion of his ſences, powers, and inclinations into God: for he ſeemed to be retourned into the ſtate of innocencie, ſo much were his interiour powers ſubmitted to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and domination of the ſoule, which was ſo perfectly vnited vnto her God in the light and frequent reuelations which ſhe receaued of the diuine preſence, whence proceeded that he gloryed in his labours, and in merueillous aſſeurance of his ſaluation, which was by ſpeciall diuine grace reuealed vnto him.</p>

                  <p>THe eſtate of perfection called <hi>Tranquility,</hi> is in the ſixt degree where there is ſuch peace and contentment, that the ſoule li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth as it were in ſilence and repoſe as in a sleepy slumber on the breſt of God, ſo that ſhe may ſay with S. Paul: that ſhe no more liueth in herſelfe, but that IESVS CHRIST liueth and raigneth in her. But three thinges ſhould preceed this life ſo ſinguler, this ſanctity and conuerſation with God, this perfect charity towardes God and our neighbour, this ſeeling of the diuine familiarity; Firſt, a perfect mortification in worckes and affaires of the world, in ſuch ſort that the ſoule for her owne reſpect haue no contentment in any creature what ſoeuer, and leſſe in her ſelfe, but onlie in her Creatour; The ſecond, that ſhe be diſtracted from all ſpirituall conſolations, wherin ſhe taketh comfort and reioyceth for her owne repoſe and taſt: becauſe often times in the ſpirittes euen of them that vtteirle ſhunne ſpirituall thinges, doe grow great affections and ſpirituall delectations, wherin they finde conſolations
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:27206:232"/>
for themſelues, but God ſeldome, or neuer: and ſo they ſhutt the gate to the true light, and this happeneth becauſe they propoſe not God for the end of their exerciſes purelie and without meane of any creature. Now this ſincere intention and renunciation, as it is far more perfect, ſo is it much more difficult then the former: therfore alſo the ſoule that doubteth therof holdeth her ſelfe abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely in the hand of God, as well for matters of the world as of the body &amp; ſoule. The third is, that with an aſsiduous dillige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſhe procureth to conuert her ſelfe free and peaceable into this moſt pure and moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple good, which is God, remitting her ſpiritt into him not in part, but abſolutely conſidering God, &amp; enioying him as it pleaſeth him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate himſelfe vnto her in this life, for the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie &amp; diuine prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiues, by which we call him with diuers names, Almighty God, moſt wiſe, moſt good, moſt iuſt. For ſo much as the holy ſcripture attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto him theſe names and qualities, for the diuers effects which he worcketh in his creatures; wherby we come to the knowledge of him, for the diuine eſſence exceedeth all titles, all tearmes and imaginations of our vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding: and when the ſoule cometh to contemplate God in the ſaid ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, ſhe attayneth the quiet and peaceable eſtate of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though it be not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall but for a very ſhort time in regard of the infirmity and weight of the mortallity wherin ſhe liueth. The property of this eſtate is, that the ſoule be inſtructed &amp; addreſſed towardes God, in all her actions &amp; cogitations, remote from the way of humane prude<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, conſidering that God is the guide and maſter of euery eſtate of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perfection, and that he alone knoweth the neceſsities, the capacity, &amp; the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tions of the ſpirit of man, and therfore he alone can conduct &amp; guide vs in the moſt commodious and moſt certaine way.

In this Chapter, it was reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto S.

<pb n="421" facs="tcp:27206:233"/>
were choſen for Prouincials, S. Francis applyed himſelfe to obey the holy will of God. And becauſe the rage of the Mores was ſpred ouer three partes of the world, Aſia, Africa, and Europe; he reſolued to ſend his Religious into thoſe partes to preach the truth of the faith of IESVS CHRIST, to reduce the Pagans from their damnable errours: And to make a beginning, he choſe Aſia for himſelfe, whither he went with ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of his Brethren, and preached to the Soldan and the Mores of his kingdome. He ſent Brother Giles into Africa with Religious of like feruour and deuotion; who thincking to preach to the Mores; were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by Chriſtians and very vnwillingly brought back into Italy. He ſent ſix Italian Religious of very perfect life, into Spaine, where the Emperour Miramolin of Marocco perſecuted the Chriſtians. The ſaid Religious were, Brother Vital, Brother Berard, Brother Peter, Brother Adiutus, Brother Accurſus, and Brother Otto: of whome, the firſt, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vital, was by the holy Father conſtituted their ſuperiour, Brother Berard was an excellent preacher in the Arabian tongue; Brother Otto, was a Preiſt, Brother Adiutus and Brother Accurſus were lay Brethren, (the rule ſo tearming the Religious that keep not the quiet.) Now ſainct Francis hauing called them, ſaid: My children, God hath commanded me to ſend you to preach the holy faith vnto the Mores and to impugne the ſect of Mahomet: and therfore my freindes, hold your ſelues ready to execute his holy will in ſuch ſort as you ſhall ſee cauſe. Goe yee I ſay, my beloued ioyfully preparing your ſoules to the crowne which it ſhall pleaſe his diuine Maieſty to beſtow vpon you: performing his holy will according as you ſhall feele your ſelues inſpired. They as obedient children, only bended their heades, and croſſed their armes, expecting his holy benediction: but the holy Father firſt made them this exhortation: My deere children, I haue certaine wordes to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer you, that you may the better effect this commandement of God, to his glorie and the ſaluation of your ſoules. Be yee carefull to keepe<note place="margin">Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious which he ſent to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.</note> peace among your ſelues, and be not Brothers ſo much in habitt and profeſsion, as in ſpiritt and will. Next, haue ſpeciall care to fly enuie, which was the firſt cauſe of our damnation; ſupport with patience, and be ioyfull in perſecutions, and humble before God and men, and by this meane, you ſhall obtaine victorie againſt your ennemis viſible and inuiſible. Be yee mindefull to imitate with all your power, our Lord IESVS CHRIST, and to follow him in the ſtricteſt manner you can in all the three vowes: in obedience, obeying your ſuperiour, as he one earth obeyed his paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes: in pouerty, liuing therin as he did, for he would be borne, liue, and dye poore, and did alwayes preach pouerty to teach vs the ſame: and in chaſtity, liuing and perſiſting chaſt, not only in bodie, but euen in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:

ſith our Lord ſo muchloued this vertue, that he would be borne of a virgin, and preſently after his Natiuity, would haue for his firſt fruites, the holie Virgin Innocentes: and being on the Croſſe, he would dye betwene two virgins, his Bleſſed Mother, and S. Iohn the Euangeliſt. Caſt all your cogitations and hopes in God, and he will aſsiſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you. Carry with you the rule and the Breuiary, and ſay the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine office the moſt deuoutly you can: Lett Brother Vital be your ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, and therfore obey him entierly; but aboue all, be mindefull to meditate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually on the paſsion of our lord IESVS CHRIST: for that is it which ſhall make all incommodities ſweet vnto you, and all trauell pleaſing in this long iorney into Spaine which you are to attempt, and in the conuerſation and commerce which yee are to haue with the Mores, the ennemies of their Creatour. Beleeue, I pray you, that there is nothing doth ſeparate you from me, but the glorie of God, and the ſaluation of ſoules, for, but for that I would neuer diſioyne you from me. And God knoweth the grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe and affliction which my hart feeleth for your departure, though in deed, your prompt obedience doth much comfort me, but it is neceſſarie that we preferre the will of our lord, before our owne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe good Religious began then out of loue to weep bitterlie, and affectionatelie recommended themſelues to his prayers, wherin next vnto God they repoſed more confidence then in any other thing, ſaying vnto him: Father ſend vs whither you ſhall pleaſe, we are ready to accompliſh what ſoeuer God by you ſhall command. But withall we beſeech you to remember, that we goe a mong moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell men, whoſe tongue is vnknowne vnto vs, as alſo are their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and behauiour: beſides we know them to be the ennemies of Chriſtians, deſiring nothing more then to drinck their bloud, and ours with ſo much more fury and paſsion, when they ſhall know we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to conuert their people; for accompliſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherof, we acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge our forces to be moſt infirme and our ſelues very inſufficient, if the mercy of God doe not by your prayers aſsiſt vs: and therfore we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending vs vnto them, demaund your holy benediction, that we may vndergoe this obedience to the honour of God and the ſaluation of our owne and the Infidels ſoules.

The poore Religious hauing heard the ſaid propoſition, with extreme ſorowfull and ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſighes, that ſufficiently diſcouered the bitternes that afflicted their ſpirit, they bowed downe their heades, calling God to witneſſe of the greife they had to leaue him ſo alone: but becauſe their obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto S.

The Martyrs then haſtened to death, with a courage and countenance very ioyfull and contented, as they that knew themſelues neere to the accompliſhment of what they ſo much deſired, and to encourage each other, they mutually ſaid: Behold brethren, behold how God doth benignely offer vnto vs, that which we haue ſo long deſired of him. We are att the port, lett vs ſeeke to arme vs well to endure this litle conflict; henceforward we ſhal no more feare the terrible tempeſtes of this world, nor the windes of the temptations of the deuill, nor the deceiptfull ſinging of the alluring Mermaides of our fleſh, the impious thenceforward ſhall haue no more power ouer this our feeble body, for we goe into a glorious country, to ſee againe our firſt originall, and to ſerue our Lord, whoſe ſeruice is to reigne: there ſhal we receaue recompenſe of our labours, after more then a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, more then the double, yea a thouſand times more then we deſerue.

Doe no longer abuſe my clemencie, who haue ſo long expected your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentnace, as alſo my holy Prophett, who, though you haue blaſphemed him, is ſo gracious, as he will not faile to pray to God for you. Now I ordaine and att this preſent pronounce, as a finall ſentence, either death by the moſt cruell tormentes that without any delay can be inuented: or my grace with all the honours and richeſſe that my beſt fauourites enioy. The glorious Martyrs verie conſtantly anſweared him, as they had att other times affirmed, that they nothing reſpected ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and temporall richeſſe, and much leſſe thoſe tormentes, nor death it ſelfe; and therfore would yeld themſelues to be diſpoſed att his pleaſure, conſidering that their bodies and ſoules were ſo firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded in the loue of their Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, that euery hower which they expected to meet him in Paradice, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them a thouſand yeares, knowing that there they ſhould liue eternally, without feare euer to be ſeparated: then they added: Our God is the ſoueraine good, and not your Mahomett, for who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, as alſo for all his adherentes, are prepared eternall tormentes, which they already experience, as you ſhall <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>one day, if you be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, yea without hope euer to gett out of hell, where you ſhall call and crye, but none ſhall anſweare you. There ſhall you repent in vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that you followed not our Counſaile which God ſendeth you: there ſhall you be in horrour, greife, ſorrow and eternall diſpaire which God hath prepared for them, whome att the terrible day of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he ſhall find to haue bin contrary to the true faith of his Sonne IESVS CHRIST, true God, and true man, there to liue in perpetuall tormentes, as they who are his, ſhall liue in perpetuall ioy. Then O king, thou ſhalt not eſcape his handes, though thou ſeeme now to haue ſome power, which is a ſinguler benefitt beſtowed on thee by God, to ſee and expect if thou wilt be conuerted vnto him; and happy art thou if thou canſt acknowledge it. The king already experiencing the force of the holy Ghoſt that ſpake in his ſeruauntes, remayned vtterly perplexed: Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles

                  <p>THe king Miramolin att that time was aduertiſed that the Arabians were entred into his kingdome, where they made hauock and deſtroyed the whole country: Vpon which occaſion he gathered his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to encounter them: and by the helpe of the ſaid Prince, and of manie gallant Portugall gentlemen, which he had with him, he defeited the Arabians, whom he chaced far away, and ſo pourſuing them, they came into a valley where they could finde no water either for themſelues or their horſes: ſo that for three dayes they knew not what to doe, being neere death with thirſt. And becauſe the earth ſeemed to be ſomewhat moiſt, they licked it with their tongues: comming to the hight of a mountaine, they burned and became outragious with thirſt without any redreſſe, and yet greater was their diſpaire when they found the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denes of the Country to be of greater extent then that which they had paſſed in drineſſe: but conſidering that when they ſhould retourne, they ſhould all dye with thirſt before they ſhould finde water, they knew not way to take.

But they perceauing how much the king was incenſed againſt them, for the iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which he pretended thoſe Religious had ſo often reiterated vpon him, they all quietly retyred into their houſes, where they carefully kept themſelues cloſe, not daring to appeare, for feare leaſt they might freele the effectes of the choler of the king; wherof in deed there was apparent reaſon: for withall, the Mores were ſo enraged againſt the Chriſtians, that they had a will to maſſacre them all, in reuenge of the iniury done to their ſect and to their Prophett Mahomett. Att night the ſaid noble man conuented before him the Religious, who came to his lodgeing very ioyfull, all manicled and enchained. But were it vpon neceſſary and vrgent affaire that he had, or would he take occaſion to deferre their condemnation, he was not then att home; wherfore they were deliuered to an Apoſtata More of our Religion, that had renounced Chriſtianity, to be carefully guarded; and very early in the next morning, they brought them againe to the lodgeing of the ſaid noble man, whome neither then did they finde, for they vnderſtood that he was out of the citty and the king alſo, and would not vere ſpeedily retourne; they then commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſainctes to priſon vnder ſtrong guard, who, albeit they were enchained, beaten, and exceedinglie tormented, had neuertheles their ſpeech alwayes free, which they ſpared not to employ for the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion vnto IESVS CHRIST, of thoſe that ſo ſtrictly kept and rudely entreated them, who in diſdaine therof, gaue them ſound buffettes ſpett in their faces, and abuſed them moſt outragiouslie.

It happened one day, that vpon ſome affaires of the Couent, ſhe priuately retired her ſelfe ſomewhat late, wherwith her husband was ſo vexed, that he cruelly beat and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her; for he tooke her by the haire, and pulled it almoſt all off, but this vertuous woman carefully gathered it together, and layd it neatly on her pillow as if ſhe meant to make them grow againe, then ſimplie layd her ſelfe to reſt, and the next morning early, ſhe ſent for S.

S.

The cooke one day telling him that there was nothinge to giue the Religious<note place="margin">A stream of raine did not wett a maid em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the ſeruice of the Frere Minors.</note> their dinner, he ſent him to a lady exceedingly affectionate vnto him, to demaund of her ſome Colewortes for the dinner of the Religious, aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing her that they alſo had nothinge to eat. This lady commanded her chamber maid, to gather ſome; but att the inſtant, there fell ſuch a ſtrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me of raine that the mayd refuſed to goe; which her miſtris perceauing, ſhe prepared, notwithſtanding the raine, to goe gather<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them her ſelfe, which her ſeruant ſeeing, ſhe preuented her miſtreſſe, and ſpeedily ran into the garden, to gather the Colewortes.

But his diuine maieſty hauing reuealed vnto me that you ſhall dye a martyr, I haue euer ſince, and ſtill ſhall, yeld you reuerence.

Hereat the Notary chaunged his choler into laughter, and deriding him went his way; but in ſhort time after, it was iuſtified.

according to the neceſsity of his audience that they all were ſatisfied: in reſpect wherof his ſermons were reputed for ſo many miracles: they that neuer heard him preach, were att deathes dore with deſire to heare him, but eſpeciallie the learned, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his eloquence, as of his exceeding ſubtility and viuacity of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt, wherwith he admirably gaue to althinges which he handled, their proper ſignification, valure, nomber and weight with a notable art. He alſo reprehended the great perſonnes of this world with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie and ſeuerity, that the moſt famous preachers trembled with feare when they heard him, and did admire how it was poſsible he could haue ſuch boldnes: many would withdraw themſelues as not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to heare ſuch open and manifeſt reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions, and thoſe that remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned couered their faces. Yet theſe reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſions were intermingled with a competent and iuſt quantitie of ſalt, which is the admirable vertue of diſcretion, according to opportunity of time, place, and perſonnes. For albeit his diſcourſe att the beginning ſeemed ſharpe, yet the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion was gracious, milde, and ſupportable to all, in ſuch ſort that without any ſcandall he terrified ſinners, comforted the weake, encouraged the puſillanimous, and made the moſt obſtinate to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

And this Sainct did not onlie aſsiſt the ſoules of the faithfull Chriſtians by preaching, but in diuers other manners, God alſo fauoured and furthered the ardent zeale which his ſeruant had of the ſaluation of ſoules, as when in the night he appeared vnto them, enforming them of their ſinnes, and admoniſhing them to goe to ſuch or ſuch a Confeſſour, telling them, how and by whome he was ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, which was a ſinguler remedie for manie ſinners, who through feare or ſhame durſt not confeſſe, for feare to manifeſt their enormous ſinnes.

Which being well vnderſtoode and conſidered by his Holineſſe, he ordayned a generall Chapter to be held att Rome, wherein himſelfe in perſon was Preſident. Now this chapter being aſſembled, S.

They more to ſatisfie him, then in hope to finde him, ſought him ſometime, and att length God permitted them to finde him, and deliuering him to his Father, the kinred were of opinion to haue him buryed: but his pittyfull mother, the ſiſter of S.

                  <p>Diuers perſons eating att table, fell into diſcourſe of the miracles of the ſainct, and after many relations, one of them recounted that of the glaſſe aforeſaid, exceedinglie admiring and wondring therat; an other of them that was a companion and ſcoffer doubting of this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,<note place="margin">An other ſeeing withered vigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branches to beare grapes in an inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and to yeld wine</note> ſaw withered branches of a vigne, wherof he tooke a handfull and in the other hand a glaſſe, ſaying: If Sainct Antony would make gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes to grow out of theſe branches, and that their iuyce and liquor would fill this glaſſe, I would hold it a miracle, and then would I beeleue the former miracle you recounted: Which he had no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſpoaken, but all the ſprigges of the branches which this ſcoffing fellow held, budded forth leaues, and then very faire grapes, which being cruſhed together filled the glaſſe with liquor, and by this meane the vertue of S.

                  <p>A child of Padua called Henry, hauing a ſwelling in his neck, vowed to the S. and was immediatly cured: but his mother that cauſed him to vow not regarding to fulfill it, the infirmity retourned, yet repenting and accompliſhing the vow, her ſonne was cured againe.</p>

And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he called him vnto him, and hauing demaunded what he was, and whence he came, Brother Bernard drew out of his boſome the

This being ſaid, he conducted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Bernard to his houſe, with ſuch ioy and contentment as if he had bin an Angell of heauen. A litle after, att his owne expences he built for him and his companions, a Couent without the cittie but very neere the walles as moſt commodious for them.

It is ſayd that this holy Father being dead and enterred, there iſſued out of his tombe an oyle of ſuch vertue as it cured many diſeaſes, and perſeuered till his body was tranſported to the great Couent neere to the ſaid citty.

                  <p>BRother Ambroſe was from his birth ſo beloued of the diuine maieſtie, that albeit he conuerſed among worldly men euen to his complet age, yet was he by a ſpeciall grace of God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes preſerued from vices and ſinnes: but being by his eternall maieſty induced to ſhunne the ſnares of the deuill, hauing, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST giuen all he had to the poore, he in the time of Sainct Francis became a Frere Minor; and hauing obtayned of God the grace of contemplation and Euangelicall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he withall his iuduſtry laboured, that the ſame might not<note place="margin">

He therfore much exerciſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in the vertue of holy obedience, which is more pleaſing to God then ſacrifices. In the moſt violent and extremeſt cold, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt naked, he trauelled for the neceſsities of the Religious, he continuallie employed himſelfe in prayer, dailie examining his conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, for the moſt part his reliefe was only bread and water with abondance of teares, and by ſuch like abſtinence, he mortified the concupiſcences of his fleſh, to be able with more puritie to offer vp his ſoule in ſacrifice vnto God. He was exceeding compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate vnto afflicted perſonnes, and with alacrity ſerued the ſicke, not only Religious, but the ſeculer alſo; If there wanted phiſike he demaunded it for the loue of God, as alſo all other thinges neceſſarie: he was very humble, and therfore deſirously laboured in the kitchen, waſhed the diſhes, ſwept the houſe, and very willingly buſied himſelfe in all other offices of humility. If by any word or act he had giuen occaſion of troubles to any one, he would preſently put a cord about his owne neck and ſo goe aske him pardon, though he endured iniuryes done to himſelfe as patiently as if no ſuch thinge had bin: he liued fifteene yeares in ſuch and the like exerciſes of vertue; and afterwardes in his death and ſince, God hath diſcouered how gratefull the life of this his ſeruant was vnto him: before his laſt ſicknes he reuealed the day of his death and the place, which he declared to one of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. He trauelled to Ciuitadochia, where being arriued, he fell ſick, and few dayes after the terme of his life being exſpired, one night att mattins he ſhewed ſuch an extraordinary ioyfull face, as if he had ſome viſion, that made him euen exteriourly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce.

Wherfore the Religious that attended him, demaunded if he had ſeene any Angell of heauen, or the holy Father Sainct Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis, he anſweared that he had not ſeene the holy Father S.

Being in thoſe ioyes, he aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his companions of the death of one deuoted vnto him which was reuealed vnto him, ſaying that William was already departed out of this world vnto almighty God, and that himſelfe ſhould follow him the ſame day betweene none and euenſonge, which came to paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe: for att the time foretold this holy Religious Ambroſe yelded his ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le into the handes of his Creatour.</p>

                  <p>THe nomber of miracles, by which our Lord would approue the life and ſanctity of his ſeruant, Brother Ambroſe; was ſuch, that Pope Gregory the ninth by an Apoſtolicall breuie commanded the Biſhop of Ciuitadochia, and the Priour of S. Iohn of the Order of S. Auguſtin to meet, and to examine the life and miracles of the S. and hauing peruſed them to approue them for autenticall. This Briefe was giuen att the Palace of Lateran, the 13. yeare of his Popedome, by vertue wherof the ſaid Prelates hauing made a moſt dilligent ſearch, they found that fourteene lame perſons had by the merittes of this ſeruant of God bin cured, as alſo foure deliuered of the falling ſickneſſe, one diſpoſſeſſed in his life time, and two after his death, ſix cured of mortall impoſtumes, and one of a fiſtula.

                  <head type="sub">THE XXXVI. CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>BRother Iuniperus was one of the firſt and moſt perfect diſciples of S. Francis: for he was ſo grounded in the firme and aſſured fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undations of humility, patience, contempt of the world and of himſelfe, that no tormenting temptations of the deuill, nor perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world could in any ſort remoue or deſioyne him from his eſtate of perfection, There was neuer any that ſaw him troubled or diſquieted, ſo couragiously did he ſupport all iniuryes of wordes or actions: Which brought him to ſuch miſpriſe of himſelfe, that many ſeeing him in ſuch poore apparance and ſo ill treated, not knowing his perfection, eſteemed him for a foole and ſenceleſſe: But S. Francis that knew him right well, reputing him in the nomber of the perfect, ſayd, that he ſhould be a good and true Frere Minor, that attayned the miſpriſe of the world and of himſelfe, ſo far foorth as had done Brother Iuniperus: and oftentimes conſidering his ſimplicities, the contempt of himſelfe, and patience in reprehenſions giuen him, he would ſay to the Religious preſent: My Brethren, I deſire, and would to God I had a great forreſt full of ſuch Iunipers. This worthy ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST oftentimes found new occaſions for exerciſe of his patience to be miſpriſed and reproached, yet without offending God, neuer ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be reputed a foole: as when he one time entred into the citty of Viterbium, hauing made a fardell of his habitt bound vp with his cord which he carryed on his ſhoulders and ſo went into the marckett place, where the children ſeeing him almoſt naked, vſed him as a foole, reuiled him with wordes, caſt ſtones att him, and berayed him with filth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had left theſe that thus tormented him, he went to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent, where the Religious ſeeing him in ſuch pittifull eſtate, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by him wherefore he had bin ſo handled, they were much ſcandalized att what he had don, and tooke it in very ill part, bitterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending him for it: ſome told him he deſerued to be cudgelled, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to be impriſonned, others, to be hanged, for the great ſcandall he had giuen to the people: but he accepted all theſe indignities with a very contented and ioyfull countenance, as matter much deſired of him: and in ſignification of the interiour contentment he conceaued, he tooke the fore part of his habitt, and beholding thoſe Religious that were moſt offended with his fact, and rebuked him for it, ſayd vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, My freindes, fill this I pray you with theſe iewels: doe ſo, feare not, for I receaue them as precious ſtones and iewels that cannot be ſufficiently

eſteemed. So called he the affrontes and iniuries done vnto him precious ſtones and of notable value with God.</p>
                  <p>An other time being in the citty of Spoletum, he vnderſtood that the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was a feaſt to be ſolemniſed att Aſsiſium, whither would repaire from moſt parts of the world; &amp; nott minding too looſe the gaine he hoped to make there, he determined to goe to the feaſt in the faſhion aforeſaid, and being in the citty, he went, expresly to be ſeene and the more to be meſpriſed of the people, into the principall ſtreetes: which was preſently related to his Brethren, as he well expected. Wherfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the monaſtery, they all chardged him with notable iniuryes, calling him foole, and worthy to be layd in irons, for diſhonouring their houſe and Religion: all concluding that he deſerued a great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: Wherevpon, the Guardian, hauing before all the company gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him a rough and rude chapter, ſayd vnto him: O miſerable wretch! what pennance can I impoſe on thee correſpondent and worthy the exceſſe of thy notorious fact: Herevnto Brother Iuniperus very humbly auſweared: Father the correction you ſhould giue me is, to permitt me to retourne in the ſame manner I came, and the ſame way.

                  <p>BRother Iuniperus being ſent to Rome there to remayne, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re the reputation of his vertues liued, ſome that were deere frein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des to him and deuoted to the Order, vnderſtanding therof, went out of the citty to meet him, ſo to entertayne him curteously and to honour him. But this holy Religious ſeeing them comming, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the occaſion, which he extremely deteſted and ſhunned, he was att the firſt apprehenſion exceedingly troubled to reſolue on ſome meane to auoyd that honour. Att le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ght after he had ſome time diſcourſed in his ſpiritt of this ſubiect, ſtill goeing on his way, he found children buſyed in this ſport following: they had layd a peice of wood croſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a wall, att each end wherof was a boy ſitting aſtride, who by equall waight did alternatiuely mount each other vp and downe. Brother Iuniperus gott one of the places and began to ſport with the boy att the other end. His freindes and affectionat, comming there, did not yet forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re very reuerently to ſalute him, well knowing his faſhions and cuſtomes: but he perſiſting firme and conſtant in his purpoſe, would
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:27206:302"/>
not ſeeme to ſee or heare them, ſo atttentiue did he appeare in that ſport; and ſo long he continued and ſo reſolutely, that try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their patience, he enforced them att laſt to retourne home much diſcontented and diſedifyed att the inciuillytie and folly of their freind; and afterwardes he ſecrecretly slipt into his Couent, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ioyfull in hauing ſo auoyded the vaineglory of that worldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement.</p>
                  <p>An other time he hauing bin againſt his will commanded to goe to the houſe of a gentleman that deſired much to diſcourſe particulerly with him, he was thervnto conſtrayned by obedience: but by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer meanes the gentleman could deuiſe to occaſion him to diſcourſe, he could not wreſt ſo much as one good word from him. Yet ſuppoſing him to be weary or diſtempered with ſome indiſpoſition, he for that night conducted him into a chamber very commodiously furniſhed for his repoſe: but very early the next morning, without ſpeaking a word to any perſon he departed, leauing the bed and other furniture diſorderly and confuſedly heaped together, to be eſteemed a foole. Which the gentleman hauing ſeene, he was exceedingly confounded and ſcandelized att this Religious, that thus diſgraced him: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned therof to the other Religious, who exceedingly checked him for it. And then in their preſence he reprehended himſelfe, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing that he did not only deſerue to be rebuked, but alſo to be ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>Brother Iuniperus diſcourſing one time with ſome Religious tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching death, one of them ſaid: God graunt, me the grace to dye in ſome Couent of the Order, in the company of my Brethren, that my ſoule may be comforted, and aſsiſted by their prayers, and that my body may be buryed with other Religious. Herevpon Brother Iuniperus tooke occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſpeech ſaying; &amp; I would that at the houre of my death my body might be ſo loathſome and ſtinking, that no Religious would aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to come neere it: but that they would therfore caſt me into ſome priuie or ſmoke, and there leaue me as moſt abhominable: and afterwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des being dead would not aforde me any buryall, but that foules might deuour my body.</p>
                  <p>The humility of this holy Religious was ſo admirable, as alſo his deſire to be miſpriſed for the loue of IESS CHRIST, that he could neuer eſteeme himſelfe in any ſort ſufficiently burdened with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proches, iniuryes, vilainies, and infamies, in his life and in his death.

                  <p>BRother Giles, Brother Ruffinus, Brother Simon, and Brother Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niperus, being on time together in ſpirituall conference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation, Brother Giles ſayd to the reſt: My Brethren, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you tell me, how you arme your ſelues againſt the temptations of ſenſuality. Br. Simon of Aſsium anſweared: I conſider the loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of this ſinne, &amp; how deteſtable it is, not only in the preſence of God, but euen before men, who though impious, yet ſeeke to conceale and couer themſelues from being ſeene in the exerciſe of ſuch a filthy act. This conſideration procureth in me a diſpleaſure and deteſtation of this ſinne, and deliuereth me of the temptation. Then Brother Ruffinus ſpake as thus: For my part, when I am tempted with that ſinne, I fall on both my knees vpon the ground, I implore the aſsiſtance of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine clemencie, and of the glorious Virgin Mother, and ſo continue in prayer till I feele my ſelfe freed. Brother Iuniperus then ſpake to this purpoſe: When I perceaue ſuch diueliſh temptations are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to my ſenſes forcibly to aſſault me, I inſtanly ſhut the gates of my hart, whereto I conſtitue for ſeuere guardes, holy meditations and pious deſires, for ſecurity of the caſtell wherin reſideth the ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le: and when their ennemies make their approches to giue an aſſault to that place, I, that command in that fortereſſe, cry to them from within: Goe your wayes, gett yee gone, the place is poſſeſſed for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; yee are diſcouered, I am fortified with whatſoeuer is neceſſary to giue you repulſe: In this manner doe I euer preſerue my fortereſſe from being ſurpriſed by ſuch baſe companions, who by their entry would vtterly ruinate me: or att leaſt it would be very difficult for me to expell them, for att the inſtant that I perceaue them ready to aſſault me, without permitting them to lay their ſiege, I enforce them to retire with ſhame enough. Which Brother Giles vnderſtanding he tourned to his companions, and ſayd: Brethren, I am of Brother Iuniperus opinion, &amp; reſolue he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforward to make vſe of his ſtratageme of warre; for it is moſt certaine; conſidering that in this ſinne the ſecureſt fight is to fly; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the traiterous appetite which is within the fleſh, findeth ſuch a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge concurrence of aſsiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the exteriour ſences by an army rayſed

But the man, more poſſeſſed with deſpight then with the loſſe, would heare no propoſition: but we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t away exceedingly ſcandalized att the Religious, of whome he bruted many lyes through the ſtreetes, and very ſeriously and vehemently threatned them.

                  <p>THis holy Religious was ſo compaſsionate of the poore, that when he mett any poorely cloathed, he would rip off part of his habitt and giue him: and becauſe he did thus often, and retourned to the Couent halfe naked, his Guardian comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him vpon obedience no more to giue his habitt nor part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. After this commandement meeting a poore wretched creature that asked an almoſe of him: he, moued with compaſsion, ſayd: I haue nothing to giue thee but this habitt: but I am forbidden vpon obedience to giue it to any: yet if thou wilt take it from me, I promiſe thee I will not hinder nor reſiſt thee. The poore man vnderſtanding theſe wordes, tooke off his habitt, and left him almoſt naked: ſo retourning to his Couent, he told the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious that a poore man had taken his habitt from him: for which his Guardian knew not what to ſay vnto him. Now the thirſt of charitable worckes being vnquencheable in the ſeruante of God, this thirſt of pittie and compaſsion ſo encreaſed in Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iuniperus, that he did not only giue to the poore his habittes: but alſo, the bookes, the orname<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the altare, &amp; the cloakes of his Brethren when he could gett them, and that occaſion was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented: therfore when the Religious ſaw any poore demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding almoſe of Brother Iuniperus, they would hide whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was neceſſarie vnto them. It happened vpon one Chriſtmas day in the Couent of Aſsiſium, that the Sacriſtine goeing to eat, prayed Brother Iuniperus in the meane while to haue ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re of the altare: before which being in prayer, there came to him a poore old woman, demanding an almoſe for the loue of God: to whome Brother Iuniperus anſweared: Mother if you pleaſe to expect a litle, I will ſee if vpon this altare ſo richli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

adorned, there be any thing ſuperfluous that I may giue you: and perceiuing ſiluer frenge vpon the ornament of the altare, he tooke his knife and ripped it off, and gaue it to the poore woman, it ſeeming to him more neceſſarie to cloath a liuing member of IESVS CHRIST then an altare of ſtone: though in the one and the other the intention be pious for the honour of God: He wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her preſently to depart for feare that the Sacriſtin comming ſhould take it from her. Wherin he did very well, for the Sacriſtin remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring the quality of Brother Iuniperus had ſcarce leaſure to eat two bittes, but he retourned in great haſt to the Church; where looking carefullie if any thinge wanted, he miſſed the frenge of the ornament: which much diſquieting him, he complayned to Brother Iuniperus, who anſweared: Brother be not troubled, I haue giuen it to a poore woman that was in extreme neceſsity. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſtine knowing that there was no meane to recouer it, went to complaine to the Generall, who then was Brother Iohn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, a very deuout Religious: who anſweared him, that the fault was his owne, ſith knowing the nature of Brother Iuniperus, he had left him to haue care of the altare: Yet intended to reprehend him, ſo to preuent the like an other time.

Now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had bin thus humbled, he went into the citty to ſeeke ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me remedie for his Generall: and it being late before he went foorth, att his retourne to the Couent it was night, and the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall was retired to his cell to repoſe. But Brother Iuniperus omitted not to goe and knock, praying him to ariſe and take the medicine he had brought him: and though the Generall diuers times with rude and ſharpe wordes reiected him, he neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles ſo long perſeuered, that his Generall att length ouerco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me by his charity, was enforced to open his dore and to take a pottage that he had brought him for phiſicke, which preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured him.</p>

                  <p>THis great ſeruant of God was exceedinglie afflicted and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the deuilles, according to their ancient cuſtome to aſſault and torment the humble, more then all other men, as thoſe whome they know to be moſt pleaſing vnto almighty God. And albeit we find not recorded the ſecrett and particuler temptations of this holy Religious; yet we cannot doubt but that he hath had exceeding great, ſith the deuilles for no other cauſe feared him, but in regard that he often vanquiſhed them: beſides it being manifeſtlie ſeene that he could neuer be wearied with iniuryes, the more eaſily by his patience to ſuppreſſe the pride and arrogancie of the deuill. Yet we obſerue a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible temptation which the deuill weaued againſt him, which was ſuch as brought him euen to the gallowes ready to be hanged, hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly bin cruelly tormented: wherby may be coniectured what his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temptations were. The matter was thus: Brother Iuniperus being to goe to a caſtell where there dwelt a noble man very euill minded in regard of his cruelties, called Nicolas, who warred againſt the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Viterbium, the deuill transformed into the ſhape of a man, went to this noble man, and hauing drawen him a part as to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnto him ſome ſecrett of importance, ſayd vnto him: My Lord I come to you as your ſeruant and friend to diſcouer vnto you that your ennemies of Viterbium haue concluded and determined your death in

this place and to fier it, that none of your people eſcape: and to this effect, they haue plotted with a man and committed the chardge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, who is already in the way to attempt it. He is diſguiſed in this manner: his habitt is very baſe and contemptible, all tome, on his head he hath a capuce of diuers pieces and patches. Therfore command him to be brought before you, and you ſhall finde about him a long aule, wherwith to ſtabbe you, and a fier ſtone with maches to fier this caſtell. Which hauing vttered, he was no more ſeene by the noble man, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe cogitation was only vppon this aduertiſement, that did extremely trouble him, as hauing bin deliuered him by ſo excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect an Oratour: and he was therwith ſo terrified that he did ſhake and tremble with the feare. He foorthwith aduertiſed the guardes of his caſtell and others whome he ſent forth with charge if they found any ſuch and ſo attired, to apprehend him and warily to bring him to him. Now Brother Iuniperus according to the ſpeciall leaue he had, went alone, and in his way mett with yong idle companions, that as birdes wondred him and pulled him by the capuce, wherof they ſtill toare of ſome piece, ſo that by ſuch entreaty and his owne often gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſome litle piece to the poore, entring into the caſtell one would haue taken him neither for Religious nor lay perſon: and being know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne by the deſcription giuen of him, the guardes layd hold of him, and brought him before the noble man, who cauſed him to be ſearched, where was found about him the aule wherwith he ſowed his ſanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and a fier ſteele, to ſtrict fier, when he was ſome time in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes in prayer. Being then found with thoſe inſtrumentes fitt to execute the practiſe wherof he was accuſed, they began to torment him, to enforce him to confeſſe who ſent him, and what he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to doe: conſidering withall the whole deſcription of the tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor was approued and confirmed in him. Firſt then his head was bound with groſſe cordes faſtened with two cudgels, in ſuch ſort as they forced and ſtrayned the naturall diſpoſition of the bones (this extreme torment ſo wrought, that during the reſt of his life he had neuer more the head ach) after that he had giuen him infinite ſtrappadoes. Being demaunded who he was, he anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he was the greateſt ſinner in the world, and being asked if he came not thither to betray the caſtell, he anſweared that he was the greateſt traytor that was, being examined if he had not promiſed and reſolued to kill the Lord of the caſtell: he anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he ſhould doe wroſe, if God would permitt and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him.

Now as all the people flocked together to ſee him trayned through the dirt, and conſequently to be hanged as a traytor, one of the miniſters of iuſtice, went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continently to the Couent of the Frere Minors of the ſame Citty, and prayed the Guardian to haſten inſtantly for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe and comfort of the ſoule of a miſerable malefactour that was conducted to his execution and death, yet neuertheles hath no appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of death, nor hath care or ſpeaketh att all of confeſsion. The Guardian ſpeedily haſtened to the place of execution, where finding &amp; knowing Brother Iuniperus, he began to weepe, and would haue put of his habitt to couer him, but he anſweared, that it was better to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a poore liuing creature, then one dead, ſo litle was this holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious troubled with the tormentes paſt, the ignominie preſent, and the apprehenſion of death att hand: but he appeared ſo cheerfull and ſo pleaſant as if he had bin in a faire garden and plott of roſes, gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liflowers and other beautifull and ſweet flowers. Which the Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian admiring, prayed the officers of iuſtice there preſent, to ſuſpend the execution of this criminell, till he had ſpoken with their Lord whoſe fauour he would craue in behalfe of him that he knew to be innocent, which they willingly promiſed. Comming then to the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, he thus ſpake vnto him: Know my Lord, the man whome you haue condemned to ſo ignominious a death, is one of the moſt perfect Religious of our Order of Frere Minors, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Brother Iuniperus. This extremely vexed this noble man, who by reputation knew Brother Iuniperus, hauing heard of his meruailes: wherfore he accompanied the Guardian, euen to the place of the citty where he was, and there fell on his knees before him, and bitterly weeping, beſought him before all the people to pardon him. The vertuous Religious did not only pardon him, but gaue him thanckes for being occaſion of his meritt towardes God, yea and thenceforwd he tooke it ſo gratefully, that remayning in the Couent of the ſaid place to cure and eaſe the torments he had endured, many hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable perſonnes preſenting him many ſmall commodities, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſent the moſt worthie and excellent to the Earle, affirming that he did not acknowledge himſelfe more obliged to any man in the world then to him, becauſe he had not found any that had more accompliſhed his deſires then he. The earle, on the contrary ſaid, that he

knew therby that God would ſhortly end his enormous ſinnes, and that he ſhould not liue long, ſith he had ſo vnworthely tormented an innocent and ſo ſainct-like a man, though he knew him not, and that God would puniſh him for it. Wherin he was not deceaued, for a litle after he was slaine by his ennemies. Now this ſinguler fact may notifie vnto vs the patience of Brother Iuniperus, the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of the vertues which God diſcouered in him, with what faith, hope, humility and fortitude he was armed, and the croſſe which he carryed in himſelfe, and wherin only he glorified, and the ſmall gaine the deuill gott of him in this combatt, where he was ſubdued by the patience of Brother Iuniperus, more like to that of IESVS CHRIST, then to that of Iob. Wherein appeareth how truly the holy Doctors affirme, that almighty God is ſuch a louer of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt and our glory, which is purchaced by labour in his ſeruice, that he denyeth it onlie to thoſe who make themſelues incapable to receaue it.</p>

The Iudge moued with ſuch wordes, and admiring the Charity of this Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, pardoned for that time the malefactor. This holy Father being in prayer in a ſolitary place, many birdes came ouer him and by their ſinging made ſo great a noyſe, as they diſtracted him. Wherfore he commanded them in the name of God to depart, and they redily obeyed. The houre of death of this worthy ſeruant of God being att length come, and his yeares being accompliſhed, he yelded his ſoule to his Creatour, adorned with vertues and ſanctity. He was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in the Couent of Spoletum where his notable merittes haue bin manifeſted, he hauing obtayned many graces of God, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and benefitt of infinitie perſonnes that haue implored him as their interceſſour.</p>

But how much he was pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the behalfe of others, as charity commanded him, ſo much was he ſeuere and rigorous to himſelfe, weakening him ſelfe by continuall faſtes, and wearing a groſſe hairecloth, hauing beſides for a long time worne a coat of maile the more to torment his fleſh. His perſeueran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce in rigour of life was, ſuch that being an hundred yeares old he did eat but once a day, except the ſondayes and principall feaſtes of the yeare, ſo that albeit his body grew old and decayed, he was neuettheles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes yong and firme in vertues.

He was wery dilligent in prayer, and had the grace of ſhedding many teares. And that he might the more commodiously apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to prayer, he made choice of a very litle cell, made of earth and boughes of trees ſeparate frome the others, wherin he ſpent moſt of his time (which was a thing in manner generall to the firſt Fathers of that time) and there was he often viſited diuinely: as alſo the glorious Virgin Mary appeared vnto him one time with her mother S.

Chriſtopher, deliuering many from death that were deſperatly ſick, reſtoring ſight to the blind, curing feiuers, goutes, fiſtulaes, and other infirmities, reſtoring ſpeech to the dumme, hearing to the deafe, and finally relieuing all that by his merittes inuocated almigthy God. But to auoyd prolixity I forbeare heare to deduce them, eſteeming the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged ſufficient to occaſion the faithfull to belieue the ſanctitye of this ſeruant of IESVS CHRIST. The miracle following ſhalbe for the incredulous only: A man called Ratier, being by chaunce neere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſepulcher of this S. and hearing his miracles related: I cannot belieue, ſaid he, that a man whome I haue ſeene in theſe dayes can worck miracles. Thoſe preſent hauing reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him, he would not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his errour, wherfore he deſerued to be chaſticed of God, as he was, thereby to make him know his temerity.

                  <head type="sub">THE LV. CHAPTER.</head>
                  <p>IT would be a matter ouer tedious both to read, and to write the liues of all the diſciples and companions of S. Francis, wherwith, as ſo many precious ſtones adorned with many graces and vertues, the ſaid holy Father began to build his Euangelicall religion: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring withall that we haue not ſuch authenticall relation of their liues &amp; miracles as is requiſite and neceſſary. In reſpect wherof we doe not make a particuler relation of each of them; but will recount ſomewhat of certaine of them who haue ſo ſpent their time, that albeit their fame be not equall to the aforenamed, yet are they not of leſſe ſanctity and glory before God. The firſt of whome is the glorious Br. Peter Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius the ſecond diſciple of S. Francis, and his firſt Vicar Generall, who was an eye witneſſe of many Myſteryes that almighty God communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto him, as in his life we haue recorded. This holy Religious being dead, God had already began by his interceſsion to worck many miracles, when the holy Father S. Francis hauing commanded him to forbeare the obtayning of ſuch miraculous graces from God, his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles ceaſſed, as hath bin amply diſcourſed in the hundredth chapter of the firſt booke, where is likewiſe related wherfore he was made Vicar Generall.</p>
                  <p>Brother Angelus of Rieta was the firſt knight that entred this religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and was one of the twelue firſt diſciples of S. Francis, and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in many worthy myſteries and miracles. The holy Father put from this good Religious an extreme feare which he had of the deuils, in ſuch ſort that he durſt not continue alone att his prayers by night: for he commanded him to goe about midnight to the toppe of a high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and there aloud to crye out theſe wordes: yee proud deuils, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ye all now to me, and doe the worſt you can: which hauing by due obedience performed, none of the deuils euer after came to annoy him, ſo that he was entierly freed of the ſayd feare. And being fully perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:27206:313"/>
in vertues and prayer, he paſſed from this life to God, and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed att Aſsiſium, with other companyons of S. Francis.</p>
                  <p>Br. William an Engliſhman, was admitted in the number of the firſt twelue Diſciples of S. Francis, in the place of Br. Iohn Chappell, that was an Apoſtata, and did hang himſelfe as Iudas had done. The mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought by this bleſſed Br. William in his ſepulcher, haue ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtified what he was: for almighty God by his merites there wrought ſo many, that he ſeemed to obſcure the glory of his Father S. Francis, by whome he was buryed: and therfore Br. Helie who then was Generall of the Order, went to his tombe, and commanded him by holy obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to forbeare worcking any more miracles.</p>
                  <p>Br. Moricke, who was firſt Religious of the Order of the Porte-Croix or Croſſe-bearers, was eminent vnder the diſcipline of the holy Father S. Francis, and was moſt famous for his admirable abſtinence, and for a long ſpace woare on his fleſh an iron ſhirt, did eate no bread, but only hearbes and rawe pulſe; he neuer woare coat, but the only habitt during his life, and att his death he left many ſignes of his ſanctity and perfect life.</p>
                  <p>Br. Benett of Arezzo was alſo perfect in all vertues. S. Francis ſent him to be Prouinciall att Antioch. There are ſtrange matters recounted of this Religious, which being difficult to be belieued, and not being ſatisfied by the teſtimony of the writer, I haue thought it beſt not to record them here, for feare that they appearing indeed doubtfully, the like iudgement ſhould be giuen of others here recorded that are moſt certaine and indubitable.</p>
                  <p>It ſhall therfore ſuffice, to know, that this bleſſed Father had the ſpiritt of propheſie, as they teſtifie who knew him: and that hauing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeuered in ſanctity of life, he repoſed in peace. He was buryed in Arezzo his owne country, whither, it is held that he brought from Babilon, one of the fingers of the holy Prophett Daniel.</p>
                  <p>Br. Peregrinus of Faleron was admitted to the religion of the holy Father S. Francis, who propheſied vnto him, that albeit he weere lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he ſhould notwithſtanding apply himſelfe to the actiue life, and his companion to the contemplatiue, and ſo it arriued, for he was a lay brother: for which humility, he obtayned of God an exceeding great perfection in vertues, and particulerly the grace of compunction and the loue of God; for whoſe ſake deſiring martyrdome, he went to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, where he viſited all the holy places, with ſuch deuotion, teares, embracinges and moſt tender louing kiſſes, that in thoſe places he ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our Sauiour as preſent. Br. Bernard Quintaualle affirmed of this Religious, that he was one of the moſt perfect of the world. And as he was by name a Stranger, ſo was he alſo in his life: for the loue of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:27206:314"/>
CHRIST was ſo burning in his hart, that he neuer permitted any other thing to reſt there: but alwayes walked and ſighed towardes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: thus did he aſcend from vertue to vertue, in ſuch ſort that he was exceedingly illuminated in his life, and in his death, by diuers miracles.</p>
                  <p>Br. Ricerio employed himſelfe in the contemplatiue life, according to the propheſie of S. Francis; which made him familier vnto him, and he inſtructed him in many diuine verities, he made him Prouinciall of the marquiſate of Ancona; many matters co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this holy Religious are recorded in the life of S. Francis.</p>
                  <p>Br. Auguſtin of Aſsiſium, Prouinciall of the land of Labour, commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called Naples, was a Religious of ſuch ſanctity, that he merited, not only to be companion in life and profeſsion with S. Francis, but alſo in his death and glory: for hauing in his laſt ſicknes already loſt his ſpeech, he ſaw the ſoule of S. Francis aſcend vnto heauen, which encouraged him to cry out: Stay holy Father, ſtay for me: and his ſoule foorthwith leauing his body, it accompanyed that of his bleſſed Father to eternall glory.</p>
                  <p>Br. Roger the diſciple of S. Francis, v as of ſuch ſanctity, that Pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorie the ninth approued him for a S. &amp; permitted commemoration to be made of him in the Coue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the Frere Minors of Tiuoly; but becauſe he was not canonized with the accuſtomed ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nities, the Religious ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer durſt keep his ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne feaſt. He was not canonized becauſe the exame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his miracles, appointed by the ſaid Pope, was neuer accompliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Brother Philippe the Long, was alſo diſciple of S. Francis. He was the firſt Confeſſour, Viſitour and Miniſter of the Religious of S. Clare. It is found recorded of this S. that an Angell purged his lippes, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them with a burning coale, as the Seraphin did to the Prophett<note place="margin">

                  <p>Br. Barbarus, Br. Iohn of S. Conſtantin, and Br. Bernard of Viridante, that were of the firſt companions of S. Francis, were exceeding emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in their vertuous and merueillous actions; as their worckes were written in the booke of life, ſo their ſoules for euer liue in glory, &amp; their bodyes are buryed in the Couent of S.

                  <p>Br.

                  <p>IT was the cuſtome of the firſt Fathers of this Order, to goe often in pilgrimage, not to ſeeke their more liberty, nor to ſatisfie their appetite with better cheere, but for the exerciſe of perfection, and to ſuffer hungar, thirſt, cold, heate, and the affi ontes which they often endured, as vnknowne in that new habitt, and ſo did they diſpoſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the incommodities of obedience, and were couragious: for they went barefoot, withone ſingle habit, without wallets, edifying themſelues in patience, and their neighbour in charitie. Now Brother Giles hauing gotten leaue of the holy Father S. Francis he went to viſitt the church of S. Iames of Compoſtella, in which voyage he did not ſo much as once ſatisfie his hungar, ſuch a deſire had he to feele in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the force of pouerty for the loue of IESVS CHRIST. Finding one day no meane to gett ſo much as bread (wherwith only he liued) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found in a barne certaine huskes of beanes left there after the threſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hing, he did eat them with great appetite, and after tooke his reſt in the ſame place. The next morning he aroſe very early, as cheerfull and well diſpoſed as if he had eaten the beſt and moſt delicate foode in the world. He was thus accuſtomed to ſuffer, being often in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtes and ſolitary places, which were more to his content then the conuerſation of the world, as leſſe ſubiect to diſtractions in his ſpirituall exerciſes, and more commodious for ſpending the night in watching and prayer. In this iorney meeting with a poore ſick creature full of ſoares, and not knowing what to giue him, he ript of his capuce and gaue it vnto him: but this charity enforced him to trauell twenty dayes bare-headed, till att laſt was giuen him cloth to make an other, and ſo did he walke with a habitt, according to the common faſhion of his Order, deformed, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tierly conformable to the charity of the goſpell. Being in Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardie, he was called by a man, of whome he thought to receaue a charitie, but comming to him, he tooke out a paire of dice, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded if he would play with him: So did the wretch flout att this good Religious, who went on bowing downe his head with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out replying a word. In this ſort he was often the obiect of laughter vnto the ſloathfull and idle companions, that made him their ſcorne, which he alwayes endured with patience correſpondent.

into Italy, it being neceſſary for him to liue vpon his labour as hauing no mony, he carryed water to paſſengers, for which ſeruice they gaue him bread, and remayning certaine dayes in the citty of Aſon, he employed himſelfe in the labour of his handes making baskettes and caſes of ozier, and ſuch litle conceates, wherwith he liued; and if he wanted either worck or matter, or knew not wherin to employ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, according to the diuers occaſions of the places where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

The holy Religious ſeeing there was no meane to goe foorth to ſeeke bread, ſayd to his companion: Brother lett vs make petition to almighty God that he will pleaſe in our neceſsity to ſend vs bread, ſith there is none but he that can heare and releiue vs. Then he recounted an hiſtory of certaine Religious, who wanting bread in the like neceſsity, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to him and were heard. Being moued by ſuch an example, they began on the euenning to pray with loud voice vnto almighty God, &amp; ſo perſeuered till the breake of the day following, when as God inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a good man of a neighbouring place, who ſeeing the ſnow ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, called to minde that he had ſeene att other times Hermites att S. Laurence, &amp; thought with himſelfe, that if then there were any there, they could not come foorth to ſeeke food; which mouing him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſsion he went out of his houſe with bread and wine, which he gaue to the Religious, and being retourned to his houſe, he aduertiſed his neighbours and friendes of the neceſsity of the ſaid ſeruantes of God, and ſo procured that they wanted not wherwith to liue the reſt of the lent, which happened to good purpoſe for them in regard of their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſsity. Br. Giles deſirous to acknowledge the great charity vſed vnto him by thoſe people, he ſaid to his companion: hitherto we haue prayed to God for our ſelues, to be relieued in our neceſsity: hece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward we ought to pray vnto him for our benefactors; ſo that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting night and day in theſe petitions, our Lord beſtowed ſuch graces

and fauours on the inhabitantes of that place, that neuer Frere Minor hauing bin formely ſeene there, many among them neuertheles being moued by the example and pious exhortations of the ſayd Religious, forlooke the vanity of this world and became Frere Minors; and ſuch as could not, ſerued God by prayers, and did penance in their owne houſes: and by this meane for corporall benefittes they gaue in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunge ſpirituall in double meſure.</p>

                  <p>THe holy Father S. Francis cordially loued Br. Giles for his great perfection in all vertues, and his promptitude in doeing well: and therfore did often obſerue him, and would ſay to his other Religious, that he was one of his knightes of the round table, ſo did he call the humble and deuout Religious. Now Br. Giles one day demaunded obedience of S. Francis to goe where he pleaſed, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne where he was: the holy Father anſweared him, your reſidence is prouided, goe where you will: whervpon hauing demaunded and receiued his benediction, he went and walked in this freedome fower whole dayes, but finding his ſpiritt much diſquieted, he retourned to S. Francis: Father (ſayd he) I beſeech you deſigne me a certaine place whither to goe, becauſe goeing according to my owne liberty I cannot haue my conſcience free: the S. ſent him to the Couent of Fabrian whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went barefoote with a very ragged habitt, though the ſeaſon were extreme cold. On the way he mett a paſſenger that ſayd vnto him: I would not goe ſo poorly cloathed in ſo cold a ſeaſon, were I therby to pourchace paradice: by which wordes the deuill ſo augmented the cold that he expected death therby: but he incontine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tlie called to minde that our lord IESVS CHRIST went barefoote and poorely cloathed through the world, and endured far more cold and other labours for our ſakes: theſe pious cogitations did in this ſort warme firſt his hart, and then all his body with a diuine heat: wherfore he began to praiſe God his ſweet lord, who had thus warmed him not with materiall fier, but by the only burning heatof his diuine loue. So Br. Giles remayned many yeares in the ſayd place, where one day weighing his ſinnes, he aſcended on a mountaine neere by, whither he carryed a yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Religious, whome he commanded, with a cord about his necke to lead him naked to the place where the other Religious were: and entring in this ſort before them, he began with teares to cry: Haue compaſsion and pitty of me miſerable and deteſtable ſinner: The Religious beholding him in

ſuch a gaſtly plight, began all to weep, and prayed him to putt on his habitt: but he anſweared, with bitter teares and extreme ſighes, that he was vnworthy to be a Frere Minor: Yet if you will that I take the habitt againe, ſaid he, I will, as an almoſe receaued of you, though I doe not deſerue it: and ſo he cloathed himſelfe and there remayned, labouring with his handes in making caskettes of ſtraw to couer or keep glaſſes, and litle baskettes which he and his companion carryed to the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour towne and villages, and in exchau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This good Religious retourning one day from the fieldes, hauing in his handes a reed and a hatchett, he paſt before a church, the Chappe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laine wherof ſeeing him called him hippocrite: which did ſo grieue and<note place="margin">Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Br.

A Religious finding him thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, demandindg the occaſion of his teares, he anſweared him: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am an hippocrite, as a Preiſt, did now inſtantly aſſure me. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious replied, poore man doeſt thou then belieue it to be true? Br. Giles anſweared that he belieued it becauſe he was a Prieſt that auouched the ſame, and he could not conceaue that a Prieſt would lie. The Religious replyed, Brother, be no longer diſquieted, for it may be thou art no hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, becauſe the opinion of men is moſt often farre from the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. Br. Giles with this reaſonnable anſweare was ſomewhat ſatisfied and comforted, ſaying that if he were not ſuch, it was by the pure grace of God.</p>
                  <p>Hearing one day relation of the fall of Br.

                  <p>This great ſeruant of God being one day out of the Couent, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued a letter and therby commaundement from his Generall to meet him att Aſsiſium whither he inſtantly tooke his iorney: his companion putting into his minde that it were good to retourne firſt to the Couent to aduertiſe the Religious therof, he anſweared: Brother, I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to goe to Aſsiſium and not to the Couent, ſo much did he yeld himſelfe to obedience, that his only cogitation was readily to obay.</p>
                  <p>The Guardian hauing commanded a Religious that was praying to goe to demaund almoſe: the Religious therat murmured exceedingly withhimſelfe, and in this diſtemper came to Br. Giles thus co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>playning:

                  <p>THis venerable Father continually afflicted his fleſh, keeping it ſubiect to the ſpiritt: Which he did to conſerue in his ſoule the ſplendour of chaſtity, &amp; therfore he accuſtomed to eat but once a day, and that litle and very late. He would ſay that our fleſh was like vnto a hogge that very greedily ran to the dirt and filth delighting himſelfe therin, or like the beetle that in all his life doth nothing but tumble and wallow himſelfe in loathſome filthines. He would alſo affirme our fleſh to be the moſt valliant ſoldier that our ennemy hath againſt vs: by which wordes and other like, he demonſtrated what an ennemy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe was to the peruerſe inclinations of his ſenſes, and what a friend to Angelicall chaſtity.</p>
                  <p>Being one day in the citty of Spoletum, he heard a voice as of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that called him: this voice being of the deuill, ſuggeſted into his heart ſuch a temptation, as he had neuer experienced a greater.

                  <p>A Religious Prieſt being exceedingly afflicted and tormented by the deuill with a cruell temptation of the fleſh and getting no remedy by abſtinences and prayers, he ſayd with himſelfe, if I could ſee Br.

Giles (or his Angell for him) appeared one night vnto him, with whoſe preſence the Religious being exceedingly comforted, he opened vnto him all his temptation, and demaunded of him ſome ayde and counſaile. Br. Giles ſayd vnto him, come hither brother, what would you doe to a dogge that would bite you? The Religious anſweared that he would cry att him and make him fly. Br.

This feare in this holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her was like to that of S. Paul when he ſayd: we carie this (diuine) trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earthen veſſels. Butt becauſe the certaine perill of the loſſe of an eternall and infinite treaſure, would cauſe a diffidence and deſpayre in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one by conſideration of his naturall infirmity, he added: we know that the preſeruation of the diuine treaſure conſiſteth in the vertue and power of God and not of vs. The ſayd Religious then tooke occaſion to comfort him, or rather the holy Ghoſt, for and by him with the ſaid ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of S.

Wherevpon ſainct Paul ſaid: Were it that my ſoule were in my body, or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated<note place="margin">2.

in the ſoule of Brother Giles confirme this verity: for after this viſion he was ſo often rapt in extaſie, that there is hardly found any other ſaint before or after him to haue exceeded him therin. It appeared by his exteriour actions what eſteeme he made therof: for he ſeldome or neuer went out of his cell, but employed himſelfe in faſtinges &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhunning all idle wordes, and all fruitleſſe conuerſation: and if ſuch diſcourſes were forcibly vſed in his preſence, and that any would nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des make him ſome relation to the preiudice of any other, he would hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nothing therof, affi ming that each one ought to be very wary and<note place="margin">Admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to extaſie in Bro.

And on the contrary when he heard ſpeake of God, he was preſently rapt into extaſie, and remayned inſenſible &amp; as dead, ſo that the fame of this ſublime and ſinguler grace being diuulged and made kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wne to all perſonnes, euen to the contry people and to children, when they mett him they would ſay, Paradice Brother Giles, and att the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and very place where he heard that ſweet and gracious word he would fall into extaſie: in ſuch ſort as if the Religious deſired to talke with him of God and to receaue his conſailes and doctrines, they muſt be wary not to ſpeake of the glory of the diuine viſion, leaſt that being rauiſhed in ſpiritt they were fruſtrared of their deſire. And becauſe he liued ſequeſtred from the other Religious, Brother Bernard therfore as zealous of his neighbours good reprehended him therin, calling him but halfe a man, as regarding only his owne good. But Brother Giles anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared, that it was more ſecure to content himſelfe with a litle then by attempting too much, to endanger the loſſe of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conſidering that vpon a very ſmall occaſion a great grace is often loſt: ſo that one muſt be wary att ſuch time not to looſe that in laughing, which is not purchaced but with much labour and weeping.</p>
                  <p>Being one day in ſpirituall conference with Brother Andrew and Brother Gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tian two Religious of pious life and his ſpirituall children, he told them that he was borne ſower times, firſt, out of his mothers woombe, ſecondly when he was baptiſed, thirdly when he entred into Religion, and fouerthly the day that IESVS CHRIST appeared vnto him, and manifeſted vnto him his glory. Wherto Brother Andrew anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared that it was true, but if he ſhould be in a forraine contry, where it ſhould be demaunded of him if he knew Brother Giles, he might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch that he knew thus much of him, that it was twenty foure yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res ſince he was borne, and that he had faith before he was borne, but had loſt it afterwardes: Brother Giles replyed that all this was true: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſayd he, before, I had not ſuch faith as I ought to haue: the which alſo God did take from me and gaue me a more cleare and perfect kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him and of his glory, and among many graces which I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued

Whervpon Brother An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew made him this demaund: Tell me Brother, if you haue not faith, what would you doe if you were Prieſt, and were ſolemnely to ſing <hi>Credo in vnum Deum?</hi> It ſeemeth you ſhould neceſſarily ſay: <hi>Cognoſco v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Deum patrem omnipotentem:</hi> and incontinently he was rapt in extaſie: all this he ſaid, not that he had ſimply no faith: but by reaſon of a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter light and illumination which God with apparant euidence had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him.</p>

                     <head>How Brother Giles was rapt in extaſie before Pope Gregory the ninth.</head>
                     <p>POpe Gregory the ninth being with his court remoued to Peruſia, and vnderſtanding that Brother Giles, of whome he had heard merueillous thinges, was neere thervnto, he ſent for him as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know him. Brother Giles came preſently to Peruſia. But being entred into the Pallace of the Pope he felt himſelfe interiourly moued with the ſpirituall ſweetnes which ordinarilie arriued him before his extaſie: wherfore conſidering that it was not conuenient he ſhould in that eſtate preſent himſelfe before his holineſſe, he ſent his companion to make his excuſe. But the Pope not admitting it would know why being within his Pallace he would not preſently come to him: ſo that his companion was enforced to ſay vnto him: Moſt holy Father, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Giles hath deferred to ſalute your holineſſe for no other cauſe, but that by ſignes ordinary vnto him, he foreſeeth that comming in your preſence he ſhall fall into extaſie. The Pope hereto replyed: I come to Peruſia more for this only reſpect then for any other thing: and therfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re bring him incontinently hither which was done, but as ſoone as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Giles had in great humility kiſſed the feet of the Pope, he ſcarcely began to ſpeake vnto him, but that he was rauiſhed in ſpiritt and remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned immoueable with his eyes fixed towardes heauen: which the Pope ſeeing, he ſayd: verily if thou die before me, I would ſeeke the knoledge of no other miracles to canonize thee. An other time the ſaid Pope goe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Couent of the Frere Minors of Peruſia to viſitt Brother Giles, the Religious ran preſently to his cell to aduertiſe him therof, but they found him in extaſie, which the Pope vnderſtanding, he went to his cell, accompanyed with many Cardinals and other noble men, who all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a long time beholding him, and to ſee if he would retourne to himſelfe. But ſeeing it, would not be in ſhort time, the Pope with his
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:27206:322"/>
company departed much admiring and troubled that he could not ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke with him as he deſired. He commanded that his extaſie being ended, he ſhould be told his holineſſe attended him to dine with him, which was done, and at dinner time this good Father went to the Pope, whoſe feet he moſt reuerently kiſſed, and was with al curteſie entertayned. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re was then with his holineſſe a gentleman that ſayd vnto him, that he had heard report of Br. Giles his gracious and ſweet ſinging, praying his holineſſe to cauſe him to ſing, therof to receaue ſome contentment and conſolation. The Pope as well in regard of his deuotion towardes him, as of his deſire to heare him prayſe God, ſaid vnto him: Sonne, I ſhould be glad you would comfort and reioyce vs in God, by ſome gracious and deuout ſong Br. Giles anſweared, doth it pleaſe your holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that I ſing? which hauing diuers times reiterated, he retyred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into a corner, and was preſently rapt in extaſie. The Pope &amp; tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe with him, deſirous to experience the force of that extaſie, they felt &amp; found him withour pulſe or heat. The Pope being exceedingly troubled that he had loſt the company and conuerſation of this holy Religious, ſharply reprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded the gentlema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that had perſuaded him to cauſe him to ſing. The time of ſupper being come, and Br.

Giles he ſaid vnto him: Becauſe the Order of the Frere Minors depe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth immediatly of vs, we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand thee vpon obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to retourne inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinently to thy ſelfe. The ſucceſſe was admirable, for att the very inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t this ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God that had bin entierly inſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſible &amp; as dead, ſtood vp right on his feet, and we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; fell on his knees before his holines, with deep humility acknowledging his fault. The Pope cauſing him to ariſe, took him by the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; ſpake vnto him: then Br. Giles, demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of him how he did; the Pope anſweared that tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ckes be to God he was well, Br. Giles added: Holy Father, you haue great need of the help of God in the great &amp; importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t affaires which you haue. For I ſuppoſe that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude &amp; occupatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the ſoule in exteriour matters, are of great labour. The Pope anſweared: My child thou ſayeſt true: therfore doe I pray thee to treat with almighty God for me, that by meane of his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce I may the more eaſily carry the weight of this burde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Br. Giles replyed that he would willingly doe it, and ſubmitted his neck to the yoke of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement of God: &amp; to that end inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly retired himſelfe from the preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the Pope, to performe his obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in prayer, where he was ſo rauiſhed in ſpiritt, that he retourned not thece in fower houres after.

he were as yet in this mortall fleſh. Now Br. Giles being retourned to himſelfe, his holineſſe ſat downe att table &amp; willed he ſhould eat with him: which was an incredible conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tment to the Pope, who afterward co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended him to a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber to repoſe. The day following his holineſſe familierly diſcourſing with him asked him what ſhould become of him. The holy Father making his excuſe of anſwearing thervnto: the Pope againe vrged him att leaſt to tell him what he ſhould be. Wherto Br. Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les hauing likewiſe replyed that he could not anſweare therin; being ſtill preſſed by his holineſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement he ſayd: holy Father, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to keepe both the eyes of your ſpiritt alwayes very pure: the right eye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinually to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate high &amp; future thinges, wherin we ought to addreſſe all our actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; the left to order &amp; direct preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t matters that are vnder our chardge, &amp; doe appertayne to the duety of our place and quality.

                     <p>This holy Father being in the monaſtery of Agele by Peruſia, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſupper made an exhortation to the Religious in the refectory, with his ordinary feruour, and with ſuch ſweetnes that he enflamed the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of all his audience in diuine loue, yea his owne alſo, in ſuch ſort that he was rauiſhed and out of himſelfe in the middeſt of his Brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re he ſo continued till the cock-crowing, and in the meane time he ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſuch a ſple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dour which enuironed him, that the brightnes of the moone which then was in full, was ſo obſcured that the ſhining therof being darckned by this new light, she appeared not in that place, which

                     <p>Brother Giles one day thus reaſoned with S. Bonauenture who was Generall of the Order: Father, God hath beſtowed many fauours on you that are learned, for you haue knoledge of many matters by which you prayſe him But what ſhall we doe to ſaue our ſelues, we, I ſay, that ar ignorant and idiots? S. Bonauenture anſweared: if God had giuen no other grace to men, but only ability to loue him, it would ſuffice: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe loue is more gratefull to God, then any other thing that can be offered vnto him. Brother Giles herevpon replyed: Tell me, Father, if you pleaſe, can an ignorant perſon loue God as much as one learned? he can, ſaid S. Bonauenture: yea I ſay more, a ſimple and poore old fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low may loue our lord as much as a Doctour in diuinity. Vpon theſe wordes Br. Giles went with great feruour into the garden, and tourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towardes the towne, he cryed out: Poore and caitiue old wretch, ignorant idiot and ſimple, loue thy Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, and thou mayeſt be greater then Br.

                  <p>THe venerable Br. Giles being in the Couent of Peruſia, a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane gentlewoma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> called Seaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-Sunnes, that was very deuout to S. Francis both in his life time and after his death: for ſhe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de her reſidence att Aſsiſium to beneere vnto his ſepulcher, came to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitt him to receaue ſome conſolation of his energicall doctrine: there did ſhe find Brother Gerardin, a Religious of exemplar life and very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, together with ſome other very ſpirituall Religious, who alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to viſitt Brother Giles, to heare of him ſome ſpirituall exhortation. Thus diſcourſing together, they fell into diſpute vpon a certaine paſſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge of holy ſcripture. And among many other ſentences alleadged by Br. Giles for proofe of what he maintained, this was one: He that doeth not what he can, often endureth that which he would not. Br. Gerardin deſirous to entertaine Br. Giles in diſcourſe, to gratifie the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany and for his particuler co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, thus bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcolaſtically to argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t againſt him: Br. I much admire that you affirme that a man endureth what he would not, if he doe not what he can, conſidering that a man can doe nothing of himſelfe: which is proued by many reaſons, wherefore I ſay, that the power preſuppoſeth the being, ſo that the action of the thing be
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:27206:324"/>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> according to its being. And ſo much doe the wordes of the Apoſtle ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, where he ſayth: If any man eſteeme himſelf to be ſomething, wher as he is nothing, he ſeduceth himſelfe: whence enſueth that a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe any thing, ſith he is nothing: which I will proue vnto you alſo by an other reaſon: If a man of himſelfe doe any thing, it is either by his ſoule, or by his body, or by both together; Now I will proue that he can doe nothing by meane of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Firſt, he can doe nothing by meane of the ſoule alone, for it is moſt cleare that the ſoule ſeparated from the body can neither meritt nor demeritt: neither can he doe more by meane of the body only, becauſe the body receaueth all his operation of his forme, and without the ſoule it hath no humane being, ſo that much leſſe can it worcke, which is a thinge proper to the forme, and finally, yet leſſe can he doe by meane of the compoſition, that is, of the body and ſoule vnited together: and if he could doe any thing, it ſhould be by meane of the ſoule: But I haue proued that the ſoule being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the body can doe nothing, and now I affirme that it can much<note place="margin">Sap. 9.</note> leſſe vnited with her body, becauſe the body being corruptible chard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth and burdeneth it: as for example, if a beaſt cannot goe vnloaden, much leſſe can it vnder a burthen. Thus Br. Gerardin made his argument appeare very probable which procured to the audience an amazement and confuſion. But Br. Giles very prudently anſweared: My good Br. and friend, beleeue, I pray you, that you haue ſpoaken amiſſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledge therin your fault. Br. Gerardin hauing a litle ſmiled, acknowledged his fault: then Br. Giles againe: This fault is not of force. When the penance is not admittable and in due forme, no grace can be obtayned therby. But tell me, canſt thou ſing? Br. Gerardin anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared he could: ſing then with me, ſayd Br. Giles, and drew out of his ſleeue a litle inſtrument made of willow, like thoſe litle gitternes or fidels wheron children play, wherof touching the ſtringes, he began to proue and demonſtrate the propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Br. Gerardin to be notoriouſly inuallible &amp; falſe, thus affirming on the firſt: Br. I ſpeake not of the being of man before the creation. I know then he was nothing, and therfore could doe nothing: but I ſpeake of his being ſince the creation wherin man receiued of God a freewil, wherby he might merit or demeritt, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt conſenting to good, and demeritt yelding to euill: ſo that you haue very erroniously ſpoaken: And I thinck you intended to circumuent<note place="margin">Scolaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Bro. Giles. 1. Cor. 13.</note> me, for S. Paul in the place by you alleadged, ſpeaketh not of the nullity of the ſubſtance nor of the puiſſance, but of the nullitye of meritt, conformably to what he ſayth in an other place: If I haue not charity I am nothing. Neither did I intend to ſpeake of the ſoule in ſeparation, or of the body dead, but of man liuing, who conſenting to grace, hath power if he liſt, to doe well, and being rebellious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="583" facs="tcp:27206:324"/>
to doe euill, which is no other thing then not to doe well. Where as you ſay, the corruptible body burdeneth the ſoule, the holy ſcripture doth not yet ſay that the ſame taketh away freewill from the ſoule, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her no power to doe good and euill: but the ſignification is, that it is an impediment to the vnderſtanding, and that the affection and imagination of the ſoule is imployed and entangled in terreſtriall affai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, therfore is it ſayd a litle before: The terreſtriall habitation depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſences diſtracted in many cogitations and in diuers ſcattered<note place="margin">Sap. 9.</note> affaires, which permitt not the ſoule freely to ſearch the thinges of heauen, where our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST ſitteth att the right hand of the Father almighty: becauſe the ſight is a ſubtility of the puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances of the ſoule, which are made dull and obſcure by the diuers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and occupations of the inferiour and corporall powers. Thus did Br. Giles by order refute all the reaſons of Br. Gerardin, who much admiring the ſame, againe with affection and great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion acknowledged his fault. Brother Giles then ſayd: this is the acknowledgement of the fault, Brother, that auaileth and ſtriketh the ſtroake. But will you that I yet more manifeſtly demonſtrate that a creature can doe ſomewhat? Brother Gerardin anſweared, Father I heſeech you: Brother Giles then getting vp on a graue, cryed out: O thou damned that art tormented in hell! Then himſelfe in the perſonne of the damned with a lamentable, horrible and terrible voice that made thoſe preſent to tremble, anſweared: Oh that I am mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable! that I am wretched and accurſed! then aſſuming his ordinary voice he proceeded: Tell me caitife, wherfore art thou damned? And taking againe that lamentable voice he anſweared himſelfe. Becauſe I haue not done the good I could, nor ſhunned and auoyded the euill as I might haue done. He asked him againe in his naturall voice: Thou damned wretch, what wouldeſt thou doe, or what wouldeſt thou giue, if it were permitted thee to doe pena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce? He anſweared in the gaſtly voice: if al the world were mine, I would giue it and would content my ſelfe to dwell in a fire for many worldes, prouided that it were ſuch as by litle and litle I could endure, only to auoyd eternall death: for ſo my paynes ſhould one day att leaſt haue end, but my damnation is eternall. Which ſaid, he retourned towardes Brother Gerardin, and ſayd: Well, haue you heard, Br. haue you heard, how a creature hath power to good or euill? And after many other ſpirituall diſcourſes, Brother Giles ſaid to Br. Gerardin: Brother that you may not eſteeme this to be a fiction, tell me, if a drop of water fall into the ſea; doth it then giue a name to the ſea, or the ſea to it? He anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weared, that the ſubſtance of the drop of water being ſwallowed vp, it tooke denomination of the ſea, and not the ſea of it.</p>

Br. Giles replyed: You haue reaſon; and for proofe therof he was in the very inſtant rapt into extaſie, ſo that he demonſtrated by effect, that his ſoule caſting it ſelfe into the profound ocean of the diuine loue and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being entierly ſwallowed vp in God, changed her eſſence of grace, into that of glory.</p>

                  <p>A Dominican Frere being Doctor of diuinity was aſſaulted with a grieuous temptation, for the deuil would put him in doubt of the moſt pure virginity of the virgin Mother of God; wherin whatſoeuer remedy he applyed, nothing did auayle him: and perceauing that his learning nor vertuous exerciſes would nothing profitt him, he much deſired to be aſsiſted by ſome ſpirituall perſonne that could deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him of this grieuous affliction. Wherfore hauing heard the ſame of the vertue of Br. Giles, and that he was a Religious illuminated of God, he repayred vnto him, and att the ſame time the holy Ghoſt reuealed vnto Br. Giles the comming of this diuine and the occaſion therof, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he went out of his cell and mett him. And entertayning him cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly, before the Religious began to ſpeake, he ſayd vnto him: Br.

Preacher, a virgin in her childbirth, and likewiſe ſtriking the earth with his ſticke, there ſprung vp an other lilly: and thirdly he ſayd Br.

Then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made theſe three admirable demonſtrations, and the ſayd Religious being entierly freed of the temptations, the lillyes vaniſhed.

                  <p>S. Lewes the ninth of that name, and fortie fourth king of France, goeing in Pilgrimage to Rome there to viſitt the holy Apoſtles, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſee Br. Giles, of whoſe ſanctity he had heard notable report: being therfore att Peruſia, he went to the monaſtery of the Frere Minors with ſome few of his neereſt fauourites, all veſted in pilgrimes weedes, where arriuing, he told he Porter that the deſired a word or two with Br. Giles: the Porter deliuered his meſſage that certaine Pilgrimes were att the gate, of whome one deſired to ſpeake with him. Br. Giles vnderſtanding by reuelation who it was that demaunded for him, he full of feruour of ſpiritt went incontinently out of his cell: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the gate, the king and he fell both on their knees, and very louingly embraced each other, with entertainement of moſt deuout and pious mutuall kiſſes in the face, as if their had bin a very inward and ancient amity betweene them. After they had thus ſome time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayned, and had ſhewen many mutuall tokens of charity, they ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues in ſilence without the vtterance of one word betweene them. Now whiles theſe two SS. were vnited in ſo ſpirituall a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Porter demaunded of one of the kinges followers, who that Pilgrime was that with ſuch great familiarity embraced Br. Giles: who anſweared him that it was Lewes king of France, who goeing to viſitt the holy Reliques of Rome, tooke in his way the viſitation of Br. Giles. The Religious vnderſtanding who he was, were exceedingly troubled, becauſe they had ſeene Br. Giles not only, not to haue giuen him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence due to ſo great a King, but euen, not to haue vttered ſo much as one word; and therfore they went expresly to the holy Father, whome they ſharpely checked and reprehended for this great errour, that ſhould in no ſort haue bin committed againſt ſo puiſſant a Prince, being alſo a Chriſtian endwed with ſo religious a deuotion and manſuetude, as that he came expresly to receaue of him ſome conſolation. Hereunto Br.

Giles ſeemed to haue no more care of him, for he no more viſited nor inſtructed him as before, which was a great affliction to this Religious: wherfore he one day complained therof vnto him in theſe termes: Father, I am extremely troubled, diſcontented and doe admire att you, that whiles I was in the world, you tooke ſuch paine to inſtruct me in what was neceſſary to my ſaluation, ſo that by your holy admonitions I am come to be Religious, and principally vpon hope the more commodiously to enioy your holy conuerſation, wherin I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the contrary, and find my ſelfe much deceiued. For you giue me not now ſo much as one word, ſo that you neither counſaile nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me any more, nor giue me any manner of conſolation; ſo that you ſeeme to haue vtterly forſaken me: belieue you therfore I beſeech you that my ſoule can receiue no greater contentment, then to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by you the manner how to gouerne her ſelfe in this new kind of life. Whereto Br. Giles anſweared, Brother, ſith you are of the houſe and family of God, as my ſelfe alſo him, and that you and I as fellowes doe fight vnder one capitaine and lord, it is not conuenient for me that am your companion, to command you to doe this, and not to doe that; becauſe I know not whither the wil of God be that you doe a thing contrary to that which I may counſaile you, and ſo I may perſuade you to one thing, and God to an other. Thus ſpeaking he lifted vp his face towardes heauen and ſpeaking with his Redeemer in preſence of this Religious, with a very ſweet voice, and yet with feruour he ſaid: O my Lord IESVS CHRIST! how worthy and excellent a thing is ſanctity and chaſtity? how pleaſing to thy diuine Maieſty? how well loueſt thou the ſoule that poſſeſſeth it? how doeſt thou heare her in

O my God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how doth thy diuine maieſty loue him, that with all his hart obeyeth thy holy commandementes? and after theſe wordes, he ſighed as before, and then ſayd: O my God! how pleaſing is that ſoule vnto thee, which being eleuated in thy loue perſeuereth in continuall prayers, contemplating thy celeſtiall treaſures and graces: But how much is that ſoule comforted of thee when in her deuotions ſhe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ureth out abondance of teares very gratefull to thy diuine maieſty, and profitable to her ſelfe, becauſe they bathe the conſcience, and open paradice vnto her? Ah! ah! ah my God! how pleaſing is that ſould, and how gratefull is that perſonne vnto thee, that for thy loue ſupporteth fatigations, labours and affrontes, and carryeth on him thy croſſe, not refuſing the burden therof, as our brother the aſſe, which complayneth not for being ouerloaden and beaten, nor when one ſayth, I would the wolfe had eaten thee, or that thou were fleyed: yea to ſuch iniuryes an affrontes he anſweareth not a worde, to giue me a great example of patience.

                  <p>THe wicked ſpirites were the more hatefull and enuious to this ſeruant of God, becauſe he had knowledge and vnderſtanding of many ſublime and diuine ſecrettes: for which reſpect they often tormented him, as within few dayes after he had that diuine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being alone praying in his cell, the deuill appeared vnto him in ſo horrible and fearfull a figure, that it preſently depriued him of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. But hauing in his hart called for helpe vnto almighty God, he was incontinently deliuered: and afterwardes made very fearfull relations<note place="margin">The ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſigne of the croſse and of holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> of the lothſomnes of the deuill. Br. Giles being once entred about mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night into the Church of S. Appollinaris, in Spoleta, there to offer his prayers, the deuill lept vpon his ſhoulders whiles he prayed, and held him ſo cruſhed and oppreſſed for a time that he could ſcarce moue, yet he ſo ſtrugled that he gott to the holy water pott, where hauing taken holy water and ſigned himſelfe with the croſſe, the deuill preſently fled.</p>
                  <p>An other time as he was praying, the deuill ſo tormented him, that he was enforced as much as he could to cry out: help me my Brethren; att which call his companion Br. Gratian came running, and he was inſtantly deliuered. Praying alſo an other night, he heard the ennemy with many other deuils that were very neere him, who talking among themſelues as men might doe, ſayd: Wherfore doth this Religious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſo much, fith he is already a ſainct, ſo agreable is he to God, and euen in continuall extaſie. Which they ſayd, to tempt him and induce him to vaine glory. The laſt yeare of his life, the deuill perſecuted him more cruelly the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had don before; as he thought one night after pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to repoſe himſelfe, the deuill carryed him into ſo ſtraight a place, that he could not turne him on any ſide, whatſoeuer endeauour he made to ariſe. Br. Gratian hearing him complaine, came to the dore of his cell to know if he were in prayer, or that ſome other accident were befallen him, and he perceiued that he was exceedingly troubled, wherfore he began to cry out: Father, what is the mater? wherto this holy Father anſweared: Come quickly my child, come quickly. But Br. Gratian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnable to open the dore of the cell, ſayd vnto him: I know not the reaſon, but I cannot open the dore. Br. Giles prayed him to doe his vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to open it ſpeedely: which, after much labour he did, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere vnto him with all his power to aſsiſt him, he could not ſo

much as moue him out of the place where the deuill had throwne him. which Br. Giles perceauing, he ſaid: Br. let me alone in this caſe, and lett vs referre all into the handes of God. So Brother Gratian, (though againſt his will) for bearing to endeauour to deliuer the holy Father out of this place, he fell to prayer for him, where by, a litle eaſed, he ſayd to his companion: you haue done well in comming to aſsiſt me; God reward you for it. But Brother Gratian complayning that he had not called him in this imminent perill of death wherin he was, and relating the diſgrace it would haue bin to him, and to his companions if he had ſo dyed, he ſayd vnto him: Be not troubled my child if God by me be reuenged of his ennemies: for you muſt know that how much the deuill reſiſteth God, ſeeking to afflict and torment me, ſo much more is he tormented and diſcendeth deeper to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundity of hell, and ſo when he perſecuteth me I am reuenged of him: for the ſeruice which I haue now done to almighty God, had no beginning of me but of his diuine Maieſty, as the end ſhall be, if it pleaſe him. Wherfore I am aſſured that the deuill neither can, nor euer ſhalbe able to preuaile againſt God: yet did not the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill omitt to torment him, in ſuch ſort that goeing att night to reſt in his cell, he alwayes went ſighing asif he would ſay, I expect, yea I goe to martyrdome.</p>

                  <p>BRother Iames of Maſſa a very ſpirituall Religious, euen in regard of his particuler grace to be often rauiſhed in God, one day demaunded of Brother Giles how he ſhould gouerne himſelfe in that grace: and the holy Father anſweared: Brother, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augment nor diminiſh, and ſhunne the multitude the moſt you can. Brother Iames not well vnderſtanding him, asked him what he meant by thoſe wordes, and Brother Giles replyed: when the ſpiritt is prepared to be conducted into the glorious light of the diuinity, it ſhould neither augment by preſumption, nor diminiſh by negligence; he ſhould alſo with all poſsibility loue and ſeeke ſolitarines, if he deſire that the grace receiued, be well preſerued and augmented.</p>
                  <p>A Religious hauing asked him what he might doe that might be moſt pleaſing to God: he anſweared ſinging: One to one, one to one: the ſayd Religious alleadging that he vnderſtood him not, the holy Father replyed: you ought without any intermiſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or whatſoeuer

                  <p>Br. Gratian that had bin twenty yeares his companion and diſciple, teſtified that in all that time he neuer heard him vtter one only idle word. This Religious as the diſcipline of ſo good a maſter had exceeding<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly profited by his company in ſpirituall &amp; edificatiue mortification, and had receaued many other graces of God, wherin deſiring not to faile, he one time demaunded of his maſter, in what worck and in what kind of the graces which God had gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him he ſhould moſt exerciſe himſelfe: &amp; this queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he made becauſe he was abſolutely reſolued preciſely to follow his counſaile. Whereto the holy Father anſweared: you ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be more gratefull to God in any other action, then in hanging your ſelfe. Which the good Religious hearing, he was ſtricken into a greiuous ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zement, and with ſuch an anſweare much troubled: wherfore Br. Giles proceeding, ſaid: Know my child, that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hangeth himſelfe, is neither in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nor on earth, but is only lifted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth, &amp; looketh alwayes downe.

By this counſaile he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto him two ſinguler vertues, prayer and humility, as ſpeciall graces of a Religious that deſireth to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>A certaine man talking one day with Br.

The holy Father then ſaid; what my friend are you ſo ſimple and ſo ignorant as not to vnderſtand me; I meant not that you ſhould kille your parentes with the materiall, but with the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tall ſword, becauſe according to the word of our Lord, he cannot be his diſciple, that hateth not his father, his mother, his kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and his Friendes.</p>

The Cardinals ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring this anſweare, asked him what he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t therby, he anſweared: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you with ſo much richeſſe, ho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nours, delightes &amp; te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes hope to be ſaued: &amp; I with ſuch and ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall labours feare to be damned.

and very humbly and deuoutly prayed God to be deliuered therof: yet could he not be heard. Wherfore he repayred to Br.

The king conſidering &amp; taking notice of the loue and fidelity of this his ſeruant, he cauſed preſently to be brought him ſuch armour as he wanted and was needfull vnto him.

                  <p>A Certaine good ſpirituall perſonne ſaid one day to venerable Brother Giles. Father, I find my ſelfe exceedingly incombred, &amp; I know not what counſel to take: for if I doe any good act, I am preſently tickled with vaine glory; and if I committ any ſinne, I am ſo troubled that I am ready ſometimes to fall into diſpaire: The holy Father anſweared: thou doeſt well to lament thy ſinne, and to haue
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:27206:329"/>
feeling of the perill wherto it leadeth: but it ſhould trouble thee with diſcretion, conſidering that the power of God is much greater to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue<note place="margin">One muſt not omitt to doe good for fear of vaine glory.</note> thee to mercy, then thine is to cauſe thee to offend God. But the feare of vaine glory ſhould neuer hinder thee from doeing good deedes. For if the labourer before ſeed-ſeaſon ſhould ſay to himſelfe, I will ſow no corne, becauſe the birdes &amp; wormes of the earth may eat vp the ſeed which I ſhall ſow before it take roote in the earth, or when it is ſprung vp and greene it may be eaten by beaſtes before it ripen and be gathered in: if I ſay the labourer ſhould thus diſcourſe with himſelfe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue ſuch friuolous difficulties, he would neuer ſow, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently neuer reape, whence would enſue that we ſhould haue no bread: but the prudent and wiſe labourer doth till and ſow his land and doth his endeauour, and committeth the ſucceſſe to the diuine prouidence: So ſhould you endeauour to proceed in good worckes without feare of vaine glory: for albeit it doe a litle trouble you for the time, the better and ſecurer part doth ſtill remaine vnto you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Grace doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit more in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion then in the world.</note> An other asking him if one could obtaine and poſſeſſe the grace of God remayning in the world: he anſweared that he could: but I had rather, ſaid he, haue one grace in Religion, then ten in the world: becauſe in Religion grace doth eaſily encreaſe and is better there conſerued, a man being there ſequeſtred from the tumult and affection of worldly folies the capitall ennemies of grace: and with all the Religious his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions by charitable remonſtrances and by example of their holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſation doe with draw him from euill, and inuite and induce him to goodnes. But the grace which ſome may haue in the world may alſo be eaſily loſt; becauſe the ſolicitude of worldly affaires and cogitations, which is mother of diſtraction, doth hinder and trouble the ſweetnes of grace, and other worldlinges by prophane and diſhoneſt conuerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by ſcandalous examples, and by diuiliſh hauntes and companies, doe diuert him from good and allure him to lewdnes: ſo that as it were by force they depriue him of his ſoules ſaluation, it being no part of their cuſtome to further a vertuous life, but indeed to deride and ſcoffe att ſuch as liue Chriſtianly, nor to reprehend the vicious and enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God, but to flatter and ſooth them. Wherupon I conclude, that it is farre more 7s;ecure to poſſeſſe one grace with a helpe that may conſerue it, then ten with ſuch hazard, yea in ſuch imminent perill.</p>
                  <p>A ſeculer man hauing once requeſted him to pray for him, he anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: Brother pray for they ſelfe: for ſith they ſelfe mayſt haue recourſe and acceſſe to God, why goeſt thou not? why wouldeſt thou ſend an other on thine arrant? this man againe told him that he acknowledged himſelfe ſo great a ſinner, that he knew himſelfe to farre remote and
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:27206:329"/>
ſeparated from God: But he, being holy and well beloued of his diuine maieſty, had more creditt with him, and had alſo more occaſion to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the ſame, becauſe he more often ſpake with God in prayer. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the S. replyed: Brother, if all the corners of the citty were full of gold and ſiluer, and that it were cryed by ſound of trompett through the ſtreetes, that whoſoeuer would, might take therof, would you ſend an other to fetch therof, or would you goe your ſelfe? the man anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that in deed he would not therin truſt the beſt frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d he had, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe would goe in perſonne.

                  <p>All falles &amp; greateſt perilles, arriue principally by bearing the head to high: as all good proceedeth &amp; is gotten by ſubmiſsion therof. Wretched are thoſe that ſeeke to be honoured for their vices and lewd behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours.</p>
                  <p>If thou acknowledge to haue offended the Creatour of all thinges, ſupport with patience the difficulties and grieuances aryſing by each of them: for thou haſt no cauſe to complaine of them, ſith euery thing ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riueth vnto thee from the hand of God.</p>
                  <p>If any one contend againſt thee, though it ſeeme iuſt to thee to gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, yet looſe: for doeing otherwiſe, when thou ſhalt thinck to haue gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then ſhalt thou haue loſt.</p>
                  <p>If thou deſire to ſee well, cruſh, and thruſt out thine eyes: if thou wilt heare perfectly, ſtop thine eares, and make thee deafe: if thou wilt ſpeake well and diſcreetly, cutt off thy tongue, and become mute: If thou wilt doe euery thing well, cutt off thy handes: If thou wilt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke perfect vſe of all thy membres, rent them, cutt them off and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parat them from thy body: If thou deſire to liue, kill thy ſelfe: If thou wilt eat well, faſt: If thou deſire to repoſe and sleep well, watch: If thou wilt gaine much, learne to looſe: O what a great wiſdome it is to know how to doe althinges well! but this not permitted to all.</p>
                  <p>Grace and vertue are the true ladders to aſcend to heauen, as vices and
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:27206:330"/>

                  <p>Grace doth vnite and incorporate to it ſelfe other grace, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth not to it ſelfe any vice. Grace will not be prayſed, nor will vice be checked or be blamed. The ſoule repoſeth in humility, whoſe daughter is patience. God ſeeth the purity of the hart, and deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taſteth him.</p>
                  <p>If thou loue, thou ſhalt be loued: if thou feare, thou ſhalt be feared: If thou acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modate thy ſelfe to liue well with others, they wil comply to liue well with thee. Happy is he that loueth, and yet deſireth not to be loued. Happy is he that ſerueth, and yet deſireth not to be ſerued. Happy is he, that knoweth how to liue with all, and yet deſireth not that all liue with him: But becauſe theſe thinges are great, they that haue litle iudgement attaine not vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Three thinges are very profitable to man, and no euill can befall him that poſſeſſeth them. The firſt, if he voluntarily ſupport all the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and croſſes that happen vnto him. The ſecond, if for whatſoeuer he doeth or receiueth, he the more hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble himſelfe.

Brother Giles put this queſtion to a Religious with whome he was very familier: doe you beleeue that I loue you? the Religious anſweared he did. Wel then, ſaid the holy Father, beleeue it no more: for a creature ought not ſincerely to loue but the Creatour, who is pure and infinite. An other Religious ſaid to the holy Father: I beſeech you Father, make me vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d how that muſt be interpreted which the Prophet ſaith: Euery friend deceiueth. Wherto he anſweared: I deceiue<note place="margin">Ierem. 9.</note> you, in that I doe not ſearch your good as I doe mine owne. For the more I repute your good to be mine owne, the leſſe ſhall I deceaue you, &amp; the more a man reioyceth att his neighbours good, the more doth himſelfe participate therin: &amp; therfore if you deſire to participate therof, ſtriue to reioyce therat, &amp; to procure Charity is the trueſt &amp; moſt ſure way of ſaluation, ſith that therby one doth not only reioyce att the good of his neighbour, but is alſo grieued att his croſſes: he beleeueth and iudgeth well of others, and euill of himſelfe: he honoureth others, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth himſelfe. He that will not honour an other, ſhall not be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:27206:332"/>
and he that knoweth not himſelfe ſhall not be knowne: he that will not weary himſelfe, ſhall not repoſe: alſo the greateſt of all labours and the moſt meritorious, is to labour in piety and benignity: he that doeth a good worck without loue and charity, is not gratefull to God nor to his ſainctes: but he that for the loue of God maketh himſelfe poore of temporall ſubſtance, ſhalbe rich of ſuch as are celeſtial. A man then ought to chooſe and loue diuine thinges and miſpriſe particuler thinges, for what can be greater then to know how to prayſe the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts of God, and to check himſelfe for his proper malice?

                  <p>A Man cannot attaine to the knowledge of God, but by meane of humility, ſith that the true way to aſcend on high is to debaſe ones ſelfe. All the euils and all the ruines of this world proceed of pride, as is ſeene in the euill Angell and in the firſt man, wherof the one was created in heauen and the other in Paradice; which alſo may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued<note place="margin">Luc. 18.</note> in the Phariſie ſpoaken of in the Ghoſpel, and in many others: And on the contrary, all good that euer hath bin done, hath bin wrought by humility, as is remarqued in the moſt ſacred Virgin, in the Publican, in the Theefe, and others. But good God, why doe we not ordinarily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on our ſhoulders ſome weighty burthen to cruſh downe our hard head, and to debaſe and humble it? A Religious one day demaunding of Br. Giles how one might ſhunne pride, he anſweared: Brother, waſh your handes, put your mouth where your feet are, conſider your ſinnes, and haue contrition for them, and then often incline your ſelfe towardes the ground. Wretched is he that deſireth glory and honour for his owne ſinnes &amp; vanities. A man is aſcended to an high degree of humility, when
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:27206:332"/>
he acknowledgeth that himſelfe is contrary to his owne good. I alſo eſteeme it a branch of humility to yeld to an other, and not to appropriat to ones ſelfe. I dare affirme that as one ought to attribute to God all goodnes as proper vnto him, ſo to our ſelues all euill. Happy is he that ſheweth himſelfe ſo vile before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as he is before God. Happy is he that walketh faithfully vnder the obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and iudgement of an other, as the holy Apoſtles did, after they were repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt. He that will haue peace and tranquillity in him, lett him repute al men grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then himſelfe. Happy is he that deſireth not to be ſeene in his wordes and behauiours that are commendable: but rather in the compunction and abiection wherin the diuine grace putteth him. He that is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyeſt man in the world and reputeth himſelfe moſt vile, he hath true humility. Humility knoweth not how to ſpeake, and dareth not be tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katiue. Humility is like the brightnes of heauen: for as of the ſame brightnes and of vapours doe proceed thunders and earth quakes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in an inſtant no more is ſeene, ſo humility doth ruine vices, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and the high toures of her ennemy pride, and then cauſeth a man after the performance of great matters, to repute himſelfe nothing. By humility a man findeth the grace of God, and peace with men. For euen as if a mightie Prince would ſend his owne daughter into a farre country, he would not mount her on a reſtiue and proud horſe, but on a gentle nagge that ſhall amble eaſily and ſecurely: euen ſo God as ſoueraine king, giueth not his grace to the proud, but only to the humble.</p>

He that feareth nor, ſheweth that he hath nothing to looſe. The feare of God guideth and gouuerneth man, and cauſeth him to find grace with his diuine maieſty, by which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath receaued this feare, he conſerueth it, and hauing loſt it, doth recouer it. All reaſonable creatures that haue forgotten themſelues in foule diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had neuer fallen therinto, if they had this gift of God, which is proper vnto the ſainctes.

Thou oughteſt to haue feare of thy ſelfe and thy like, and to carry thy ſelfe reſpectiuely and warily: for a man that liueth in the middeſt of his ennemies, cannot be in perfect aſſurance. Our fleſh is our ennemy, which with the deuill is continually aduerſe to our ſoule.

If thou heare any one ſpeake ill of thee, aſsiſt him; if he ſpeake well of thee, referre that to God. If thou wilt make thy part the better, make it ill, and that of an other, good: I meane thou muſt praiſe the worckes and good wordes of others, and blame thine owne.

                  <p>Doe not wrong or iniury to any, and if it be offred to thee, ſupport it patiently for the loue of God, and in remiſsion of thy ſinnes: for it is more meritorious to ſuupport a great iniury for the loue of IESVS<note place="margin">To ſuffer iniuries freely is of excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt.</note> CHRIST without murmure, then to feed euery day an hundred poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re people, and to faſt much and auſterely.

It were a great vertue for a man to content himſelfe to be ouercome of all the men of the world, for ſo he ſhould become truely lord of all the world.

                  <p>A man one time praying Brother Giles to giue him ſome conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he anſweared: Endeauour to doe well, and thou ſhalt be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: for if a man doe not prepare in himſelfe a place for God, he ſhall not find him in his creatures. What man is there, that will not doe that which is beſt, not only for his ſoule, but euen for his body in that which concerneth this life? I can truely affirme, that whoſoeuer ſhaketh off the ſweet and light yoke of our Sauiour, ſhall find it afterward far more painfull: and he that therwith burdeneth himſelfe moſt, att lenght ſhall find it moſt light.</p>
                  <p>Would to God all men would doe that which they may acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge to be beſt for their bodyes euen in this world: for he that made the other world hath made this alſo, and can giue to man in this world the benefittes which he giueth in the other, and the body feeleth the happineſſe of the ſoule. A Religious hearing Brother Giles to ſpeake theſe wordes, ſayd vnto him: Tell me Father, if you pleaſe, we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes dye before we haue any experience of any good: The holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſweared: The Furriers are knowen by skinnes, Shomakers by ſhooes, and forgers by iron: But tell me, Brother can a man be knowne by an art that he neuer practiſed? Thinck you that Princes and Potenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes beſtow great fauours and prefermentes on ſottiſh perſonnes and without iudgement? there is no probability. Good worckes are the true way and meane to the fruition of all happines, as ill deedes to fall into all miſeries, happy is he that feeleth no ſcandall att whatſoeuer matter vnder heauen: and he that is edifyed with whatſoeuer he ſeeth and heareth, and that amongeſt all thinges chooſeth only thoſe that he may vſe to the moſt benefitt of his ſoule.</p>

Prayer<note place="margin">Inſtance requiſit in prayer</note> illuminateth the ſoule, and by it good and euill are diſcerned. All ſinners ought to make this prayer vnto God, that he will giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knowledge of their owne ſinnes, of the diuine mercy, and of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittes receaued of IESVS CHRIST. He that cannot pray, knoweth not God. It is neceſſary for all thoſe that are to be ſaued, if they haue vſe of reaſon, to apply themſelues to prayer, to obtayne mercy of God. Lett vs ſuppoſe that a widdow and lady which were much retyred, ſimple and chaſt, had a ſonne, that for ſome crime committed were priſonner &amp; condemned to death: This Mother though honorable and retyred, would ſhe not repayre to the Prince, with abondance of teares to ſeeke fauour for her ſonne? This vrgent neceſsity, no doubt, for the extreme loue of this widow to her ſonne (though ſhe were very rarely ſeene to goe out of her houſe) would enforce her to runne through the ſtreetes, with cryes, weepinges and lamentations, to ſollicite all thoſe whome ſhe thought might any way aſsiſt her in ſauing the life of her ſonne: which ſhe would attempt without any feare or reſpect of the modeſty requiſite to her degree and quality. In like manner he that knoweth his ſinnes, knoweth conſequently to aske pardon for them with ſhame and humility.</p>

                  <p>An other Religious demaunding of this his Father, why a man was more tempted in his prayer then in any other time, he anſweared: When any one hath a proceſſe in a kinges Court, and knoweth that his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſary

ſeeketh to gett ſome fauour againſt him att the kinges handes, he endeauoureth with all meanes and poſsibility to hinder his repaire to the Court: if he cannot, he procureth att leaſt that the king giue not eare vnto him, or at leaſt that he obtaine not his requeſt; and then vſeth all his indeauours to procure iudgement in his owne behalfe: Thus worcketh the deuill againſt vs. And therfore when you diſcourſe with any one, you ſhall very rarely perceaue the deuill to warre againſt you with his temptations: but if you goe about to recreat your ſoule with God in prayer, you ſhall incontinently feele the ſhottes of the ennemy againſt you. But you muſt not therfore giue ouer prayer, but with great feruour and reſolution perſeuer, for there is the true and aſſured way, leading to the celeſtiall contry: and he that for temptations omitteth prayer, is like to a coward that flyeth the combatt.</p>

Br. Giles anſweared: Brother, omitt not to continue prayer with your accuſtomed feruour. For if God giue not you his grace att firſt, he can giue it you att an other time: and that which he might haue giuen you in a day, or in a weeke, in a month, or in a yeare, he will giue you when he ſhall ſee it moſt conuenient and moſt neceſſary for you. But in the meane while faile not in your endeauour, and leaue the care of the reſt to the prouidence of God. For the maſter Cutler giueth many hammer-ſtrokes on the iron, before the endeth a knife, and then att laſt finiſheth it with one blow.</p>

Beleeue you not alſo, ſayd the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that I would giue my neighbour foure thouſand duckets, rather then my ſelfe? The Religious anſweared, I beleeue you. Br. Giles then inferred: Our Sauiour ſayth in the Goſpell: he that forſaketh Father; Mother, Brothers, Siſters, kinred, friendes, and all other worldly thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for my ſake, ſhall receaue an hundred fold in this world, and in the other, life euerlaſting.</p>
                  <p>This holy Father ſeeing a gentleman, that was eſteemed to be worth threeſcore thouſand duckets, to enter into Religion ſayd: The retribution which God giueth in this life is exceſsiuely great, ſith that to this man is to be deputed and hundred times threeſcore thouſand duckets, but we are blind and worſe then blind, that will neither know nor conſider it.</p>
                  <p>This good Father on a time ſayd: beleeue me if we ſhould ſee a man repleniſhed with grace and vertues, we ſhould not ſupport the ſight of his perfection: and if a man were perfectly ſpirituall, he could hardly permit and endure to ſee or heare any wordly thing, or to ſpeake with any worldly perſonne but vpon vrgent neceſsity; but would affect to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſolitary.

Wherto the holy Father thus anſweared: if you were in the Court of the king of Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, &amp; ſhould demand of him a thouſand marck in ſiluer, he might an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, what haſt thou don for me that may moue thee to demaund ſuch a recompence? but if you had formerly done him ſome notable ſeruice, you might with fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Therfore if you will ſerue God, you muſt firſt labour in obedience; ſith it is a greater vertue to doe one thing att the will of an other, then to doe two, att ones owne pleaſure. Then he added: No ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can obtaine to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation of the glory of his diuine Maieſty, but by feruour of ſpiritt &amp; ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t prayer, and then is a man enflamed with the feruour of the holy Ghoſt &amp; ſoareth vp to diuine conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, when the hart is ſo diſpoſed with the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

neither can nor will thinck of other thing then that w ich it poſſeſſeth and feeleth. He ſhalbe a perfect contemplatour who, hauing all his me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres cutt off, yea and his tongue, would neither thinck, procure, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to haue any other member, nor whatſoeuer other thing he can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine vnder heauen, and this by reaſon of the excellencie of the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ineffable odour and ſweetnes of contemplation. In that reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect S. Marie Magdale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being proſtrate att the feet of our lord IES. CHR. receaued and felt ſuch a ſweetneſſe of his wordes, that ſhe had no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in her, that could or would doe other thing then what ſhe then did. Which ſhe ſufficiently teſtified, when her ſiſter complayning att the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of her helpe, ſhe anſweared nothing either by wordes or figues. But our Redeemer as her Aduocate and Procuratour anſweared for her: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſhe was imployed in his ſeruice more excellently then Martha was. Now to contemplate is to ſequeſtred from men, and to remayne vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alone with IESVS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>Br. Giles made this demannd to a Religious of his Couent: Brother what ſay the Doctours of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation? the Religious anſweared: they ſpeake diuerſely. Will you, replyed the holy Father, that I ſpeake mine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion therof? the degrees of conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation are, fire, vnction, extaſie, taſt, repoſe, and glory: then he added: a more expreſſe contemplation of God<note place="margin">Notable ſimilitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de.</note> with the ſoule cannot be giuen, then that of the Eſpouſe, with his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſe: for the Spouſe, before he receaueth his Eſpouſe, ſendeth her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, iewels, and other ornamentes of price to adorne her: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are together, the Eſpouſe leaueth all thoſe thinges to approch vnto her Spouſe: ſo doe good worckes and vertues adorne the ſoule as precious ſtones and ſumptuous attire, and prayer vniteth it vnto God.</p>
                  <p>An ancient Religious demaunded of Br. Giles, if the ſoule by extaſie and contemplation did ſometime euen in this life goe out of the body, and he anſweared, that it did: yea he aſſured him, that he knew a man yet liuing, whoſe ſoule being lifred vp in extaſie, went out of the body, and forſooke it, yea already vtterly forgetting the ſame. I beleeue ſaid the Religious, that ſuch ſoule was exceedingly grieued to retourne into her body. Br. Giles then ſmilingly replyed: Brother that which you ſay is true, yea moſt true.</p>
                  <p>This holy Father would often, in prayer and att other times with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding feruour, ſay: What art thou my God, of whome I demaund this? and what am I that aske it? I am a ſack filled with dung, with loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and with wormes: and thou art lord of heauen and earth. And thus beginning his prayer, he would be incontinently eleuated and rapt into almighty God.</p>

                  <p>THe Venerable Br. Giles would ſometimes ſay lett him who deſireth to be learned humble well his head, lett him be exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in good worckes, and lett him rent his body on the earth, &amp; God will giue him knowledge. It is a ſoueraine wiſdome to doe good worckes, carefully to obſerue the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandementes and to conſider the iudgements of God. He once ſayd to a Religious that would goe to a lecture att a Colledge: Tell me wherfore would you goe to the lecture? Know that the moſt worthy ſcience is to feare and loue God: theſe two vertues will ſuffice you, a man hath knowledge according to his good worckes and no more. Be not only carefull to profitt others, thou being obliged to be more carefull to benefitt thy ſelfe. We would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times know many thinges for others, and few for our ſelues. The word of God is not of him that heareth it, nor of him that vttereth it, but of him that putteth it in effect. Many not knowing how to ſwimne throw themſelues into the water to helpe an other that they ſee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of drowning; but hauing aduentured too farre, they are drowned together: ſo that wheras there was but one in perill, two are loſt by preſumption: In purchaſing aboue all thinges the ſaluation of thy owne ſoule as thou art obliged, thou ſhalt not omitt to aſsiſt others, but rather in doeing good worckes for thy ſelfe, thou ſhalt alſo profitt them that wiſh thee well. The Preacher of the word of God is a meſſager of his maieſty, to the end he be to the people a flaming light, a glittering glaſſe, a ſtanderd-bearer of his warryers. Happy is he that condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth others by the aſſured way, that faileth not to walke the ſame way, and that inducing others to runne, ſtandeth not ſtill himſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe: and ſo if he helpe to enrich others, he remayneth not poore. I ſuppoſe a good Preacher preacheth more for himſelfe then for others, and it ſeemeth that he who endeauoureth to draw ſoules out of an euill courſe to ſetle them in a good, ought to feare that himſelfe be not ſeduced from the ſame good way, and led to the way of the deuill.</p>
                  <p>A Religious demaunded of this holy Father, whither were better to preach well, or to doe well: he anſweared, tell me who doth me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt more, ha that goeth in pilgrimage to ſainct Iames of Galicia, or he that ſheweth him the way? I ſee many thinges that are not myne, I heare much that I vnderſtand not, and I ſpeake much that I
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:27206:340"/>
doe not performe; and it ſeemeth to me, that a man is not ſaued for ſeeing, ſpeaking and hearing, but for well performing that which he knoweth to be the beſt. Wordes are farther diſtant from deedes, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth is remote from heauen. If any one would permitt you to goe into his vineyeard there to gather grapes, would you content your ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe with leaues? It is a thouſand times more neceſſary for a man to gett inſtruction for himſelfe, then for all the world. If you deſire to know much, doe many good worckes, and humble your ſelfe withall poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. A Preacher ſhould not ſpeake ouer-curiously, nor too grosly: but ſhould vſe only common and ordinary tearmes.</p>
                  <p>Then the holy Father ſmilingly proceeded: there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene the ewe that bleateth much, and her that bringeth many lambes: that is, it is not one thing to preach, and to putt in execution.</p>
                  <p>Br. Giles one day ſayd to a Doctour, that ſeemed to glory much in his doctrine and preaching: if all the earth were in the poſſeſsion of one man, and he ſhould not labour it, what fruit would he reap therof? Rely not therfore ſo much one your learning, albeit all the knowledge of all the world were in your head, becauſe not performing worckes neceſſary to your ſaluation, it would nothing auayle you.</p>
                  <p>This holy Father prayed a Religious that went to preach att Peruſia, to take for the theme of his ſermon theſe wordes: I kiſſe, I kiſſe, I ſpeake much and performe litle. This is in his life a litle before.</p>
                  <p>This holy Father expounding theſe wordes of our Sauiour IESVS<note place="margin">Luc. 22.</note> CHRIST, <hi>I haue prayed for thee Peter,</hi> I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith faile not: and thou once couuerted, confirme thy Brethren: he thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted it: Almighty God, ſayd he, would giue to vnderſtand that a man ſhould firſt labour for himſelfe, and then for others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And albeit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion of ſoules be very gratefull vnto God, yet it is vnderſtood of tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe that can doe it without preiudice to the ſaluation of their owne ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, ſeruing God, as S. Paul, wherſoeuer they are. Therfore this holv Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would often with great feruour of ſpiritt, ſay: Paris, Paris, thou doeſt ruinate the Order of S. Francis. Which this good Religious ſayd, ſeeing the diſquiett and trouble of ſpiritt of many learned Frere Minors, that put confidence in their ſciences.</p>
                  <p>Br. Giles hearing a quaile and a doue to ſing, ſayd in feruour of ſpiritt; there is the way, there is the way, and not there: as if they ſayd, lett vs endeauour to doe well in this life, and not expect the other: with reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſiſter doue thou ſpeakeſt this, ſo ſweetly groning.

For although a tree grow and is faſtened in the ground, he doth not yet ſodenly become great, and when he is great, he doth not preſently floriſh, he is not ſo ſoone fruitfull, if he be, they be not ripe, if ripe, they do not in euery reſpect content the maſter.

                  <p>Two thinges I hould for great benefittes of God, when a man hath his hart remote from ſinne, and repleniſhed with loue towardes God: which two thinges whoſoeuer ſhall poſſeſſe without danger of any euill, ſhalbe in poſſeſsion of all good: But he muſt perſeuer, becauſe if one had from the beginning of the world to this inſtant, liued in diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes afflictions, and now ſhould haue abondant fruition of all kind of ioyes, all the miſeries paſt would not offend him: on the contrary, if one had alwayes ſpent his time in continuall iollyty and contentment, and were att this preſent oppreſſed with diuers miſeries and infirmities, his pleaſures paſt would nothing reioyce him.

                  <p>I Would more reſpect a litle grace from almighty God in Religion, then much more in the world: becauſe there is more perill and leſſe helpe in the ſeculer eſtate then in Religion, and yet a ſinfull man hath more feare of his good then of his euill, becauſe he feareth more to doe penance entring into Religion, then to perſiſt in ſinne in the world.</p>
                  <p>They that enter into Religion, and performe not what is conuenient to their vow, are like a common labourer that adorneth himſelfe with the armour of a braue ſoldier and when he muſt fight, knoweth not how to vſe it. I doe not eſteeme it much to enter into the Court of a king, and to gett fauour of him: but I much eſteeme, to know how to liue in a

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had rather liue in ſeculer eſtate, with deſire to enter into Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, then to be Religious with wearineſſe and irckſomnes. The glorious Virgin Mother of IESVS CHRIST was borne of ſinfull man &amp; woman, and liued not incloſed in any Religion, neuertheles ſhe was, &amp; is as ſhe is. But when a Religious hath made profeſsion, he muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that he neither knoweth nor can liue out of Religion. It doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly ſeeme vnto me that the Religion of the Frere Minors was ſent of God into the world, for a great benefitt and profitt to al men: but we ſhal proue extremely miſerable, if we be not ſuch as we ought to be.

Conſidering all the Religions that are, and haue bin from the beginning of the world to this preſent, I find none ſo reaſonable, conuenient, nor better then this of the Frere Minors. He is rich that playeth the part of a rich man, he is wiſe that imitateth the wiſe, he good that imitateth the good; and he noble that is a true follower of our moſt noble Lord IESVS.</p>
                  <p>Vertuous conditions open vs the way to all happines, and vicious to perdition. And therfore the more a Religious ſubmitteth himſelfe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of odedience, the more fruit doth he produce; and the more obedient a Religious is and more ſubiect to his Superiour, for the honour and loue of God, ſo much more is he poore of ſpiritt and purged of his ſinnes.</p>
                  <p>A Religious truely obedient is as a ſoldier well armed, and as a horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mounted on a gallant Courſer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But it is very perillous to demaund of God vertues and graces, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if hauing receaued them, we doe not good worckes accordingly, we make his diuine Maieſty more our ennemy, and prouoke his wrath to chaſtice vs for our ingratitude: in reſpect that by how much greater the gift is which God preſenteth to his creature, the more vngratefull doth he proue that conſerueth it not. The more a man is ſurmonted by vices and ſinnes, the more ought he to hate and abhorre them.</p>
                  <p>By prayer a man doth often meritt great graces and vertues, for he is therby illuminated in his ſoule, and fortifyed in faith, he taketh notice of his miſery, obtayneth feare and humility, and purchaſeth a contempt of himſelfe: he getteth contrition for his ſinnes, the gift of teares, and amendement of his euill life. Prayer maketh the ſcience of a man pure, maketh him conſtant and ſtable in patience, and delighting in obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, it maketh him perfect in mortification of himſelfe; it purchaſeth vnto him an aſſured knowledge, the gift of vnderſtanding, the gift of force, the gift of prudence, and finally conducteth him to the knowledge of God, who manifeſteth himſelfe to them that adore him in ſpiritt and truth: for a man by prayer is inflamed in loue, then preſently runneth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diuine odour, and obteyneth the ſweetnes of delight, then is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated to repoſe of ſpiritt, where he is admitted to the glory of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<note place="margin">Ioan. 4.</note> of God. When he ſhall haue layd his mouth to the word of the moſt high, wherwith alone the ſoule is ſatisfied. Who can euer ſeparate him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> prayer, which raiſeth and eleuateth the ſpiritt vnto contemplation?</p>
                  <p>And that they, who ſhall deſire to obtaine the afforeſaid thinges, may know to attayne therto, lett them, among all other well obſerue theſe ſix conſiderations, as moſt neceſſary, wherof the firſt is touching his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes paſt, for which he muſt haue contrition: the ſecond, to be prudent in his actions preſent: the third, to foreſee thoſe to come: the fourth, lett him conſider the mercy of God that expecteth mannes repentance, not taking vengeance on him, though he haue made himſelfe worthy of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall tormentes, according to diuine iuſtice, which he deſſembleth, in expectation of his amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. The fift is of the benefittes of his diuine Maieſty, which are innumerable, as the incarnation, and paſsion, and all for our benefitt, the doctrine which he left vs, and the glory he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth.

                  <p>An other putting him a queſtion of predeſtination, he anſweared: The water of the ſea ſhoare is ſufficient to waſh my feet, yea my whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and I eſteeme him a foole that this being able to content him, will caſt himſelfe into the mayne ſea: for I beleeue it ſufficeth a Chriſtian to know how to liue well, without ſearch into matters ſo highe. Then he added: you muſt pray to God that he giue you not too much felicity in this world, but that he ſend you great combattes againſt your ſences, and that therin he doe not aſsiſt you by the taſt of his diuine ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and ſuauity, for your greater recompence, and his greater glory.</p>
                  <p>Hereby may be diſcerned whither a man loue God perfectly, if with an earneſt care he endeauour to ſequeſter himſelfe from vices, ſeeking dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to augment in good worckes, becauſe it is a greater vertue to follow grace, then patiently to ſupport afflictions, for many haue patience, but follow not grace.</p>
                  <p>Frere Minor, is as much to ſay, as one vnder the feet of all men, and the greater the deſcent is, the greater alſo is the ſally. We ought more to feare temporall feclicity, then temporall euill; for the euill followeth man, and felicity is his contrary. We muſt ſo conuerſe with men, as we looſe not that which God woorketh in vs. But lett vs rather labour and trauell to ſaue our ſelues with litle, ſith that it ſometimes happeneth that a man being skilfull in ſwimming, and will imprudently ſeeke to hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe an other that is in perlll of drowning in the water, they both are drowned, and ſo the loſſe is double.</p>
                  <p>A man ſhalbe obliged to yeld an account of the graces which he hath not: For as God createth a creature by his bounty and grace, he ought reciprocally appeare gracious and acknowledge the ſame; if not, lett him know that he hath loſt grace by his owne negligence. For if he would trauell and labour in the grace receaued, he ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine many other graces of God, which through his owne fault, he hath not.</p>
                  <p>I deſire, ſayd this holy Father, firſt to obey euen to death: then

S.

Neither did his diuine Maieſty faile, to open vnto them the meanes: and to at taine therunto, he inſpired this vertuous woman to relye on a very honorable graue woman, that gouerned her in her houſe as her mother. And to the end this holy purpoſe might be ſiniſterly enterpreted of men, and to hinder publicke murmure, ſhe went out of her Fathers houſe with this good womau, and found out the holy Father, by the feruour

And therfore ſhe began very exquiſitely to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe her ſelfe to the effecting of the wordes of the holy ſeruant of God, who hauing very louingly entertayned her, began to preach vnto her the contempt of the world, and by euident reaſons to demonſtrate vnto her, that all the beauty of thinges preſent is but a vanity, filled with falſe and deceipt full hopes. Then he perſuaded vnto her pure eares, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and amiable eſpouſale of IESVS CHRIST, and counſayled her to conſerue that moſt precious pearles of virginall purity, for that glorious Spouſe, who out of loue he bare to the world being God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came man and would be borne of a virgin.

Thus then leauing her fathers houſe, her citty, kinred and friendes, ſhe with extraordinary ſpeed arriued att the Church of our lady of Angels, where the Religious that in the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of God, were employed in pious watchinges, receaued with bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning wax lightes in their handes, this holy virgin, that ſought her Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe and Redeemer IESVS CHRIST with a lampe not extinct and empty, but filled with diuine loue.

Sixteene dayes then after her conuerſion, her ſiſter Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes inſpired of God, with a ſtrong and prompt reſolution gaue a ſlipp and farwell to the world, and came to her ſiſter Clare, to whome diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering the ſecrett of her hart, ſhe ſayd, ſhe was reſolued to ſerue God in her company. Which the glorious Clare vnderſtanding, ſhe moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly embraced her, and with a very ioyfull and contented countenance ſayd: My moſt deere ſiſter, I giue infinite thanckes to our lorde IESVS CHRIST, that it hath pleaſed him to heare me, and deliuer me from the affliction I endured for your ſake. This noble conuerſion of Agnes by the prayers of her Siſter Clare, was ſeconded by as many contradictions of her kinred: for theſe bleſſed ſiſters ſeruing our lord IESVS CHRIST and imitating his ſteppes, ſhe that had moſt taſt of God and was in high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her progreſſe, inſtructing her ſiſter Nouice: their kinred knowing that Agnes was with her ſiſter Clare, twelue men of their neereſt bloud, as Brothers, Vncles, and Coſen germanes, aſſembled to aſſault them and to combat the eſpouſes IESVS CHRIST. The day following then, with an extreme rage and fury they came to theſe holy virgins, yett att their firſt comming, diſſembling their lewd intenſion, they ſhewed them ſome fauourable countenance: then addreſsing them ſelues to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Agnes, diſpairing of all opinion to withdraw S.

Wherto ſhe anſweared, that ſhe was reſolued, the grace of God aſsiſting her, to remayne with her ſiſter: which anſweare one among them diſdayning, full of paſsion and tranſported with choler, tooke her by the haire, and gaue her many blowes with his feet and ſiſtes, then vſed all his force to pull her out of the place, which att length by the helpe of the others he performed: for taking her in their armes, they forcibly trayled her out. But this litle daughter of IESVS CHRIST, ſeeing her ſelfe violently wreſted by thoſe furious lions out of the armes of her God, ſhe began to cry to her ſiſter, help me ſiſter, and permitt me not to be ſeparated from our Lord IESVS CHRIST and your louing company. Her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall kinred trayned a long the vally this virgin of IESVS CHRIST againſt her will, and in deſpight of her feeble, though couragious reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, renting her cloathes from her tender body.

And albeit ſo many men and their ſeruantes putt all their forces to lift her vp, yet could they neuer doe it, but called labourers &amp; worckmen of the vineyards that wrought ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about to aſsiſt them, yet their great nomber no more auayled then the leſſer. Finally the forces failing of her kinred and thoſe that attempted to aſsiſt them: they acknowledged the miracle, though ſcornefully, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: It is no meruaile that ſhe is ſo weighty ſhe hauing bin all night, as lead, whervpon Signeur Monalde her vncle in extreme paſsion, lifting vp his arme to ſtrike her he preſently felt an extreme paine therin, which did not only torment him for the preſent, but a long time after. Herev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon S. Clare (after her prayer) arriuing, beſought her kinred to forbeare in vaine to contend with God, and to leaue vnto her the care of her ſiſter, who lay as halfe dead. They perceauing that they would neuer ſtagger in their pious reſolution, being exceedingly wearyed, left the two ſiſters together. This troup then being departed, the tormented Agnes aroſe from the ground full of ioy in IESVS CHRIST, for whoſe loue ſhe had fought and ouercome in this her firſt conflict, againſt the world and his Prince the deuill, by fauour and aſsiſtance of diuine grace; and her ſiſter asking her how ſhe felt her ſelfe, ſhe anſweared, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the affliction they had procured her, by buffettes, beatinges, ſpurnes with their feet and fiſtes, tearing by the haire, trayning her through ſtony wayes, ſhe had felt in manner nothing, eſpecially by the vertue and force of diuine grace, and next by the merittes of her good prayers. Shortly after the holy Father ſainct Francis cutt off her haire, leauing her ſtil hir proper name, Agnes, in memory of the innocent lambe IESVS CHRIST, who offering himſelfe in ſacrifice to his Father, gaue reſiſtance to the world, fought valerously and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came.

                  <p>Now deſiring to entitle her rule by the title of pouerty, ſhe demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Pope Innocent the fourth the priuiledge of pouerty, who as a a Magnanimous Prelat reioycing att the great feruour of this holy virgin, exceedingly commended this her deuotion, aſſuring himſelfe that the like priuiledge had neuer bin demaunded of the Apoſtolike ſea. And to the end a new and extraordinary fauour might anſweare this new and vnaccuſtomed demaund, the holy Pope with an exceeding contentment wrote with his owne hand the firſt pattent of the priuiledge. Which Pope Gregory the ninth his predeceſſour, of holy memory, had alſo done, who with a Fatherly affection louing this eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, once gaue her counſaile, in conſideration of the diuerſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations of matters, and the ſtrange euents of times, yea and in regard of the perills of future ages, to be content that her Order might haue ſome poſſeſsions, himſelfe offering to beſtow it on them: but ſhe coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly withſtood it, and as a true, poore, and legitimate daughter of the Patriarch poore S. Francis, would neuer accord thervnto. The Pope alleadging that if ſhe feared the breach of her vow, he would abſolue her therof. This Virgin very humbly anſweared him in theſe tearmes: Holy Father, I ſhalbe very ioyfull if it pleaſe your holineſſe to abſolue me of all my ſinnes. But to free me from performing the Counſailes of God, I will accept no abſolution. This holy virgin

with an exceeding ioy receaued the morcels of bread which the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious brought from begging, and had gotten for the loue of God: But ſhe was much troubled when ſhe ſaw whole loaues. She laboured much to conforme her ſelfe in all conditions of perfections of perfect pouerty with him that was poorely crucified: And in ſuch ſort that no tranſitory thing might ſeparate the moſt poore virgin from her beloued, nor hinder her from her moſt ardent feruour to follow our Lord IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST.</p>

Is it not a great matter that vſing one only habitt all patched, and a poore cloake of the groſſeſt cloth, ſhe rather couered her body then defended it from the importunities of the ſeaſons? But it is more admirable that ſhe neuer woare ſtockinges, ſhooes, nor other thing on her feet, after ſhe became Religious. It was alſo a ſtrange mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that ſhe faſted dayly and neuer failed for whatſoeuer occaſion that happened.

This eſpouſe of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST woare more then the reſt a haircloth as great as halfe a tunicle, made of hogges haire, the haire next her flesh being halfe ſhorne: She alſo woare a haire cloth, which a Religious very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately once borrowed of her: but prouing it to be ſo rude and ſharpe, ſhe reſtored it to ſaincte Clare three dayes after, more readily then ſhe had ioyfully borrowed it.

But in regard that the rigorous life wherwith ſhe ſo afflicted her body brought her to ſickneſſe, the holy Father ſaint Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis commanded her to lye on chaffe.

a holy enuie deſired to ſerue IESVS CHRIST, all ſeeking to participate of the euangelicall life which by this eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, was demonſtrated vnto them.

                  <p>AS ſaincte Clare was mortified in her fleſh, and far remote from all corporall recreation, ſo did ſhe continually buſye her ſoule in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotions

and diuine prayſes. This virgin had fixed and imprinted the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of her feruent deſire in the eternal light: &amp; as ſhe was remote from earthly occupations and rumors, ſo did ſhe the more lardgely dilate the boſome of her ſoule to the influence of diuine grace. She continued in long prayer together with her Religious after compline, the riuers of teares that flowed from her eyes awakening and bathing the hartes of her companions: When the ſleep of others gaue her opportunity to be ſolitary, being often in prayer, ſhe would lay her face againſt the earth bathed with teares, kiſsing it ſweetly and with ſuch contentmenr, that ſhe ſeemed alwayes to hold in her armes her Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, att whoſe feete her teares trickled downe, and her kiſſes left their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions.</p>
                  <p>It happened one time, that as this holy virgin powered out her teares in the ſilent of the night, the Angel of darcknes appeared vnto her in fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of a black yong man, ſaying: If thou continueſt this extreme wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping thou wilt become blind. Wherto ſhe anſweared: He that is to ſee God, cannot be blinde. Wherwith the deuill being confounded vaniſhed and fled. The ſame night this S. being in prayer, after matines, all ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in teares, the temptor appeared againe vnto her and ſayd: Weep not ſo much, vnleſſe thou wilt haue thy braine to melt and diſtill, in ſuch ſort as thou ſhalt auoyd it att thy eyes and noſtrels, and therwith ſhalt haue thy noſe crooked. S. Clare with great feruour anſweared him: He that ſerueth IESVS CHRIST can haue no crookedneſſe, and preſently the wicked ſpiritt diſappeared. Many ſignes did diſcouer &amp; make know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the great alteration ſhe receaued in her ſelfe, in the feruour of her prayer, and how ſweet and delectable the diuine bounty was vnto her in this ioy and holy conuerſation: for when ſhe retourned from prayer, ſhe with admirable contentment, brought wordes enflamed with the fire of the altare of God, which kindled the hartes of her Religious, and procured in them a great admiration att this extreme ſweetnes that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and flaſhed out of her face. It is without doubt, that almighty God had coupled and conioyned his ſweetnes with her pouerty, and did manifeſt exteriourly in her body, that her ſoule was interiourly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with diuine light. In this manner did ſhe ordinarily liue full of ſo ſupreme delightes, paſsing ouer this deceiptfull world with her noble Spouſe IESVS CHRIST, and being on this wheele of motion, ſhe was theron ſuſtayned with an aſſurance and firmity of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, very ſtable, and preſerued with the celeſtiall eleuation of her ſoule, in the hight of heauen, keeping the treaſure of glory ſecurely ſhutt vp, with in a veſſell of fleſh, here below on earth.

The impiety of this Emperour did ſo augment, that he had aſſembled all the Mores that dwelt on the mountaines and among the deſertes, to make himſelfe the more fearefull vnto his vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: and after he had by lardge promiſes gayned theſe Mores, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them into diuers places, he gaue them att length for retyre a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ancient but ruined citty, which yet to this preſent is called, Moura des Mores, which they fortifyed, and then thither retyred about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand fighting men, who did much miſcheife ouer all Apulia, and in other Chriſtian places. Theſe ennemies of the faith of IESVS CHRIST came one day vnexpectedly towardes the cittye of Aſsiſium, who being already cloſe to the portes, a great number of them came to the Monaſtery of ſaint Damian, as a lewd and diſsloyall nation that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually thirſteth after the bloud of Chriſtians, and dareth to committ indifferently all kind of execrable actes, without either ſhame of men, or feare of God. Theſe Mores then brake euen into the Monaſtery of ſainte Clare, where ſhe was with her Religious daughters, who had their hartes ſurpriſed with an extreme terrour: but much more when they heard the barking and crye of thoſe dogges ſo neere them, ſo that they were euen dying with the apprehenſion, not knowing where to ſeeke reliefe, nor of whome to hope for deliuerance from ſo emminent perill, but by the merittes of their holy mother, Whome with infinite ſighes and teares, they aduertiſed of what they heard and ſaw.

As once in the night of the Natiuity when the world and Angels did ſo ſolemnly feaſt for the birth of our Redeemer, all the Religious went to the quier to Matines, and left their holy Mother accompanied only with her grieuous infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity: wherfore hauing begun to meditate on the great miſtery of that night, and lamenting exceedingly that ſhe could not aſsiſt att the diuine ſeruice, ſhe ſighing ſayd. O my God, thou ſeeſt how I remayne here alone! and ending this, ſhe began to heare the Mattins that were ſung in the Church of S. Francis in Aſsiſium, very diſtinctly vnderſtanding the voice of the Religious and the very ſound of the Organes: yet was ſhe not ſo neere the ſaid Church as ſhe might humanly heare what was ſong there: but it muſt neceſſarily be concluded, that this was miraculously don in one of theſe two ſortes: either that the ſinging of the ſaid Religious was by the will of God carryed to S. Clare, or her hearing was extended ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, and by ſpeciall grace of God, euen to our Lady of Angels neere vnto Aſsiſium. But this S. was further fauoured by a diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation, which exceedingly comforted and reioyced her for ſhe was by almighty God eſteemed worthy, to ſee in ſpirit his holy cribbe. The mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning following, her Religious comming to ſee her, ſhe ſayd: Deere ſiſters, bleſſed be our Lord IESVS CHRIST, that it hath pleaſed him, not to leaue me alone, as you haue don: but know that by the grace of his diuine Maieſty, I haue heard all the ſolemnity and all the ſeruice that this night hath bin performed in the Church of our holy Father S.

                  <p>Albeit this moſt prudent virgin had neuer ſtudyed, yet did ſhe much delight to heare a learned man preach, well knowing that vnder the wordes of ſcience lay hidden the ſweetnes of ſpiritt, which her ſelfe more ſubtility obtayned and taſted with more ſauour. She accuſtomed to ſay, that the ſermon of whoſoeuer preaching the word of God was exceeding profitable to ſoules, conſidering that it is no leſſe prudence to know how ſometimes to gather beautifull and ſweet flowers from a mong groſſe and rude thornes, then to eat fruittes of a good plant.</p>
                  <p>Pope Gregory the ninth one time att the inſtance of diuers Prelates, commanded that no Religious ſhould preach att the monaſterie of poore Religious women without his expreſſe permiſsion: wheratt the pittiful mother complayning, in regard that thenceforward her daughters ſhould ſeldome be ſpiritually fed with holy doctrine, with teares ſhe ſayd: Lett then all my Religions be taken hence, ſith they are taken away who gaue vs the food of ſpirituall life. And with all ſent away the Religious that appertayned to her monaſtery to ſerue them in getting almoſe abroad, refuſing to haue Religious that ſhould prouide them bread to reliefe the body, ſith they were depriued her that gaue them bread to nouriſh their ſoules.

                  <p>S.

And if ſhe found any ouer-much benummed with cold, or otherwiſe in ill diſpoſition through ſtrict obſeruation of the commune rigour, ſhe commanded them to take ſome recreation, till their neceſsities were ſatisfied. If any of her daughters were troubled with temptations, or were ſorrowfull or melancholie, ſhe would call her a part and louingly comfort her. Sometimes ſhe would fall to the feet of thoſe that were heauy and afflicted, to putt away the force of their griefe by her motherly cheriſhinges, for which they yelding themſelues to this their holy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did not proue ingratefull.

                  <p>POpe Gregory the ninth had a merueillous confidence in the prayers of ſaincte Clare, hauing experienced their great vertue &amp; efficacie, and often times when he was in any difficulty, both whiles he was Cardinall and biſhop of Hoſtia, and afterwardes when he was Pope, he would by letters recommend himſelfe to this glorious virgin, demaunding helpe of her, becauſe he knew of what importance her aſsiſtance was; this being in him not only a great humility, but alſo worthy to be dilligently imitated, to ſee the vicar of IESVS CHRIST on earth to begg helpe of a ſeruant of God, in reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe to her prayers. This great Paſtour knew well what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine loue could doe, and how freely pure virgins doe finde the port of the conſiſtory of the diuine Maieſty open. There is extant a very deuout letter of this Pope, written to ſaincte Clare whiles he was Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, which is here inſerted to make appeare that the ſpiritt of God made his reſidence in this Prelat, and what deuotion he carryed to the ſanctity of the glorious ſaincte Clare.</p>

Well beloued ſiſter in CHRIST IESVS, ſince the houre that the neceſsity of my retourne ſeparated me from your holy ſpeeches, and depriued me of that pleaſure to conferre with you of cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiall treaſures, I haue had much ſorrow of hart, abondance of teares in myne eyes, and haue felt an extreme griefe. In ſuch ſort that if I had not found att the feet of our Lord IESVS CHRIST the conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ordinary piety, I feare I had fallen into ſuch anguiſhes as my ſpiritt would haue forſaken me, and my ſoule would haue vtterly mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted away, and not without reaſon, becauſe that ioy failed me, with which I diſcourſed with your good company of the body of our Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer IESVS CHRIST and of his preſence on earth, celebrating the feaſt of Eaſter with you and the other ſeruantes of our Lord.

very diligently examine her, or cauſe her to be examined touching the Catholique Faith, and the holy ſacramentes of the Church. And if ſhe be found ſincerely faithfull in thoſe matters, and doe loyally confeſſe them, and promiſe entierly to obſerue them, and that ſhe be not marryed, or if hauing a husband he by conſent of the Biſhop of the Dioceſe become Religious, hauing vowed continencie, and ſhe not hauing other impediment, as ouer-aged or infirme, or want of iudgement, and diſcretion to obſerue ſuch courſe of life, lett the manner and rule of liuing be dilligently declared vnto her: then being found capable, the wordes of the goſpell be denounced vnto her, that ſhe goe and ſell all ſhe hath, and endeauour to diſtribute it vnto the poore: which if ſhe cannot effect, her good will ſhall ſuffice.

                  <p>OVr Redeemer IESVS CHRIST recompenced well the pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and good worckes of his beloued Virgin ſaincte Clare: for as ſhe was enflamed with an infinite loue of the miſteries of the holy croſſe, ſo by the vertue and power of the ſame croſſe, ſhe became noble in the ſignes &amp; miracles of IESVS CHRIST. Oftentimes in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the ſigne of the croſſe on the ſicke, they were miraculously cured, and indifferently of all ſortes of diſeaſes.</p>
                  <p>A Religious man called Stephen, hauing a hote feuer that exceedingly afflicted him, the holy Father ſainct Francis ſent him to ſaincte Clare, to make the ſigne of the croſſe vpon him, as one that well knew her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and vertue, which he exceedingly honoured. Now the Lady Hortulana mother of ſaincte Clare was then in the Couent of ſaint Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian: for a litle before, conſidering that her daughters had eſpouſed IESVS CHRIST, ſhe came to them to Religion, where this happy lady ſerued as a true Gardener in that Garden encloſed with thoſe virgins, our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, and with the glorious Agnes ſiſter to ſainte Clare, and the other Religious all repleniſhed with the holy Ghoſt, to whome the holy Father ſaint Francis ſent many diſeaſed whome they cured, after hauing made on them the ſigne of the croſſe, which they moſt hartely honoured. The ſayd Religious then being ſent to ſainte Clare, ſhe, as the daughter of obedience being therto com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the holy Father Saint Francis, preſently made on him the ſigne of the croſſe, then left him a litle to sleep in the Church, in the place where ſhe was accuſtomed to pray, and the Religious hauing a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le repoſed, aroſe ſound, ſecure, and freed of his infirmity: then he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned to ſaint Francis, by whome he had bene ſent to ſaint Damian, and conſequently was cured.</p>
                  <p>A child of three yeares old of the citty of Spoletum called Matthew, had by chaunce a ſtone thruſt into his noſe, whence it could not be got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out, ſo that the child was in extreme perill: whervpon he was brought to ſaincte Clare, who hauing made the ſigne of the croſſe on him, the ſtone incontinently fell out of his noſe, and he was perfectly well.</p>
                  <p>An other child of Peruſia hauing a filme on his eye was brought to ſainte Clare, who touching the eye of the child, and making the ſigne of the croſſe theron, willed them that had preſented the child vnto her,
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:27206:366"/>
to carry it vnto her mother that ſhe might alſo make the ſigne of the croſſe vpon it, which hauing done the eye became cleare, and being purged of the filme that obſcured it, he was preſently cured, whervpon ſainte Clare affirmed that this miracle was wrought by the merittes of her mother, who finding ſuch glory to be attributed vnto her, reputed her ſelfe vnworthy therof.</p>
                  <p>One of her Religious called Beneuanta, hauing had for twelue yeares together an impoſtume vnder her arme, which did purge by fiue ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall iſſues, ſaincte Clare had compaſsion therof and made on her the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſigne of the croſſe: then with her owne handes taking away the playſter, ſhe was cured of her long continued ſores. An other of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious called Aimia, being for more then a yeares ſpace afflicted with the dropſy, together with an extreme paine in her ſides and a burning feeuer, ſainte Clare conceaued a very ſtrong compaſsion of her, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hauing recourſe to her noble and infallible medicine, ſhe made on her body the ſigne of the croſſe in the name of her beloued IESVS CHRIST, &amp; the Religious was perfectly cured. An other ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God borne att Peruſia, had for two yeares ſo loſt her voice that one could ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely heare her ſpeake: but hauing vnderſtood by a viſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhe had the night of the Aſſuption of our Lady, that ſainte Clare ſhould cure her: the poore afflicted creature hauing very impatiently expected the breake of day, repayred with a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g confide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce vnto that holy virgin, and by ſignes craued her benedictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: which fauour hauing obtayned, her voice which ſo lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time ſhe had wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted, became as cleare and ſhrillas euer it had bin. An other Religious called Chriſtina that had bin lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g time deafe in one of her eares, &amp; had in vaine tried many remedies, S. Clare hauing made the ſigne of the croſſe on her head, &amp; with her ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d touched her eare, ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her hearing as perfectly and clearly as before. An other Religious called Andrea had a diſeaſe in her throat, the griefe wherof procured her much impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: it was admirable, that among ſo many prayers enflamed with diuine loue, there ſhould be a ſoule ſo cold, &amp; among ſuch prudent virgins, one ſo indiſcreet &amp; vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderate. This Religious feeling her ſelfe one night more torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted with her infirmity then ordinarily, afflicted &amp; impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that her paine did rather encreaſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diminiſh, ſhe ſo cruſhed &amp; preſſed her throat, that ſhe made appeare her intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to choake her ſelfe, thincking by viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to expell that ſwelling, ſo to auoyd longer torment &amp; by ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce attempting to doe more then was the will of God. But whiles that poore Religious buſied her ſelfe in this folly, ſaincte Clare by diuine inſpiration had knoledge therof, wherfore calling one of her Religious ſhe willed her to haſten downe and boyle an egge in the ſhell and cauſe ſiſter Andrea to ſwallow it, which done to bring her to her preſence. The Religious inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly dreſſed the egge, and forthwith brought
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:27206:366"/>
it to the ſicke party, whome ſhe found litle better then dead, hauing ſo cruſhed her throat that her ſpeech was vtterly gone, yet ſhe made her ſwallow the egge as wel as ſhe could: then raiſing her fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her ſtrawbed, ſhewith much labour led her to S. Clare, who thus ſpake vnto her: Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſiſter confeſſe thee to God, and haue contrition for what thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedſt to doe, and acknoledge that IESVS CHRIST will giue thee health far better then thou with thy owne handes haddeſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to doe: change thy euill life into a better, for thou ſhalt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer recouer an other ſickneſſe that ſhall ſucced this, but ſhalt dye therof. Theſe wordes procured in this Religious a ſpiritt of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punction and contrition, ſo that ſhe, being entierly cured of this grieuous infirmity, amended her life; and a litle after ſhe fell into an other ſicknes which ſaincte Clare had foretold, wherof ſhe ended her life piously.</p>
                  <p>It doth manifeſtly appeare by theſe examples and by many other mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueillous thinges, which this holy virgin wrought by this healthfull ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, that the tree of the croſſe of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST was deeply planted in her hart, and that in a merueillous manner the fruites did interiourly recreat her ſoule: ſith the leaues therof did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriourly worck ſuch remedies, by the handes and merittes of this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſainct.</p>

A litle after the Romane Court was att Peruſia, where the encreaſe of ſainte Clares ſickneſſe being diuulged, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of Hoſtia haſtened with great dilligence to viſite the eſpouſe of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SVS CHRIST, whoſe Father he was by office, Gouernour by ſpeciall ſollicitude, and Foſterer and friend in moſt pure and chaſt amitie; and her he comforted, applying and with his owne handes adminiſtring vnto her the moſt ſacred ſacrament of the Euchariſt, and then made a very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout ſermon vnto the Religious: ſainte Clare with great humility and in the name of our Redeemer IESVS CHRIST, beſought him to accept in recomme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation that her family, and all her other poore ſiſters of other Monaſteries: but aboue all ſhe moſt inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly beſought him, to obtaine of the Pope and the Colledge of Cardinalls, a priuiledge and confirmation of holy pouerty. Wherto the Cardinall gaue his word, and as a faithfull Protectour of her Religion, &amp; one moſt deuout and affectionat to ſaincte Clare, did afterwardes effect it: For Pope Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the fourth att her moſt inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t requeſt, confirmed the rule which the holy Father ſaint Francis had inſtituted for her, as is formerly recorded: of which rule S.

But Innocent the fourth ſeeing the perſeuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and laſt will of ſainte Clare, graunted the ſame vnto her by a bull, the eleuenth and laſt yeare of his raigne, as we haue before recorded. And the yeare being almoſt expired, the Pope came, with his Cardinals from Peruſia to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſium, wherin the firſt viſion touching the death of the holy virgin was accompliſhed: for the Pope being in his office more then a man, by the aucthority which he hath of IESVS CHRIST on earth, whoſe perſon he repreſenteth in the temple of the Church militant, the Cardinals ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying his holineſſe, repreſented the diſciples of our Lord IESVS CHRIST.</p>

Now then the members of this virgin being by continuance of her ſicknes as vtterly decayed, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re befell her a new weakenes, which being a token that ſhe ſhould in ſhort time be called of God, ſhe alſo vſed it as a ladder to mount to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſaluation. Whervpon the Pope, Innocent the fourth, came to the Monaſtery of ſaint Damian, accompanied with many Cardinals, to viſitt the ſeruant of God, not doubting but ſhe whoſe life he had already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, was the moſt perfect in ſanctity of all women of his time, and therfore worthy to haue her death honoured by his preſence. His holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe then being entred, he went directly to the glorious Virgin, and comming neere to her bed, he tendered her his hand to kiſſe, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour ſaincte Clare with exceeding ioy receaued.

                     <p>This Pouerty I haue alwayes bin carefull (with the grace of God) to obſerue, and to cauſe it to be obſerued: and for more ſurety of the ſame, I haue made my Profeſsion therof vnto our holy Father Pope Innocent the fourth in whoſe time we began, and haue confirmed it by his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours: that by no meanes in no time, we ſhould decline from this holy Pouerty, which we haue vowed vnto God and vnto ſaint Francis.

If it ſhould happen att any time that the ſaid ſiſters ſhould leaue their country or citty to goe vnto an other, they are firmely bound after my death in what place ſoeuer they are, to obſerue the holy pouerty, which they haue vowed vnto God and to ſaint Francis.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which ſhall be in office as alſo the other ſiſters, ſhalbe carefull not to receiue more land then extreme neceſsity doth require, as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                     <p>And for the charity of our Lord IESVS lett the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> keepe the vnio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of loue. The charity which you haue interiourly, ſhew it exteriourly by worc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, to the end that through your exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, the ſiſters who are called vnto your profeſsion, may encreaſe in the loue of God, &amp; mutuall charity. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I pray all thoſe who ſhalbe choſen in the offices of the ſiſters that they ſtudy to excell the others, rather in vertue and modeſt conuerſation, then in their office: to the end that by their example, the Siſters that were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto the religion before them, be moued to obey them, not only in reſpect of their office, but for loue. The Abbeſſe muſt be carefull &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet towardes her Siſters, as a good mother towardes her children. She muſt alſo haue a prouident care of euery one according to their neceſsity, of the almoſe which it ſhall pleaſe God to ſend her. She muſt withall be ſo ſweet and indifferent vnto all, that the ſiſters may with out feare or doubt, declare vnto her their neceſsity, and that they confidently haue recourſe vnto her, when the Abbeſſe and the Siſters ſhall thincke it to be neceſſary. The Siſters that are ſubiect, lett them remember that for the loue of God they haue renounced their owne willes, wherfore I will that they obey their mother, as they of their one accord promiſed vnto God to doe: to the end that their mother ſeeing the humility, charity, &amp; vnion which they haue vnto each other, may eaſily beare the chardge, with the office ſheſuſtaineth: and becauſe it is heauy &amp; bitter they muſt through their holy conuerſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, turne it into ſweetnes. And becauſe the way is narrow &amp; the gate ſtreight, which leadeth vnto life, &amp; few there are that walke in it, and few that perſeuer therin: bleſſed are they that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue receiued the grace to walke in it, and to perſeuer vnto the end: lett vs therfore be carefull, if we be entred in the way of our lord, that by out fault and negligence we doe not fall from the ſame: to the end that we committ not that iniury vnto our lord, to this bleſſed mother the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virgin Mary, to our holy Father ſainct Francis, and to the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant and militant church: for it is written, accurſed are they who decline from your commandement.

of ſuch greife exteriourly, it did enflame in them a more burning fire within: For thoſe eſpouſes of IESVS CHRIST were ſufficiently mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the rigour of Religion, albeit the force of greife did conſtraine the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to caſt forth loud cryes and ſighes, and to power out riuers of teares. The holy virgin att lenght being turned towardes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay vnto her ſoule, goe my ſoule, goe ſorth ſecurely; thou haſt an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured guide to performe this voyage: for he that is they Creatour, hath ſanctified thee, &amp; hath alwayes conſerued thee, affecting thee with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der loue, equall with that of a mother towardes her child. And thou my God, be prayſed for hauing created me. A Religious ſiſter asking her what ſhe meant therby: ſhe anſweared: I ſpeake to my bleſſed ſoule. Her moſt glorious Spouſe IESVS CHRIST was not far from her, &amp; atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for her. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tourning to one of her Religious, ſhe ſayd: Doe you not ſee my daughter, the king of glory whome I ſee? Almighty God alſo layd his hand on an other Religious, who ſaw with her corporall eyes thorough the teares that diſtilled from them, a glorious viſion; ſhe being pearced thorough with the dart of ſorrow, caſt her eyes towardes the gate of the houſe, and ſaw enter a great proceſsion of virgins richly cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in white, hauing each one a croune of gold on their head: but one of them appeared more beautifull, ſumptuous and glittering the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the reſt: For ſhe had on her head an imperiall crowne, garniſhed with precious ſtones, out of whoſe countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce proceeded a light ſo ſhining that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted the obſcurity of the night into cleare and bright day: It was with out doubt the glorious Virgin Mary, Queen of virgins, who came to the bed of the eſpouſe of her ſonne, to whome enclining ſhe graciously em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her, and incontinently ſhe was couered and the bed alſo by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther virgins with an extreme ſumptuous mantell. So the day following, which was the eleuenth of Auguſt, this holy ſoule aſcended to heauen, there to be crowned with perpetuall glory. Happy was her departure out of this miſerable life, ſith it was her entry into that of eternall feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie. For the faſtes which this S. performed in this exile, ſhe is now ioyfull and had her fill att the magnificall table of the cittizens of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and for the humility and baſeneſſe of her habite, ſhe is now gloriously attired with the glory of Paradiſe. The continuall ſighes and deſires which ſhe had for the preſence and loue of her deerly beloued Spouſe, are accompliſhed by the bleſſed viſion of God face to face, and by the aſſured fruition of the ſoueraigne good: leauing the way open to the example of ſanctity, that we blinded, and miſerable mortall creatures, reiecting theſe ſhort, falſe and deceiptfull pleaſures of this world, may purchaſe the permanent, true and aſſured that indure eternally.</p>

Each one preſently eſteemed her a ſainct, and called her the eſpouſe of IESVS CHRIST, accompayning their diſcourſes with great abondance of teares of deuotion. The officers of iuſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred thither accompanyed with many warlike Champions and a great nomber of armed men, which that night guarded the monaſtery, for feare that precious treaſure might be bereaued them.

So farre is this my griefe from slacking, that it continually encreaſeth: which as it had a beginning, ſo doe I beleeue it will finde no end in this world.

The S. replyed: I will cure this, as I did the other in thy throat: then ſhe vnbound the ſayd impoſtume, tooke of the plaiſter, and caſt it on the ground, then applyed therto the oyntment which her companion had brought, and inſtantly the child was perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Wherupon this holy Father being requeſted, yea importuned generally and particulerly, to inſtitute an Order and rule wherin ſeculer and marryed people might liue to doe penance, and to liue in a more ſecure eſtate for their ſaluation: The yeare 1221. he inſtiruted the Order of Generous Penitents, whereof all Chriſtians that liue not in monaſticall Religion might yet be me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers.
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:27206:382"/>
The firſt that entred this Order was an holy man called Lucius, and though no rule is found to be recorded att that time, nor forme of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing preſcribed by S. Francis, to theſe Penitents, yet it is moſt aſſured that he gaue them certaine rules, according to which they ſhould tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally and ſpiritually gouerne themſelues, were it to faſt, or pray, more then other ſeculers, to know what office and deuotions they ſhould vſe, what almoſe they ſhould giue, how they ſhould be cloathed, and what rigour of penance they ſhould vndertake: of which ordo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nances deliuered by S. Francis and recorded by them to whome he taught the ſame, Pope Nicolas the fourth cutt off one part, and left only that which was moſt eaſie inſtituting a rule, which here we will inſert, which was alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward confirmed by the Apoſtolicke ſea, by three moſt ample letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentes. And albeit the firſt and ancient habitt of theſe penitentes was afterwardes different in diuers prouinces, yet is it moſt probable, that the moſt common and general, was the ſame which thoſe of the third Order yet weare in Italy, as moſt conformable to their ſtatue. The colour is gray like to that of the Frere Minors; but the forme and faſhion is as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſeculers doe weare: and it is credible that S. Fra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cis his will was that the ſayd Penitentes ſhould weare this habitt, ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h in thoſe places where this Order was by him firſt inſtituted and where he moſt conuerſed, this manner of habit was vſed. Theſe ſayd Penitents may not weare the cord as the Frere Minors. Theſe of the third rul (which haue ſucceeded thoſe) who liue in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and are Religious by vow, can leſſe auouch the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a cord, but muſt vſe a leather belt.</p>
                  <p>And it is to be noted that the Frere Minors cannot receaue theſe Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents to the profeſsion of Religious obedience, or to any vow but only may admitt and receaue them to the ſayd rule of life and company of the Penitents, exhorting and admoniſhing them to obſerue the ſame. They may alſo aſsiſt them in confeſsion and other ſpiritual worckes as Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>freres and true Brethren of the Order. Neuertheles the Religious may not be their Prelates or Superiours, becauſe they are ſubiect to ſeculer &amp; eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction. Theſe Penitents may yet, as is practiſed in all their Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fraternityes, create an head or chefe by the title of Miniſter, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, or Priour, who ſhall haue care to aſſemble the Brethren att certaine times to conſult of matters touching their company.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo manifeſt that S. Francis alone, among al other authors of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions, did inſtitute and ordaine the Brethren and ſiſters of the third Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Penitents. And becauſe he had formerly inſtituted two rules, the one of Frere Minors, and the other of poore Siſters, this Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Penitents was called the third Order: thence is deriued their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination. Since that time ſome others Orders, principally the Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Freres endeauour to imitate S. Francis, and to inſtitute alſo other

But to the end more apparent knowledge may be had of this firſt and true Order of Penitentes, inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the holy Father S.

This holy princeſſe found much trouble with her husband the firſt yeare, not that he wanted ſufficient inclination to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, but by reaſon of the ill diſpoſition of thoſe of his counſaile, and of ſome particuler ſeruants and domeſticall officers of his, who inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and reputed the great humility of this worthy Princeſſe, for ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhnes and want of ciuility and Courtlie complements: and therfore did contemne and perſecute her to their vtmoſt. But by her continuall prayers ſhe obtayned of God many particuler graces, and namely that her husband ſhould not only not hinder her holy exerciſes, but ſhould be very ioyfull, the which incontinently came to paſſe.

                  <p>THis vertuous woman was ſo feruent in prayer, that ſhe neuer prayed without weeping, and yet in ſuch ſort as ſhe kept it vnknowne. In her prayer ſhe felt both ſorrow and ioy in her ſoule: ſhe would ſay that to weepe with force and heauineſſe was to ſhew an euill countenance vnto God. It once happened that being according to her cuſtome in prayer, her hart, eyes and han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des eleuated towardes heauen, her ſoule was ſo rapt and ſwallowed vp in God, that burning coales falling on a fold or plait of her gowne, burned a good part therof ſhe not perceiuing it, and had burned yet farther, if one of her ſeruantes paſsing by, had not haſtely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed the ſame: in doeing wherof ſhe cryed ſo loud that ſhe cauſed the pious lady to retourne to her ſelfe, who with her owne handes ſett a piece on that part of her gowne which was burned.

In the middeſt of the greateſt proſperity that ſhe euer had, ſhe alwayes deſired the eſtate of pouerty, to imitate and follow that of IESVS CHRIST in this life, ſhunning all pompe and worldly glory. By this fauour and holy deſire, ſhe would often being alone in her houſe with her friendes and ſeruantes, cloath her ſelfe poorly, affirming that if ſhe fell into pouerty, ſhe would in that ſort be cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed.

And therfore Father, obtaine you of his diuine maieſty the light of one eye, and I wil endeauour to pray for the other. And ſo both of them with great confidence and feruour falling to their prayers, the ſight of one eye was reſtored to the blind, and a litle after, the other. Wherin God ſhewed the difference of the meritts of the interceſſors, in that the ſight reſtored to the ſecond eye, was very much clearer, purer, and ſharper then the other.</p>

His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des were gracious and pleaſing conformable to the ſpiritt that deliuered them: and the better to attaine to the perfect contempt of himſelfe, he would often, for the loue of IESVS CHRIST, waſh the ſoares and vlceres of leapers with his one handes, and ſerue them with gteat fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour of deuotion, and with ſuch charity, as if with his owne eyes he had ſeene and ſerued IESVS CHRIST himſelfe. He behaued himſelfe towardes his ſubiectes and vaſſals, ouer whome he had entier iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as a iuſt lord, iudgeing their cauſes with a ſeuere clemencie, as one that could not be drawne from the right courſe of iuſtice by feare, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, fauour or corruption. This holy man proceeded in all actions by the vertue of diſcretion, wherwith he ſo te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pered his worckes of mercy, that therin he with exceeding humility auoyded worldly glory and fauour: and as a valiant and perfect warryer, he neuer deſiſted from his firſt inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and as iuſt, he withall his induſtry ſhunned the occaſions of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God. This ſeruant was ſo charitable and liberall to the poore, that neuer any demaunded of him an almoſe for the loue of God, but he gaue him a reward together with good wordes. All his care was to feed the hungry, to lodge pilgrimes, and haue care of poore ſick and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne creatures, as one that acknowledged the poore CHR.

neighbours, no leſſe was he, but much more repleniſhed with the loue of IESVS CHRIST. And knowing that the edifice of vertues hath its end in the perfection of holy prayer, in regard that it is a conuerſation and familiarity with God, he applyed himſelfe with all his endeauour to prayer and contemplation: he alſo ſayd the canonicall houres with ſuch deuotion and attention, as if he had bin in the viſible preſence of IESVS CHRIST.</p>

                  <p>This holy Confeſſour of IESVS CHRIST, changed this life for a better the yeare of grace 1327. Father Francis of Maronis, a famous prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher and Doctour was preſent att his death. The very daye of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture he appeared in all glory vnto his wife, (who was them in her Countie in Prouence) to whome he vttered theſe wordes of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt: The ſnare is broaken, and we are deliuered, and ſo without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther word he vaniſhed. The Conteſſe the ſame day recounted to all her company the death of her husband, it being the 27. day of September.
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:27206:400"/>
He was buryed in the church of the Cordeliers att Paris clothed in the habitt of the third Order, and the ſame yeare his body was translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Prouence to the Couent of Apte, in which his ſanctity was by many miracles diuulged; for which he was by the Apoſtolike ſea canonized.

                  <p>Att the death of this Counteſſe and till her body was enterred, a moſt ſweet harmony was heard in the aire, as they haue teſtified and aſſured who were neere her body. It is piously beleeued that they were Angels ſinging as true friendes of virginall purity. Our Lord wrought many miracles as well in the life time, as att the death of this holy woman, and in ſuch quantity, as there is no doubt but that our lord had canonized her in heauen.</p>

of great family, but of moſt vicious life: whither being come, weary, feeble, and halfe ſtarued with hungar and cold, not able to paſſe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they there ſtayed, without dreaming what danger might there befall them, and ſent to pray this tyrant, to entertayne, lodge, and refreſh them that night, for the loue of our Lord IESVS CHRIST. This noble man by diuine inſpiration, willingly receaued them into his houſe, and commanded incontinently a good fire to be made them, then cauſed them to cat with his people. At which time, one of the Religious that was a Prieſt, and had a ſpeciall grace in preaching well, perceauing that att this table there was no ſpeech but of robbing, kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and pilling, each one vaunting of his villanies, and glorying in his murders and theftes committed, the good ſeruant of God reſolued, after ſupper to make them an exhortation in the behalfe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour IESVS CHRIST, with the greateſt feruour he could procure. And ſo, grace being ſayd, vnable any longer to retaine his zealous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritt, he addreſſed himſelfe to the tyrant and ſayd: Hauing receaued of you ſuch a charity for the loue of God, we ſhould proue too ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full if we did not beſeech the diuine maieſty to reward you for vs, and did not endeauour to requite you by ſome documents conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our pouerty, that may benifitt your ſoules and your peoples, whome I beſeech you heere to aſſemble together, we deſiring to giue to you all, a ſpirituall refection for the corporal which you haue giuen vs. This noble man hauing conuocated all his people, and they hauing ſetled themſelues to heare the ſermon, the Religious began with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding feruour to diſcourſe of the glory of Paradiſe, in theſe termed: My beloued Brethren in CHRIST IESVS, if the eternall felicities, for which God hath created vs, were knowne vnto vs, and that we did often well conſider them, what paine would we not vndertake to ſerue him, and neuer to offend him, for feare to looſe that ioy and glory without end, for ſo baſe a trifle as the world? that ſweet ſociety of the Angels? that life and ſecurity of the bleſſed? that glorious ſatiety of the elect? that ſupreme light without night and darcknes? that perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall peace and amity without any feare or perturbance? and all the happines that we can deſire, free and ſecure from all diſaſter, with that diuine fountaine of the preſence and glorious commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the eternall God?

Now the Religious att his houre layd himſelfe to repoſe, and when he thought they all slept, he aroſe &amp; went out of the houſe, to doe penance for the penitent as he had promiſed him. Lifting then his handes to heauen, he with many teares dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded pardon of almighty God for the ſinner, &amp; praying with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding feruour, his body was eleuated fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the earth the hight of a tour, &amp; in that manner, bitterly bewayled the ſoule of that noble man, begging pardon of IESVS CHRIST for his offences in ſuch ſort and with a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ſo paſsionate, that he merited to be heard, as appeareth by what enſueth: for the penitent hauing ſeene and heard all this, not without exceeding terrour, contrition and abundance of teares, accompanyed with conſolation, perceauing with what feruour the ſeruant of God offered his prayers to the diuine Maieſty for the ſaluation of his ſoule: very early in the morning he ſell att the feet of the Religious, praying him with great compunction to ſetle him in the direct way of ſaluation, he being ready to execute whatſoeuer he ſhould command him.

The deuil taking on him humane ſhape became his ſeruant and ſo diligently ſerued him, that he ſhortly committed vnto him the gouernment of his houſe and the abſolute diſpoſition and management of his affaires, following his counſaile in all his buſineſſe.

                  <p>An other Religious was tempted with deſire to viſite his kinred, and leaue being refuſed him by the Prouinciall, he ſayd to himſelfe: I will goe, and they ſhall ſee who can force me to retourne: and preſently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further licence departed.

                  <p>Sometime after a yong gentleman of very delicat conſtitution being admitted into the Order of the Frere Minors, began (by diabolicall te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) to haue his habitt in ſuch horrour, that he ſeemed to carry on him a moſt baſe and abhominable burden.

Which hauing done the ſame morning that he had purpoſed to depart, he was as it were conſtrayned to kneele before the altare, and att the inſtant had this merueillous viſion: He ſaw an infinite multitude of Religious that paſſed two and two in proceſsion before the altare, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in moſt rich and gorgious attire, hauing their face, and handes, and whatſoeuer exterio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
