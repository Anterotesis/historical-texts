         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To thoſe Presbyterian Miniſters
and others, who are unſatisfied with
the lawfulneſs of giving thanks to
GOD for the ſhedding
of blood.</head>
            <p>THe objection of a Friend at our
late meeting was, that he was
unſatisfied in his Judgment,
that it is lawfull to rejoyce at the
ſheding of blood, though it were
granted to be in the diſtruction
of an Enemy. To which I anſwer; That conſidering
of it ſimply of it ſelf, it is a ſad thing, and a matter
rather of ſorrow then rejoycing, to ſee ſo Noble a
Creature as man, to looſe his life in ſuch a manner,
but as it is to be conſidered in the relative, and by
the effects and drift of the Enemy, which ſought for
our lives, Liberty, and Freedome, even in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of God; I ſay if men become thus ſtubborn
and wilfull, their destruction becomes a matter of
joy and delight. <hi>Then ſhall the righteous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
and be glad. Syon heard and was glad
and the Daughters of Judah rejoyced, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of thy Judgments O Lord.</hi> Pſal. 97. 8.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:169735:3"/>
               <hi>He caſteth the wicked to the ground, ſing
unto the Lord with Thankſgiving.</hi> Theſe
places ſhew the behaviour of the righteous, when
God ariſeth and putteth forth his ſtrength for the
deſtruction of his Enemies, <hi>They exceedingly
rejoyce: Pſal.</hi> 68, 1, 2 and they expreſſe that Joy
before the Lord verſe 3. from which places it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Church and people of God when they
have victorie, are enjoyned to rejoyce, from whence I
conclude, that ſolemn dayes of Tanksgiving for
Victories obtained, are not only lawfull, but enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as a duty, and when the people of God, do come
before God to perform this duty, they ought <hi>excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
to rejoyce,</hi> Pſ. 58. 10. <hi>The righteous
ſhall rejoyce when he ſeeth the vengeance, he
ſhall waſh his feet in the blood of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
what vengeance this is you may ſee in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
verſe where the wicked are deſtroyed like thorns
under a Pet. Gen. 15. 19. <hi>Melchiſedick bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
God for the Victory and ſucceſſe given
unto</hi> Abraham. And when the Lord drowned
<hi>Pharoh</hi> and all his Hoaſt: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Meriam</hi>
rejoyced and ſung praiſes unto God, <hi>Judges</hi> 5. So
when <hi>David</hi> was compaſſed about with many Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and the Lord had ſcattered them, the voice
of joy and gladnes was in every godly heart, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there is great reaſon why it ſhould be ſo, for
God is much glorified in this work of power, we ſee
when <hi>Pharohs</hi> Chariot wheels flew off, then he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:169735:3"/>
that God fought for <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 14.
and the like in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 13. &amp;c Now are the ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mies
of God by this means, brought to glorifie God,
and ſhall not his own people in whom he puts forth
his power, give evidence of thank fulneſſe unto him.
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 50 23 He that offereth praiſe and thanks,
glorifieth God. Again, this joy and gladnes comes
from the benefits that come to Gods people, when
their Enemies are deſtroyed. Firſt their ſubduing
of the Enemy gives them the more freedom and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in the ſervice of God, as when <hi>Saul</hi> was dead,
then <hi>David</hi> could frequent the Sanctuary. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it gives evidence of Gods favour, to be renewed
and confirmed to his people, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but reign Pſal. 41. 11. <hi>By this I know thou
favoureſt me, becauſe mine Enemy doth not
triumph over me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far have I thought good, briefly to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
theſe Meditations unto you, which if you
pleaſe to ponder and conſider ſeriouſly of, I hope not
only your ſelf, but others of the Presbyterian Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
will be ſo far from cenſuring us, that they will
joyn with us in this Heavenly duty, from whence
doth ariſe an over flow or breaking forth of the ſpirit
into Songs of joy and gladneſs.</p>
