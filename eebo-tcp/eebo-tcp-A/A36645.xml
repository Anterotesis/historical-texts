            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>When I entered the library of Mr. Laurence Hutton some time ago I did not at first know whether most to admire the studious quiet of the room itself, the bric-à-brac on the tables, the etchings and odd plates on the walls, or the books on the shelves. I decided finally in favor of the books.</p>
            <p>Old plays and collections of old playbills, a rare old edition of 'The British Essayists;' an original edition of Fielding's 'Pamela's Conduct in High Life,' (second edition, 1741;) a scarce continuation of the genuine 'Pamela,' by an unauthentic Samuel Richardson. These and many more tempt the eye and hand. I have no time (to mention what beautiful work in an illustrating way Mr. Hutton is making of a copy of Stedman's 'Poets of America.' I have not time to speak of the original edition of Dryden's 'Marriage à la Mode,' bound by Rivière, presented to mine host, on the occasion of his wedding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by Edmund Gosse.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Humbly Dedicate to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship that Poem, of which you were pleas'd to appear an early Patron, before it was Acted on the Stage. I may yet go farther, with your permission, and say, That it receiv'd amendment from your noble hands, e're it was fit to be presented. You may please likewise to remember, with how much favour to the Authour, and indulgence to the Play, you commended it to the view of His Majesty,
<pb facs="tcp:54741:4"/>
then at <hi>Windsor,</hi> and by His Approbation of it in Writing, made way for its kind reception on the <hi>Theatre.</hi> In this Dedication therefore, I may seem to imitate a Custom of the Ancients, who offer'd to their Gods the Firstlings of the Flock, which I think they call'd <hi>Ver Sacrum,</hi> because they help'd 'em to increase. I am sure, if there be any thing in this Play, wherein I have rais'd my self beyond the ordinary lowness of my Comedies, I ought wholly to acknowledge it to the favour, of being admitted into your Lordship's Conversation. And not onely I, who pretend not to this way, but the best Comick Writers of our Age, will joyn with me to acknowledge, that they have copy'd the Gallantries of Courts, the Delicacy of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, and the Decencies of Behaviour, from your Lordship, with more success, then if they had taken their Models from the Court of <hi>France.</hi> But this, my Lord, will be no wonder to the world, which knows the excellencie of your Natural parts, and those you have acquir'd in a Noble Education. That which with more reason I admire, is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so absolute a Courtier, you have not forgot, either the ties of Friendship, or the practise of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity. In my little Experience of a Court (which I confess I desire not to improve) I have found in it much of Interest, and more of Detraction: Few men there have that assurance of a Friend, as not to be made ridiculous by him, when they are absent. There are a midling sort of Courtiers, who become
<pb facs="tcp:54741:4"/>
happy by their want of wit; but they supply that want, by an excess of malice to those who have it. And there is no such persecution as that of fools: they can never be considerable enough to be talk'd of themselves; so that they are safe onely in their obscurity, and grow mischievous to witty men, by the great diligence of their envy, and by being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways present to represent and aggravate their faults. In the mean time they are forc'd, when they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be pleasant, to live on the Offalls of their Wit, whom they decry; and either to quote it, (which they do unwillingly) or to pass it upon others for their own. These are the men who make it their business to chase Wit from the Knowledge of Princes, lest it should disgrace their ignorance. And this kind of malice your Lordship has not so much avoided, as surmounted. But if by the excellent temper of a Royal Master, always more ready to hear good than ill, if by his inclination to love you, if by your own merit and address, if by the charmes of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, the Grace of your Behaviour, your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Greatness and Habitude in Courts, you having been able to preserve your self with Honour in the midst of so dangerous a Course; yet at least the remembrance of those Hazards has inspir'd you with pity for other men, who being of an inferiour Wit and Quality to you, are yet Persecuted, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in Little, which your Lordship is in Great. For the quarrel of those people extends it self to any
<pb facs="tcp:54741:5"/>
thing of sense; and if I may be so vain to own it amongst the rest of the Poets, has sometimes reach'd to the very borders of it, even to me. So that, if our general good fortune had not rais'd up your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to defend us, I know not whether any thing had been more ridiculous in Court, than Writers. 'Tis to your Lordship's favour we generally owe our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Patronage: And to the Nobleness of your Nature, which will not suffer the least shadow of your Wit to be contemn'd in other men. You have been often pleas'd not onely to excuse my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections, but to vindicate what was tolerable in my Writings from their censures And what I never can forget, you have not onely been careful of my Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but of my Fortune. You have been Sollicitous to supply my neglect of my self; and to overcome the fatal Modesty of Poets, which submits them to perpetual wants, rather then to become importunate with those people, who have the liberality of Kings in their disposing; and who dishonouring the Bounty of their Master, suffer such to be in necessity, who endeavour at least to please him: and for whose en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment He has generously provided, if the Fruits of His Royal favour were not often stopp'd in other hands. But your Lordship has given me occasion, not to complain of Courts, whil'st you are there. I have found the effects of your Mediation in all my Concernments; and they were so much the more noble in you, because they were wholly voluntary.
<pb facs="tcp:54741:5"/>
I became your Lordship's (if I may venture on the Similitude) as the world was made, without knowing him who made it; and brought onely a passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to be your Creature. This Nobleness of yours I think my self the rather oblig'd to own, because otherwise it must have been lost to all remembrance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for you are endued with that excellent quality of a frank Nature, to forget the good which you have done.</p>
            <p>But, my Lord, I ought to have consider'd, that you are as great a Judge, as you are a Patron; and that in praising you ill, I shall incurre a higher note of ingratitude, then that I thought to have avoided. I stand in need of all your accustom'd goodness for the Dedication of this Play: which though, perhaps<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it be the best of my Comedies, is yet so faulty, that I should have fear'd you, for my Critick, if I had not with some policy given you the trouble of being my Protector. Wit seems to have lodg'd it self more Nobly in this Age, than in any of the former: and people of my mean condition, are onely Writers, because some of the Nobility, and your Lordship in the first place, are above the narrow praises which Poesie could give you. But let those who love to see themselves exceeded, encourage your Lordship in so dangerous a quality: for my own part, I must confess, that I have so much of self-interest, as to be content with reading some Papers of your Verses, without desiring you should proceed to a Scene or Play: with
<pb facs="tcp:54741:6"/>
the common prudence of those, who are worsted in a Duel, and declare they are satisfied when they are first wounded. Your Lordship has but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther step to make, and from the Patron of Wit, you may become its Tyrant: and Oppress our little Reputations with more ease then you now protect them. But these, my Lord, are designs, which I am sure you harbour not; any more then the <hi>French King</hi> is contriving the Conquest of the <hi>Swissers.</hi> 'Tis a barren Triumph, which is not worth your pains, and wou'd onely rank him amongst your Slaves, who is already,</p>

            <head>Prologue.</head>
            <l>LOrd, how reform'd and quiet we are grown,</l>
            <l>Since all our Braves and all our Wits are gone:</l>
            <l>Fop-corner now is free from Civil War:</l>
            <l>White-Wig and Vizard make no longer jar.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>France,</hi> and the Fleet, have swept the Town so clear,</l>
            <l>That we can Act in peace, and you can hear.</l>
            <l>'Twas a sad sight, before they march'd from home,</l>
            <l>To see our Warriours, in Red Wastecoats, come,</l>
            <l>With hair tuck'd up, into our Tireing-room.</l>
            <l>But 'twas more sad to hear their last Adieu,</l>
            <l>The Women sob'd, and swore they would be true;</l>
            <l>And so they were, as long as e're they cou'd:</l>
            <l>But powerful <hi>Guinnee</hi> cannot be withstood,</l>
            <l>And they were made of Play house flesh and bloud.</l>
            <l>Fate did their Friends for double use ordain,</l>
            <l>In Wars abroad, they grinning Honour gain,</l>
            <l>And Mistresses, for all that stay, maintain.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:54741:7"/>Now they are gone, 'tis dead Vacation here,</l>
            <l>For neither Friends nor Enemies appear.</l>
            <l>Poor pensive Punk now peeps ere Plays begin,</l>
            <l>Sees the bare Bench, and dares not venture in:</l>
            <l>But manages her last Half crown with care,</l>
            <l>And trudges to the <hi>Mall,</hi> on foot, for Air.</l>
            <l>Our City Friends so far will hardly come,</l>
            <l>They can take up with Pleasures nearer home;</l>
            <l>And see gay Shows, and gawdy Scenes elsewhere:</l>
            <l>For we presume they seldom come to hear.</l>
            <l>But they have now ta'n up a glorious Trade,</l>
            <l>And cutting Moorcraft, struts in Masquerade.</l>
            <l>There's all our hope, for we shall show to day,</l>
            <l>A Masquing Ball, to recommend our Play:</l>
            <l>Nay, to endear 'em more, and let 'em see,</l>
            <l>We scorn to come behind in Courtesie,</l>
            <l>We'll follow the new Mode which they begin,</l>
            <l>And treat 'em with a Room, and Couch within:</l>
            <l>For that's one way, how e're the Play fall short,</l>
            <l>T' oblige the Town, the City, and the Court.</l>

                     <p>If I have err'd, Madam, I hope you'l pardon the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity of a Stranger; for I may well call my self so, after five years absence from the Court: But you have freed me from one error.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Dor.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought good voices, and ill faces, had been insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; and that to be fair and sing well, had been onely the priviledge of Angels.</p>

                     <speaker>Dor.</speaker>
                     <p>And how many more of these fine things can you say to me?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>
                     <p>Very few, Madam, for if I should continue to see you some hours longer: You look so killingly, that I should be mute with wonder.</p>

                     <p>This will not give you the reputation of a Wit with me: you travelling Monsieurs live upon the stock you have got a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, for the first day or two: to repeat with a good memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and apply with a good grace, is all your wit. And, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54741:9"/>
your Gullets are sew'd up, like Cormorants: When you have regorg'd what you have taken in, you are the leanest things in Nature.</p>

                     <p>Then, Madam, I think you had best make that use of me; let me wait on you for two or three days together, and you shall hear all I have learnt of extraordinary, in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys: And one thing which I never saw till I came home, that is, a Lady of a better voice, better face, and better wit, than any I have seen abroad. And, after this, if I should not declare my self most passionately in love with you, I should have less wit than yet you think I have.</p>

                     <speaker>Dor.</speaker>
                     <p>A very plain, and pithy Declaration. I see, Sir, you have been travelling in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or some of the hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, where men come to the point immediately. But are you sure these are not words of course? For I would not give my poor heart an occasion of complaint against me, that I engag'd it too rashly, and then could not bring it off.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>
                     <p>Your heart may trust it self with me safely; I shall use it very civilly while it stays, and never turn it away, without fair warning to provide for it self.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Dor.</speaker>
                     <p>First, then, I do receive your passion with as little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, on my part, as ever you gave it me, on yours. And now see what a miserable wretch you have made your self.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>

                     <p>In one word, I am marry'd; wretchedly marry'd; and have been above these two years. Yes, faith, the Devil has had power over me, in spight of my Vows and Resolutions to the contrary.</p>

                     <p>And is not that enough?

                     <p>The truth is, your disease is very desperate; but, though you cannot be cur'd, you may be patch'd up a little; you must get you a Mistress, <hi>Rhodophil:</hi> that, indeed, is living upon Cordials; but, as fast as one fails, you must supply it with another. You're like a Gamester, who has lost his estate; yet, in doing that, you have learn'd the advantages of Play, and can arrive to live upon't.</p>

                     <speaker>Rho.</speaker>
                     <p>One of the Stars of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> I assure you: Young enough, fair enough, and, but, for one quality, Just such a woman as I would wish.</p>

                     <speaker>Pala,</speaker>
                     <p>O Friend, this is not an age to be critical in Beauty: when we had good store of handsome women, and but few Chapmen, you might have been more curious in your choice;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54741:11"/>
but now the price is enhanc'd upon us, and all Mankind set up for Mistresses, so that poor little creatures, without beauty, birth, or breeding, but onely impudence, go off at unreasonable rates: and a man, in these hard times, snaps at 'em, as he does at Broad-gold, never examines the weight, but takes light, or heavy, as he can get it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Rho.</speaker>
                     <p>But my Mistris has one fault that's almost unpardonable; for, being a Town-Lady, without any relation to the Court, yet she thinks her self undone, if she be not seen there three or four times a day, with the Princess <hi>Amalthea.</hi> And for the King, she haunts, and watches him so narrowly in a morning, that she pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents even the Chymists who beset his Chamber, to turn their Mercury into his Gold.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet, hitherto, me-thinks, you are no very unhappy man.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Rho.</speaker>
                     <p>With all this, she's the greatest Gossip in Nature; for, besides the Court, she's the most eternal Visiter of the Town: and yet manages her time so well, that she seems ubiquitary. For my part, I can compare her to nothing but the Sun; for, like him, she takes no rest, nor ever sets in one place, but to rise in another.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>
                     <p>I confess she had need be handsome with these qualities.</p>

                     <speaker>Rho.</speaker>
                     <p>No Lady can be so curious of a new Fashion, as she is of a new French-word; she's the very Mint of the Nation; and as fast as any Bullion comes out of <hi>France,</hi> coins it immediately into our Language.</p>

                     <p>No naming; that's not like a Cavalier: Find her, if you can, by my description; and I am not so ill a painter, that I need write the name beneath the Picture.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>

                     <p>'Tis yet in the bud, and what fruit it may bear I cannot tell; for this insufferable humour, of haunting the Court, is so predominant, that she has hitherto broken all her assignations with me, for fear of missing her visits there.</p>

                     <speaker>Pala.</speaker>
                     <p>That's the hardest part of your adventure: but, for ought I see, Fortune has us'd us both alike; I have a strange kind of Mistris too in Court, besides her I am to marry.</p>

                     </l>
                     <l>Our last great King,</l>
                     <l>Had, by his Queen, one onely Son, an Infant</l>
                     <l>Of three years old, call'd, after him, <hi>Theagenes</hi>;</l>
                     <l>The General, this <hi>Polydamas,</hi> then marri'd:</l>
                     <l>The publick Feasts for which were scarcely past,</l>
                     <l>When a Rebellion in the heart of <hi>Sicily</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Call'd out the King to Arms.</l>

                     <l>His temper was too warlike to accept it:</l>
                     <l>He left his Bride, and the new joys of marriage,</l>
                     <l>And follow'd to the Feild. In short, they fought,</l>
                     <l>The Rebels were o'rcome; but in the Fight</l>
                     <l>The too bold King receiv'd a mortal wound.</l>
                     <l>When he perceiv'd his end approaching near,</l>
                     <l>He call'd the General, to whose care he left</l>
                     <l>His Widow Queen, and Orphan Son; then dy'd.</l>

their time to swarm, and invade the Presence.

Now am I confident we had all four the same design: 'tis a pretty odd kind of game this, where each of us plays for double stakes: this is just thrust and parry with the same motion; I am to get his Wife, and yet to guard my own Mistris. But I am vilely suspitious, that, while I conquer in the Right Wing, I shall be routed in the Left: for both our women will certainly betray their party, because they are each of them for gaining of two, as well as we; and I much fear,

                     <p>Were I a woman, Oh how you'd admire me! cry up every word I said, and scrue your face into a submissive smile; as I have seen a dull Gallant act Wit, and counterfeit pleasantness, when he whispers to a great Person in a Play-house; smile, and look briskly, when the other answers, as if something of extraordinary had past betwixt 'em, when, heaven knows, there was nothing else but, What a clock does your Lordship think it is? and my Lord's <hi>repertee</hi> is, 'Tis almost Park-time: or, at most, Shall we out of the Pit, and go behind the Scenes for an Act or two?

                     <p>Ay, Boy; there's Dame Nature in the case: he who cannot find wit in a Mistris, deserves to find nothing else, Boy. But these are riddles to thee, child, and I have not leisure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct thee; I have affairs to dispatch, great affairs; I am a man of business.</p>

                     <p>You are mistaken, Sir; I would onely have you show me a more lawful reason why you would leave me, then I can why you should not, and I'll not stay you; for I am not so young, but I understand the necessities of flesh and bloud,

                     <p>Yet, if I might advise you, Sir, you should not delay it: for your younger Brother comes up with 'em, and is got alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy into their favours. He has gain'd much upon my old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, by finding fault with Inn-keepers Bills, and by starving us, and our Horses, to show his frugality; and he is very well with your Mistris's Father, by giving him Receipts for the Splene, Gout, and Scurvy, and other infirmities of old age.</p>

I remember him before I travell'd, he had nothing in him but meer Jocky; us'd to talk loud, and make matches, and was all for the crack of the field: sense and wit were as much banish'd from his discourse, as they are when the Court goes out of Town to a Horse-race.

                     <p>Quite contrary: the Letter could never have come in a more lucky minute; for it found her in an ill humour with a Rival of yours, that shall be nameless, about the pronuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>French</hi> word.</p>

                     <p>Lord, you have the softest hand, Sir! it would do a woman good to touch it: Count <hi>Rhodophil</hi>'s is not half so soft; for I remember I felt it once, when he gave me ten Pieces for my New-years gift.</p>

                     <p>What dost think of a blessed community betwixt us four, for the solace of the women, and relief of the men? Methinks it would be a pleasant kind of life: Wife and Husband for the standing Dish and Mistris and Gallant for the Desert.</p>

                     <l>Those hours I have to live, which Heav'n in pity</l>

                     <l>The greatest part, in pray'rs for you; the rest</l>
                     <l>In mourning my unworthiness.</l>

            <head>Epilogue.</head>
            <l>THus have my Spouse and I inform'd the Nation,</l>
            <l>And led you all the way to Reformation.</l>
            <l>Not with dull Morals, gravely writ, like those,</l>
            <l>Which men of easie Phlegme, with care compose.</l>
            <l>Your Poet's of stiff words, and limber sense,</l>
            <l>Born on the confines of indifference.</l>
            <l>But by examples drawn, I dare to say,</l>
            <l>From most of you, who hear, and see the Play.</l>
            <l>There are more <hi>Rhodophils</hi> in this Theatre,</l>
            <l>More <hi>Palamedes,</hi> and some few Wives, I fear.</l>
            <l>But yet too far our Poet would not run,</l>
            <l>Though 'twas well offer'd, there was nothing done.</l>
            <l>He would not quite the Woman's frailty bare,</l>
            <l>But stript 'em to the waste, and left 'em there.</l>
            <l>And the men's faults are less severely shown,</l>
            <l>For he considers that himself is one.</l>
            <l>Some stabbing Wits, to bloudy Satyr bent,</l>
            <l>Would treat both Sexes with less complement:</l>
            <l>Would lay the Scene at home, of Husbands tell,</l>
            <l>For Wenches, taking up their Wives i' th' Mell,</l>
            <l>And a brisk bout which each of them did want,</l>
            <l>Made by mistake of Mistris and Gallant.</l>
            <l>Our modest Authour, thought it was enough</l>
            <l>To out you off a Sample of the stuff:</l>
            <l>He spar'd my shame, which you, I'm sure, would not,</l>
            <l>For you were all for driving on the Plot:</l>
            <l>You sigh'd when I came in to break the sport,</l>
            <l>And set your teeth when each design fell short.</l>
            <l>To Wives, and Servants all good wishes lend,</l>
            <l>But the poor Cuckold seldom finds a friend.</l>
            <l>Since therefore Court and Town will take no pity,</l>
            <l>I humbly cast my self upon the City.</l>
            <trailer>FINIS.</trailer>
