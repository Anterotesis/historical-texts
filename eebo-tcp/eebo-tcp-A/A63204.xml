            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We will not trouble you with the large Evidence of the Riſing, as we did yeſterday; but we will prove theſe things upon him, that he undertook to do it, that he was concerned with the reſt of the Confederates: we ſhall ſhew you this is not a new thing, but he hath been an old Rebel, for this hath not been a new Project, but hath been acting ſeveral Years. Five Years ago, when the King attended my Lord Mayors Show, he undertook to kill him off of <hi>Bow-Church.</hi> We ſhall call our Witneſſes, and prove it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon him.</p>

He was at my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber once; ſays he, Maſter ſhall we do nothing?

I asked him what buſineſs? ſays he, either a brisk Puſh (that I took for an Inſurrection) for the two Brothers; ſays I, what Brothers do you mean? Says he, the Captain and Lieutenant: thoſe were the two Terms they uſed ſince the <hi>Van herring</hi> was Printed.

Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, when Sir <hi>Francis Chaplain</hi> was Lord Mayor, his Majeſty and the Duke ſtood at Mr. <hi>Waldoe</hi>'s Houſe. by reaſon of the Angel Houſe being ſhaken. And he came to my houſe and told me, he would diſcourſe me upon ſome private matter; I called him into a Cloſet, and he told me they had a fair opportunity to take off the King and the Duke at once; I told him that would do very well, but how will you do it? Says he, we will do it with Croſs-bows, we are to be half a dozen, and we will go into the Steeple, where there is a Window juſt oppoſite to the Balcony, and a great deal of Diſcourſe we had to this purpoſe. My intent was to divert him from this Deſign, and told him how impoſſible it was they ſhould eſcape the Foot-Guards, and Horſe-Guards, and multitude of People: And if he did not do the Buſineſs effectually, he would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, and all the Party. I reſted ſatisfied he would have deſiſted upon this. But I knew the Principles of theſe Fifth Monarchy Men, and their Aſſociates, and thought it not ſafe to truſt to his bare ſay ſo, that he would deſiſt, but I went to the King and the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> into my Lord Chamberlains Chamber, where they came to me, and I gave them this Account, and deſired them to ſet ſome to watch the place, and to ſearch if any were got into the Steeple before they came; and there was one <hi>Horſal</hi> appointed, that did accordingly watch them, but none came: Upon which ſome Good-willers to it have have reported that it was a Sham buſineſs, but I think that was not well done.

               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. J.</speaker>
               <p>You hear what Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler</hi> ſays of the Croſs bows you deſigned to kill the King with, what ſay you to that?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hone.</speaker>
               <p>I ſay, there was a perſon told me of ſuch a thing; and I told Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> immediately of it. The perſon that told me was a Shop-keeper, and I don't know him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You named three Perſons to the King, that were Confederates with you, but you came to me of your ſelf.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Look you, your ſelf was one of the wicked Undertakers in that Traiterous, Deſign.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hone.</speaker>
               <p>No, I did never deſign it, but I was told it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, that your ſelf and ſome other good Fellows were ingaged in the Deſign.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hone.</speaker>
               <p>I was not ingaged, only as I was told by a Fellow, that there was a Shop-keeper lived hard by that would do ſuch a thing, and I immediately told Sir <hi>Nicholas Butler.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Come, 'tis in vain for you to mince the matter, for here is a full Evidence againſt you: The beſt you can do for your Advantage now, is, to conſider well with your ſelf, and repent of this wicked Deſign. What Religion do you profeſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hone.</speaker>
               <p>Religion, my Lord?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, any or none?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hone.</speaker>
               <p>My Lord, I hear ſeveral ſorts of Men, ſometimes Baptiſts, ſometimes Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and ſometimes the Presbyterians.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>L. C. J.</speaker>
               <p>But regard none. Look you, Gentlemen of the Jury, you hear a plain caſe of a barbarous Murder deſigned upon the King, one of the horrideſt Treaſons that hath been heard of in the World, to have ſhot the King and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> in their Coaches, as they were coming upon the Road. You have had full Evidence of this Mans being one of them; and therefore I am of opinion, that you muſt find him Guilty.</p>
               <stage>So the Jury brought the Priſoner in Guilty, without going out of Court.</stage>
               <p>
                  <hi>And on</hi> 
                  <date>Saturday July 14.</date> 
                  <hi>Mr. Recorder gave Judgment againſt him, as follows;</hi>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That you be carried back again, to the place from whence you came, and from thence be drawn upon an Hurdle to the place of Execution; where you shall be hanged up by the neck, but cut down alive, your Entrals and Privy Members cut from your Body, and burnt in your ſight, your Head to be ſevered from your Body, and your Body divided into four Parts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed at the Kings pleaſure. And the Lord have Mercy upon your Soul.</hi>
                  </p>
