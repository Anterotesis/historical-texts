         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

have ever since, and still do, go in travail with it; for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ever since that time I parted from you, at your then
house at <hi>Islington,</hi> I never scarce enjoyed a good hour all
along of those leaves, what with reproaches now, threats
<pb facs="tcp:34174:3"/>

               </note> but how? and how far? you
shall briefly otherwise be informed, onely let me add, may
the Lord send us less Law, and more Iustice, hoping that
those worthies and you, whom God hath so signally owned,
and who already have done so great things, and much
more is expected from, will hold it no great matter of
difficulty, to relieve and rescue a poor oppressed friend
(suffering in, and for your Cause) from the phangs of
Laws &amp; malicious Malignants. Indeed I did lately, in the
late <hi>L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Protectors</hi> time, make some speciall applications
to those of my Country-men eminent about him, for my
protection and indempnity, but they were so intent upon
their ambition, that they would not remember poor <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
and what was offered in my behalfe to their Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
they did not Christian-like lay it to their hearts,
but courtier-like clap it in their pockets, for which I wish
them forgiveness; But Sir, these leaves, whatever their
matter and handling is, I am sure their tendency is good,
the first Edition was three years past, to the then <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor;</hi>
but still my said Country-men, to whose hands, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a chargeable winter journey, I trusted them (it seems
jealous they should tell some tales) still obstructed them.
This second Edition because mostly occasioned, through
some passages unto me,<note place="margin">M. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</note> in order to them from an excellent
man (whose name I know it precious to you and all good
men) I send forth under your patronage (for honest men
and books had need to be well garded these times) for so
much as is mine, as I then said, they pretend no higher
inspiration, then some harmeless reading, and truths
(as wise men say) lying in <hi>abdito,</hi> may haply sometimes
be descryed amidst the shades of woods and mountains,
rather then in the noyse and throng of the world: they
<pb facs="tcp:34174:3"/>
tend to the discovery of the evills of extreams, and as the
same rare soul said,<note place="margin">M Baxter</note> all overdoing in the work
of God, is undoing: This solely hinders our
happinesse, and I verily believe, this spirit of dissention
was never neerer a discoverie then now; and I hope such
a spirit as was between <hi>Joseph</hi> and his Brethren, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
toward us, and then not only <hi>England,</hi> but great
<hi>Brittain</hi> for ever happy, and for ever glorious, and I hope
those poor leaves, and especially, what is of Mr. <hi>BAXTERS,</hi>
will abundantly contribute towards that great felicity.
Aud truely it is most pitious, that amongst Christians,
all parties being so near together in their principles,
should be so wide, and distant in their affections; not
unlike, as is reported of some spired mountains with us
in <hi>Wales,</hi> where shepheards may talk one with the other
on the tops,<note place="margin">In sumsis eorum ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticibus pastores confa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulantes a mane ad vesperam vix conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nirent. <hi>Cambden.</hi> ex <hi>Gyr.</hi>
               </note> but scarce can meet together in a
days travail; so in the many necessaries,
aud fundamentalls, we come all close together
yet unhappily, for some lower opinions and
circumstantialls, we ever stand at distance
and will never shake hands: and it would please God
all good men would duely lay it to heart, what a wound
Religion, and Christianity suffers thereby, and to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yondour
selvs, &amp; to consider, that even <hi>Turks &amp; Pagans</hi>
are confirmed in their superstitious darknesse, by our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions,
and the only way to hasten this great blessing to
our selves, and the world, would be, for all good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
especially of the Ruleing and Ministeriall rank, by
degrees, to suffer those false fires (for lights I dare hardly
call them) of passion and prejudice, clean to go out in
them, and to let, right Reason, and Grace, Gods two great
luminaries, kindly to rule and shine in their Orbes, their
minds and intellects. But <hi>HONOURABLE SIR,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34174:4"/>
Not to keep you from your great affairs too long in this
Porch, and to end with one word more to my self, truely
<hi>SIR,</hi> I find my drooping thoughts not a little revived,
behold the prange disposings of divine providence before
our eyes,<note place="margin">to</note> that after a harsh Comma given to the <hi>Old-Cause</hi>
and Parliament, methinks like those rivers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulfed
into the Earth, after a great space have again their
resurrection; or like the glorious eye of Heaven Eclipsed
by the saucy moon, recovers and appears to the World in
it's former luster. These should be wonderous things in
our eyes, the same great invisible hand that wrought all
this protect, and direct them and you in the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his name and glory among us. By this much I
verily believe yo do perceive, I am one that would fain be
bungling and doing of some good, might I be but left qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etin

from the injuries,<note place="margin">Protected</note> and malice of wicked malignant ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and like the snail to retire and live (without mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station)
in the shell of my own poor enjoyments is all my
ambition, and if your piety wil be pleased to prove the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of God to obtain me but thus much, and what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation
for my great wrongs, (in any proportion as
they shall be made appear) as shall seem good to justice, I

INTRODUCTION,
WITH
Some modest advertisements touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Author; and a brief view of
the progress hitherto in the affairs of
Religion and the Gospel in
VVALES.</head>
            <opener>Good Readers,</opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall humbly beg from all of you, that the
unworthinesse of the Author may not prejudice
any truths that here may offer themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you. Many professing themselves to be Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarks
and Masters of Religion in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Wales,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Evangelizo manu &amp; scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, Raynold, in praefat.</note> I thought my self also a little concerned to bring
in my poor mite in the way I was most capable of; and with
my <hi>Hand,</hi> as they with their <hi>Iongue,</hi> to further so blessed a
work. I may truly say, that I have had ever a genius to the
affairs of Religion, and this thirty years known something
from it, and have had some blessed experiences of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
in my own soul, and have been something versed in
Men, and Books of severall sorts, though but a slender pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,
and not read only one side (as they say) of the leaf,
and those that run in one strain of Opinion, which indeed
meerly begets stiffenesse, and obstinacy, and an aptnesse to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34174:5"/>
jangling and dissention, the only bane of Religion, I might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
adde, that I was the first of my Country that did publish
any thing in order to the Parliament,<note place="margin">The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to <hi>Wales.</hi> 1646.</note> and what <hi>Reproaches,
Dangers,</hi> and <hi>Discouragements</hi> I incurred, I list not to
mention; for my part, I envy not any that came in at the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leventh
hour, and I hope my portion is reserved for mee in a
better World. I was in the number of those that were named
in the Act of the Propagation of the Gospell in <hi>Wales,</hi> all
which together I hope will warrant mee to offer my poor
thoughts unto the World, in an affair of so much consequence
to God and my Countries good; and the great Searcher of
hearts can witnesse, I have no design to humour any, or to
crosse any in the wayes and Principles they have layed, but
meerly to shew the dictates of my own poor Judgement and
Conscience in a businesse of so much moment to God, and the
good of soules.</p>
            <p>It hath been my prayer that it should give offence to none,
and the Judiciously godly I doubt not will discern so, and that
it is my <hi>heart</hi> that hath most guided my <hi>hand</hi> throughout,
That some well meaning men will dart their misprisions
and censures at it, is my expectation; but I shall pity and pray
for them; but dare undertake if they will bee pleased to read
and understand without prejudice (which I confesse a hard
task) they may at last konne mee thanks, and find herein
something to enable their <hi>Iudgements,</hi> to grow up to their
<hi>affections,</hi> and may in good time prove, though the less <hi>aerie,
Notionall</hi> and <hi>Talkative,</hi> yet the more <hi>firm, practicall,</hi> and

            <p>And I pray let it bee understood, that it is meerly calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and intended for the Horizon of mine own Country, and
as to the State of Religion there, and not to others that are in
the higher Regions of Spiritualities; and yet if such may have
any benefit, I shall think my labour the more happy, and give
God the glory.</p>
            <p>I humbly in the last place beseech all, that what is here

               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:34174:5"/>The advancement of <hi>Religion,</hi> and the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is such a
work, that God and his <hi>Angells,</hi> and all good men have their
eyes in speciall manner beholding it, and how awefully; then
should all such as have to do with it stand affected? and my
heart gives mee, there should be yet more in it, than what is
hitherto done and seen. I am assured the Commissioners and
Ministers hitherto imployed in it (for all the Calumnies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them) wanted not much zeal and reall good intentions
therein; they put out most of the old Ministers, and for ought
of them I know, <hi>most</hi> of them well deserving it, but the defect
and complaint is, that their vacant places are not yet sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supplyed, and those that are come into their places, are
such, that make it their whole work and businesse, most of all,
only to <hi>preach</hi> (not but that I account Gospel Orthodox
preaching a holy and necessary ordinance, and we should all
blesss God for it) but that many could wish and desire with it
some other <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi>

for the <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>reverent</hi> use and comfort of the
Sacraments, and other usuall administrations; for without
question, I humbly conceive, they are functions that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and pertinent to the Ministers, and they are the means to
maintain the face and visibilitie of Religion (if not some sense
and reverence of God among the common people) indeed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
or divine worship in a larger sense, and the Gospell,
(though pitty they should ever be parted) are not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the very same <hi>things</hi> (as I shall clearly shew in a more
proper place) and the not right distinguishing of them, doth
cause amongst us some mistakes, if not inconvenience; hence
the people now generally mutter and say, that when they
customarily assemble, they come (as indeed out of a Principle
of nature) to serve and worship God, and not meerly to hear
and bee instructed. Now as for some thousands that are said
to bee converted amongst us by late preaching (my charity
bids mee hope, really to Christ, and praise be to God for it)
yet others in opposition to them complain, that far many more
thousands, for want of preaching, or any other publick duties
of Religion, and the distance and scarcitie of Ministers (at
least such as they will attend to) are ready to make defection,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34174:6"/>
and fall away to Poperie, if not <hi>utter prophanenesse, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,

Glory will suffer, little lesse than it is advanced in the other.</p>
            <p>And I humbly conceive this is an impartiall view of the

names, and <hi>Titles</hi> of the Books, as <hi>Genesis, Exodus, &amp;c.</hi>
may be left quietly alone; nay, many words of the Language,
but of civill use, are gain-said (such a turbulent Villain is this
spirit of Error and Dissention) the Remedy whereof (with
all humble submission to the godly wise) and especially safest
for Religion, were to rest and stand content with words,<note place="margin">Usus penes quem arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trium, &amp; jus, &amp; norma lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendi. Hor.</note> as

been ever held to be the sole <hi>Masters</hi> of <hi>Words,</hi> and to give
the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>stamp</hi> unto them; and it is worth taking notice
of, that many times words of good and harmlesse signification,
through Ignorance and prejudice, become in time to be taken
in the worse sense; which did we understand, and not behold
them through the false glass of prejudice, clearly in their first
innocent institutions, and right meaning; a wise man would
but laugh at the variances about them, though some of them
passing through the revolutions of corrupt ages, may carry
some cause of offence with them, yet so to strive for them, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to so much trouble and loss of Charitie, I conceive is a
<hi>Remedie</hi> worse than the disease, and many can make that
wise use of them, as to bear with them as some petty monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Truth, and Antiquity of Christian Religion, &amp;c.
And I conceive it would bee a labour well bestowed, for some
able hand, to open and explicate all such words in Religion,
as the Vulgar take offence at, that every body might not
call this and that <hi>superstition</hi> and <hi>Antichristian,</hi> without more

a course that would much conduce to settle mens judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

               <head>The Word Propagation explicated.</head>
               <p>THe word Propagation properly (as every School-boy

planting young ones in their stead; but in the sense of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
it hath ever very properly been used, as much as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
and inlarge, and in that signification wee take it. It being
so, let us grant the word a twofold sense (as it hath been used,
and is in order to Religion) the first wee may call the ancient
Propagation, as in the primitive times, people from Infidells
and Pagans were converted to acknowledge and beleeve
Christ, &amp;c. And as multitudes and Nations did come so to
beleeve, this was called the Propagation of the Gospell; now
in this sense, some among us mutter at the word as a dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to our Country, who from our Ancestors, the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>
have received the Title of Christianity, with some of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:34174:7"/>
the first of the World, as all Histories and Antiquity doth

now besides this, we may also call Propagation in a more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
sense, as when those that go under the generall name of
Christians, and yet are dissolute, and unchristian, and unholy in
their lives, and brought by means of the Gospell, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
into a better state of vertuous and holy Christian living,
and fear of God, and in this sense wee may well admit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation,
and heartily wish it amongst us, and all the World;

               <p>NOw partly clearing what wee mean by Propagation, the
word Religion and Gospell come opportunely in. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
hinted, they are not altogether the same; for as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
wee have all a common interest in Religion, but as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and beleevers in Christ wee belong to the Gospell; by
the meer instinct and impulsion of nature, all men are prone to
acknowledge and adore the Divine Power (or God) and this,
and all that pertains to the reverent performance of this, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:34174:8"/>
called <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Divine Worship;</hi> now it is said, that
most of our late endeavours were wholly to promote the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</hi>
and <hi>preaching</hi> it, and that only the beleevers and Elect
in Christ are the better for; Now upon a reckoning, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
hardly the moyetie, or half the people in <hi>Wales</hi> would
be granted to belong unto <hi>Christ</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> but admit
the number more or fewer; now the Gospell and preaching
it, being only that which takes up our thoughts and care, I
would know what provision should there be, for that number
that belongs not to Christ; I am confident none is so unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
as to say, let them shift as they may, therefore if not for
their <hi>souls behoof</hi> and <hi>benefit,</hi> yet for the <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>glory</hi>
of God as meer Creatures, there ought to bee something
whereby they might testifie their duty and Homage to their

and make no conscience of their Oaths and Promises in
their actions and dealings, which I need not further to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
unto the Judicious, therefore along and together with
the preaching of the Gospell, well were it that some reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
&amp; decorums of Religion were thought good to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
for the containing of all men in the aw and apprehension
of God, and the maintaining of civill honesty in their actions

not to suffer such contempt to the places of divine worship, to
which scarse will be granted their very names, which use, and
the language hath given them, and suffered (notwithstanding
late good provisions for them) to decay and ruine, without
some course be timely taken; I know not how many may be

               <head>The word Preaching explicated.</head>
               <p>THe next word in order is <hi>Preaching</hi> (the Gospell is
coincident with this) but so much mistakes and abuse
there is concerning it, that the spirit of dissention seems to bee
so wreathed about it, that I dread to attempt the medling
with it; but if the good Reader will bee charitable, and think
mee non-either, that is <hi>against</hi> or <hi>above,</hi> this or any holy
ordinance, I will give my poor Judgement, and where I fail,
I beseech the pardon of the Godly, and that still hee mind,
that the design of my pen is in this, and the whole, for <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
and against the <hi>evills</hi> of <hi>extreams;</hi> I will not trouble
you with the severall meanings of the word <hi>Preaching</hi> in the
Scripture, and the Ages of the Church; but surely that which
is meant by it in the pure primitive Gospel sense is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
(as <hi>Heraulds</hi>) proclaiming and making known to the
World, <hi>that great Mystery hid from</hi> all former Ages, <hi>that
Iesus Christ the Son of God was incarnat and born of a
blessed Virgin, &amp;c. to bee Saviour of the World,</hi> and the
publishing of this, and the other heavenly Doctrin of <hi>Christ,</hi>
as the <hi>resurrection,</hi> and the fundamentalls of <hi>Faith,</hi> is, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive to be, the preaching meant in the Scripture sense,
and to know and beleeve this, there is an <hi>absolute necessitie</hi>
to <hi>Salvation;</hi> now the mistake is, that those Texts and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture that mention the preaching in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
sense, and the <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of it, is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
wrested too violently to the <hi>necessity</hi> of ordinary <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and Sermons,</hi> which certainly cannot be of that absolute
necessity as the former, because wee are by course of Ages
born where Christ is owned and beleeved in the former sense,
and have sundry helps, by <hi>Education, Conference,</hi> Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and good <hi>Books,</hi> to improve that knowledge; But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the preaching in our latter sense, and use, to bee of very
speciall conveniencie and necessitie for us, and our improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the knowledge and wayes of God, so it bee right,
<hi>Gospel,</hi> and Orthodox preaching, and beyond all other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
helps and means, when it is a publick Ordinance (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
no doubt) of a more special blessing along with it;<note place="margin">Objection.</note> but
if some say that the Devil and evil spirits may be said in some
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:34174:9"/>
kind to beleeve in the first sense, I confess perhaps they do as to
their intellectuals, and historically, but so, as to their sorrow
and horror: but mankind beleeves at least to some glympses of
hope and comfort, and the Elect to their unspeakable joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
The mistake partly of this necessity, made Preaching, lately as it
were, overflow its banks, and to overtop all other Ordinances, and
made that gap and tolleration for all pretenders,<note place="margin">Exod. 36. 4.</note> that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
was like as of old at the offerings of the Temple, <hi>That the
people bring more than enough for the service of the work
of the Lord;</hi> until his Highness late seasonable Ordinance, hath
(and I hope still will more) like <hi>Moses, then caused the people to
be restrained from bringing more work into the Sanctuary.</hi>
And truly I have often much marvelled, how in ancient times,
when they had scarce any kind of Preaching, nor near those helps
our times abound with, they should so far out go us in <hi>holiness
of life, Mortification, and contempt of the World;</hi> they
by <hi>Praying, Fasting, holy Hymnes,</hi> frequent use of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and other <hi>Exercises of devotion,</hi> and troubling not
themselves, nor the world, with Crochers and Notions, attained
to higher pitches of holiness than we know or feel; <hi>doubtless
the holy Spirit hath some other secret way (besides the onely
sense of Hearing, and the means of words) to come into the
soul,</hi> as to <hi>Eliah,</hi> he was not in the <hi>wind, and fire, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake,</hi>
but in the <hi>still small voyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2 Now Preaching being thus stated, I could heartily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend,
especially to our younger Preachers, a due care of what
they deliver unto the people, for they <hi>(like Iacobs flocks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Rods)</hi> apprehend and conceive but just as you put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes,<note place="margin">Gen. 30</note> and to inform their Judgement especially in the
principles of Faith, as wel as to move their affections, which later,
without the former, makes them so easily fly into peevish fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and not to obtrude and press upon their credulity that every
thing they deliver is <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Word of God,</hi> but what
undoubtedly is so; much may proceed from their own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and frail affections, as men; and that they would prescribe
unto the people some sober Rules for reading the Scriptures, for
some, as soon as they can but read a Chapter, prefer their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy
before the soundest Interpretations, hence, and the like, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:34174:9"/>
strange opinions, and crased extravagancies of many in these
times (as those we call Quakers, and others deluded, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
well-meaning souls) I have often mused of them, and they
are not strange, for I find such a kind in all Religions that ever
were, as the <hi>Illuminati</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Dervises</hi> among the
<hi>Turks,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See Burtons</hi> religious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, p. 739.</note> and indeed all Enthusiasts whatsoever, it proceeding from
the over-intention of the fancy and melancholy; and indeed they
ought to be gained and reduced rather with <hi>Physick,</hi> than
<hi>reason;</hi> and this I say comes when the fancy like a ship hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
sail, and the Understanding and Judgement want ballast,<note place="margin">Inciderunt in desiderium curiosarum visonum &amp; digni habiti sunt illusioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, <hi>Aug. conf. l. 10.</hi>
                  </note>
and therefore it were a good remedy to spare many speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and notions, and to ground people in the substantials of Faith
and Religion; move and perswade them unto the duties and
practices of a holy life; so that many that have a desire to fear God,
and to lead honest vertuous lives, yet if they agree not with some
in opinions and forms, they shall have but their cold commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,
and stile of moral men: Whereby sure I am, many good

from either <hi>being good, or doing good.</hi> Methinks to
<hi>feed the hungry, cloath the naked, relieve the oppressed,</hi> are
most proper works for all Christians, sure I am, upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

               <p>3 For our better success in the word, one more caution I have to
our Preachers and Ministers, that is, I humbly conceive that it
would not do amiss to correspond and comply with the people
in some of their more tollerable Modes and Customs (at least)
for a while,<note place="margin">This is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as only to the state of <hi>Wales.</hi>

ballance the abuse and corruptions imputed to them; and with
us in <hi>Wales</hi> the people generally from an ancient use much spend
the time in pious <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Songs, celebrating</hi> the birth and
actions of Christ, which at least keeps them in some awe
and reverence of God, and their anniversary course no doubt
makes some more impression upon them, than not at all.</p>
               <p>As also their not using the Lords Prayer, at least sometimes
in compliance with the peoples use: I confess, I think the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Prayer hath been, as all the rest of the Scriptures, abused;
as in the conceit of the absolute necessity of it at all times, and
contenting with the meer <hi>formal utterance of it,</hi> to the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of other devotion; these abuses the people should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
advised of, and not utterly to disuse it, as I hear they do
not in other places of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> rather than so, I
incline to beleeve with those, that the Apostles, and the Church
after them, ever used it in their devotions, and the first I find
that gain-said the use of it, was the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> as in the
Synod of <hi>Militane</hi> the first charge against them was, <hi>Nova Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resis,

sometimes, at our more solemn Devotions, at least, it might
be as the Diamond in the Ring, and as the sweet odor of our

through the word, the first thing observable is to see the force
of passion and prejudice in some, even to wrench and transport
them from the Law and instincts of Nature, as either not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
such places, or at least any regard or respect towards them;
for as from the Law and Principles of Nature, all Nations never
so barbarous acknowledge a supream Divine Power, so as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
they have an impression to assign some places to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the same Power, and some answerable respect and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:34174:11"/>
to the places; read, you may of Nations that are so
barbarous that they want Towns, and other ornaments of civil
Nations, but none there is but have their <hi>Aras &amp; Templa,</hi> their
Rites and places to worship; and indeed such a strong byas,
and impulse of nature there is thereunto, that most (and some
Christian) do slip rather into superstition, and too much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
than be short in the worst extream, <hi>Prophaneness,</hi> or too
little to such places; As they say the Emperor of <hi>Russia</hi> in his
greatest pomp will alight from his horse, at the sight of every
Church, and to his devotions, and will not mount but go on foot
whilst in sight of it; I urge not for (as the Papists extream) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
superstitious reverence to such places, as if there were inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
holiness in them, but because of the end and the service they
are ordained to, I conceive them not to be so slighted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
as they are by many. Methinks were there nothing else
but that one example of our Savior of whipping the buyers and
sellers out of the Temple, and that with such indignation and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
it were sufficient to gain some regard to such places, for
our Churches are ordained to the same use and ends, as the
Temple was, and it was not <hi>Solomons;</hi> and the Merchandise
was for religious ends, for sacrifice; from all which I conceive,
it is clearly evinced, that if no honor and respect be to be given,
yet no scorn and contempt is to be offered to such places. And
what our common people in <hi>Wales</hi> are apt to in this kind, out of
this instinct of nature, some charge them with superstition, which
when they slip so far unto, I could wish them discreetly reproved
and instructed, but to suffer them to bend to the other worst ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream,
and perswade them to have no account or esteem to such
places, but to value them as every other ordinary place, this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
my judgement, and I know it begets very hard thoughts,
and I never heard or read any judicious Protestant Divines, but
seem to allow a kind of relative holiness to such places;<note place="margin">As the word <gap reason="foreign">

God; insomuch when truth shall appear (which is but one) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

wee take the Scriptures to be <hi>Aphorismes, Canons,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems,</hi>
and where they hold forth no light, hee referrs us to the

a general custome in the Church, and hath been practised by

<hi>when I observe any custome in any Church, any thing that is
laudable,</hi> and <hi>comely,</hi> and <hi>God hath not determined it, there is

where the Scriptures are dark and silent, there the customes of

which our unhappy quarrells are) well were it wee could
suffer our selves to be guided by the Judgement and Rules men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned;
the want of this is our pronenesse to reproach each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with <hi>superstition,</hi> and <hi>prophanenesse,</hi> and <hi>Antichristian;</hi>
all of them I confesse great evills, but surely many times mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood,
which causeth so much <hi>scupulosities, tortures of

could heartily wish those words were once rightly stated amongst
us; methinks to conclude all things <hi>superstitious</hi> that are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly
warranted in Scripture, is of some perillous consequence;
and of the two great evills, I humbly conceive <hi>superstition</hi> to be
less than <hi>prophanenesse,</hi> for superstition is acknowledged to
be a <hi>cultus perversus</hi> or a kind of Religion looking awry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

               <p>2 I shall mention another mistake of some places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
fomenting contention, as those texts that are produced and
wresled to make against natural parts, <hi>Knowledge and learning,</hi>
as the 1 and 2 to the <hi>Corinth. Where is the Scribe? &amp;c. God
hath made foolish the wisdome of this World,</hi> and such other
places, whereby simple people are brought to conceive hard
thoughts of Gods excellent gifts, and ignorance most strangely
promoted, the consequence whereof I leave to the Judgement of
the wise and truly Religious; doubtlesse the Apostle doth not
condemn true wisdome and knowledge, but the false and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
wisdome of the Grecians in those times to <hi>whom Christ and
his Doctrin seemed foolishnesse;</hi> did wee know what know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is, wee would infinitely be taken with the beautie of it, for
what is it but the <hi>improvement of natural Reason,</hi> and what is
Reason, but a <hi>beam</hi> and <hi>ray</hi> of that divine light, and a <hi>drop</hi> of that
infinite Fountain of all excellencies and perfections, which is God?
<hi>Every good and perfect gift is from above, and commeth
down from the Father of light,</hi> and doubtless in these Ages of
the Church, it concerns Ministers especially to be more knowing
than others. In the primitive times when the State of the Church
did not seem so much to require it, as now, how learned were
they, is well known, insomuch that <hi>Iulian</hi> the grand enemie of
Christianity, thought it as his only Engine against it, to forbid
Christians the means of learning, &amp;c. and in this so knowing an
Age, that even many women are held learned, to have the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
simple and illiterate is as great a scandall to Religion, as I
can Imagine; I deny not but learning as all good things else have
been abused, but to have hard thoughts against it, especially
upon pretence of Scripture, I beseech all men of any Judgement
and godlinesse to consider, and that with the Apostle, <hi>that
the Spirit of the Lord hath diversitie of opperations, in some
after this manner, in others after that, but is the same God
which worketh all in all.</hi>

the <hi>state</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in these ages of the

            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Let none hence inferre, that I seem to make a gap
for any unworthy <hi>scandalous Ministers</hi> to come in:
Those that were ejected, doubtless many of them did
but well deserve it; yet of those I accompt some more
tolerable than others; as those of some lighter ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes,
and dissents in judgement, yet of good Abilities,
whereof there is store such, they kissing the Rod, and
humbled in the sense of their former failings, I could
hartily wish they should be restored (at least) to some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
to exercise their Gifts and Talents in, and
because the <hi>Harvest is great, and labourers few:</hi> and that
for want of a supply <hi>Gods worship</hi> and service is in hazard
to suffer among us. In such an exigence, we should not
so much stand for whom we could wish, but accept of
such we needs must have, and give place to a Rule wise
Men have, sometimes <hi>to admit of an Evil, rather than an
Inconvenience.</hi> And though haply they may want the way
and gift of Preaching, yet they may have those gifts, that
may be of other special uses to Religion: If they may
not be so good for the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> they may be for the <hi>Presse,</hi>
and such services of Religion. I might here start a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34174:15"/>
Question whether the <hi>Tongue</hi> or <hi>Hand</hi> hath done most
service to God in his Church: The Apostle sayth, <hi>his
speech was contemptible, and his letters powerfull.</hi> I will
not enter into the bowels of this Question, but leave it
to the judicious; only I suppose with submission, that
had it not been the <hi>Pen</hi> and <hi>Writings</hi> (next the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God) of the former ages of the Church; I can
hardly imagin (against such strength of opposition and
errors) how Christian Religion, and the pure truths of
it could have devolved and arrived to our hands; and
those that have done signal services in the Church, was
by their pens, as anciently St. <hi>Aug.</hi> &amp;c. who makes it his
excuse to withdraw himself from his former profession
of Rhetorick;<note place="margin">Illi professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oni prae diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultate spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rands, ac do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lore pectoris non suffice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, Conf. lib. 9. cap. 5.</note> because he spent so much his breath and
lungs; and amongst our Moderns famous Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi>
who was held not to be so well gifted for utterance; and

could not so well with his <hi>Tongue</hi> and <hi>voiec,</hi> he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with <hi>his hand and pen;</hi> So I say, for such as cannot
with us passe so well for preaching, may at least for their
other <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> be at least accompted of us as the
<hi>Gibeonites</hi> of old to be <hi>Hewers of wood, and Drawers of
water for the house of God;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iosh. 9.</note> especially such as may be very
usefull to us in <hi>Wales</hi> for the <hi>Controversaries,</hi> and for the
<hi>translation of ancient and modern Books into the language,</hi>
which is something wanting of things in that kind, and
hath but its meer <hi>antiquity</hi> to credit it: For which pains
I humbly conceive, they might well be accompted
Members of the Ministery, and be accordingly incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
and cherished, and not leave us altogether use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
to droop and languish away in sad melancholy, and
penury, as they doe, &amp;c. neither would; but that others
that pretend to gifts of another accompt, be but incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged:
But with these one or two Cautions; 1. That
the able Ministers frequently mind them, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
wholly upon the strength of their gifts, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to improve this by industry and studying; and
to be as in the nature of the <hi>Catechystae</hi> and <hi>Lectores</hi> of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34174:16"/>
the ancient times, before they rush into the <hi>publick
preaching</hi> the word.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And that the able Ministers prescribe unto them, and
all others, some modest <hi>Rules</hi> in reading the Scriptures;
For we have now a dayes an <hi>aptnesse</hi> to be <hi>self-conceited,</hi>
and to prefer our own sense before the foundest inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> And that they do not over young presse into the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Ministery (a fault much in these times) whereby
the <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> of the function doth suffer;
they instancing the <hi>youth of Timothy,</hi> who was no <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
person,</hi> but a <hi>rare soul,</hi> that <hi>prophecies</hi> went of him,
and <hi>Pauls holy hand</hi> was upon him; and is said to be <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>I Confesse after our late <hi>purgation of the Temple</hi> (I may
say) and <hi>ejection</hi> of Ministers; Churches have had lately
a sad face among us: &amp; I hear stil to this instant, that many
<hi>principal Towns</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> want Ministers, or any use of
the <hi>administrations</hi> publickely among them;<note place="margin">Llanbadarn. vaur in Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digan shire.</note> and what I
cannot but upon my own sad experience mention; the
parish whereof I am being one of the goodliest Parishes
of <hi>Wales</hi> containing in common compute above 2000
Communicants, and divers persons of special quality,
hath not, above this twelve month had any setled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister;
the <hi>greatnesse of the impropriation,</hi> being at least
1000<hi>l. per annum,</hi> with the appurtenant profits, and
the smallnesse of the stipend being but 20<hi>l. per annum</hi>
being the cause of our unhappinesse: I could heartily
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:34174:16"/>
beg a <hi>Minister</hi> suitable to the <hi>gravitie</hi> and <hi>consider able<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi>
of such a place; and I doubt not the <hi>piety</hi> of his
<hi>Hignesse</hi> and those in authority under him,<note place="margin">Tyth.</note> will find a
competency out of such a <hi>revenue,</hi> to furnish such places
with a due incouragement for an able Minister.</p>
               <p>But all this as a Digression, now for our number and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
supply of Ministers, as to our present exigence, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive such of our mere <hi>tolerable</hi> ejected Ministers
upon their <hi>reformation</hi> and submitting to the present
Government may be of use to the Ministery.</p>
               <p>I doubt not, and know there are many of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of able parts, and virtuously disposed, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in <hi>England,</hi> or in the Universities, that would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
offer their being and Talents among us; if they see
incouragements answerable to their minds; but are
kept back because of their incapacity with the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and <hi>formes</hi> of others, under whose checks their
disposition can hardly stoop, and pity it is to hear how
many ingenuous and hopefull persons <hi>droop</hi> and hang
down the head, especially in the Universities, resolving
any other course of life and <hi>profession,</hi> rather than the
Ministery: and divers upon such discouragements beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
themselves unto Popish Seminaries beyond Sea;
which, I pray God, may be timely considered, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
among us; which being redressed may afford us
a good supply in due time.</p>
               <p>The supply that many designs from the congregatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
Churches (though I could wish any way would doe
the businesse) I doubt, will hardly perform, because I
see them not trained but in some plain <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Welsh</hi>
books, and that but of one strain and opinion, which,
no doubt may enable, to become good meaning Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
but short (I conceive) of the dignity and title of
knowing and orthodox Divines, and Ministers, which
doubtlesse in this intelligent age, must have something
of excellency more than ordinary, to keep up the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Reverence of the <hi>Calling</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> for as
sometimes many may be accompted good <hi>Preachers,</hi> and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34174:17"/>
yet be none of the <hi>best Christians,</hi> so many a <hi>good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi>
may be none of the <hi>best Preachers,</hi> as to the gifts
mentioned, and the publike Ministery.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Our therefore most ready course is to be (as former
times) beholding unto the a famous <hi>Lamps</hi> of the Land,
the <hi>Universities;</hi> indeed a favour from them (under his
Highnesse, whose goodnesse we lay claim to) as to have
a dispensation for a Colledge or two among us in <hi>Wales,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Such as <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> and Winchest.</note>
would, doubtlesse, highly advance us for a supply of able
Ministers; but this wish, without the least intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
unto our two <hi>Mother great Universities;</hi> but as

and <hi>Degrees,</hi> or thence confirmed, but all will
say, the difficulty is the Matter of Revenue, and Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance;
but where his Highnesse the Protector hath
his smile towards, the Word <hi>difficultie</hi> signifies nothing;
and doubtlesse he that hath hitherto given us such a
plentifull tast of his goodnesse, will not in such a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of honour to himself and our Nation, be wanting to
us; and as for Revenues, I verily think those of the
late sequestrations of Churches well managed would
afford much help; and if they be short, let us consider
the Revenues of our 4 Bishopricks, which are slipped
into several private hands, upon easie Bargains:<note n="*" place="margin">And some are opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned there might an easie disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very out of such profits that might without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any, be found for the advance of so pious a design.</note> And I
could Christianly intreat them, and all others that have
advanced their <hi>store</hi> and fortunes by the late times, out
of their abundance, to part with some Mites towards so
<hi>pious</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> a work; indeed such Actions as
these, and to <hi>cloath the naked,</hi> and <hi>feed the Hungry;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Servants and Champions of Christ: Let us
but consider, if former Ages had been so cold in their
Charities of this kind; We should not have beheld the
<hi>goodly</hi> and <hi>venerable structures,</hi> as the <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi>
of this land; But some will say, all this was done
in times of blindnesse and Popery, to <hi>merit</hi> Heaven;
and be that granted, yet in this time of greater light, it
will be our dishonour to do nothing but heap up riches,
&amp;c. and though not to <hi>merit</hi> Heaven, yet to <hi>merit Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34174:17"/>
to our name from posterity, let us not stick to lay
forth our selves in such Deeds: and I doubt not but
it would be much acceptable to God, and all Men of
vertue.</p>
               <p>The last Thing I shall propound in order to supply, is,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
That I could wish the Gentry would more freely devote
their Children (like so many <hi>Samuels</hi>) unto God and
his Ministery. This doth much slead the <hi>Romish</hi> Dame
in her heights of Glory and Pride, by engaging the best
Rankes and Nobility in their Ecclesiastick Orders. And
though I aim not at such a grandeur, and splendor as
they; yet to chuse them out of the better sort for the
Ministery (I humbly conceive) being thereto qualified,
would be an honest and Christian politie to maintain
the reputation of the calling; and I could wish all or
thers to be observant of the Genius and disposition of
their Children, and they of the sweetest nature to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
over to the service of God, and a supply of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery.
I confesse formerly hitherto we ordained them
to the more advantagious professions, as the Law, &amp;c.
But I doubt not but God in his good time, through
his Highnesse wisdom, wil yet find a way of fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
for his worship and service.</p>
               <p>Having thus briefly shewed our helps and Remedies,
as to the Ministery, I conceive also our Reconciliation
about some trivial differences concerning the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the other administrations; would avail our
design, which I shall humbly offer.</p>

<hi>really</hi> so. And hence every one thinking himself as good

The bad, or rather no Christian, reproaches and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutes

yet wholly to deprive Infants of the Benefit of Baptism,
is, I humbly conceive, of worse consequence; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
there being a golden Mean and Remedie that might

<hi>Charity;</hi> The Objections are so well known, that I

is, we finde not in the New Testament any <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi>
or <hi>example</hi> for it; yet finding that Families and

that Infants might be amongst them, as there, where

Women: or indeed, any expresse positive command to
keep and change the Sabboth: yet to follow the stream
and universal practise of the Church herein being best,
and why may we not for baptising Infants do the same.

shall find that they did not only baptise Infants, but
gave them the Lords Supper, as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> confesseth,
and is used in some parts of the Eastern Church still.
And what say we to that dark place of the Apostle (which
he makes the great Argument of the Resurrection) the
Baptising for the Dead; whence is evinced, That if
Baptism was thought to be availeable for the Dead, then
much more must it be for the Living. And if the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church thought the Lords Supper necessary to
be given unto Infants,<note place="margin">1 Cor. cap. 15. v. 29.</note> much more then may wee think
Baptism, &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> conceives that Infants dying,
and baptised, though wanting faith,<note place="margin">Quos pleno lucis suae fulgore illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sttraturus est dominis, cur non iis—si ita libuerit, exigua scin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla irradia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, &amp; Sect. 19. ut supr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

believers in years have, that God may have some more
secret mercies, and irradiations of his countenance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, suitable to their condition, We find our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
a great friend of little ones, taking them <hi>into his
arms, and blessing them, and reproving his Disciples for
hindering them,</hi> saying, <hi>Of such were the Kingdom of God,</hi>
were it but to imitate him, let us descend into all the
tenderness and compassion as may be of them, having the
whole Church of God (until a few of these last worst
dayes) to lead us in the use and practise of Baptising
them.</p>
               <p>But some of the more learned may say,<note place="margin">Object.</note> that among
the Antients we find many were not baptised, until they
came to good years, as St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
&amp;c. This makes nothing, that though some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, for some reasons, were not then baptised
until good years; but that the generality, and those that
descended from Christian Parents, were baptised In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
Some, as <hi>Austine</hi> and the like, were to grapple
with the objections of humane reason against the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
and simplicity of Christianitie, and until they had
got the conquest, and be throughly resolved and setled,
did deferr Baptism; and the like might be allowed still,
upon the same score: Though it is more proper for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
Jewes, and Mahometans, than those that descend
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34174:19"/>
from Christian linnage: It seems, as by what he says of
his friend <hi>Alipeus, ad ipsam Christianam fidem pigrius mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vebatur;</hi>
that he and other great wits made pauses, and
came by degree to highest Christianity; partly I say, as
to be throughly satisfied, and haply to let the heat and
temptations of youth passe over: But this was, I say,
but as to some particular men, whose condition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
was notas usual: But generally the Children of
Christians is conceived to have been all baptized. And

expedient, by considering the right use of that ancient
Rite in the Christian Church, called Imposition or
laying on of hands, (other names it hath had) which,
no doubt among other sacred uses from the primitive
Church hath been ever used in favour of infant Baptism,
and the Lord hath been pleased often to consign it with
special effects of his grace and blessing to that end: And
I do not find any of the judicious Protestant Divines or
<hi>confessions</hi> against the right use of it, he among them that
I find lesse favourable to it, is Mr. <hi>Calvin;</hi> but he mainly
is against it as a <hi>Sacrament, and the abuse and corruption
of it, as restraining only to the hands of Bishops, and a seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>FIrst, some are not satisfied with the usual names, as
<hi>Sacrament, Communion, Eucharist,</hi> or the <hi>Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>

I confesse a very <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>ancient fit name;</hi> so it should
not clash &amp; <hi>justle</hi> out the other forementioned reverent
names, out of <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>affectation;</hi> and some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it favours more popishly than the other; because
of its allusion to the <hi>Communion</hi> in one <hi>kind</hi> among
them; but were there no strife but for the name, all
would be well; for the persons receiving, there is no
small variance; indeed to make no difference, and to
entertain all loose, scandalous persons, hath been a foul
fault; but again to stand over-precisely, and to admit
none but such as can give clear evidences of grace, by
definitions, &amp;c, may be somewhat an extream. In the
Primitive times, we find, that all <hi>baptised,</hi> and did
<hi>believe</hi> the Articles of Christian faith, and had no noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
crimes, were accompted capable of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I wish all could expresse and define spiritual
things; but that is many times upon a persons <hi>audacity</hi>
and <hi>natural faculties,</hi> and one may define <hi>faith</hi> and want
it, and another not be so well able to define, and yet
have it: As for the differences concerning the <hi>gesture;</hi>
some conceive it best to stand strict to the confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the first institution; but that sounds not safe,
but inferrs other harsh circumstances; as it must then
be in an <hi>upper Chamber,</hi> and <hi>in the night time, after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:34174:20"/>
and <hi>a few Disciples,</hi> and they only <hi>Men,</hi>
and not <hi>Women,</hi> and their <hi>manner of sitting,</hi> not
as ours; but as my poore Judgement, I could
think <hi>kneeling,</hi> the most beleeming gesture,
because the only gesture of <hi>adoration,</hi> and <hi>most
reverence,</hi> and used generally in all ages; and
to be against it, because the Papists kneel at
the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> were as well not to kneel at pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
because they so doe. But as I said, the <hi>gesture</hi>
in any kind should not cause variance, it being not
of the <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>substance</hi> of the thing, which alone
is of the <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> of the receiver; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
to the custome of the Church and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
where one is, is Christian discretion, and
safe. Much it is to be wished, that the use of this
Sacrament were more frequent among us. The <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both,</hi>

God should be invoked upon solemnly in an Act

I conceive it somewhat rational, that some such thing

banefull and destructive unto it, than Dissentions
and Errors, and therefore <hi>Peace, Vnity,</hi> and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
must necessarily be thought most advantagious for
its recovery and advancement, and this happiness
is most feared should betyde it, by its greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
as our ingenious Countryman Mr. <hi>Howel</hi>
observes, that the Turkes in their Letanie, pray,<note place="margin">In Dedon. 1. p.</note> that
the Discords and Dissentions of Christendom may
continue, and when ever it falls out otherwise, there
are among them very fatal prophesies, as in the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
History you may see.</p>
               <p>There are those that hold it necessary there
should be Heresies and Divisions among us, from
that Text, <hi>Opportet esse Hereses,</hi> &amp;c. These words
were but occasionally to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> upon the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order

Supper;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. v. 19.</note> and without doubt, not meant by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
as to the tolleration of Errors or Divisions.
Let us doe what we can, <hi>Nolens Volens,</hi> such infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities
we cannot prevent or hinder. As we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
say, there must be <hi>Sinns, Sicknesse,</hi> and <hi>Evils</hi>
in the world, not that we should give way to them,
but rather because they will needs come upon us,
we should use the more <hi>Care, Endeavour,</hi> and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
to avoid and prevent them. And that above

               <p>By the title you see here, we may discern how it
concerns all who bear the name of Christians, to

be in the terms of <hi>Charity, Peace &amp; Unity</hi> with each other
some excelent men I find that hath laid this very much
to heart, as Sir <hi>Ed. Sandies,</hi> who (as the Epistolar saith)
<hi>gave such a blow to Popery,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">In his Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropae, or vie of Religion in the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern part of the world.</note> 
                  <hi>that such another would
make his Tower fall about his ears,</hi> writing at least 50
past; besides those many <hi>passages</hi> of state, it contains
many observable things, as to our times; and all upon
the <hi>deep sense</hi> of the miseries of Christendom, and its
distraction; and what rare passages he propounds for
the remedy upon those 5 sorts of Unities to be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.

                  <note place="margin">p. 139. p. 201.</note> I leave to
the judicious and charitable, and refer the knowing
Reader, and all in authority, to ponder, I cannot but
mention that he there charges all that are in extremes
and those in all parties that stand in the termes of
<hi>scrupulosity, stiffnesse,</hi> and <hi>opinionativenesse,</hi> to be the
Authors of the Church its misery, and ruine of the
glory and grace of Christendom; a List of such Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies
we also find (and that most Protestants)<note place="margin">In Annot. in Cass.</note> in the
learned and charitable <hi>Grotius;</hi> and it would please
God to incline the worthy Ministers and Pastors of the
Nations unto the study of Charity (at least among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
though lesse)<note place="margin">And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther greater means to advance the Kingdom of Christ. Dr. Hall Serm.</note> unto their other Nations; and
doubtlesse they would find from the Lord a more
plentifull blessing upon them and their labours, which
I will close with a sweet wish of an excellent man; <hi>Oh
that our Tongues and Pens were hapily met against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Enemy of Christendom, long agoe had the Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane
Moon wained to nothing, and given way to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Sun of the Gospel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may discern how much it concerns all
that bear the name of Christians to be at <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
then how much more us among our selves in this
Nation. Oh that we would duly consider, that <hi>God
is the God of Peace;</hi> our Saviour the <hi>Prince of Peace;</hi> his
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34174:23"/>
Gospel the <hi>Gospel of Peace,</hi> and leaving the world, his
greatest Legacy he could bequeath was Peace; and
that we would consider that Divine comparison of the
Apostle, Though we are <hi>many Members,</hi> yet but
one body, and make it our great work and businesse
to have Charity with each other; It is the very mark
and badge our Saviour hath left, to distinguish us
from others. <hi>By this they shall know you are mine, if
you love one another:</hi> And the Apostle, as not valuing
any thing with it,<note place="margin">Pet. 4. 8.</note> bids us <hi>above all things to have ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Charity among our selves;</hi> And the writings of the
Apostle, though sparing in matters of other great
moment; yet Charity, as being that gift of greatest
consequence to Gods Church and people (and in the
want thereof it hath most, and still will suffer) doth
most frequently inculcate it, and the mention of it
runs like a golden vein through all their Writings, as
intimating how much we should <hi>value and practise
it</hi> above all Notions and Duties whatsoever. That
we all having one <hi>Lord,</hi> one <hi>Faith,</hi> one <hi>Baptisme,
May all with one heart, and one mouth, glorifie God, the
Father of our Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>
