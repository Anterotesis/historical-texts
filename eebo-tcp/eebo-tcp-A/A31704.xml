            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A <hi>Quack-Doctor</hi> is one of the Epidemical Diſeaſes of this Age, a Younger Brother to the <hi>Pox,</hi> and the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> but more deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive than either; and like them too, is begot in an Illigitimate Copulation, betwixt ignorance and impudence, an Heterogenious jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Dregs of <hi>Galen</hi> and <hi>Caput mortuum</hi> of <hi>Paracelſus</hi>; you may call him an <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> in Phyſick, or a <hi>Gifted Brother</hi> in the Knack of <hi>Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; a <hi>Doctor</hi> but no <hi>Maſter</hi> of <hi>Arts,</hi> ſave thoſe of <hi>Couſenage</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> a <hi>Pettifogger</hi> in Medicine, that <hi>Goes to Law</hi> with Diſeaſes, and <hi>Plays Booty</hi> with <hi>Death</hi>; whoever <hi>Truſt</hi> their Lives in his Hands, had need of a large doſe of <hi>Hellebore,</hi> and did not <hi>Madneſs</hi> Excuſe, muſt forfeit their <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Chattels,</hi> as <hi>Felo's de ſe,</hi> Acceſſary to their own Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>He Pretends to Cure all Diſeaſes that ever Sin Intail'd upon the raſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> but in truth a vagrant <hi>Mountebank,</hi> or a <hi>Seaventh Son,</hi> or an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Stroaker</hi> out does him Fifty in the Hundred; for his <hi>Skill</hi> is not ſo much as a <hi>Tooth drawers,</hi> and a <hi>Corn-Cutter</hi> is an <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> to him; the Proverb that aſſerts every man, <hi>To be either a Fool, or a Phyſitian,</hi> apply'd to him, makes a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> without a <hi>Difference,</hi> for this <hi>Unalphabetical Cheat,</hi> clames both Titles, yet we muſt confeſs to his Praiſe, that his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Preſence</hi> is <hi>Medicinal,</hi> for his <hi>Looks</hi> are enough to give one a <hi>Stool</hi> or a <hi>Vomit,</hi> and his everlaſting Impertinent <hi>Tattle</hi> will either <hi>Purge</hi> your <hi>Gall</hi> with Anger, or your <hi>Spleen</hi> with Laughter.</p>
            <p>To trace his <hi>Pedigree,</hi> is to rake a <hi>Dunghil,</hi> and write the <hi>Genealogy</hi> of <hi>Muſhrooms,</hi> for his <hi>Birth</hi> is (commonly) as wretched as his <hi>Breeding,</hi> both being below <hi>Mechanick,</hi> not to be found, but amongſt the <hi>Feeces</hi> of the <hi>Bedraggled Rabble</hi>; yet he might have Liv'd well at his <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Handicraft,</hi> but Extravagance put him upon ſhifts, &amp; <hi>Idleneſs</hi> made him Abandon his <hi>Anvil</hi> or his <hi>Loom,</hi> his <hi>Aul</hi> or his <hi>Thimble,</hi> &amp; pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſafe and <hi>Thriveing</hi> courſe of <hi>Pocket-Picking,</hi> no <hi>Jiltor, Legerdemain,</hi> being now a days ſo Effectual as a <hi>Catholick Pill</hi> or <hi>Univerſal</hi> Portion.</p>
            <p>His prime care, and greateſt trouble, is to get the <hi>Names</hi> of Diſeaſes <hi>Without Book,</hi> &amp; a Beadrole of Ratling <hi>Terms</hi> of Art, which he deſires
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46113:3"/>
only to <hi>Remember,</hi> not <hi>Underſtand,</hi> ſo that he has more <hi>Hard words</hi> than a <hi>Juggler,</hi> and uſes them to the ſame Purpoſe, to <hi>amuſe</hi> and beguile the Ignorant or unwary, firſt of their <hi>Wit,</hi> and next of their <hi>Mony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To render himſelf remarkable, he firſt prevails with ſome <hi>Aſſociate Porters</hi> and <hi>Tripe-Women</hi> to call him <hi>Doctor,</hi> for his Ingenuity in Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Kib'd Heeles,</hi> and Curing <hi>Cut Fingers</hi> with a <hi>Shoomakers Ind</hi> and <hi>Cobwebs</hi>; and ſo affected he is with the <hi>Title,</hi> that afterwards he will never anſwer to any other name, but Mr. <hi>Doctor</hi>; two <hi>Gally Pots,</hi> and a Peny worth of <hi>Sena-Stalks</hi> ſet him up, and he is not ſo ſoon a <hi>Student</hi> as a <hi>Profeſſor</hi>; Impudence is his <hi>Licenſe</hi> to practice, and at the <hi>ſeaventh Funeral</hi> he has cauſed, he takes his Degree; when he comes to <hi>Let Blood</hi> you would think him about to ſtick a <hi>Calf,</hi> and he Thumbs your <hi>Pulſe</hi> like a Carman playing on the <hi>Lute</hi>; his <hi>Library</hi> conſiſts in <hi>Peny Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,</hi> every Man and Woman their own Doctor is his Diſpenſatory, and as ſoon as he has read ſix Leaves in <hi>Culpeper,</hi> he ſends <hi>Death</hi> a Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to play a <hi>Prize</hi> with him at any <hi>Weapon</hi>; when People tell him their <hi>Grief</hi> and their <hi>Ails,</hi> he knows what the Diſeaſe is no more than <hi>Poor Robin,</hi> yet that he may ſay <hi>ſomething,</hi> tells them tis a <hi>Scurbattical Humour, afflicting the Diaphragma, and comes of Heats and Colds,</hi> and then pulling out a Box of <hi>Quicksilver Pills,</hi> (for his <hi>Pocket</hi> is all his <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copaeia</hi>) he bids 'um <hi>take them,</hi> and provide a <hi>Large Chamber Pot,</hi> and not doubt but they ſhall ſhortly find their Names in his <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Mighty Cures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His ambition is to be counted a <hi>Phyloſopher by fire,</hi> but is beholding to his Wife and kind Friends to compleat him a <hi>Vulcan</hi>; his Brain-pan is ſtuft with <hi>Antimony</hi> and <hi>Vitriol,</hi> but his faireſt pretence to <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is becauſe of an excellent trick he has got, to turn Powder of the Rows of Red-herrings, or a Vial of fair water, into good hard <hi>Silver,</hi> and by his Art <hi>Extracts</hi> Mony out of <hi>Piſs</hi> as faſt as <hi>Veſpatian</hi>; he rails at <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> and <hi>Hippocrates</hi> (as ſome <hi>Bigots</hi> do againſt the <hi>Pope</hi>) without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they were <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Women</hi>; but admires <hi>Van Helmont</hi> blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and fancies him &amp; <hi>Paracelſus</hi> to be two jolly <hi>Dutch Burgomaſters,</hi> that by the Hermetick art, firſt found out the making of <hi>Tophet Potabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> in the wounderful Invention of <hi>Snap-Dragons</hi> and burnt <hi>Brandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At firſt he deals as a private <hi>Mountebank,</hi> and makes every blind <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe</hi> he comes in his <hi>Stage,</hi> where he tells a <hi>Thouſand Lies</hi> of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous <hi>Cures,</hi> and has his <hi>Landlady</hi> at his Elbow to <hi>Vouch</hi> them: he bribes all the <hi>Nurſes</hi> he can meet with, and keeps a dozen <hi>Midwives</hi> in Penſion to proclaim his skill at <hi>Goſſipings,</hi> he indears the <hi>Chamber maid</hi> by a private <hi>Doſe,</hi> to bring him <hi>In</hi> with her <hi>Miſtreſs</hi>; the new Married <hi>Citizens Wife,</hi> that out-longs <hi>Rachel</hi> for a Bantling, comes to him for

the reputed ability of his Back, not his Brains, and the <hi>Suburb Gammers</hi> admire him for copeing a Pot ſo <hi>ſociably</hi>; ſometimes knowing his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines not worth buying, he takes up a humour of giving them away, and pretends to <hi>Cure</hi> all the <hi>Poor</hi> in the three Nations for <hi>nothing.</hi>
