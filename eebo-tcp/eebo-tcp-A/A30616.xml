         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Spectatours of
the Tragical End of
THOMAS MAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KERNESSE,
Grace
Mercy, and Peace,
&amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is not my Ambition to appear in
Print, that hath prompted me to
this Work; for none can be more
averſe from ſuch a thing than my
<pb facs="tcp:46086:3"/>
ſelf, as too conſcious of my Inability in
that kind, but the Advice and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of ſome, upon Conſiderations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
Gods Glory and the Publick
good and Intereſt of Souls, have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd
me to do what is otherwiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to my own Inclination; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
when I had pondered all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of that Affair, I am about
to relate, and found, that the hand of
God was eminently therein; that it was
a rare and greatly affecting inſtance of
Divine Power and Grace; that what
hath already been openly known, hath
made ſome awakening, and ſerious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
on the Minds of People, and
knowing that no Body was ſo throughly
acquainted with the whole as I am,
having ſpent much of my time with
him in Priſon for three or four Days,
I do therefore for theſe, and other Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
preſent this following Narrative to
the World.</p>
            <p>The Lord knows my deſign purely is
to <hi>Revive,</hi> and <hi>Inculcate</hi> more what
you have either ſeen or heard of ſo
wonderful a Providence. Oh that what
<pb facs="tcp:46086:3"/>
I write may be as <hi>Goads and as
Nails faſtened by the Maſters of
Aſſemblies,</hi> Eccl. 12. 11. And I hope
you that were the Viſitours of this
Poor Man, and you his Fellow-Priſoners,
have not ſo ſoon forgot his Expreſſions
at ſeveral times in your hearing. To
the end they may never be forgotten
by my ſelf, nor you, I publiſh them.
Let me appeal to your own Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
did not his <hi>Words,</hi> his <hi>Looks,</hi>
his <hi>Actions</hi> declare, that he was in
good earneſt for Eternity? Ah! Death
will make Men ſerious, when it ſhall
pleaſe God to ſet the Conſideration of
it home upon the Heart of a Poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>Cannot you remember how oft, ſome
of you at leaſt, have heard him admire
the Grace of God, that touched his
Heart with a feeling ſence of his Sin?
Did you never hear him ſay, <hi>I have
a bleeding Heart for Sin</hi>? I am ſure
ſome of you did; Oh let there not be
wanting in <hi>Wisbech</hi> Town, or Goal,
Hearts bleeding for Sin, while there is
a Heart there. What ſay you Sinners?
<pb facs="tcp:46086:4"/>
what were your thoughts when you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
this Poor Penitent? Did you think
to continue in your Sins, or to forſake
them? If the <hi>former,</hi> who can expreſs
and ſufficiently lament the hardneſs of
your Hearts, and miſery of your State?
But if the <hi>Latter,</hi> now put your then
good Reſolutions into Practice. Oh that
Conviction and Converſion Work may
not expire in <hi>Wisbech</hi> with this Poor
Creature, but let the Exhortation he
gave to ſome of you the Night before
his Death, be ever in your Memories
<hi>freſh,</hi> and <hi>lively.</hi> The Lord make it
effectual to you, and all others that ſhall
hear of it. <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>and turn
to God ſpeedily, Do not drive it off
ſo late as I did. Let it be now.</hi>
Mine is a late Repentance, though I
hope not too late. He was convinced
to the Quick, that in ſound Converſion
there muſt be Repentance towards God,
as well as Faith in our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt, and would oft ſay; I <hi>expect
Salvation at the Hands of God, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for the ſake of Jeſus Chriſt, my
ſweet Saviour, that Immaculate Lamb:
Yet muſt I earneſtly ſeek, and beg
<pb facs="tcp:46086:4"/>
it at his Hands, with a truly Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Heart, bleeding for Sin, and I
hope I do; it is my earneſt deſire to
do ſo.</hi> Imitate him in this; may it not
be in vain, that Providence brought
him hither to ſuffer Condign Puniſhment,
who had been once before condemned to
die at <hi>Lincoln:</hi> Oh that this one Soul
may be the firſt Fruits of a plentiful
Harveſt of Souls! So <hi>prays heartily,</hi>
            </p>
            <closer>
               <signed>Yours Affectionately,
Who would gladly ſpend
and be ſpent in the ſervice
of precious Souls.

MACKER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESSE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THomas Mackerneſs,</hi> Late of
<hi>March</hi> in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Eley;</hi>
was a Man of a moſt Profligate
and Heinouſly Wicked courſe
of Life. As to his Parentage and
Education, (being utterly a ſtranger
to him till after his Condemnation,)
I can ſay nothing, nor is it much
material. But by his own Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to me, and others, he was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
or rather infamous for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Impieties; living many Years
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:46086:6"/>
in ſuch a Diſſolute Flagitious and
Atheiſtical way, as was extreamly
hazardous to his Souls Eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
and expoſed him to the fatal
ſtroak of Juſtice, even from Men
here: He told me, that for
<hi>Drunkenneſs, Swearing, Whoring</hi> and
<hi>Theft,</hi> none had exceeded him; that
in theſe Capital and Epidemical Sins
of the Age, it was not poſſible to
apprehend how Notorious he had
been: For of late Years eſpecially,
he had abandoned all fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of God, giving himſelf wholly
up to work Wickedneſs; and to
uſe his own Phraſe, <hi>Had been the
Devil's Pack Horſe;</hi> or in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>
ſtile, <hi>Led captive by him at his will.</hi> At
laſt ſeized by the hand of Juſtice,
and laid in the Goal at <hi>Wisbech,</hi>
there he diſcovered the Hardneſs of
his Heart, and Impenitency, by all
the ways he was capable of in thoſe
Circumſtances he was then in. Thus
obdurate did the poor Wretch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
till the <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> and Sentence
was paſſed on him; which was on
<hi>Wedneſday the Fifteenth of</hi> Auguſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:46086:6"/>
               <hi>Laſt:</hi> I went not to Viſit him
till the <hi>Saturday</hi> Night after his
Condemnation, being prevented by
ſome Extraordinary Occaſions.</p>
            <p>When I firſt came into the
Room, one was praying with him,
and I obſerved him to be intent
upon that great Work. After it
was over, I entered into Diſcourſe
with him about his Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>
            <p>It was eaſie to diſcern by his
<hi>Looks</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions,</hi> that he was
under great Rebukes and Tumults
within, from a <hi>Guilty Conſcience.</hi>
Sometimes his Countenance would
be very Sad, Dejected and Diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as Indicative of inward
Horrour, Gripes, and Struglings,
fetching bitter Groans: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
he would ſpeak with ſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence;
charging Sin with vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Indignation, and higheſt Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations
of himſelf, ſaying, <hi>What
a vile Wretch have I been, for Lying,
Swearing,</hi> &amp;c. and the other Sins
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:46086:7"/>
before mentioned, <hi>with utter neglect
of God, and of his Sabbaths; there
was not a Viler and more Wicked
Wretch upon the Earth.</hi> He Liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Attentively to Counſel, and
ſaid, he <hi>had too long turned away
his Ear from hearing inſtruction.</hi> He
Enquired ſollicitouſly, how he
might come to God: Said, that
he was convinced it was his Duty
to go to God, but How he
ſhould go, and in what manner,
he added, I could inſtruct him
better then he knew of himſelf.
Now (ſaid he) <hi>I am Reſolved to
Prepare my ſelf for Dying, though at
firſt, when I returned from the Place
of Tryal, and Condemnation to Priſon,
many Vain Projects came into my
Head of preventing my Execution:
And truly</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>all along I
have cheriſhed flattering, but falſe hopes of
Eſcape, never once admitted a ſerious
thought of Death; till I heard the</hi>
Judge <hi>ſay,</hi> Mackerneſs, <hi>You ſhall
Die: And then thoſe Words ſtruck
me to the</hi> Heart, <hi>yet for a time I
ſtifled that Allarm; till on a Sudden
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:46086:7"/>
my Mind Labouring hard under ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Temptations to the contrary, and
overcoming them, I was fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to a Vigorous and Serious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to the Things of another
Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon I Endeavoured to help
him what I could, in the Great
work he had to do for his poor
Soul; Deſired, and Aſſiſted him to
look into himſelf, that he might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the Vileneſs, and Deformity
of his Depraved Nature, that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Corruption, from which all
the Evil of his Life proceeded, ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſome time in ſuch Diſcourſe as
I thought moſt conducive, throughly
to inform him of his Loſt, Undone
Eſtate, not without ſome fruit; I at
laſt commended him to God by
Prayer, ſo left him that Night, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
to come again the next
Night.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, I went, and found him
at Prayer himſelf, and in much the
ſame temper of Mind, though ſtill
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:46086:8"/>
more hopeful. He declined a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
ſaying <hi>He deſired no company,
but that which might do his Soul good.</hi>
For now he found all was vanity,
wiſhed he had looked into his own
heart, when he came firſt into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and deſired a few days longer
to have prepared for Death, but,
ſince that was impoſſible, feelingly
declared. That the worſt place in
Hell would be too good for him, if
he did not induſtriouſly improve
every Minute of this little Time. In
Prayer he did with great eagerneſs
catch hold of the expreſſions I uſed,
Repeating them over again with more
than ordinary fervency: When I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately
begged of God, that
thoſe poor Sinners (including the reſt
of the Priſoners, and particularly that
poor Woman that ſuffered with him)
might be as Firebrands pulled out
of the burning, he vehemently cryed
out, <hi>Firebrands indeed Lord:</hi> And when
I added, A Chriſt, good God, for
theſe miſerable Souls, he cryed aloud,
<hi>A Chriſt, and nothing but a Chriſt,
weeping as he ſpake;</hi> with much more
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:46086:8"/>
to the like purpoſe, giving various
expreſſions of a Heart, in ſome good
meaſure broken with a true ſenſe of
ſin and miſery thereby, ſeeming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
to ſpeak with me alone, but
could not that Night, by reaſon of
much company, and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
it till Morning.</p>
            <p>Coming again the next Morning,
he did ingenuouſly open to me the
ſtate of his Soul, and acquainted me
how Satan, that malicious and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
Adverſary, did watch for Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
againſt him, to obſtruct
his Proceeding, in the great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Soul's Salvation; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
more Self-Deteſtation, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with Pathetical and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Longings after Chriſt. Now
I obſerved in him ſome kindly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
of True Repentance;
which I laboured to Promote with
utmoſt diligence. He ſhewed me
ſeveral Books lent to him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which he asked my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
My Reply was, That he
had not time to Read Books, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:46086:9"/>
that I judged it beſt to lay them
all aſide, except the Bible, and
a little Book, Intitled, <hi>A Guide
for Heaven;</hi> becauſe it contained
Excellent Directions for a ſaving
cloſe with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I directed him to ſeveral Texts
of Scripture, which I deſired him
to Peruſe, and Meditate upon, in
my abſence: He thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
my Directions, and when
I returned in the Evening, he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
me on this manner, <hi>Welcome,
welcome Gueſt indeed! I can now
tell you, that you, and none but
ſuch as you are, that come to do
my Soul good, are welcome to me.</hi>
One might read a marvelous change
of his inward Diſpoſition in his
Countenance; he ſeemed tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with more than ordinary ſenſe
of the Quickening and Comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Influences of Divine Grace:
<hi>I have been conſidering</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>the Advice, your gave me, and
Meditating on thoſe Scriptures, you
directed me to: And, Oh! I ſee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:46086:9"/>
it is <hi>Nothing but a Chriſt</hi> will do me
good: Oh the Sweet Promiſes that God hath
made to Returning Sinners! Bleſſed be
God I am out of Hell.</hi> I had thought
I had <hi>been in Hell in the Night;
I ſaw, as it were, Hell Gaping,
the Devil Roaring, and my own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
Condemning me to the Pit of
Hell;</hi> and indeed crying <hi>out with
Horrour, Blood guſhed from my Noſe:
Some, that lay in the Room with
me, ſaid, I had been in a Slumber,</hi>
whether I was, or no, I could
<hi>not well</hi> tell, <hi>but thought I might be
ſo. However, when I found my ſelf
out of Hell, Oh, how it affected
me!</hi> Then he Wept and Melted
kindly, ſaying, <hi>Oh, what a Wretch
am I that I ſhould Sin againſt ſo
good a God, as this, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf ſo ready to forgive! I
am reſolved to lie at his Feet: I
am convinced that I am a loſt undone
Creature out of Chriſt: It is not all
I can do, that will or can ſave me:
Were I to Live my days over again,
and ſpend them in nothing but Prayers
and Tears, that could not Save me,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:46086:10"/>
no, it is nothing but the mercy of God
in Chriſt, that muſt ſave me; and
upon this will I truſt. I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
that at the laſt I will lay my
ſelf wholly at the Feet of God's Mercy
in Jeſus Chriſt, and there I will
Die:</hi> This he utteered with raiſed and
enlarged Affections. <hi>They have brougt
my Coffin, and I am not afraid to
ſee it;</hi> proceeded he, <hi>I thank God
I can freely Lie down in it: Theſe
Shackles about my Leggs are, as if
they were not; I do not regard them.
My Heart is ſo cheared with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of the Pretious Promiſes God
hath made to poor periſhing Sinners;
and</hi> Why not to me? <hi>And Why
not to thee indeed ſaid I.</hi> She Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>much, to whom much was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given:</hi>
Ah Reply'd he, <hi>it is much
muſt be forgiven me, Much indeed.</hi>
More to this purpoſe paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
us: Several other Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
were with him that Day,
and Prayed with him as he told
me, what Diſcourſe they had with
him I know not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:46086:10"/>
On <hi>Tueſday</hi> Morning, being the
day before his Execution, after ſome
Conference for the ſettling his
Faith and Hope upon a right bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
cautioning him againſt all the
deluſions of a ſubtile Tempter, and
ſelf-deceiving Heart, that he might
not be confident in himſelf, or any
thing elſe, but only in the ſure
Word of Truth, he broke out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a moſt <hi>Pathetical Rapture,</hi> not
without a Flood of Tears, Admire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Love of God to Man in
Chriſt Jeſus, ſo as was wonderful to
behold, and next to inexpreſſible:
Thus he continued for about a
quarter of an hour, his Heart ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as if it would break in pieces
before it could get vent, it ſeem'd
to me impoſſible ſuch Words, as
then flowed from his Mouth, ſhould
proceed from any other than an
Heart truly touched and broken
with godly Sorrow, and that felt
indeed, what the Love of God in
Chriſt meant. Oh how did he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe
himſelf, ſaying, <hi>There was no
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:46086:11"/>
Creature upon Earth more loathſome,
than he was to himſelf by Reaſon of
Sin,</hi> adding, <hi>He had been the Devils
Vaſſal, and Drudge, hurried on by him
to all manner of Evil, and that now
God ſhould touch his Heart with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe,
make him ſenſible of his Sin,</hi>
he did admire with greateſt thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.
One ſitting by, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> that Chriſtians
ſhould labour for it, as a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
thing, He anſwered, <hi>If the
Lord will not give me the aſſurance
of the Pardon of my Sins before I die;
yet if he will but inable me to Hope in
his Mercy, to ſeck him, wait, and truſt
in him, I will praiſe him.</hi> I ſpent the
greateſt part of this day with him
in <hi>Prayer, Inſtruction,</hi> and <hi>Exhortation.</hi>
He was not without ſome damps
upon his Spirit that Afternoon, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
his fear of miſcarrying; oft
loading himſelf with his Sins, as
exceeding the common ſize: And
yet durſt not but own, that the
Merits of Chriſts Blood and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God through him, were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
more and greater. Verily,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:46086:11"/>
it was marvellous to me, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the Methods of <hi>Free Grace</hi>
with this Poor Man: How the
Lord by a holy Fear and awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Apprehenſions of the evil of
Sin, and eternal Miſery, preſerved
him from carnal Security, and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption:
And alſo upheld him from
ſinking into horrid Diſpair, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out ſome Tokens of his Love,
and Mercy to him, now and then.
He was ever moſt humble, when
moſt raiſed with any Hopes of
finding acceptance with God through
the Lord Redeemer.</p>
            <p>Having left him three or four
hours, in the Evening, I viſited him
again, at which time People came
thronging into the Chamber, ſo as
created ſome trouble to the Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and He looking round on them,
dropt ſeveral ſeaſonable and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Exhortations to them, ſaying,
<hi>Come ſee the Fruit of Sin,</hi> and <hi>what
it will bring you all unto,</hi> if <hi>you don't
take warning by me, and turn to the
Lord by true Repentance,</hi> I mean not,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:46086:12"/>
               <hi>you ſhall all come to Shackles, and a
Halter, but <hi>to ſuch an</hi> Hell in your
Conſciences.</hi> Oh, <hi>I have felt a Hell
in my Conſcience.</hi> Then looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Coffin,</hi> Ah, ſaith he, <hi>I am
thinking a</hi> Houſe, <hi>a</hi> Town, <hi>a</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<hi>nay a</hi> Nation, <hi>could not hold
me, not long ago, and to morrow I
muſt be confined within the narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of that little room. Look Sirs,
what they that have moſt, muſt have
at laſt but their length,</hi> a Coffin:
<hi>Then ſhaking his Head,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I
may truly ſay with</hi> Solomon, <hi>All
worldly things are but Vanity, and
Vexation of Spirit, Vexation of Spirit
indeed to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Spending again ſome time in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
upon God with, and for him,
he was ſweetly affected in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and cryed out, <hi>Lord,</hi> thou haſt
ſaid, Whoſo is weary and heavy laden,
let him come to thee for reſt for his
Soul, and he ſhall find it. I am hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
laden with the Burthen of Sin,
it is a <hi>heavy</hi> Burthen, that I have
lain under theſe three, or four days, but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:46086:12"/>
thanks be to God, it is lighter than
it was, Lord, thou haſt ſaid, He that
cometh to thee, thou wilt <hi>in no wiſe
caſt out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It growing late, he deſired the
Company might be diſmiſt, and I
left with him alone; I deſired we
might ſing an Hymn before they
went away, all readily aſſented to
it, he joyned with us with a very
audible and chearful Voice: After
we had done, he ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be God
I can ſing with chearfulneſs. Did you
not Mind me, how chearfully I ſang?
My Heart is very much refreſhed with
the Conſideration of Gods Mercy, ſo
that it affected</hi> the Hearts of all
that were preſent; there were not
many dry eyes in the Room, though
full of People, who were aſtoniſhed
at what they ſaw and heard. When
all the Company was departed, he
told me, his Companions, that came
to viſit him, ſaid, <hi>Look, how he is
fallen in two or three days,</hi> ſhaking
his Head and lifting up his Hands,
he retorted, <hi>Oh happy fall for me,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:46086:13"/>
would to God I had ſo fallen ſooner;
Bleſſed be God for this fall, it is
the happieſt fall that ever I had:</hi>
After a little pauſe, <hi>To Morrow,</hi>
ſaid he, <hi>my poor Soul muſt take its
flight out of this Body; Oh that it might
flie into its Saviours boſome!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſignified to him, that I had
thoughts of ſtaying with him all
Night, he told me he could have
been glad of it; but for ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
we omitted it: He Prayed
me to come Early in the Morning,
and then not to leave him till I
ſaw him Executed. He moſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately
thanked me for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
I had done him, praying God
to reward me: I told him my
work was wages, excuſing my ſelf
that I came not ſooner to viſit the
Priſoners, telling him, it was oft
in my mind ſo to do, but a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Shame prevented</hi> me; Oh! ſaid
he, <hi>Would to God you had come
ſooner:</hi> And truly I found a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Acceptation among all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
beyond what I could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:46086:13"/>
I mention this only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
my Brethren in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
to viſit poor Priſoners. You
cannot tell till you try how welcom
you may be to ſuch diſtreſſed
Souls, and how ſerviceable for
their Eternal welfare. The general
greeting I had from this poor Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
after my ſecond viſit, was, <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
Welcome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I cannot omit the Civility
of Mr. <hi>Bloodwick,</hi> their Keeper,
who did readily admit of any that
might be helpful to the Souls of
thoſe under his charge; and the
peculiar excellency of Mrs. <hi>Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
is worth taking notice of, by
whoſe over-ſight the Priſon is kept
with great neatneſs, whereas other
Priſons are ſo filthy, as renders it
very prejudicial to the Health of
thoſe that viſit them; here it is not
ſo, the Niceſt perſons need not fear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
offended with ill ſcents.</p>
            <p>But to digreſs no further, I left
him that Night, promiſing to be
with him Early in the Morning:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:46086:14"/>
Soon after Four I went to him,
we ſpent moſt of the time till Nine
in Diſcourſing of what he had
Read after I left him, and in
Prayer: The frame of his Spirit
ſtill remained Humble, Tender and
in good meaſure: Spiritual Death
and Judgment were now Solemn
things in his Account and the
thoughts thereof lively and influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
on his whole deportment. He
laboured with mighty concernedneſs
how to <hi>Die Well,</hi> preſſed all about
him with ſtrong Arguments to live
better than he had done; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he ſtrictly admoniſhed and charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his <hi>Wife,</hi> who had been a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partner
with him in all his villany,
that ſhe ſhould immediately Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and what ſtraits ſoever ſhe
came into, ſtill to depend upon, and
truſt in God, following and ſerving
him in ways of true Religion and
Godly Fear, to keep her ſelf from the
ſnares of evil company, which had
been Ruinous to him, ſo dangerous to
her already, and is one of the greateſt
Engines of deſtruction the Devil uſes
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:46086:14"/>
in the World. Not only the Life of
his own Soul was precious to him,
but he ſhewed ſtrange Zeal for the
Salvation of others, pitied poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
with bowels of Compaſſions,
oft declaring his deep ſenſe of their
miſerable ſtate, who lived careleſs in
the matters of their Souls Eternal
Peace, and Comfort.</p>
            <p>A little before Execution, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
of him what <hi>Confeſſion</hi> he
thought to make, he ſaid, he was not
inclined to ſpeak much publickly in
that reſpect, for this reaſon, <hi>That he
judged it uſeleſs, and at moſt would only
gratifie ſome, who came for nothing elſe
but to hear him tell a long Story of a
Vicious Life, which was more likely to
diſcompoſe his own mind, than tend to
their Edification.</hi> Moreover he ſaid,
<hi>I cannot affect the Guilty, and for others,
ſome may believe me, ſome may not:
The Guilty know themſelves. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
leave them to God and their own
Conſciences, wiſhing them true Repentance,
that they may never come to this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
End.</hi> He did not think fit to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:46086:15"/>
go out of the World accuſing others,
whom he could no more than ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
and neither bring them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Puniſhment for what they had
done, nor prevent thereby their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
in the ſame courſe of Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
No, for (ſaid he) God muſt
convince them, and change their hearts,
which he did, and would pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for to his laſt.</p>
            <p>He was deſirous to imploy all his
little ſpace in ſeeking God, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
up himſelf to Jeſus Chriſt in
humble prayer; now and then ſaying,
<hi>Oh! my Time is ſhort, within a few
hours, yea moments, I ſhall be in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
<hi>O vain World!</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus he prepared himſelf to
Embrace Death with comfort; for
though any one might ſee great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs
in all his Carriage, when
going to the Place of Execution, and
when there, yet as little ſadneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
as ever did sn any in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
that was not abſolutely ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid,
and inſenſible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:46086:15"/>
Requeſting me oft not to leave
him till Death ſeparated us, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him to the Place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
where I prayed with him,
committing his Soul to God, he joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with me with great Ardency:
Then was ſung the latter part of the
39th <hi>Pſalm</hi> by his appointment; in
ſinging whereof he ſeemed Elevated
in Heart and Voice above moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
At laſt turning about and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
round on the multitude, he took
his farewell in theſe words, or words
to the like effect.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Gentle Spectators, You are come
to ſee a ſinful miſerable wretch
ſuffer this Ignominious Death; I
thank God it is not terrible to me,
for I truſt that I ſhall find Mercy with
God for my poor Soul, through
the precious Blood of my ſweet
Jeſus. You may ſee here what Sin
will bring you to; Oh take warning
by me; take heed of Sin; ſhun
Temptations; <hi>flee Evil Company;</hi>
beware of Sabbath-breaking, for by
this Sin the Devil begins with many
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:46086:16"/>
to draw them to all manner of
Wickedneſs, ſo he did with me; Oh
forſake all your Evil Ways! turn to
the Lord, he is a gracious God. Oh
vile Wretch! that I have ſo ſinned
againſt a holy, juſt and merciful God:
I have been a <hi>Prodigal</hi> indeed, but I
hope now a <hi>Returning one;</hi> Oh that
they that have been my Companions
in miſchief, may repent before it be
too late! I beg of them to fear
God, and mind their Souls: There
may be ſome of them that hear me
at this time, the Lord touch their
hearts: Oh do not ſtill go on! you
are known to God, who will call you
to account for all one day: Think
of it, I beſeech you; the Lord give
you Repentance, and Pardon your Sins,
that you may not come to this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
End you ſee me come to.</q> With
more to the like purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Then Reſigning himſelf to God, and
beging Acceptance with him, for the
Merits of a Dear and Alſufficient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
he Ended this Temporal and
miſerable Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:46086:16"/>
Hitherto I have given a bare Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Relation of what came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
my own perſonal knowledge; and
I Appeal to God for my Fidelity in
the whole: For, though in ſome
things I may have varied from his
preciſe words, (which yet I have
ſtuck to as much as is poſſible) I dare
confidently affirm, that I have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from his Senſe, and the truth
in any thing. Only let me add far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a few Obſervations for Spiritual
improvement; as, what may from the
Preceding Narrative be inferred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That when God ſets ſin upon
the Conſcience, and inlightens the
mind to ſee its Guilt, the moſt
obdurate ſinner cannot withſtand the
Terrors of Divine Wrath: This
was moſt plainly demonſtrated in this
Man's Caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that had once made
a mock of Sin (as all ungodly Fools
do) and no fear of the Great and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Majeſty of an Infinitely Holy,
Juſt and Omnipotent God, did lay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
upon him; but in contempt of
Hell and all the Threatnings of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Divine Diſpleaſure, ſwaggered
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:46086:17"/>
it out in thoſe ways that lead directly
to Eternal perdition, till the Lord graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
let in ſome beams of Holy Light
into his Soul; then how horrid were his
Sins? and how dreadful the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their juſt deſert! Oh, the Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
that I ſaw him in! How did he
Tremble? And the thoughts of
having to do with an Angry Almighty
God, will ſhake the Hearts of the ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Sinners; for, <hi>Who knows the power of
his Wrath? Who can dwell with Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That when Men come once
ſeriouſly to conſider Death, Judgment
and a future State, the neceſſity of a
Chriſt for their Souls, will preſently
and evidently appear to them: Did
not Men caſt theſe out of their
Thoughts, it could not be that they
ſhould live at eaſe; ſet ſo light by a
Saviour as the generality of them do.
Alas! Men put the evil Day far from
them, and look upon Death, Judgment
and things of another World, as at a
vaſt diſtance; or at moſt not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
certain, and ſo their <hi>Preparations</hi> for
Eternity are but Languid, Remiſs,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:46086:17"/>
Heartleſs and Inſignificant: But let
Death look them in the Face, and their
Minds be poſſeſſed with Sober, Lively,
Believing Apprehenſions of the grand
important matters of a World to come;
then give them a Chriſt, and nothing
but a Chriſt is the load and earneſt cry
of their Souls. Oh, the worth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and neceſſity of that pretious
Chriſt that they had long before vilified
and rejected!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If the Lord pleaſe to put a
poor Sinner upon ſollicitous care and
concern for Saving the Soul, no <hi>means</hi>
will be neglected, no diligence in the
uſe thereof wanting for that end; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
they will be much in Prayer:
Cry oft and mightily to the Lord for
Grace and Mercy: Give God and their
own Souls no reſt, till they find both.
Nothing more remarkable than this in
the preſent inſtance. What a price did
he ſet upon Prayer? as appears by this,
that he gladly accepted the Prayers of
any, though of never ſo mean capacity;
and though at firſt he could only Pray
with others help, yet upon my preſſing
him to exerciſe himſelf in Prayer,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:46086:18"/>
uſing his own expreſſions, and telling
him (when he pleaded he could not
Pray without help) that a due ſight
and ſenſe of our Sins, Wants and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries,
would find us matter enough for,
and open our Mouhts wide in Prayer.
He acknowledged he wanted not words
to plead with the Judge for his Life,
accepted my Counſel, ſet upon the
Duty, found aſſiſtance and comfort
therein; told me when I came next to
him; <hi>I thank God now I can Pray:</hi> And I
have heard him with Ardour of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
make his Addreſs to God. No time,
no pains were now too much for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his peace with God, obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of ſin, and working out his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But alas! is it not a ſad, and too
certain a ſign, that few are as ſolicitous
as they ought for their Souls. Would
there then be ſo many Prayerleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and families in the World? Would
God's Holy Day, Word and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and Neceſſary Means of Grace be
ſo neglected? Oh! that in <hi>Wisbech,</hi>
and every place there may be more
Praying, Striving and Running in the
ways of Gods Ordinances for Heaven;
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:46086:18"/>
that they would teſtifie abundantly
that they are in good earneſt to provide
for their Souls, and that the one thing
neceſſary is their chiefeſt buſineſs and
only weighty concernment in this
Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They that apprehend the
Mercy of God in Chriſt aright, will
look upon him as a moſt holy and
<hi>Righteous</hi> God alſo: They'll not ſet
Free Grace, and the Infinite Riches of
his Mercy in oppoſition to his Juſtice,
but admire and adore his Grace the
more, by ſeeing a full ſatisfaction to
his Juſtice in the Blood of his own dear
Son of indiſpenſible neceſſity. Scarce
did any more magnifie the Love and
Free Grace of God to ſinners, than he;
Bleſſing the Lord with admiration, that
his Mercies were ſo infinite, Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
boundleſs; yet had he an Eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſevereſt Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:
Oft, when ſpeaking how gracious
God is, and merciful to poor ſinners,
ſuch as he was; he would add, He is

juſt, as well as merciful; and therefore
he is merciful in Chriſt only, who can
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:46086:19"/>
ſatisfie his Juſtice: Oh that Sinners
therefore would not preſume upon the
meer Mercy of God, contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with a general Notion, that God
is merciful, and ſo will ſave them: For
all the Mercy and Grace in God, will
never ſave one Soul, but as it Runs
through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only
proper Channel of its Conveyance to
humble penitent believing Sinners.
'Tis Chriſt alone, who by the Sacrifice
of himſelf hath made Attonement for
Sin, paid a Price adequate and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
to Infinite Juſtice, born the
Curſe, fulfilled the Righteouſneſs of
the Law, for the Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of thoſe, who believe in him,
and obey his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>To conclude: Receive a word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation;
Up and be doing; omit no
opportunity; ſpare no induſtry for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
the Eternal Intereſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

Call of this ſad and Diſmal Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence

Patience, and Long-ſuffering towards

Sirs! the Judge is at the Door; the
