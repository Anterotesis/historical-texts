         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and dissent amongst the Judges, even in

those Lawes which are most fundamentall,
that we are lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of our highest priviledges, and those cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
which are most essentiall to Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
then we were before. To introduce
the legality of the Ship-scot, such a Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
hath been maintained, as destroyes all

liberty: and such art hath beene used to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
traverse, avoid, or frustrate the true force
or meaning of all our Lawes and Charters,
that if wee grant Ship-money upon these
grounds, with Ship-money we grant all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides.
To remove therefore this uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

these weighty and dangerous difficulties,
into serious debate, an solemnly end that
strife, which no other place of Judicature
can so effectually extinguish.</p>
            <p>That the King ought to have aid of his
subjects in time of danger, and common aid
in case of common danger, is laid down for
a ground, and agreed upon by all sides, But
about this aid there remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s much variety
and contrariety of opinion amongst the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Sages of our Law; and the principall
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:14368:3"/>
points therein controverted are these foure:
First, by what Law the King may compell
aid. Secondly, when it is to bee levied.
Thirdly, how it is to be levied. Fourthly,
what kinde of aid it must be.</p>
            <p>1 Some of the Judges argue from the
Law of Nature, that since the King is head,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound to protect, therefore he must have
wherewithall to protect: but this proves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that which no man denies. The next Law
insisted upon is Prerogative; but it is not
punctually explained what Prerogative, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Prerogative naturall of all Kings, or
the Prerogative legall of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Some of the Judges urge, that by Law
there is naturall allegeance due to the King
from the subject; and it doth not stand with
that allygeance that the Princes cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
aid, but must require the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
therein. Others presse, that the Law hath
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etled a property of goods in the subject, and
it doth not stand with that property, that the
King may demand them without consent.
Some take it for granted, that by Royall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative,
as it is part of the Lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the King may charge the Nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
publike consent, and therefore it being
part of the Law, it is no invasion upon
Law. Others take it for granted, that to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie
money without consent is unjust, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:14368:4"/>
that the Kings prerogative cannot extend to
any unjust thing: So many contrary points of
warre doe our Trumpets sound at once, and
in such confusion doe our Judges leave us,
whilest either side takes that for granted,
which by the other is utterly denied. By these
grounds Royall prerogative, and popular li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
may seeme things irreconciliable;
though indeed they are not; neither doth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side in words affirme so much, though
their proofes bee so contradictory. King
<hi>Charles</hi> his maxime is, that the peoples liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
strenghteus the Kings prerogative, and the
Kings prerogative is to maintain the peoples
liberty; and by this it seemes that both are
compatible, and that prerogative is the more
subordinate of the two. The Kings words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
since have beene upon another occasion,
That he ever intended his people should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
property of good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and liberty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
holding no King so great, as he that was
King of a rich and free people: and if they
had not property of goods, and liberty of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
they could bee neither rich nor free.
Here we see, that the liberty of the subject is
a thing which makes a King great; and that
the Kings prerogative hath only for its ends
to maintaine the peoples liberty. Wherefore
it is manifest, that in nature there is more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
due to the liberty of the subject, then to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14368:4"/>
the Prerogative of the King, since the one is
ordained onely for the preservation of the
other; and then to salve these knots, our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
must be, what prerogative the peoples
good and profit will beare, not what liberty
the Kings absolutenesse or prorogative may
admit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and in this dispute it is more just that
we appeale to written Lawes, than to the
breasts of Kings themselves. For we know
Nationall Lawes are made by consent of
Prince and people both, and so cannot bee
conceived to be prejudiciall to either side;
but where the meere will of the Prince is
Law, or where some few Ministers of his
may alleage what they will for Law in his
behalfe, no mediocrity or justice is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected:
we all know that no slave or villaine
can be subjected to more miserable bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
than to be left meerly to his Lords abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
discretion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we all see that the thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of such is most grievous, which have
no bounds set to their Lord discretion. Let
us then see what <hi>Fortescue</hi> writes, not regard
what Court-dependants doe interpret, and

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14368:5"/>
and plain, and in direct affirmance of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Law and usage of <hi>England,</hi> and it is not
sufficient for the Kings Counsell to say, that
these words extend not to Ship-money: for
if there were any doubt, the interpretation
ought rather to favour liberty than Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
            <p>It is not sufficient for Judge <hi>Iones</hi> to say,
that it is <hi>proprium quarto modo</hi> to a King, and
an inseparable naturall Prerogative of the
Crowne to raise monies without assent, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
he first prove that such Prerogative be
good and profitable for the people, and such
as the people cannot subsist at all without it:
nay, such as no Nation can subsist without it.
This word Prerogative hath divers accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
sometimes it is taken for the altitude of
Honour, sometimes for the latitude of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
So we say the Prerogative of an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
is greater than that of a King; and
that of a King greater than that of a Duke,
or petty Poten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ate: and yet of Kings we say
that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath not so great a
Prerogative as the King of <hi>England,</hi> nor the
King of <hi>England</hi> as the King of <hi>France,</hi> &amp;c.
For here though their honour and title be the
same, yet their power is not. Sometimes Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
signifies as much as Soveraignty;
and in this generall consideration wee say,
that all supreame Commanders are equall:
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14368:5"/>
and that they all have this essential insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Prerogative, that their power ought to
be ample enough for their perfection, and
good of the people, and no ampler: because
the supreame of all humane Lawes is <hi>salus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli.</hi>
so this Law all Lawes almost stoope;
God dispences with many of his Lawes, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>salus populi</hi> shall bee endangered;
and that iron-law, which we call necessity it<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe,
is but subservient to this Law: for ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then a Nation shall perish, any thing
shall be held necessary, and legall by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But to come to the Prerogative of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>

               </gap>ke of it in generall, and
comparatively; we say it is a harmonious
composure of policie, scarce to be paralleld
in all the world, it is neither so boundlesse as
to opresse the people in unjust things, nor
so strait as to disable the King in just
things; by the true fundamental constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of <hi>England,</hi> the beame hangs even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and the Subject: the Kings

howsoever we ought not to condemne any
Nation as unjust herein, though differing
from us; for though they seem perhaps very
unpolitick, yet it is hard to be affirmed that
God and Nature ever ordained the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod

such as are not essentiall to royalty, but
may bee annulled by the same power by
which they were created. That a King shall
defend and maintaine his subjectes, is a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
belonging to the Office, not a priviledge
belonging to the Crowne of a King; this
obligation nature layes upon him, and no
other power can dissolve it. Also that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
shall afford aid, and joyne with their
Princes in common defence, is a duty arising
from the allegeance of the people, and not an
honor redounding only to the Prince; natures
law hath made this a tie, not to be changed
or infringed: for that which is annexed by
an eternall superiour power cannot be made
severable by a temporall humane power:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14368:7"/>
but that such an Emperour, King or Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,

            <p>This resolution seemes very strange to me,
since the Law of Tenures and Purveyors is

that it cannot; or may not subsist without it.

Flower out of the Regall Garland, nor would
it be (perhaps) Profitable for the State, to
suffer the least diminution thereof. Wee
know also, that in England the Prerogative
hath beene bound in many cases, by Statute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law,
and restrained of diverse such priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
as were not essentiall, but meerely poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall.
<hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Regi:</hi> this was
one of the English Royalties, and very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
many wayes, yet wee know this is
in diverse cases limited by Act of Parliament,
and that very justly, as <hi>I. Hutton</hi> argues,
The great and ancient Tax of Dangelt, it was

               </gap>e,
yet this was first released by King <hi>Stephen,</hi>
and after abolished for ever by the statutes of
<hi>Edward</hi> the first: and there is no reason why
an Act of Parliament should not bee as valid
in our case as it was in that. Wherefore it is
to be admired, that <hi>J. Iones</hi> should account
this way of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in all ages done such noble acts without it;
and not onely defended, but also enlarged
their Dominions. The last kinde of accept<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on
of this word Prerogative is improper.
Thus to pardon malefactors, to dispence
with penall Lawes, to grant <hi>Non obstantes,</hi>
to be free from attainders, to call or discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
to prorogue or dissolve Parliaments,
&amp;c. are not truly and properly called Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives:
these all in some sense may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Munities, or indemnities belonging to
the sacred person of the King, as he is invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
and subject to no force &amp; compulsion
of any other, And as he is the soule of Law,
in whose power alone it is to execute Law,
and yet not to be constrained thereto. To
grant a pardon for some malefactors for
some crimes, may perhaps be as heynous as to
commit them; and that which drawes a guilt
upon the King, cannot be said to be his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.
If it might be tearmed a Royalty,
that the King is not questionable, or punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
or to be forced to such acts as tend to
the obstruction of justice, it might as well
be so tearmed in acts tending to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
of Law: for in both he is alike free
from any coercive or vindicative force. For
it is out of necessity, not honour or benefit,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:14368:8"/>
that the King hath a freedome from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
or restraint in these cases; and that
this freedome is inseparable, because no force
can be used but by superiours or equals, and
he which hath either superiours or equall, is
no King. If a King should shut up the Courts
of ordinary Justice, &amp; prohibit all pleadings
and proceedings betweene man and man, and
refuse to authorize Judges for the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of suits, hee would bee held to doe a
most unkingly thing: and yet this may be as
truly called a Prerogative, as to difuse and
dissolve Parliaments. But it may be obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
that the King, besides such negative pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
and freedome from force, hath also a
positive and siezing subjects lands, &amp;c. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
cases, as in making Bulwarks upon any
mans land for common defence, &amp;c. To
this it may be answered, That to such power
the King is not intituled by his Prerogative,
nor is it any benefit to him, necessity herein
is his only warrant: for either this private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
must happen, or a publike ruine
follow; and in nature the lesse and private
evill is to be chosen: and here the party tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
enjoyes safety by it, and shall after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
satisfaction for his detriment. Were
there such apparent unavoidable necessity in
the Ship-scop, that either that course must
be taken, or the community inevitably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rish,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:14368:9"/>
or where the King wholly disinteressed
in point of profit, or were there hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution,
it could not be without consent,
and so not against Law. So then, for ought
that is yet alleaged, Prerogative, except that
which is essentiall to all Kings, without which
they cannot bee Kings, is alterable, and it
ought to be deducsed out of the written and
knowne Lawes of the Kingdome, and Law
is not to be inferred out of that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we ought
not to presume a Prerogative, &amp; thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
it a Law, but we ought not to cite the
Law, and thence prove it to be Prerogative.
To descend then to our owne Lawes, yet
there our Judges vary too. What the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law was in this point is doubted by
some<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and some say if the Common Law did
allow the King such a Prerogative, to lay a
generall charge without consent, then Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
cannot alter it.</p>
            <p>Some doe not accept against the force of
Statute Law, but avoid our particular Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
by divers severall evasive answers. Some
say our Great Charter was but a grant of the
King, extorted by force; some except against
the 25. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. because there is <hi>sal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o</hi> in it:
some against the 34. of <hi>Ed.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. as made in the
Kings absence; some object against the 14.
of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. as if it were temporary, and because it
is not particularly re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ited in the Petition of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:14368:9"/>
Right: and the common evasion of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficiall
Statutes, &amp; of the Petition of right,
is, that they binde the King from imposing
pecuniary charges for the replenishing of his
owne coffers, but not from imposing such
personall services, as this Ship-scot is, in time
of danger and necessity. J. <hi>Crawly</hi> maintaines
this Ship-scot to be good by Prerogative at
the Common Law, and not to be altered by
Statute. What the Common Law was, this
Court can best determine; but it is obvious
to all men, that no Prerogative can be at the
Common Law, but it had some beginning,
and that must be from either King or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
or both: and in this, it is not superiour
to our Statute Law, and by consequence not
unalterable. The Medes and Persians had a
Law, that no Law once past, should ever be
repealed; but doubtlesse this Law being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
first, all others might after suffer the
same alteration, and it is most absurd to think
that this Law might not be repealed by the
same authority by which it was at first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted.
J. <hi>Iones</hi> sayes, our Statutes restraine
tollages in generall termes, and cites divers
cases, that a speciall interest shall not passe
from the King, but in speciall terms: but his
cases are put of private grantees, over whom
the King ought to retai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e a great prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence:
but the Law is, that where the whole
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:14368:10"/>
state in grantee, that grant shall have the force
of a Statute, because it is <hi>pro bono publico,</hi> and
because the whole State is in value and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as much to be preferred before the King,
as the King is before any private grantee. But
J. <hi>Iones</hi> sayes further, if generall words shall
extend to these extraordinary publike levies,
then they may as well extend to his ordinary
private rights &amp; intradoes, &amp; so cut off <hi>Aide
pur faire filz Chivalier, &amp;c.</hi> The contrary
hereof is manifest, for the intent of all our
Statutes is to defend the subject against such
publike tollages and impositions, as every
man is equally liable to, and as are not due
in Law otherwise, or recoverable by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
action. Now these aids, &amp;c. and the
Kings ordinary revenues and services, are
not such as are due from every man, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
by ordinary action. Howsoever
in all these doubts the Law would now be
made cleare, and not onely the vertue of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
in generall, but also the true meaning of
our particular Charters would be vindicated
from these exceptions.</p>
            <p>2 I come now to our second difficulty,
when a publike charge may be laid. Here
the favourers of Ship-money yet agree, that
the King may not charge the subject meerly
to fill his owne coffers; or annually, or when
he will invade a forraigne enemy, or when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14368:10"/>
Pirates rob, or burn Townes and Burroughs,
for these ordinary defence is sufficient: and
when there is imminent and eminent danger
of publike invasion, we agree that the subject
may be charged.</p>
            <p>The <hi>quaere</hi> then is, whether the King bee
sole Judge of the danger, and of the remedy,
or rather whether he be so sole Judge, that
his meere affirmation and notification of a
danger foreseene by him at a distance, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely to be foreseene, shall be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
that he may charge the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
thereupon at his discretion, though
they assent not, nor apprehend the danger as
it is forewarned. J. <hi>Crooke</hi> proves the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
thus: If danger, sayes he, be far distant,
if it be in report only of French Armadoes,
and Spanish preparations, &amp;c. though it be
certaine, and not pretensive, yet Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tary
aid may be speedy enough: and if it be
imminent, then this way of Ship-scot will
not be speedy enough; for either the design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
is really to have new Ships built, and that
will require longer time than a Parliament;
or else money onely is aimed at, whereby to
arme other Ships, and for this the Law hath
provided a more expedite way than by Ship-scot,
in case of imminent danger.</p>
            <p>If then the King have power to presse all
mens persons and Ships, and all are bound
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14368:11"/>
               <hi>exponere se, &amp; sua,</hi> and to serve <hi>propriis sumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us,</hi>
when imminent danger is, and this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
hath alwayes beene held effectuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
it is consequent, that if he be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute
of competent aid in present distresses,
he cannot pretend a greater necessity in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
more remote, when they are but suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
or perhaps pretended onely.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Bramston</hi> sayes here, that there is
a necessity of preventing a necessity: and
that the Sea is part of the Kingdome, and
therefore of necessity to be guarded as the
Kingdome. The answer is, That the safety of
the Kingdome does not necessarily depend
upon the Ship-scot, and so this necessity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
removed, the necessity grounded upon
this, fals off of it selfe. For if the Kingdome
may escape ruine at hand when it is a storme,
without Ship-money, it may much more
escape it afar off being but a cloud. But grant
the Sea to be a part of the Kingdome to some
purposes, yet how is it a part essentiall, or
equally valuable; or how does it appeare that
the fate of the Land depends wholly upon
the dominion of the Sea? <hi>France</hi> subsists
now without the regiment of the Sea, and
why may not we as well want the same? If
<hi>England</hi> quite spend it selfe, and poure out
all its treasure to preserve the Seigniory of
the Seas, it is not certaine to exceed the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14368:11"/>
force of <hi>France, Spaine, Holland,</hi> &amp;c.
And if it content if selfe with its ancient
strength of shipping, it may remaine as safe as
it hath formerly done. Nay, I cannot see that
either necessity of ruine, or necessity of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
can be truly pretended out of this,
that <hi>France, Spaine, Holland,</hi> &amp;c. are too po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
at Sea for us.</p>
            <p>The dominion of the Seas may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as a meer right, or as an honour, or as a
profit to us. As a right, it is a theame fitter
for schollers to whet their wits upon, then
for Christians to fight and spill bloud a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout:
and since it doth not manifestly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
how or when it was first purchased,
or by what Law conveyed to us, we take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of it only as matter of wit and disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As it is an honour to be masters of the
Sea, and to make others strike saile to us as
they passe; its a glory fitter for women and
children to wonder at, then for States-men to
contend about. It may bee compared to a
chaplet of flowers, not to a diadem of gold:
but as it is a profit to us to fence and inclose
the Sea, that our neighbours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hall not surprise
us unawares; its matter of moment, yet it
concernes us but as it doth other Nations:
by too insolent contestations hereupon, wee
may provoke God, and dishonour our selves:
we may more probably incense our friend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14368:12"/>
then quell our enemies, we may make the
land a slave to the sea, rather than the sea a
servant to the land; but I pray Master <hi>Selden</hi>
to pardon me for this transition, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
my matter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the Kingdome could
not possibly subsist without Ship-money in
such a danger, yet there is no necessity that the
King should be so sole Judge of that danger,
as that he may judge therein contrary to the
opinion, and perhaps, knowledge of other
men. I allow the King to be supreame, and
consequently sole Judge in all cases whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
as to the right, and as to the diffusion of
Judgement; but as to the exercise and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of judgement, he is not, nor ought not
to be accounted sole Judge. In matters of
Law the King must create Judges, and sweare
them to judge uprightly and impartially, and
for the sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ect against himselfe, if Law so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
yea, though he be of contrary judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
himselfe, and by his Letters sollicite the
contrary. The Kings power is as the disgestive
faculty in nature, all parts of the body con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
heat to it for their owne benefit, that
they may receive backe againe from it a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
concocted and prepared supply of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment,
as it is their office to contribute, so
it is the stomacks to distribute.</p>
            <p>And questionlesse sole judgement in
matters of State, does no otherwise belong

And by this meanes if he regard not his
word more than his profit, he may in one
yeare draine all the Kingdome of all its trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and leave us the most despicable slaves
in the whole world.</p>
            <p>It is ridiculous also to alleage, as J. <hi>Iones</hi>
does, that it is contrary to presumption of
Law to suspect falsity in the King: for if
Law presume that the King will not falsly
pretend danger to vex his subjects, of his
owne meere motion, yet no Law, nor reason,
nor policy will presume, that the King may
not be induced by mis-information to grieve
the people without cause. The Sunne is not
more visible than this truth, our best Kings,
King <hi>Charles,</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
and all the whole ascending line, have done
undue illegall things sometimes, contrary
to the rights and Franchises of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mis-informed, but having consulted with
the Judges or States in Parliament, they have
all retracted and confessed their error. Nay,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14368:13"/>
there is nothing more knowne, or universally
assented to than this, that Kings may be bad;
and it is more probable and naturall, that
evill may be expected from good Princes,
than good from bad. Wherefore, since it is
all one to the State, whether evill proceed
from the King mediately or immediately,
out of malice or ignorance: and since wee
know that of all kinds of government Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall
is the worst, when the Scepter is
wielded by an unjust and unskillfull Prince,
though it be the best, when such Princes as
are not seduceable (a thing most rate) reigne,
it will be great discretion in us not to desert
our right in those Lawes which regulate and
confine Monarchie, meerly out of Law-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;
if we must presume well of our
Princes, to what purpose are Lawes made:
and if Lawes are frustrate and absurd, where
in doe we differ in condition from the most
abject of all bond-slaves?</p>
            <p>There is no Tyranny more abhorred than
that which hath a controlling power over all
Law, and knowes no bounds but its owne
will: if this be not the utmost of Tyranny,
the Turks are not more servile than we are:
and if this be Tyranny, this invention of ship-money
makes us as servile as the Turks. We
must of necessity admit, that our Princes are
not to be mis-led, and then our Lawes are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14368:13"/>
needlesse; or that they may be misse-led, and
then our Lawes are uselesse. For if they will
listen to ill councell, they may bee mooved
to pretend danger causlesly; and by this
pretence defeate all our lawes and liberties,
and those being defeated, what doth the
English holde, but at the Kings meere dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
wherein doth the excell the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
condition? if wee shall examine why
the Mahometan slaues are more miserably
treated, then the Germans, or why the
French Pesants are so beggerly, wretched,
and bestially used more then the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,
or why the people of Millaine,
Naples, Sicily are more oppressed, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled
upon, and inthralled then the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
of Spayne? there is no other reason
will appeare but that they are subject to
more immoderate power, and have lesse
benefit of law to releeve them.</p>
            <p>In nature there is no reason, why the
meanest wretches should not enjoy free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
and demand justice in as ample mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
as those whom law hath provided for:
or why Lords which are above law should
bee more cruell then those which are
more conditionate: yet wee see it is a fatal
kind of necessity onely incident to immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
power, that it must bee immoderately
used: and certainly this was well knowne to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14368:14"/>
our incestors, or else they would not have
purchased their charters of freedome with
so great an expence of blood as they did,
and have endured so much so many yeeres
rather then to bee betrayd to immoderate
power, and prerogative: let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
not bee too carelesse of that, which
they were so jealous of, but let us look nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into the true consequence of this
ship-scot, whatsoever the face of it appeare
to bee. It is vaine to stop twenty leakes in a
ship, and then to leave one open, or to
make lawes for the restraynt of loyalty all
other wayes, that it may not overflow the
estates of the comminalty at pleasure, and
yet to leave one great breach for its irrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>All our Kings hitherto have beene so
circumscribed by law, that they could not
command the goods of their subjects at
pleasure without common consent: but
now if the King be but perswaded to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
danger, hee is uncontroleable Master
of all wee have, one <hi>datum est intelligi,</hi> shal

               </gap>ham, and no better: I doe
not say that this King will falsifie, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
that wee all, and all that wee have are
at his discretion if hee will falsifie; though
vast <hi>power</hi> bee not <hi>abused,</hi> yet it is a great
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14368:14"/>
mischiefe that it may, and therefore vast
<hi>power</hi> it selfe is justly odious, for divers
reasons. First, because it may fall into the
hands of ill disposed <hi>Princes,</hi> such as were K.
<hi>Iohn, Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> the second,
<hi>Richard</hi> the second. These all in their times
made <hi>England</hi> miserable, and certainely
had their power beene more unconsineable
they had made it more miserable. The
alterations of times doe not depend upon the
alteration of the people, but of <hi>Princes:</hi> when
<hi>Princes</hi> are good it fares wel with the people
when bad ill.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Princes</hi> often vary, but the people is alwaies
the same in all ages, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> capable of smal,
or no variations: If <hi>Princes</hi> would endure
to heare this trueth it would bee profitable
for them, for flatterers alwaies rayse jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies
against the people; but the trueth is,
the people as the sea, have no turbulent
motion of their owne, if <hi>Princes</hi> like the
windes doe not raise them into rage. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
vast power if it finde not bad <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
it often makes <hi>Princes</hi> bad: It hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
charged <hi>Princes,</hi> as it did <hi>Nero</hi> from
good to bad, from bad to worse: but <hi>Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pasian</hi>

Empire was in <hi>melius mutatus:</hi> daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

            <p>
               <hi>Subsidies</hi> were in former times seldome
granted, and few at a time, now <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
are helde by some to be of no other use
then to grant them.</p>
            <p>The Fox, in <hi>Esop,</hi> observed that of all the
Beasts which had gone to visite the <hi>Lyon,</hi> few
of their foot-steps were to be seene <hi>retrorsum,</hi>
they were all printed <hi>adversum.</hi> And we find
at this day, that it is farre more easie for a
King to gaine undue things from the people,
then it is for the people to re-gaine its due
from a King: This King hath larger <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi>
and hath raigned yet fewer years, and
enjoyed qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

And yet his taxations hath beene farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and his Exploits lesse honourable, and
the yet people is still helde in more jealousie.</p>
            <p>To deny Shippe-mony which sweeps all, is

               </gap>eld and accounted a rejection of naturall Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance.
I speake not this to render odious the
Kings blessed government, God forbid, I hold
him one of the mildest, and most gracious of
our Kings: And I instance in him the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
that we may see, what a bewitching
thing flattery is, when it touches uppon this
string of unlimitable power: if this ambition
and desire of vast power were not the most na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall,
and forcible of all sinnes, <hi>Angels</hi> in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14368:15"/>
               <hi>Heaven,</hi> and man in <hi>Paradize</hi> had not falne
by it; but since it is, <hi>Princes</hi> themselves ought
to be the more cautious and cautilous of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> vast power if it neither find nor
make bad <hi>Princes,</hi> yet it makes the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
of good <hi>Princes</hi> the lesse pleasing,
and the lesse effectuall, for the common and
publicke good: And therefore it is a rule both
in <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Policy,</hi> and Nature, <hi>Non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currendum

such as the <hi>Ship-scot</hi> is, whereby all liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in eighty eight was victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
without this <hi>Taxation,</hi> and I am fully
perswaded she was therefore Victorious the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because she used it not. Her <hi>Arte</hi> was
to account her <hi>subjects hearts</hi> as her <hi>unfailing

nor deceived her, and in that dismall gust of
danger, it was good for her and the whole
State, both that she did not relye upon forced
aides of money, or the Swords of grieved
Souldiers; For this <hi>Ship-money,</hi> nothing can
be pretended but necessity, and certainly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
is ill pretended; when the <hi>meere doing of
the</hi> thing, <hi>is as</hi> dangerous <hi>as that for</hi> which <hi>it

            <p>
               <hi>Wee know</hi> Nature <hi>teacheth us all,</hi> Of two
Evils to chuse that which wee thinke the
least, though it bee not so; therefore if the
people apprehend this Remedy as a Thing
worse then the Disease, though they be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
therein, yet that very mistake may
proove fatall.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Army beeing harshly treated
by the <hi>Senators,</hi> and their proud <hi>Generall,</hi>
did refuse to charge upon the <hi>Enemy,</hi> or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
the charge of the <hi>Enemy,</hi> they chose rather
to be slaughtered by <hi>Strangers,</hi> then Enthral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

            </p>
            <p>Thus wee see there is no necessity of levying
<hi>Ship-money,</hi> there is rather necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
it: And we see that presumption of

upon their subjects.</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But I come now to my third D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficulty, how
a publick charge is to be laid upon the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
The law runs generally, that in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
no Tollage or pecuniary charge may
bee imposed <hi>Forsque per common assent de
tout la Realme,</hi> or <hi>Si non per common consent
de Parliement.</hi> Some presidents, or matters of
fact appeare, wherein some Kings have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
times invaded this right of the subject,
but upon conference had with the Iudges,
or petition in Parliament, redresse was ever
made, and the subjects right re-established.
All the colour which can be brought to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
the Law in our case, is, that the words
of the law are generall Taxes and Tollages,
but doe not by special mention restrain extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
impositions, in time of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
danger. But wee know the Petition of
Right, 3. <hi>Car.</hi> is grounded upon former
Statutes, and recites divers of them, and is a
cleare affirmance of the common right of
England; and yet by that the commissions
for Loanes were damned: and it is evident
that those Loanes were demanded for the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14368:17"/>
generall defence of the Kingdome in time
of imminent danger; and by the same Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
not onely Loanes, but all other levies
of money upon what pretence of danger
soever, <hi>Si non per common consent,</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as illegall, and contrary to the
Lawes and Rights of <hi>England.</hi> Two things
therefore are objected against Parliaments:
First, that they are of slow motion, and so
most of the Iudges alledge. Secondly, that
they may be perverse, and refuse due aid to
the King, and so I. <hi>Crawley</hi> boldly suggests.
For answere wee say in generall: First, that it
is the wisdome of Kings to bee alwayes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilant,
and to have their eyes so open upon
forraigne <hi>Princes,</hi> and to maintaine such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
that no preparation from abroade
may surprize them before recourse had to
Parliament; and this is very easie to insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<hi>Princes,</hi> who have a competent strength
of shipping, Secondly, to have alwayes in
readinesse against all sudden surprizes, a
sufficient store of ammunition and arms both
for sea and land-service: and the revenues
of the Crowne of England are sufficient for
this purpose, and have beene held more then
sufficient in former times, when hostility
was greater, and the Kingdome smaller.
Thirdly, to seeke advise and assistance from
Parliaments, frequently in times of quiet,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14368:18"/>
as well as of danger, as well when warre is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t
smoaking, or kindling, as when it is blown
into a flame. Before the conquest this was
held policie, and since in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds
time, a statute past to this purpose; and if
<hi>parliaments</hi> of late bee growne into dislike,
it is not because their vertue is decaid, it is
because the corruption of the times cannot
endure such sharpe remedies. Fourthly, to
speake particularly of this case of ship-money,
wee say that it is a course more slow then by
<hi>parliament:</hi> there was more expedition used
in <hi>parliament</hi> to supply King <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rles,</hi> since
hee came to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> then can this way.
And wee say moreover, that as the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Kingdome was when ship-money
was demanded, whatsoever was pretended
to the contrary, a <hi>parliament</hi> might have
beene timely enough called, and seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
enough supplied the King. As to the
second objection of I. <hi>Crawly,</hi> too unfit to
come out of any honest wise mans mouth,
but much more for a Iudges, Iudge <hi>Crooke</hi>
replies, that as there is <hi>nullum iniquum in
Lege,</hi> so neither <hi>in parliamento.</hi> The three
noted factions which are adverse to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are the papists, the prelates, and
Court parasites; and these may bee therefore
supposed to hate <hi>parliaments,</hi> because they
knowe themselves hatefull to parliaments.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14368:18"/>
It is scarse possible for the King to finde out
any other that thinkes ill of Parliaments, or
is ill thought of by <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Of <hi>Papists</hi>
little neede to bee said, their enmity is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
they have little to pretend for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
but that parliaments are growne pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritannicall.
The prelates thinke themselves
not to have jurisdiction and power enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and they knowe that <hi>Parliaments</hi> thinke they
have too much, and abuse that which they
have much more: therefore to uphold
themselves, and to crush their ill-willers,
they not only tax <hi>Parliaments</hi> of purita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme,
but all puritans of sedition: as much
as in them lies, they wed the King to their
quarrell, perswading him that <hi>Parliaments</hi>
out of puritanisme, do not so much aime
at the fall of Episcopacie, as Monarchy,
and that Episcopacie is the support of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
so that both must stand and fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Howbeit because they cannot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braide
<hi>Parliaments</hi> of attempting any thing
against <hi>Monarchy</hi> further then to mainetaine
due liberty, therefore they preach an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable
prerogative, and condemne all law
of liberty as injurious to Kings and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with <hi>Monarchy. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And the common Court doctrine is, that
Kings are boundlesse in authority, and that
they onely are <hi>Cesars</hi> friends which justifie
that doctrine; and from this doctrine hath
growne all the jealousies of late betweene
the King and his best subjects; and this is
that venemous matter which hath laien
burning, and ulcerating inwardly in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels
of the common-wealth so long. The
other enemies of Parliaments, are Court
dependants, and projectors, which have
taken advantage of this unnaturall dissenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt the King and his Subjects; and
have found out meanes to live upon the
spoile of both, by siding with the King,
and beeing instruments to extend his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
to the purchasing of preferment to
themselves, disaffection to the King, and
vexation to the common-wealth. These
three factions excepted, and some few
Courtiers which are carryed with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of example, or are left to speake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing
trueths, there is scarce any man in
all the Kings dominions, which doth
not wish for parliaments, as the States
best physick, nay almost as its naturall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14368:19"/>
food: but I will instance in three
things wherein parliaments excell all other
Councells whatsoever.</p>
            <p>1. For wisedome, no advice can bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
so prudent, so profound, so universal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comprehending, from any other author;
it is truely sayd by Sir <hi>Robert Cotten,</hi> that all
private single persons may deceive and bee
deceived; but all cannot deceive one, nor
one all.</p>
            <p>That an inconsiderable number of Priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does
should see or knowe more then whole
Kingdomes, is incredible: <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>x populi</hi>
was ever reverenced as <hi>vox Dei,</hi> and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are infallble, and their acts indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to all but Parliaments. It is a just law,
that no private man must bee wiser then
Law publickly made. Our wis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st Kings in
<hi>England,</hi> have ever most relied upon the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, no advice can bee so faithfull,
so loyall, so religious and sincere, as that
which proceeds from parliaments, where
so many are gathered together for Gods
service i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> such a devout manner, we cannot
but expect that G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d should bee amongst
them: and as they have a more especiall
blessing promised them; so their ends can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee so sinister: private men may thrive
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:14368:20"/>
by alterations: and common calamities,
but the common body can effect nothing
but the common good, because nothing
else can bee commodious for them.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> in the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the
third, according to the Court Doctrine at this
present, saies, that in <hi>Parliament</hi> Kings are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
lesse then they should be, and the people more.
If this bee spoken of irregular Kings, which will
endure to heare of nothing but prerogative go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
it may cary some semblance of trueth:
but sure i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> is, good and wise Kings are ever
greatest when they sit immured, as it were,
in that honourable Assembly: as the Historie
of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and many of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors
testifies. Tis true, <hi>K. Henry</hi> the
third, met with divers oppositions in
<hi>Parliament:</hi> Hee was there upbrayded,
and called <hi>dilapidator regni;</hi> it was true that
hee was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o, and the most unworthy of rule
that ever sate sate in this Throne; yet those
words became not subjects: I doe not ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fie,
but in some part extenuate such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanors;
for the chiefe blame of those
times is not to bee throwne upon the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and commons, but upon the King
and his out-landi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> parasites. <hi>It is without
all question also that in those bloudy unjust
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imes, had it not beene for frequent parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14368:20"/>
and that soveraigne remedy which
thereby was applyed to the bleeding wounds
of the Kingdome, no other helpe could have
stanched them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Even then, when Parliaments were most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent,
and when they had so much provocation
from so variable an uncapable a <hi>Prince,</hi> they
did not seeke to conditionate prerogative, or to
depresse <hi>Monarchy</hi> for the future, though they
were a little to injurious to him in person for
the present.</p>
            <p>Since that time also many <hi>Parliaments</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ve
had to struggle for due liberty with insolent prin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces,
and have had power to clip the wings of
<hi>Royalty;</hi> and the custome of all <hi>Europe</hi> almost
besides hath seemed to give such countenance to
such attempts; but the deepe wisedome, &amp;
inviolable loyalty of <hi>Parliaments</hi> to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
of governement hath bin such, that they
never made any invasion upon it. As it was
in all former ages, so it now remaines intire
with all its glorious ensignes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and all the complements of power;
and may hee be as odious which seekes too
alter or diminish Monarchicall governement
for the future, as he which seekes to make it
infinite, and slanders <hi>Parliaments</hi> as enemies
to it, or endeavors to blow such jealousies into
the Kings eares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:14368:21"/>
3. No advice can bee so sit, so forcible, so
effectuall for the publicke welfare, as that
which is given in Parliament: if any Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
Counsellours could give as wise sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
advice as Parliaments, yet it could not
bee so profitable, because the hearts of the
people doe not goe along with any other, as
with that.</p>
            <p>That King which is potent in Parliament,
as any good King may, is as it were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skonsed
in the hearts of his subjects, that he
is almost beyond the trayns or aimes of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
and rebellion at home, nay forraign ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stility
cannot pei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce him, but through the
sides of all his people.</p>
            <p>It ought to bee noted also, that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
have ever beene the most devoted ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
coequall, sweetly-moderate Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
so in our English Parliaments, where the
Nobility is not too prevalent, as in <hi>Denmark,</hi>
nor the Comminalty, as in the Netherlands,
nor the King, as in <hi>France,</hi> Iustice and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
kisse and embrace more lovingly then
elsewhere. And as all the three States have
alwayes more harmoniously born their just
proportionable parts in England then else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
so now in these times, in these lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
knowing, religious times, we may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more blessed counsell from Parliaments
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:14368:21"/>
then ever we received heretofore. May it
therefore sinke into the heart of our King to
adhere to Parliaments, and to abhorre the
grosse delusive suggestions of such as dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
that kinde of Councell. May lie rather
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ide in that Community which can have
no other end but their owne happinesse in his
greatnesse, thè<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in Papists, Prelates, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors,
to whom the publick disunion is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious.

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and almost hopelesse in England at this day,
is that Parliaments are clouded, and disused,
and suffered to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by the ill bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ries of our State. May it lustly
enter into his beleefe, that it is impossible for
any Kingdome to deny publicke assent for
their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
when publicke danger is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

               </gap>, and
when it is fairely required, and not by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
extorted: that no Nation can unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
seeke its owne <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

may make their Subjects
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:14368:22"/>
purses their owne private coffers, if they will
demand due things, at due times, and by due
meanes.</p>
            <p>4. I come now to the last difficulty, about
the condition and nature of such aydes as are
due by Law from the Subject to the King,
Though much have beene argued both at the
barre and on the Bench, for the King, that he
may raise moneyes from his Subjects, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
consent by Law, Prerogative, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
Yet at last, because the Petition of
Right absolutely crosses this tenet, it is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to us backe againe, and yeelded, that the
King may not impose a pecuniary charge by
way of Tollage, but onely a personall one by
way of service. And now all our contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
ends in this, that we must contest, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Ship-scot be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecuniary, or a perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
charge: For though the intent of the
Writ, and the office of the Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>iffe be to raise
moneyes onely, yet the words of the Writ,
and the pretence of State, is to build and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
Ships of warre. The Kingdome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
takes this to be a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> delusion and
imposture, and doubtlesse it is but a pick lock
tricke, to overthrow all liberty and proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of goods, and it is a great shame that so
many Judges should be abetters to such frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulent
practice contrived against the State. It
is not lawfull for the King to demand mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyes
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:14368:22"/>
as moneyes, but it is lawfull to demand
moneyes under another wrong name, and
under this wrong name all former Lawes and
Liberties shall be as absolutely cancelled, as
if they had beene meere cobwebs, or enacted
onely out of meere derision. If former lawes
made to guard propriety of goods were just,
and grounded upon good reason, why are
they by this grosse fallacie, or childish abuse
defeated. If they were not just, or reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
what needes such a fond subtiltie as this?
why should they not be fairely avoided by
Law? Why were they made at all? But be
this invention what it will, yet we see it is
new; if it be quashed, the State is but where
it was, we are still as our Ancestors left us;
and since our preceeding Kings never here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
put it in use in the most necessitous
calamitous times, we may from hence infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e,
that the plea of State necessity falls off of it
selfe; if we admit not of this innovation, then
the State suffers not; but if we admit it, no
necessity being of it, we can frame no other
reason for our so doing, but that our former
franchises and priviledges were unjust, and
therefore this way they must be annulled.
Some of our Judges doe prove, that if this
were a personall service, yet it were void;
and they cite the case of Barges, and Ballin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:14368:23"/>
vessells, built truly for Warre in time of
Imminent danger, and yet these charges upon
complaint made by the Subject, were revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and disclaimed. But here in this case
many other enormities and defects in Law
Lare, for if ships be intended to be built in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
Countries, a thing impossible is injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and if <hi>moneyes</hi> be aimed at, that very
ayme is against Law: and if the Kingdome
were to be disfranchised, it were not to be
done by all illegall way.</p>
            <p>Besides, in the Writ, in the <hi>Assessement,</hi>
in the <hi>Sheriffes</hi> remedy against <hi>Recusants</hi>
of it, in the execution of Law, by, or after judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
many inconveniences, errors, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes
arise many wayes: and sure take the
whole case as it is, and since the Creation no
whole Kingdome was ever cast in such a cause
before.</p>
            <p>Besides, though the <hi>Iudges</hi> ought wholly to
have be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> themselves upon this, to have proved
this a personall service, and no pecuniary
charge, they have roved after necessity, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of Law, and Prerogative, and fearce
said any thing at all hereof.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Brainston</hi> argues very eagerly,
that personall services by Sea and Land are
due to the King in cases of extremity, and all
their records, case, and presidents prove no
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:14368:23"/>
more, and that men may be arrayed, and ships
pressed, and that <hi>sumptibus populi;</hi> but there
is nothing proved that the meere raising of
moneyes in this case, is a personall service.
I. <hi>Iones</hi> indeed argues to this purpose: If
the Law intrust the King with so great a
power over mens persons, why not over their
estates? There is cleare reason for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary:
because the King, if he should abuse
mens personall aides, could not inrich or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
himselfe thereby, and we know it is gaine
and profit, it is <hi>Auri sacra sames</hi> which hath
power over the breasts of men. It is not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
for Tyrants to imbattaile hoasts of
men, and make them charge upon the Sea-billowes,
and then to gather up Cockles and
Piwinckle shells in lieu of spoile, as one did
once: but the World abounds with stories
of such Princes, as have offended in abusing
their power over mens estates, and have vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
all right divine and humane, to attaine
to such a boundlesse power.</p>
            <p>Good Kings are sometimes weake in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting
boundlesse power; some affect riva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with God himselfe in power, and yet
places that power in doing evill, not good:
for few Kings want power to doe good, and
therefore it misbecomes not sometimes good
Subjects to be jealous in some things of good
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:14368:24"/>
Kings. But J. <hi>Iones</hi> farther sayes, that Ships
must be built, and without money that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be done: <hi>ergo.</hi> This necessity hath beene
answered, and disproved already: and I now
adde, that for the good of the Kingdome there
is more necessity that Ship-money be damned
then maintained. Such unnaturall slavery
seems to mee to be attendant upon this all-devouring
project, and such in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>amy to our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
our Lawes, and our selves, nay, and
such danger to the King and his posterity, that
I cannot imagine how any forraigne conquest
should induce any thing more to be detested
and abhorred.</p>
            <p>Those Kings which have beene most cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
of unconfined immoderate power, have
beene the weakest in judgment, and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their lives have beene poore and toylsome,
and their ends miserable, and violent: so that
if Kings did rightly understand their owne
good, none would more shunne uncontrollable
absolutenesse then themselves.</p>
            <p>How is the King of <hi>France</hi> happy in his
great <hi>Prerogative?</hi> or in that terrible stile
of the King of <hi>Asses? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee see that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
power makes him oppresse his poore
Pesants,</hi> for their condition is most
deplorable, and yet set his power aside, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:14368:24"/>
there is no reason why he should not be as a
Father to cherish them, as a God to comfort
them, not as an enemy to impoverish them, as
a tormentor to afflict them.</p>
            <p>2. His oppression makes him culpable
before God: he must one day render a sad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for all the evill which he hath impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
for all the good which he hath not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to them. That the Vicegerent of
God should doe the office of a tyrant, will
be no light thing one day.</p>
            <p>3. His sinne makes him poore: for were
his Pesants suffered to get wealth and enjoy
it, the whole Land would be his treasury, and
that treasury would containe twice as much
as now it doth.</p>
            <p>4. His poverty makes him impotent, for
money being the sinewes of warre, how
strong would his joynts be, if all his subjects
were abounding in money, as doubtlesse
they would, if they wanted not liberty, and
propriety? besides, poverty depresses the
spirit of a Nation: and were the King of
France, King of an Infantery, as he is onely
of a Cavalrie, were he a King of men, as he
is onely of beasts, had he a power over
hearts as he hath over hands, that Country

5. His impotence, together with all other
irregularities, and abuses is like to make
his Monarchy the lesse durable. Civill
wars have ever hitherto infected and macera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that goodly Countrey, and many times
it hath been near it's ruine: it now enjoyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
peace, but it doth no great exploits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
nor is ever likely to doe, unlesse by
practising upon the distemper of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
should some other Prince practise in
the like manner upon that, and propose liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to the grieved people, much advantage
might be taken: but these avisoes would
better proceed from that most heroick, most
terrible, most armipatent Churchman, which
effects such great wonders here: wee see
hence that Princes by some gaine lose, as
the whole body pines by the swelling of the
spleene: we see that <hi>Reh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>oam</hi> catcht an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
power, as the Dog in the fable at a
shadow, but in stead of an uncertain nothing,
he let fall and lost a certaine substance; and
yet flatterers have scarce any other bai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e
then this shadow of immoderate power,
whereby to poison the phantasies of weake
humours, undiscerning rash Princes.</p>
            <p>My humble motion therefore is: First, that
the judgement given in the Chequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:14368:25"/>
for Ship-money, may bee reversed, and
damned, as contrary to the right of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that those Iudges which adhered
to equity and integrity in this case, might
have some honourable guerdon designed
them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that some dishonourable penalty
may bee imposed upon those Iudges which
ill advised the King herein, and then argued
as Pleaders, not as Iudges; especially if any
shall appeare to have solicited the betraying
of the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that the meaning of our Lawes &amp;
Charters, may bee fully and expresly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and the force and vertue of Statutes and
publicke Grants, may be vindicated from all
such exceptions and objections as have beene
particularly or generally made against them.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, that a clearer solution may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the foure maine points stirred, how
farre prerogative is arbitrary and above Law;
and how farre naturall Allegeance bindes to
yeeld to all demands not of Parliament:
next, how the King is sole Judge of danger,
as that his meere cognizance thereof shall be
sufficient, though there be no appearance or
probability thereof. Next, how a necessity
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:14368:26"/>
of publicke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ine must be concluded now, if
Ship-money be not levied, when no such ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
hath been formerly, when this new plot
was not devised. Lastly, how this Ship-scot
pretending ships, but intending money, and
really raising the same, can be said to be no
pecuniary tollage within our Statutes, but a
meere personall service.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, that any Officers, or Ministers of
State, which shall attempt to lay the like taxes
hereafter upon the Subject, by vertue of the
like void warrants, may be held and taken as
Felons, or Traytors, or forcible Intruders.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, that something may be inacted
against forraigne and domesticall Forces also,
if they shall be congregated for the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
and that the subject may be inabled
by some fit and timely remedy to be given
against a military kinde of government.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, that the due way of publicke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
in case of imminent and eminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
or actuall necessary warre, for the pressing
of men, and other charges of warre, such as
Cote and Conduct money, and all doubts
thereabouts, may be made more certaine
and settled for the time to come.</p>
            <p>Ninthly, that if the Kings ordinary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
now taken for the Crowne, be not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:14368:26"/>
to maintaine him, as our great Master,
some legall order may be taken therefore, and
that he may be sensible of his Subjects loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
and his Subjects live safe under him,
that his enemies may finde him considerable,
and his true friends usefull.</p>
