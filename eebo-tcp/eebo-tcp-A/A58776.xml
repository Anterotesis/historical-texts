            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>Our Chriſtmaſs this morning very pleaſantly began; For the <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity</hi> Boys during the <hi>Advent,</hi> took a Conceit, in Imitation, as is ſuppoſed, of your Famous City of <hi>London,</hi> to Burn the <hi>Pope</hi> in Eſſigie; but carried it not ſo privately, but that the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> got notice; upon which he Summoned the Magiſtracy to conſult them about a Method to prevent it. The Maſters of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> being preſent, 'twas agreed, the beſt expedient was, to offer the Boys a Bond in theſe terms, We the Students of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> of <hi>Edenbrough</hi> conſidering the Dangerous Conſequencies might attend the burning of the <hi>Pope</hi> on <hi>Chriſtmaſs-Day,</hi> do bind our ſelves not to do it upon that Day, or any Day hereafter: But very few or none of the Boys would Subſcribe. Then the Magiſtrates Apprehended ſome of the moſt Active in this Contrivance, two of them <hi>Engliſh,</hi> one ſaid to be the Son of Sir <hi>Philip Grey</hi>; They were ſeized in their Beds very early in the Morning, and the Town Guards ſurrounded the Colledge to hindered their Rendiſvouzs.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding which they Met betwixt 9 and 10 in a convenient Place, taking the advantage of the nigheſt Paſſage of the High-ſtreet, where they brought his <hi>Holineſs</hi> with his <hi>Cavalcade,</hi> being attyred after his <hi>Antichriſtian Manner,</hi> with his <hi>Miter, Keys,</hi> &amp;c. and ſettled in his <hi>Throne.</hi> One of the Boys read a ſhort, but ſharp Accuſation againſt him: Then by common conſent, proceeded to Sacrifice him by Fire to Sir <hi>Edmund Godfreys</hi> Ghoſt. At which time the Magiſtrates ordered the Publication of a Proclamation againſt tumultuous Aſſemblies, leaſt they ſhould be Petition'd for the tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of it by the Inhabitants, there being few <hi>Abhorrers</hi> to be ſeen at that time. But by deſign, the Earl of <hi>Lithcow</hi> coming to his Reſcue, though the Boys were Reſolute, yet by drawing of his Sword, and his <hi>Followers</hi> by his Example, relieved for ſome ſmall ſeaſon, the Old Gentlemen from his Sentence, and halled him into a by Place, and overturned him; but the Boys crying aloud, <hi>There was Hereſy in his Belly</hi>; the <hi>Mermidons</hi> ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Gun-Powder, there left him to his incenſed and enraged Adverſarys, who dragged him again into the Great-Street, where the Fire coming to the Combuſtables in his Belly, blew off his Head, and miſerably ſcattered the remaining Members of the Harlot.</p>
            <p>Immediately, General <hi>Dallyel</hi> marched with two Companies by the <hi>Cowgate-Part,</hi> ſuppoſing the Boys might have been at the ordinary Place of Execution. Before him marched the Kings Horſe-Guards on a Gallop, with his Majeſties Standard Royal, and Swords drawn, and at an other Port, entred two Companies more; but the Boys undaunted, drew the Inſallible-Chear into the Streets, and then diſperſed themſelves, whil'ſt the Horſe and Foot made a ſtrong <hi>Parade,</hi> to ſecure what might further be attemped upon his Diſciples. I ſhall not add further in this matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving you may have a better Account than can be poſſibly given you by</p>
