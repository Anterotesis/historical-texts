            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:618:4"/>
And albeit the pretence whereof they did make shew to the world, was only the restoring of the Romane Religion, yet men of deeper iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t could not be ignorant, that they had a purpose to prepare their credulous Scholers for a day of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration otherwise; and in the meane while to make them discontented with the present times, which they ceased not to lade with al calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wicked imputations whatsoever. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst this number was and is a certaine auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious person, vvho termeth himselfe Doctour Hill: and being a man of no more then a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent learning, but yet of a very bolde spirit, hath traced the steps of other his felowes which went before him. For he principally maketh shew to yeelde Reasons, why Popery should be the true faith of Christ, and for that purpose heapeth vp a many of weake and worne-out Arguments: but toward the middle of his booke falleth into other points, as if this Kingdome our Countrey, were a sinke of wickednesse beyond all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth, and therefore detestable to God and good men. In respect of which vnsufferable defamations, it was helde most fit that this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise should receive an Aunswere: but especially for the pointes of Papistrie broched and vrged

You doe not so daunce in a net, as that you can see every body, and no body can see you. There is much and very much preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice against you, such as wil not in hast, vpon the naked word of a person suspect, be satisfied for. We know this your Maxime, that faith given, or promise made to an Hereuke may be broken. We know, that with you the Pope is Christes Vicar, and his voice is to be obeyed as an immediate Oracle of God. We vndoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderstande that diverse of the Romane Bishops haue done their worst to depriue her late sacred Maiesty of her crowne and dignity. We finde that many of your Predecessors and Schoole-maisters, haue in printed books much reviled and railed against the Lords Annointed, and some doe yet persist. We are assured that the companies of your fellow students, are mainetained by the late professed enemies of our Religion, Prince, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. We haue it confessed by men of their owne sort, that many of the English beyonde the seas are at the sole devotion of the Spanyard. It cannot be denied that the Rectours and chiefe men of, or neere your Seminaries, as <hi>Allen, Bristow, Stapleton, Parsons,</hi> &amp; other, haue either by their actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or their writings, or both, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselues known traitours against our dead Soveraigne &amp; the State, as also that diverse of the leaders did with their best indevours helpe forward the invasion, Anno 1588, and some of the meaner sort came in the fleete. And as certaine it is, that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry both Irish and English Priests and Iesuites haue beene prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall instigatours of the Irish tumults. At home, albeit of late there hath appeared some difference between such as are vnited to the Arch-Priest, and the rest which oppugne him, yet in this our Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did certainely finde that they al agreed, that to their vitermost they did knit <note n="p" place="margin">The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation.

And from this roote of being reconciled to the Romane Bishop, it ariseth, that many of your followers are male-contented with the present state, and insinuate so farre as they dare, that they wish another governement. Al these scruples make against you;

They haue by printed books, made infinite protestations of alleageance and loyalty, the least sparke whereof doth novv see me never to haue resided within their breasts: which well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth what credit may be given to actiue stirring Papists. Now for your part if you approue these thinges, your heart is not sounde: and if you dislike them, you renounce many Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remes, and much also of the practise of Popery: and then you may be a witnesse to your selfe, that as many of your forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and fellowes haue swarved in these actions and positions, so they and you also may goe astray in your other pointes of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie, vvhich you at this time doe not more eagerly defende, or confidently mainetaine, then your predecessours and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners haue done the rest before named.

so absurd, as to say according to that which you would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate heere, that there was no Church till of late, &amp; that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell was absolutely hidden, or Christ simplie vnknowne vntill their daies. For we well vnderstand, &amp; teach co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary-wise, that in the Primitive Church plentifully, &amp; afterward alwaies more or lesse, in some parts of the world or other, there were the Elect of God, who groning to behould the common errours of their age, did strive to beleeve and live after the rule of the Scriptures. But the speech of <hi>Luther</hi> &amp; of vs in that behalfe is comparative: that in comparison of that which it should bee: or that which had bin not long after the Apostles: or in respect of that which the Lord hath of late reveiled: or of that which by the faithfull might have bin wished, the Gospel had not for some later ages, so free a course, and Christ was not so ordinarlly &amp; vnpollutedly taught; but the Bible lay much neglected, and was cast aside in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of other bookes.

Mahumetisme, and know that Mahomet was a false Prophet, &amp; never had Angel, (vnlesse it were one of darknes) sent vnto him. And as touching the Church of Rome, we are not ignorant that before the daies of Mahomet, it did by little &amp; little decline, but in the time of Phocas the Emperour &amp; Boniface <note n="s" place="margin">Vide Plat. in Bonif. 3.</note> the third, then Pope, (which was neere to the daies of Mahomet) the malignity of it did grow much greater. And since that season, the mistery of iniquity hath wrought forward &amp; forward, &amp; it is almost grown to the ruine of it selfe. But in al this time the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods serva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts was never extinct, not the Church brought to such passe, as that Mahomet one of the great enimies of Christianity should neede to reforme it.

If then you will vnderstande what it is which we doe teach, the Turkes haue not so much as in shew, any the like reason for their most vaine assertion, as we haue for our posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; since our doctrine in this case is laid vpon a sure foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which with all your invectiues you shall no more be able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you can hurt the Moone with stones throwne against her.

For he had ever those who were his Congregation, &amp; Common-wealth, observing his statutes; &amp; this regiment was better setled then that of Solon or Lycurgus was, the precincts of whose government were bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded within the territories of the Spartane &amp; Athenien Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in the compasse of some hundreds of years came to their period &amp; end.

Now whereas you ioine here with Solon and Lycurgus the law-giver Plato, I pitty your over-sight. For that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth which Plato imaginarily erected, did indeede vanish away and come to nothing, before it was setled.

This is solemnely spoken of by the Apostle, &amp; by al both old &amp; new intreating of it, is observed to signifie some matter of great note, that is to say, some maine declining from somewhat. Many of our Papists fearing to touch this soare which can in no case turne them to good, would haue this interpreted to note nothing else, but the slipping of divers regions &amp; countries, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their subiection to the Romane Empire. But Gregory Martin and the other Rhemists, being overcome with the evidence of truth, are heere a litle more honest then or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and speake to other purpose.

                  <hi>and withall, from most pointes of Christian Religion.</hi> In the margent it is, <hi>and from most articles of the Catholike faith.</hi> Here they would haue vs take the Romish beleefe, for the Christian Religion &amp; Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith: but that deserveth a long pause. We rather obserue out of them, that this revolt is in matter of faith, and not onely from the Empire; then which glosse nothing can be truer. Well then, if there must be so egregious an Apostasie, it wil follow, that Antichrist so dominering, as by the Apostle he is described, will not be negligent so to represse the publike service of God, that it shall not carry any liuely head or countenance, where he hath to doe. So that certainely our Rhemists yeelding to this expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe in substance confesse so much, as that the apparencie of Gods congregation, in the time of the great defection, must bee mightely eclipsed. Now the Lord, to the end that he might esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish his faithfull, and arme them to expect this paucity of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and inconspicuousnes of his Church, and yet not be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged for that which should be past, present, or to come; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that there might be no doubt in a matter of this moment, letteth vs farther know, that <hi>the</hi>

In Greece if a man had beene disposed to put a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene one that was learned, and the vulgar vnlearned people, it had been a good note of distinction to say, he is a Philosopher. But when the question grew betweene several Sects &amp; their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, then for more particular difference, it was not enough to say that Diogenes was a Philosopher, but he was a Cynick: such a one was an Epicurean, another a Peripa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In some sence it is enough to say, that in the yeare 1588, her Maiesty of England had against the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard a campe of so many thousand English, resolute me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, religious, and well appointed: but when there is question of particulars in that campe, then the Oxford-sheere men had those Captaines, the Wilt-shire men these, and their colours were several. So if in India or Asia, the opposition must be betweene the Infidels or Mahumetans on the one side, and the servants of Christ, of what sort soever they be, on the other side, it is enough to say in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, thus or thus do the Christians: But if there be occasion to particularize any thing, then the Christians in Spaine, or those in Germany are thus and thus affected. VVhen speech is of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Mahomet opposed to Christianity, the name Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane will comprehend the Persian and his subiects, the Turke and his vassals, the kings of Argier, Tunis and Marocco, and all that are vnder them. But when we talke of the difference in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homets profession, betweene the Turke and the Persian, vvhich hath on either party cost much bloud, we say the Persian thus holdeth: the Turke beleeveth thus. Wheresoever in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there is disagreeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, some holding for the Pope and some other against him, there the name <hi>Papist</hi> is frequent: &amp; this is not only in Germany, but God be praysed for it, in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and Sweden, and Denmarke, in Polonia, in Fraunce, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, the Low Countryes, &amp; whersoever else the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is knowne either openly or secretly. Yea in Italy, Spaine and Sicily not only the name of Papistes, but the whole doctrine of Popery woulde quickely come in question, were it not for your bloudy Inquisition, or cruell massacring otherwise, of such as bend not that way. And yet they be not able to extirpate Gods truth. As for the Greekes they loue you not, neither like of your

But surely the Infidels, or Turkes, or Greekes do neither call you nor know you by that name. And if <hi>Luther</hi> were the first who gave you that title of <hi>Papiste,</hi> which pleaseth you so much, you are behoulding to him for fitting you so right: not that you might not lustly have bin so called before. But hee having occasion to display your impiety to the full, and God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableing him with learning and knowledge, as also with spirit and wit for that purpose, hee gave you a name most sutable to your nature, which is the truest vse of appellations and names. It very well agreeth with you: for if Christians be those who harken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, and are directed by him, you may well be Papists, who depend on the onely voice and direction of the Pope.</p>

Thus if one Papist will bee so wicked, as to devise something which was never spoken, or to pervert that to ill purpose which was well spoken, his fellowes will presently applaude it as a truth, and publish it one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:618:44"/>
as if it were as certaine as the Gospell. Now for this of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if there had beene any such matter, which but in probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty could haue beene fastened vpon him, would that sweete fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Cochleus who pursueth him step by step, haue forgotten it? Or would he not aswell haue remembred him for the Creede, as he did for the Pater-Noster, although that also was but the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of a knot in a rush. For it is a complaint made by <note n="m" place="margin">An. 1522. in actis Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theri.</note> Cochleus against Luther, that in his translation of the New Testament, he did not keepe the set words of the Lordes prayer formerly vsed, but for <hi>Pater noster quies in coelis,</hi> he put it, <hi>Noster pater in coelo,</hi> and for, <hi>Sanctificetur nomen tuum,</hi> he translated it as if it were, <hi>tuum no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sit sanctum,</hi> &amp; yet you must vnderstand that it was into Dutch that he turned it, and not into Latin, where in all likelyhoode it was as a great fault to put <hi>Noster</hi> before <hi>Pater,</hi> as it is in English to say <hi>Our Father,</hi> and not rather <hi>Father ours,</hi> or <hi>Father of vs.</hi> Doe you not want matter of waight to obiect, when you spende your times in such frivolous exceptions? And even of this sort is the next stout reason which followeth. For as Luther was afraide of the worde <hi>Catholike,</hi> so are wee of <hi>Heretike,</hi> that is to say, never a whit: for we know that there be Heretikes, as Arrians, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists and many more: and that the Romanists are as great in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie as any, in as much as they vary from truth in many, &amp; those capitall and very dangerous pointes.

What could he wish more, when the greatest sort of worldlings daunced after his pipe, and were as glad to come in, as he to open his dores? Hee had doated as I thinke, if he could not have kept his owne counsaile. But in that fault you shall not take him. The care therefore of him and his ministers was, to keepe all vpright, or at least to preserve the ground-worke of his building, and if any of his children at their play did fall out, he closed it vp againe aswell as he could, &amp; had his officers for that purpose. If any other did but baye, or open, against this his setled common-wealth, he vvas not <hi>amicus Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> a friende to the Courte: either bring him to conformitie or <hi>Crucifige.</hi> So you may behoulde the reason, why in the deepe time of ignoraunce, there was such a confederacy or conspiracy rather, to have all vnder silence.

As Basile therefore saith of vertue and vice, so Sathan did with verity and errour. <note n="k" place="margin">De vera virginitate.</note> Where a dore is of vertue saith he, there on either side is set a dore of vice, the entraunces of which are very like to the other of vertue.

               <p n="5">5 VVhat a harvest your Dominicane and Franciscane Friers have made in the Indies, I deferre to recount till I come to the nexte Chapter. Onely heere I tell you, that vpon vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable warrant wee finde not, that almost any man of worth, for learning, wisedome, warfare or government, hath by his conversion given any testimony to Christendome, of the good which your Friers have done among the Indians. You please your selues with fancies, and <hi>mulus mulum scabit,</hi> one of you doth falsely trumpet the praises of another. If you be such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetters, why goe you not into Africa, into the kingdomes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco and Fez, to Tunis or Argier? From Spaine or Italie, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance is not much to these. Or why do you not crosse the Adri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atike sea, &amp; step into Grecia or Morea? why traveile you not far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Constantinople, Tripoly or Aleppo to winne men from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> which is so much the easier, because all these Turkes &amp; Saracens admit of some Positions belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging to the Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> faith, but the Indians accept of none. Truth it is, that vnto these places,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:618:72"/>
other nations of Christendome for trafficke do resort; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you should report any vntruth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning these, you would quickly be disproved. But far traveilers may say more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary men, and for that cause you tell vs a tale of the Indies, and some of your men say that there they cast out Devils also. They do wel to lay it in places so distant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> for although they egregiously faine, yet we shal hardly take them tripping: it is no ready worke to convince them. But wee imagine that your attemptes for conversion, may have the same successe in the East and VVest Indies, as the offer of your <note n="u" place="margin">Maff Hist. Lib. 1.</note> Portingale Priestes and Friers had in Congo, where adventuring vpon verie small acquaintance, to baptize the king and the inhabitantes, the most part as your Historiographer saith, (but it is to be feared that all) quickly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Christianity, &amp; returned to their heathenish wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the mire. They disliked not the first principles of the faith, neither the Ceremonies therein, but when they were called vpon to leave their grosse vices, as adultery and witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafte and seeking to Devils, to remitte iniuries, to restore thinges vniustly taken each from other, they would not endure these exhortations, but like reneging Apostatas they became as before. And of likely-hood so it fell out frequently with the Spanyards in America, where they <note n="x" place="margin">Petr. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. Decad. 3. 10.</note> were exceeding nimble in administring baptisme, to those who knewe very little. Had it not beene fit, that before the Sacrament had beene imparted, the Infidels should out of Gods booke largely haue heard of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges? which course <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptist did take, preaching repentaunce; <note n="y" place="margin">Math. 3. 2</note> and that woulde well have tryed them before hande, and so Gods name might not haue beene dishonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor Baptisme abused, nor the people made the worse, nor the Priest never the better. Doth not the true Church of Christ gaine much by such titulary bargaines, and is not Gods king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome much increased through it? And yet doubtlesse such good matches your Friers also make in the Indies, but especially in those of the East, where the inhabitants have more witte, and your messengers have lesser power.

Howe happy are those men, who for their constant standing in the gappe, against Sathan &amp; Antichrist, are every day illustrated, and made celebrious, by the maligning of the adversaries of truth? Their soules are in peace, and their glory is promulgated by their enemies trumpets, who the more they oppugne them, the more we doe loue them, and eternise the memory of them. These and other their consorts, as the Archbishop Cranmer with other of the English, Mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cthon and Bucer, and Fagius and many more of their ranke, were no such loose companions and sensuall men as you fondly doe here intimate, neither ever did they become bad spectacles to the world, but ledde their liues in study, in preaching and writing, which may well appeare by such volumes of their workes, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beene laide on the Popes backe, haue broken many ribs of him, that they never will be able to close againe.

here you bestow your remembrance on Peter Mattyrs vvife, how blessed was shee living, and howe happy is her soule nowe, that shee shoulde in such sort bee exagitated for Christ his sake? Shee was neither flaps nor fustelugs, but a woman indeed of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reasonably corpulent, but of most matron-like modesty, for the which shee was much reverenced by the most: shee was of singular patience, of excellent artes and qualities, and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, for her recreation she delighted to cut plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mestones into curious faces and countenances, of which exceeding artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially done, I once had one with a womans visage and heade at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire on the one side, and a Bishop with his miter on the other, which was the elegant worke of her hands. By diverse yet living in Oxford this good woman is remembred, and commended as for her other vertues, so for her liberality to the poore, which by Master <note n="l" place="margin">In Histor. Eccl. Sub Maria Reg.</note> Foxe writing how shee was entreated after her death is rightly mentioned. For loue of true religion, and the company of her husband, shee left her owne countrey to come into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in K. Edwards daies, and so good was her fame here, that when the Papists in Q. Maries time being able to get nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her beeing dead, were yet desirous to wreske their teene vpon her integrity, they would needes rage vpon the bones of her, a woman and a stranger, and tooke them out of her graue from Christian buriall, and buryed them in a doung-hill.

those words should haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But his malice rather served him, and fitter it was for his purpose, falsly to accuse that Reverende man Theodore Beza, that he had perswaded Poltrot to kill the Guize at the seege of Oreleans. We allow not of the deed, but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly condemne the fact: &amp; there was never learned man of our party, who defended it or excused it. The malefactour also recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved condigne punishment for his labour. Indeede the <note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. lib. 6. &amp; 7.</note> Guizes after the death of their father, did publikely giue out, that the Admirall and one other noble man had hyred Poltrot ther-vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and that Beza had approved the deed; but when the admiral heard of it, he knowing it to be a malicious slaunder, did by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like writing require, that according to the lawes of Iustice, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot who was reported to haue said so much in his torture, might be kept aliue, that he might come face to face to iustifie himselfe: but this was denied, and Poltrot in all hast was executed. But when the rumour still co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued, that the Admirall was touchable with the fact, he putteth forth an honorable declaration, &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of his innocency therein, which was so apparantly true, that the king at Molune in Bourbon, did by ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sentence cleere him, and acquite him of that vniust imputation. Now the maine fact being avoided, Beza proveth to bee innocent; since by his most desperate enemies he was never thought to be more then an accessary, by allowing it at the instance of the Admiral, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in truth he spake not with Poltrot, but was more then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles of from him. And yet, notwithstanding that all this is as evident as the Sunne, good Doctor Hil, doe you keepe the lie going, and let it not die in your hands.</p>

Well, Frecul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus saith that the Arrians converted the whole Nation of the Gothes, in the daies of the Emperour Valens, from paganisme to the faith. But there bee three Ecclesiasticall historiens vvho seeme to crosse that. Let vs heare them speake. <note n="s" place="margin">Socr. 4. 27</note> Socrates saith, that vnder Valens, or in his time many of the Gothes received the Christian faith, and he addeth that to please the Emperour, they addicted themselues to the Arrian sect. Here then there is nothing which hindereth, but that many of them might be new converted at the very first by those heretikes. <note n="t" place="margin">Theod. 4: 32.</note> Theodoret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede hath it, that being formerly converted to Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving aright, yet when they were enforced to seeke friendship at the hand of Valens, by the instigation of Eudoxius a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian neere about him, they were swayed by the Emperour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the Arrian heresie.

Valens sendeth them Arrian preachers, who taught them heretically to beleeue in Christ. These <hi>Uese Gothes</hi> thus converted, being outragiously abused by some of the Emperours people, tooke vp weapons against the Romanes; which when Valens vnderstoode, he goeth with an army against them. Loosing the field he flieth, and being glad to betake him to a Cotage, he was so pursued by those Gothes, that they set the house on fire, and burnt both it, and him in it. <hi>By the iudgement of God</hi> saith <note n="x" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Iornandes, <hi>that he should be burnt with fire by them, whom seeking the true faith, he had turned aside to perfidiousnesse, and had writhed aside the fire of charity to the fire of hell.</hi> The <hi>Vese Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> then being so great a nation, were by the Arrians first co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or perverted to beleeue falsly on Christ.

ordinarily women in their younger yeares doe breed most chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and it were a monstrous matter as you would insinuate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, that in old age they shold haue many, yet this maketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for your purpose, nether hath it any affinity with the spouse of Iesus Christ.

Will your wit serue you to think, that so it is with Christs beloved? Then the later ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of the world should be in a fearful state. You may ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnderstand, that the fruitfulnes of the Church, is nether tied to the first age, nor middle age, nor the last age, but to such times as the Lorde hath appointed, who decreeth that at some times there should be <hi>balcyons</hi> daies, but some other seasons great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, in which the Church shal haue a being, but yet be reduced to straights, and to a smaller number. Let any man look into this before the comming of Christ, at which time, the Church was in her youth, for almost 2000. years, being contained in the houses of a very few of the Patriarkes. After <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 1. 1. 7</note> Iacobs comming into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, &amp; the multiplying of the Israelits, her bra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches were spread wider.

In that state did our Saviour finde it: &amp; then nor many of the Iews were reduced to the faith, but the maine harvest was of the Gentiles. Now if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the false Priests, either in the daies of Iosias, or of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, would haue bin of your mind, he might haue argued as you do, that if the Church the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> should be said to bring out more chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> formerly shee had done, shee must haue gone for a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

So it is since the time of Christ. God hath his appointed sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which himselfe hath fore-told, somtimes promising that his spouse should flourish, and some other times be obscured. So in the daies of Constantine, the hew of her, not for purity but for extent, was more glorious then vnder all the former Emperours. Vnder Constantius &amp; Iulian her territory was abridged: yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Theodosij and some other blessed Emperours, shee grew againe, &amp; notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding was no monster. After ward her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was dimmed, the authority of Antichrist spreading it selfe in the worlde, as it was before hand <note n="f" place="margin">Apo. 13. 14</note> prophecied that it should bee.

                  <hi>wicked man should be reveiled,</hi> as all the worlde may see that in our time he is, <hi>whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth,</hi> that is with the preaching of the word, vvhich who doth not se to haue diminished the kingdome of the Pope, <hi>and shall abolish</hi> with the brightnes of his comming, so that Antichrist albeit much maimed shalbe til the last day of iudgment, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Ministers must striue to keep his kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e vpright, as our Iesuits &amp; Seminary Priests do. But his Babylon in part &amp; by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees must fall, &amp; so it is already. The Church was ever somwhat, but of late shee is more glorious then in some ages before.

Epist. 76.</note> Gregory woulde not stande to it. This doth often appeare in the vvorkes of Leo, but I vvill cite by name one place, whence Prosper might have the prose of that, which heeturned into verse. Speaking vnto Rome, as concerning Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter &amp; Paule, hee saith thus: <note n="y" place="margin">Leo Serm. 1. in Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit. Petr. &amp; Pauli.</note> 
                  <hi>These are they who brought thee to this glory, that thou shouldest be a holy natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a chose people, a citie of Priests &amp; Kinges, and that by the holie seate of Saint Peter, thou beeing made the</hi>

And then he could not see the inconvenience, that afterward did arise by too much magnifying that Episcopal or Patriarchical city. And these things are especially to bee reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In the first Church, that is while the Apostles lived, the spouse of Christ for doctrine was most glorious, &amp; for some hundreds of yeares afterwards, her honor flourished not a little: yet so that some pety superstitions began to creepe in heere and there. But about six hundred years after Christ, shee for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward face did more &amp; more droupe in doctrine. <note n="f" place="margin">1.

And that which was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was not so eminently, as that the followers of the Apostles did much obserue it, being then more troubled with persecution or heretiks, then with superstition. In processe of time matters grew to a worse state, evil opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s creeping in, &amp; at last the maine <note n="g" place="margin">2.

And it being thus whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things were at the worst, God in this later age, hath suffred that truth which was more hidden, to illustrate the Christian world again. Yea but you wil proue, that since the Primitiue Church, faith florished more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before, or at the least it was not diminished vntill our time. You can do wonders Sir, or els your own reason would informe you, that nothing beene added til these lare navigations of the Portingales &amp; Spaniards, Christianity must needs be exceedingly diminished, when the Saracens &amp; Turks for so long space, haue devored so much of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, Europa, &amp; Africa, as is or hath bin vnder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

Well, the faith was in Gregories times over all the worlde. How proue you this? Forsooth he wrote Epistles to Bishops of Spaine, France, England, Sicely, yea &amp; of the East, &amp; of Afrike, Ergo the faith was over all the world. A young man of the age of sixteene yeares hath by his diligence learned without booke, the Epistle to Philemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; that to the Colossians, yea the book of

                  <hi>Madera</hi> is one of the fortunat or Canary Ila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, lying some few daies iourny South-west ward fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Spaine. You might if it had pleased you, haue added the rest of the Canaries, and the Azores, as also all that lie neere A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, as Cuba and Hispaniola, and many about them; also the Philippinas, and I cannot tell what. But my conceite is that you went no farther, because the Author or Copy which you follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no farther. For I deale plainly with you, I do not hold you gilty of the knowing where al these places be. And yet it were no huge labor, in the reading over of such an Authour, as the <note n="d" place="margin">Hist. India aut select. Epistol.</note> Iesuit Maffeus is, to take the wordes heere and there as hee relateth

the comming in of the Portingales, or the pretended labours of his felowes. But I smell it to be borrowed from some other man, as your <note n="e" place="margin">Ratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 3.</note> enumeratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Heretikes was from Staphilus. In which respect I call to minde howe once on a New-yeares day in the morning, a Parish-Clarke in Oxford brought to the Minister of that Parish, certaine Latin verses as a token for the Newe yeare. The Minister seeing them, before he reade them said, that hee tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ked him for his paines, but added that he did not thinke, that he could haue made a Latin verse. The Clarke with an humble smile looking on, did no way deny but that the verses were his owne. But when the other had reade them, he altered his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tolde him that they were taken out of a Printed booke. It is true indeede saith the Clarke, but Sir, I tooke the paines to write them out for you. Even so much paines have you taken, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly from some ignorant fellowes collections, to write these names out for vs.</p>
               <p n="16">16. I am induced to think so, not only because you have play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed such pageants before, but much rather because a sober man may wel thinke that if you had known what you did, or had had any true vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of the matter, you wold never have made such a clatter to so small a purpose. For it may well be supposed that there be no such places, as some are named by you: some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them are so meane, as that to this day they never could finde place in any mappe whatsoever published to the worlde. Onely they are mentioned by one Iesuite, who cannot lye; and he maketh every meane man a King: if he once parled with a Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite he shall want no title. You have reckoned vs vp heere one and forty names, many of them in themselves small base and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour things, &amp; if diverse of them be ordinarily tearmed King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, yet the whol cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try is not so great as a prety shire in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp; some of the Ilands are as meane as the Ile of Wight is. If you will stand on it that these be kingdomes, yet wee can make you answere, that very many of the Kings of the East cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, are Lordes but as over moale-hils, and so it was some thousands of yeeres agone. <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 14. 2.</note> You may reade of the King of Sodome, and of the Kinge of Gomorah, as also of the Kinge of Admah, and of the Kinge of Zeboim, and yet all these lived vvithin a small

compasse of ground. For the one and forty names which you note vnto vs, you may reade of <note n="g" place="margin">Iosu. 12. 9.</note> one and thirty Kinges indeede, with whom Iosuah had to deale, and yet all their dominion was so within Canaan, that the territories of all their regiment, was not so much as England alone, without Scotland ioyned to it. And yet if an ignorant man shoulde heare the names of all those Kinges, as they are set downe by Iosua, he would looke as much about him, as one of your silie Papists doth at those heere in your booke. To let them therefore know how you egregiously abuse them, you haue said as much as if I should speake in this sort. His Maiesty of England hath a great many good subiects (I begin to give the instance in Suffex, because I heare that this Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet is much in request among backward people there) as in the great city of Chichester, in Arundel, in Rye, and in many other good places there about. Also in Sandwich with all the Cinque portes and the liberties of the same, yea in the Iles of Shepy, and Tenet, with other lying at the landes end fast by Essex, yea adde herevnto Hul &amp; New-castle vpon Tine &amp; the strong towne of Barwike. And if a man should tel this to some vnlettered Italian who lyeth a great way hence, he might be made to wonder: but the truth were no very high matter. Thus it is with these places named, which are onely cities, townes or angles standing along the sea coast, vpon the shore of the Indies, and interrupted or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersorted with heathenish dominions, or else they are Ilands in the selfe same quality. And in many of these, if there were some said to be baptised 20. or 40. yeares agone, or if there be now but 5. Portingales or Spanyards, which keepe a shop or ware-house, yet there is the Romish faith. Which our Author who never vseth but to cast at <hi>All,</hi> as it seemeth doth acknowledg, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his custome he hath an extenuation, <hi>It is happilie received of many though not vniversall of all,</hi> And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he saith <hi>in many lands it is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the greatest part of the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,</hi> he meaneth not that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turals do accept of it, but the Spanyards &amp; Portingals have killed the greatest part of them, and now they themselves do make the maior part. This advantage you have for your words D.

(if I should say nothing of that which we teach, but leave it wholy to God and his good blessing) Gentilisme is yet by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny degrees more then all the Papisme in the world, and Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metisme in Barbary, in Turky, in Persia, and in the dominions of all those who hold for that false Prophet doth exceede it. And yet the great propagatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ethnicisme or Saracenisme doth not make them to bee in the right; neither doth the same evince in behalfe of your Romane fancies, but that only must go for truth which hath warrant out of the Scriptures.</p>

This I say by the way, for that it grieveth mee at the very hart, to beare that my deare countrey doth persecute that religion which all the vvorld hath ioyfully embraced, or at the least doth vvillingly tollerate, as though shee were wiser then all the world beside is, or ever hath beene, or then al her Elders.

As our Students in our Colledges haue vsed to make verses, and to fixe them vp on the skreenes or elsewhere publikely, on the day of her late Maiesties comming to the Crowne, so they had sometimes at Doway when they made verses in like sort, &amp; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the day before named I do not remember.

It should haue beene an vnrecompensable weakenesse to haue permitted such incendiaries to bring all to combustion, and our magistrates in the meane time, to haue stood by the houses of themselues &amp; their neighbours being on fire, and to haue thought it a pretty thing to stand and warme themselues by the flame. But they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inspired by a better spirit, did make good &amp; wholsome lawes, inhibiting the approaching of such dangerous guests, or if they would not forbeare, paying them the wages due for their worke. <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae nascuntur leges.</hi> Ill manners breede good lawes. And if England alone have received such bad measure from vnnatural bredde English, who can blame the Magistrates and law-makers of England, if by speciall ordinances they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the safety of that charge, which is committed to them, which cannot be but by cutting off such malefactours.

Yet who doubteth but a good Christian may ioy in his hart exceedingly, and thankfully expresse it in his tongue, that many who sate in darkenesse may now behold the light, and the sheepefold of Christ is more and more filled. But if we would be too forward, you will plucke vs backe againe. Although it be, say you, in some places of Europe, yet in some other it is not. As who should say your Popery is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall in all.

By what means your Idolatry came into those Countries, I haue shewed before, and how plentifully there it is. If we would talke idly, as you for the most part doe, we might say that in every place where the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of Holland trade, and haue people residing, our religion is accepted. But since the English Merchants haue companies &amp; houses in Russia, in Constantinople, in Aleppo, in Alexandria sometimes, in Barbary, in Zacynthus, in Venice, and Legorne, we might say after the fashion of your boasting, that our religion is in those parts. But we desire to make no more of things then indeede they are. Yet we tell you for those remote provinces,

that as now one hundred and twenty yeeres agone they knewe not one whit of your faith, so it may please God, before one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty yeeres more bee passed (if it so seeme good to his most sacred wisedome) to plant the truth which we reach, in the East &amp; Westerne world, especially if a passage by the North ende of America, or that by Asia beyond <hi>Ob</hi> may bee opened, vvherein our <note n="q" place="margin">M.

But the issue of this whole matter must bee leste to the divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which is to bee magnified therefore, if hee adde this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to his Church, And if he deny it either there or in any other place, we must not be caried too farre with griefe or pitty, since it doth not please him who is the father of mercie to condescend vnto it. Nowe vvhereas you avouch, that our doctrine is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye in England, I knovve not vvhither I shoulde put that in your ignoraunces, or rather in your malicious cavils. Truth it is our common prayer booke is vsed onelye by those who are of Englishe allegeaunce, but is there anie pointe of doctrine in it, vvherevnto other Churches reformed, in Europe, doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend? The Catechisme of the Councell of Trent doth dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in words from the Catechisme of Canisius, and both of them from that of M. Vaux: yet you would thinke it a wronge if anye man should tell you that they disagree in pointes of doctrine. So the service of the reformed Congregations in Europe, as in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, Fraunce, Switzerland, in the dominion of the Palsgraue, in the Regiments and free cities of Germany which are of the Pallsgraues confession, as also in a good parte of the low Countries, is the same in all pointes of moment, not differing one int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>: their Professions are the same. There is no question among these in anie one pointe of religion. The Ecclesiasticall policy being different, as in some places by Bishops, in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the auncient Church, some cities and Countreyes vvere imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ruled by a Patriarke, Grande Metropolitane, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by an inferiour Bishoppe vvho was subiected to the greater:
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:618:123"/>
yet they all might agree in the faith. The cheefe at Rome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately is the Pope, at Millaine for spirituall thinges the Arch-bishoppe, in some places bee but Suffragaines, in some other Iurisdictions, a Deane or Priour by Privilege hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Papall auctoritie, vvhich also in times past vvas in the Chauncellours or Vice-chauncellours of our English Vniversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, some fewe thinges beeing excepted and reserved. Yet will you say that these doe differ in religion, or retaine not the same doctrine? Even so it is touching the beleefe of the Protestantes in England, of those which you in spite call Puritaines in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and of them whome you tearme maliciously, Libertines in Holland and Zeland. They teach no other libertie then what the <note n="r" place="margin">Galat. 5. 1.</note> Apostle teacheth, and biddeth vs to stande fast in it. For the shewing of your skill, I entreate you to let your scholers heare one pointe of moment, or materiall, vvherein all those Churches which before I named, doe differ. Speake it out, if you can tell what. Touching the Lutheranes in Denmarke and many places of Germany, I haue toulde you before that in one pointe of the Eucharist they disagree from the rest of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which the LORD in time may sende to bee reconciled; and wee pray vnto him for the same. But your comfort vppon that discorde is small.

               <p>TRUE Miracles were never wrought but by them, who were of true religion, for that they are done only by the power of God. Now it is so manifest that there hath bin almost an infinite number of miracles wrought by those who were of the Catholike<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Romane Religion, and never any by them who were not of that Church-since Christes time, as he who shall deny it, may be proved no lesse impudent &amp; shamelesse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vvho shall deny, that ever there vvas any Masse saide in times past in England, or that ever there were any warres betweene Turkes and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, or that there be any such countries as the East and UUest Indies. which thing if a man should deny, would be not of all men bee deemed not onely impudent, but madde, drunken or a foole? And surely the one is no lesse knowne, by all approved writers and eie-witnesses, than the other. For as in the Gospell and in the Actes, the holy Scriptures witnesse, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought by Christ and his Apostles, so doe most approved au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours of everie age vntill this daye testifie, and record the continuaunce of the working thereof in the Catholike Romane Church, the which Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours for the most part were eie-witnesses of the saide miracles, as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>

But Maffeus the Iesuite and fellow to Xavier wil not <hi>Propter bonum sociatatis</hi> let him goe so. He therefore <note n="y" place="margin">Hist: Indic.

That at Goa im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately he made a sicke man whole. That twise in a horrible tempest at sea, dipping his boxe of relikes into the water, hee made all to bee calme. Many other such matters are currant of him among his companions, touching all which I may saye, that of likely-hood they bee not overmuch beleeved of the Pope or Papists themselues, since his Holinesse nor any of his Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, haue bestowed the Sainting of this Xavier on him, neither hath any one of that Society beene Canonized to this day, as the Secular Priests doe rightly obiect against the Iesuites.

6 The story then of the Christian souldiours, for the generall consent of approoved writers therein, we doe beleeue, &amp; know that God in mercy inclineth much to the <note n="a" place="margin">Iam. 5: 17.</note> praiers of his good servaunts. That Gregorius Thaumaturgus did something it is likely, but whither he by letters could cast out Devils wee doe not hastily credit. Great learned men recorded many things vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on report of others; and conceiving that all straunge Narrations would breed admiration to the Christian faith, were well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to accept of them, &amp; deliver them to other without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disquisition. This more grosly appeared in Gregory and Bede: but it had his beginning before their age. Of this sort we esteeme that which is related, of Hilarion, Anthony, Martin, and Nicolas: reports of them, went for records, and small matters were made great. Hierome and the other olde writers coulde not yet fully discover to what head Sathan did bende; (whose meaning was to raise from the rumour of those miracles, innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable occasions of idolatry, to be committed at or to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes of those persons, who were said to doe the wonders) and for that cause these good men were the more facile to apprehende such relations. But if these as also the other mencioned by Saint Austen, should without exception be granted to be true, vvhy doe you Papists challendge them to be yours? Or what doeth this more make for the Synagogue of Rome, then if the Gothes who broke into that citty, in the daies of <note n="b" place="margin">Sozo. 9 9.</note> Honorius the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour should haue arrogated and assumed to themselues, all the Acts of the worthy Consuls, renoumed Dictators, &amp; famous Em perors who in times past had resided there? If it be said that some of these were Monks &amp; Heremits, it is true that they desired vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a wrong opinion of more holines therein, to liue seiunct from the world, as the <note n="c" place="margin">Ioseph. de bel. Iudaic. lib. 2. 7.</note> Esseis among the Iewes had done, &amp; all their vsage we can neither commende nor excuse: but they sayde no Masse, sunge no Dirges for the dead, neither did they leade a life any way concurring with these later Antichristian swarmes: distinguish the times, distinguish the persons, put a difference betweene the actions then and nowe, and our Papists may no more challendge to themselues their miracles, then the Senbes and Pharisees might haue strengthned their errours by the olde
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:618:132"/>
wonders of Moses. Those which Saint Austen nameth are not free from their exceptions; that some were reports: some groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the narration of one: that frequently those things are attributed to religion, which might be effected naturally, disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses having their periods, and medicines which are applied, som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times working more then can bee imagined. But for reverent respect to that father, we insist not too far vpon these. Only this we wold haue noted; that he citeth not those as necessary proofs to confirme the faith, (for what Saint Austens opinion is of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in that behalfe, yee shall see anone) but to yeeld to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of some, who being vnbeleevers did call for straunge signes &amp; wonders: for the stopping of whose mouthes, he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that their age had some rare matters and events in it, though he cited them not as much making or marring, for the verity of religion. I pray you obserue his wordes in the beginning of the Chapter, <note n="d" place="margin">De civit. Dor li. 22. 8:</note> 
                  <hi>Why say they, are not those miracles now done which you doe preach to haue beene done?

Nay, what argument could be drawne from them, in the daies of Saint Austen? Might that which our adversaries vrge, that those who did miracles had the Catholike faith?

For ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those thinges are not true which are saide, or if there bee done some miracles of heretikes, wee ought the more to take heed, because when the Lorde had saide that there shoulde bee some deceivers, who by doing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny signes shoulde deceiue the very elect if it were possible, hee did adde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to inferre, that the religion of Proserpina or the Locren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was right, for these strange wonders sake?

This sheweth that you haue a prety wit of your own. To come now to the matter, our reply is in truth as you say, that the sandy foundation of all your rotten building doth rest vpon vncertaineties, your miracles are most fained, your visions are forged, your Prophecies false, all of them out of date, no inforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of verity to be gathered from them.

                  </note> answered. But your meaning is to be wilfully blind. There is nothing more false then thar Luther reiected the Epistle of Iames. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it as Scripture, &amp; cited it as he did other books. And how sha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fully was Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pian put to his plu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> havi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g Luthers works laid before him, &amp; being bidde turne to that place, where Luther so depressed &amp; vilefied that Epistle, he could find no such thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, but said it was so in a copy of Luthers works which was at Prage in the Emperours Library. And if any had sought it there, then the booke had beene removed to some other place, as the <note n="m" place="margin">Munsten Cosmogr: l: 2:</note> tree which Aeneas Silvius saith was sought in diverse cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, &amp; still missed; that tree I meane whose leaues falli<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g into the river, were turned into Barnacles. You might do wel in behalfe of Campian to shew some one of Luthers followers in Germany, De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke or else-where, who is so opposite to S. Iames his Epistle: for those whom some cal the <hi>Rigidi Lutherani,</hi> do sinke nothing which he held. Since the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both they &amp; we, &amp; al who professe the reformed Religion, do accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it Canonical, it is but an idle speculation to make that obiection. And why should Luther fly that booke as crossing the doctrine of only faith, since all other who maintaine that doctrin, do accept of that Epi. also. S. Iames doth not thwart that which S. Paul had taught: for the spirit of God is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it self, &amp; if there be any difficulty in one <note n="n" place="margin">Iac: 2: 24:</note> single text of that Epistle, it is to be explicated out of other places, which are more cleere &amp; ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. S. Paule the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in his Epistles to the Romans &amp; Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, hath so manifested that point of Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith alone, that he who without preiudice wil read the text, shal never need any Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mentary. It is so plaine that diverse Papists looking into that, &amp; laying aside false and perverted glosses, haue embraced that doctrine. <note n="o" place="margin">Sleidan. l: 21:</note> Vergerius who inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to write against Luther in that Argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, was by traversing of it, caught himselfe. Nay Ferus and Albertus Pighius who otherwise is a grosse Papist, haue sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed vnto it. And wheras our Papists obiect, that S. Paul saying that a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is iustified without the workes of the law, doth meane nothing else but the ceremonial law; that is lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g since refuted &amp; resolved by S. <note n="p" place="margin">Aug: de spirit. &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cap, 14:</note> Auste<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise.

Paule hath, that a man is iustified by faith without workes, because no works done before beleeving, helpe toward iustification: but that in beleeving actually a man is repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted iust before God, &amp; that if he die immediatly, having no time to worke, yet he by beleeving is iustified: Notwithstanding that if he liue he ought to bring forth good fruit. His co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clusion is that S. Paule doth speake of workes going before faith, &amp; S. Iames speaketh of works following that faith which hath iustified. And a right beleefe wil not be without them, if it have time to shew it selfe. I might heere adde how frequent a thing it is, with diverse Doctors of the Church, to vse the word of <hi>onely faith</hi> in speaking of our Iustificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but of that hereafter. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to shew that neither Luther nor we need feare the Epistle of S. Iames, as crossing our other doctrine, we say that S.

Iames intendeth a declaration that we are iustified: the one beateth on that before God, where the setled apprehension of faith prevaileth, which notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding wil not be without his convenient fruit; the other mentioneth that before men, who know not the hart, but must iudge of that which is externall, &amp; therefore it is rightly said by the Apostle, in their persons, <note n="s" place="margin">

                  </note> Machabees is too weake, to proue praier for faithfull soules lying in Purgatory to be lawfull. The text it selfe in the Originall is so perplexe, that an evident and certain sence cannot be made of the words. And who doth not see there, that they were not faithful persons, but rather grosse sinners which were slaine, and such as may bee thought to haue received a iust iudgment from God, both on body and foule, for medling with the Anathema or excommunicate thing? Iudas therfore who was a man so experienced in the law of Moses, could not be so simple as to send an offring, or to cause praiers to be made for the soules of them who were thus flaine, (especially when all offrings were prescribed in the Leviticall law, but there was none immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning the persons of dead men, but all for the living:) this therefore was the misse-conceite of the authour, writing therein his owne fancie, rather then the fact of Iudas. For that worthy man wel knewe, that the atonement and reconciliation was to be made, for the rest of the people and army which lived, who might smart in and for their fellowes sinne, as their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers had done for the <note n="l" place="margin">Iosua. 7. 5.</note> transgression of Achan. The offring then and praier at Hierusalem was to prevent this, and not for the soules of them who dyed in their sinne, and were not godly persons as the wordes of the Authour may seeme to import. That men should pray to Saints, I finde nothing in these treatises. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly somewhat there is that <note n="m" place="margin">Mac. 15: 12 14.</note> Onias and Ieremy did pray for the whole people of the Iewes. And what will you infer vpon these? You might vnderstand, that we deny not, that the Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven do pray in general for the good of the Church: but that they in particular, know our wants, heare our callings, vnderstand our wishes, that remaineth for you to proue. Besides you might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that this was a Vision, wherein things are represented o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then really they are, as it was with S.

Nay, our Church hath beene so carefull for giving any vvay iust occasion of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale in this matter, that it permitteth the Minister to reade in steede of any of these Apocriphal Chapters, other Canonicall lessons vpon the Sun-daies and Holy-daies, and therefore much more vpon the working-daies, as hee in his wisedome &amp; iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment shal see fit, requiring of him prudence &amp; discretion in that behalfe.

doth shut out from the Canon these bookes of Esdras, and yet they are printed and bound vp with all their ordinary Bibles, if the same or such like exceptions may bee taken, against Iudith, Tobias, and the rest, is there not as great reason that they also should be secluded from the Canonicall, albeit they remaine in the volume of the Bible? The exceptions against all these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversed writings are many, but I will reduce them briefly to these three plaine heads, which I meane to touch. First the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the bookes of Esdras is slight and vaine, without maiestie, and vnworthy the holy and sacred spirit of God. Secondly these tracts are not to be founde in the Canon of the old, that is, the Iewish Church. And thirdly in the computation of Christians they are also reiected. If we lay these lines and rules to the rest, we shall finde them of very little different quality. For first the matter of them is not coherent with the rest of the vndoubted scripture. In <note n="c" place="margin">Cap: 5. 12</note> Tobias, the Angell vtteteth somewhat of himselfe, which cannot literally be avoided: when he saith to old Tobias, <hi>I am of the kinredos Azarias, and Ananias the great, and of thy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> So, it is a narration worthy at the least to be pawsed vpon, that the <note n="d" place="margin">Cap: 6: 13:</note> seven husbands of Sara should be killed by an evil spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the first night of their mariage.

This was very soone after the age wherin the Apostles lived. It is heere to be marked concerning this holy man, as also of al the rest whom I shall name, that they never had in this businesse reference to ought, but to the course of the Iewes, accepting their iudgement for the bookes of the olde Testament to be that, wherevnto Christians also should cleaue.

But if any man be in this cause to be heard it is Hierome, whom Lodovicus Vives some-where did truely call <hi>miraculum orbis,</hi> the miracle of the worlde. Hee lived a good while at Rome, and thought highly of that Church, and therefore would not hastily break from any thing, vvhich generally, or vvith good ground was there received. Hee travailed into Palestina, and there spent much of his time, and by longe conference vvith a Ievve, and other his extreame labour, attained to the exact knovveledge of the Hebrevve tongue, and there-vpon as some thinke tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slated the vvhole Bible into Latin, as others suppose reformed and castigated that version, vvhich is called the Vulgar; and is now only currant among the Papists. Also hee made those learned Commentaries on the Prophets, which labour may tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be said to be the glory and beauty of all his vvorkes, vvhich yet otherwise are renoumed sufficiently.

                  <hi>As therefore the Church indeed doth read the bookes of Iudith, of Tobias and the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, but doth not receiue them among the Canonical scriptures, so it may read also these two volumes,</hi> that is Ecclesiasticus and the booke of Wisdome, <hi>to the edification of the people, not to confirme the authority of Ecclesiasticall doctrines.</hi> What would he haue said thinke you, if he had seene our Papists bring these bookes, as the chiefe pillers of praier for the dead, and intercession of Saints, and other such like Apocryphal trumpery.</p>

Those whom you call new fellowes are able to proue every part of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to be more ancient then your vn-Catholike superstition. Your reasons why we cannot continue, do halt on every foote. We cannot call a Councell, Ergo we cannot continue. A simple Antecedent, and a childish Consequent. And why I pray you may not the Princes &amp; governors of the Reformed kingdomes and States of Europe, as well assemble a Councell as the Popish Princes may? Yea and so much the better a Synode, because dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and conference may be free, as being out of the worde of God, and not restained within the limits of your Popes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Then how can you proue that it is of the necessity of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Generall Councels should be called?

Nay if Martin say yea, &amp; confirme it, Leo comming after will say No, and vndoe it. So that let the Councel pray and talke what they wil of the holy Ghost being among them, if the Popes holy spirit do not agree with theirs, their holy Ghost is nothing. Somewhat it was that Pope <note n="f" place="margin">Platin ain Faschal. 2:</note> Paschall did put on a gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle whence 7. keyes and 7. seales did hang, that he might adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise men that according to the seven fold graces of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, he had power to close and seale, and open and shut the holie Churches over whom by Gods appointment he was ruler.

Afterwarde when the Pope had got the head, he began to bee a little bold: but his Dictates were only attended in such places of the West, as over which he had vsurped a spirituall dominion. But the Greeke and Easterne Church tooke no notice of those assemblies more then of factious and partiall Conventicles; which is the true cause that at the Councell of Florence (which was cunningly got togither by Eugenius the 4. to toppe that of <note n="k" place="margin">Coch hist.

In the like sorte in the ninth <note n="p" place="margin">cent: 9. 9:</note> Century, the compilers of it do shew themselues not wel affected to that which you call the eighth Generall Councell, &amp; they haue no smal reason for it. For besides the allegations of the Greekes against it, which even now is specified, and besides the matter of it, which I will not stand to discusse, there was a foule attempt at the very entrance into it. The Pope of Rome had so farre prevailed, that he had there his Agents who stoode at the Councell dore with writing tables, profering them to all who would enter there, and requiring that they first should subscribe to the Iutisdiction and transcendent authority of the Romane Bishop. To which Such as yeelded did enter in: and those who refused were not only repelled, but it was done with much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and disgrace vnto them. A fit course to make a free Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node.

And of this sort either directly or indirectly haue all the Popes Councels bin. You tel vs that some Eutychians be in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, and Nestorians be in the East, whereas indeed Asia is in the East: but countrey in particular you name vs none, nor authour you cite vs none. I haue heard indeed of Marchantes who haue travailed in those parts, that at this day there is at Aleppo a Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Nestorians, and likely it is that in the country ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, or farther of in Armenia, there may be more. Neither is it vnlikely, but that some also may embrace the old heresie of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyches in those parts. In as much then as Nestorius was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the third General <note n="q" place="margin">Socn 7. 33 Evagr. 1. 4.</note> Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel at Ephesus, it is probable that his folowers wil refuse that Synode, &amp; consequently all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming after &amp; ratifying that, &amp; so they must only accept the 2. formost.

That the Church cannot faile in faith, we haue a testimonie from Christ, Peter I haue praied for thee that thy faith faile not, but for other things I remem ber no such lesson. For that out of the Gospell convinceth little, where two or three are gathered togither in my name, there am I in the middle of them. For they may be deceived amonge whom Christ is. Iohn the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist said of him to the Pharisees, He was among you, and yet they vvere deceived, and he was among the Iewes when he was crucified and spit vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And what madde man will say, that they could not be deceived? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine of what assistance of Christ is that to be vnderstoode, if of his assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance by the presence of his divinitie, that is every where, and is nothing to this matter. If of the assistance by his grace, howe will it followe that where two or three come togither to confer about the peace of the Church or any other good, Gods grace should presently br infused in them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they haue perhaps committed many sinnes where of they haue nether had compunction nor made confession. For thus some doe come togither, and either so presently with the comming their sinnes are blotted out, or else it is not necessarie that they should haue grace infused. But suppose they haue grace, will that make them that they cannot sinne, that they cannot goe awry by ignorance, or by some passion blinding them? Grace moueth to doe well, but doth not inforce or put in an inevitable necessity. If you vnderstand it of assistance by direction inwardly, that is given only to holy men who are filled with the spirit.</hi> Againe, <hi>Councels many times are gathered to alay schismes between Popes, &amp; to make peace in the Church vvhieh perhaps God hath so interrupted, that hee may doe good to the Church, to purge it from pride, covetonsues, vanity, simony. Now it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not from Christ, that men should desire only the externall peace of the Church, for so doe many carnall men at this day, that themselues li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in idlenesse and rest, they may freely serue their owne wils. And who will say that these are gathered in the name of Christ, who for this ende seeke the vnity of the Church? Yet of these there are so many as are scant to be numbred; carnall children of the Church, who care for nothing that is spirituall, may persecute those who are after the spirite, Such as for te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peral things come to the Church, hypocrites, eaters vp of Christ crucified, and of these is the Church so full, that in Chapters or Colledges you can</hi>

                  <hi>hardly finde other. And of these as being the wisest fellowes are those who are sent to Rome &amp; Princes Courtes, to generall Councels, &amp; these vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hope of greater promotion doe labor that they may be sent. And are these such who will come to reforme the Church, who only desire that freely the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> selues may do what they list. But before peace &amp; iustice can be there must be such are formation in the Church. He that seeketh outward peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spiritual peace, doth as if he should build a house without a foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They who were assembled at the Councell of Pisa, said they had broughte peace to the Church, and gaue it out to the world, when there was no such matter. Do you thinke then whither they were deceived or not? and so a Councell may be deceivid. The holy Ghost directeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who haue fitted themselues as aledging to intertaine him by good workes. But how should he visite them who thwarte the spirite, and seeke to extinguish him in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men? which in steede of the fire of charity are inflamed with the heat of ambition? These will heare nothing which is contrary to their own lust, and taste nothing of spirituall giftes, and come with a false hart to handle Gods businesses, seeking those thinges vvhich are their evvne and not Gods, which if Paule coulde say of his time, we may much more say of the dregs of our daies. With such the holye Ghost is not: and such stubborne ones woulde not yeelde to the motions thereof. Now if the Spirit bee not with such, and the greatest part of Councels consist of such, and there the Decrees are made by the maiour parte of voices, may not Councels erre? I speake not this of the present Councell at Basile, for there I heare mante good thinges are handled: but yet I heare there bee many things there vvhich shoulds not bee, contentions, emulations, heart-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, clamours which the Spirite doeth not desire. There had neede be good men sent to Councels, that God may bee amonge them. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Fathers did vse vvith praying, fasting and vveeping to begge at Gods hande, that his Spirite mighte bee present at Councels amonge them, to direct them, which they needed not to haue done, if they ware sure that hee coulde not bee absent. UUee reade in the Scripture that for one mans sinne, an armie of Gods freindes hath beene overthrowne. One sicke sheepe infecteth a vvhole flocke. And since on one mans sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or voice, the vvhole assemblie dependeth, may not he both be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and deceiue a vvhole Councell? To doe all thinges vvell and never to erra is onelye the parte of GOD; but the vvorlde knovveth that men are not Gods, not Angels, but such as of vvhome it is saide.</hi>

                  <hi>All men are lyers. They are subiect to passions and ignoraunces, which overtake men the more, when by vaine pride they vvoulde put them from them. If you saie that it resteth not on humane infirmitie, but it is of the povver of the holye Ghost, that the Councell cannot bee deceived, vvho is certaine that vvith the maiour parte of the Councell vvhich must preponderate, the holye Ghost is present?

So Micheas could doe no good on all Achabs Prophets. And who knoweth whither the maiour parte of the Councell bee vvorthie to bee deceived or no? God in Ieremie did for sake the temple vvherein the levves did trust, and hee badde the Prophet that hee shoulde not pray for them, for he would not heare him. Therefore good mens praiers doe not alvvaies obtaine for the wicked. Yea but hee hath promised to bee vvith his Church to the ende of the vvorlde. But hee alone knovveth vvho they are that haue grace in his Church. The Lorde knovveth vvho, are his. The Church by grace may remaine in one onelye vvoman, as in the time of the passion it did onelye in the Uirgin Marie. Shall a Councell now bee of greater authoritye then all the Apostles vvere? And yet they all declined at Christes death, and vvere afraide. Shall is bee greater then all the militant Church, of vvhich Augustine saide that heere it cannot bee vvithout spotte or vvrinckle, but in the nevv Hierusalem it must be.

For out of the old Councels both Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and Vniversall, there are many matters contrary to their definitions. As in the thirde Councel at Carthage there is much spoken concerning the children of Priests, which sheweth that Priests then were ordinarily marryed.

Now in the eight booke of his Stromata, Clemens indeed doth shew himselfe a Philosopher, yea if you will a Logician, talking of the Predicaments, and naming <hi>Relatiues,</hi> which is the point for the which this forged Dionysius citeth him. Againe, this booke is dedicated to Timothy Bishop of Ephesus, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so long a scholer and fellow traveiler with S. Paule, needed not so meane a man, &amp; in so barbarous a fashion to instruct him in those things which this sweete Authour pretendeth. Besides this, if there had beene such an Authour of any worth or name, some of the ancient writers would haue given him some credite, and sometimes haue mencioned him. Eusebius letteth not any man scape who was ought, or left any monument to the church. Notwithstanding he hath not any worde of this Dionysius. S. Hierome came after him, and wrote a <note n="h" place="margin">Catalog. scripto. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastico.</note> treatise purposely of such as before his daies, left any bookes to posterity, where neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the hame of this Dionysius is not to be found.

had beene of any reputation vvith them, some or other of the olde Fathers speaking of Angels, vpon iust occasion would haue named either it, or the authour, or the matter of it. <note n="m" place="margin">Haeres. 64</note> Epiphanius saith that there are more degrees of Angels then one, but howe many hee nameth not.

I answere, first that indeede he nameth one Dionysi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, &amp; attributeth to him the title of a Divine, but he calleth him, not Areopagita, and therefore hee may meane some other later fellow. Secondly, the treatise containing this, is expunged out of the workes of Athanasius, and put among those that are held to be forged; so that here but one lyer doth speake for another, and then their rewarde is that neither of them ought to be beleeved. Thirdly it agreeth not with an vndoubted place of <note n="s" place="margin">De co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni essent. patris. filij &amp; spi. sanct.</note> Athanasius, for there he rather seemeth to make fiue sorts of Angels, &amp; that with offices differing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those of Dionysius, as, those that teach, those that permit thinges to bee done, those that punish, those that gratifie souls, and those who remaine with men. Afterward indeede hee mencioneth Thrones, &amp; Cherubins and Seraphins. So that the first who beeing himselfe of any estimation mencio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Denis, is Gregory the Greate, who in <note n="s" place="margin">Moral: lib: 32. 18:</note> one place saith that there bee nine orders of Angels, but not a word hath he of Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius.

Like to this is your quoting of Calvins Institutions, where you name not the booke, which intendeth that you never sawe him nor reade him.

As for Causaeus, I cannot yet by any search get sight of the booke, but wee may iudge by that formerly obiected against him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Dionysius, that if we had the booke, your cavil did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine no great matter in truth.

               <p n="7">7 YOV haue given vs the rule before; that we revile the Fathers: novve vvee shall haue the reason annexed to the rule. The Fathers write notable Sermons concerning Lent and other fasting daies as they are nowe vsed; and wee cannot endure such fastes, therefore we hate the Fathers writing of that argument. I vvoulde you coulde learne to hate vntruth, and then your eies would bee so opened, that you should see little of this which you write to bee true. Hovve prooue you that the Doctors speake of Lent and fasting daies as you now vse them? You name vs first Saint Basile, in whome I finde onely two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons concerning fasting. The <note n="x" place="margin">Serm. de Ieiunio.</note> former of them is in commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of abstinence, howe good it is for the soule, howe health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the body. And there is not one worde in it, to which vvee doe not assent, giving due commendation therevnto. His se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sermon doth beare a title which seemeth more to make for you, <note n="y" place="margin">Deieiunio pridie diei Cinerum.</note>

that then they kept a day of ashes, as now you keepe Ashe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wednesday. I will not heere discusse whether the solemne vse of ashes was so auncient or no: the contrary wherof directly appee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth out of Polydore Virgil, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly if you wil allow it, then your Shrove-Tuesday must be a fasting day, which the Romanists Carnevall may not admit. Thirdly if you had looked into that Sermon it selfe, you might haue found that more then once, Basile speaketh of a fast onely for five daies, &amp; no more; which being to be kept no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, vtterly overthroweth your positio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in those times Lent and fasting daies were observed as now they be. You haue hard happe Doctour Hill to trippe vp your owne heeles. In Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Nazianzen there is so little concerning fasting, as that sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t any point in Divinity is lesse touched by him then that.

Out of which there is nothing to be wonne but this, that a Lent in one sorte or other was kepte in his time, which you need not trouble your selfe to prove; for we do yeeld it. As for Chrysostome, he hath three or foure Sermons where he speaketh of fasting, how requisite it is, and that aboue all matters men in their abstinence should fast fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sinne, which doctrine wee also publish.

But hee reiecteth both their sayinges, because they coulde bring no written testimonie of either of these, vvhich is a good course for vs also to examine traditions called Apostolicall by. From Easter he commeth to Lent, and therein sheweth, that even in his daies which was late, the manner of keeping of it was very different. <hi>Those</hi> saith hee <hi>who are at Rome doe fast three vveekes togither before Easter, the Saterdaie and the Sundaie beeing excepted. But they vvho dvvell in Illyria and all Greece; and they vvho dvvell at. Alexandria doe sixe vveekes before beginne those fastes vvhich are kepte before Easter, and that time they call Lente.</hi>

                  <hi>Some contrary to the custome of these, making seven weekes before that feast the beginning of their fasting, although they doe fast onely fifteene daies, and that with some distaunce being put betweene, yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they call this Quadragesima or Lent. Wherevpon I doe not a little wonder how these though they differ in the number of the daies, yet all cal it by one name Quadragesima. Diverse doe giue diverse reasons of this name, devised of their owne heade. Moreover they doe not only differ in the number of the daies, but in their abstinence from meate they fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low diverse courses. For some doe altogither abstaine from all kind of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving creatures: some amonge living creatures doe eate only fishes, some togither with fish doe eate also birdes, and doe saie that they are bredde of the water, (as it is in Moises.) Some doe forbeare from fruits covered with hard shels, and from egges: others doe eate dry breade only, others not so much as that. There bee who when they haue fasted to the ninth houre doe vse various kindes of meates. In severall nations they fast se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally, whereof there are almost infinite causes. And because no man can shewe any precepts concerning it set downe in writing, it is manifest that the Apostles therein did giue free power to everie man, minde and will, that each man should doe that which is good, beeing induced vnto it neither by feare nor necessitie. This severall sort of fasting we doe know to be in the Churches.</hi>

But what adoe there was to hammer it to this set number, it is marveilous to beholde. There are certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees which are put out in the names of some of the most aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Bishops of Rome. Among these, <note n="i" place="margin">Decretal. Epist Teles phori.

Lordes daye or Sundaye no Christian might fast. VVhere once againe wee finde that matters vvhich may most iustly bee doubted of, are called Constitutions or traditions Apostolical. For hovve came it about that the most auncient Fathers and the vvriter of the Epistle fathered on Telesphorus knevve not that there vvas such an ordinaunce? VVell, <note n="l" place="margin">Haeres. 70:</note> Epiphanius speaking of fasting and mourning, saith it is an ordinance of the Apostles, <hi>Hee vvho afflicteth his soule on the LORDES daye, is accursed to GOD</hi> And in <note n="m" place="margin">In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clus libri contra hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reses.</note> another place speaking as plainly, hee saith that there were no fastes vppon the LORDS dayes, and that therefore the Communion vvas celebrated in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that aftervvardes they might eate that daye.

the Thursday also, and so the dayes of Lente are shrewdely shrunke. In this distraction was the olde Church about this fast, no man almost being able distinctly to tell vvhat to make of it for the number of the dayes. They vvho harkened to Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesphorus had a Quinquagesima for a Quadragesima, fiftye or at least forty and nine dayes for fortye. They vvho beganne at Quadragesima Sunday and kepte all till Easter, had fortye and two daies to their Lente, and so as <note n="r" place="margin">Vbi supra.</note> Polidore hath, for a good while it was kepte.

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:618:207"/>
onely a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slatour of it. The golden streames of S. Chrysostomes eloquence wee hold wel neere incomparable, &amp; his frequent si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes &amp; comparisons to be so familiar, &amp; yet so significant and lively, that wee account him scant worthy the name of an eminent preacher to the people, who hath not bin conversant in his works. We thinke S. Hierome for his learning not vnworthy to bee called a wonder of the world: his vniversal knowledge, &amp; especially in the sacred tongues, togither with his ponderous style are honorable among all vvho knovve good letters. Saint Augustine for his iudgement goeth beyond them all: his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding was great as most of al appeereth in <note n="z" place="margin">De civita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te Dei,</note> one tract of his, being the most noble of all his vvritings: his diligence, his zeale, and acutenesse against heretikes, have vvonne him everlasting prayse: and so doe vvee esteeme of his vvorkes, that we holde him much dis-furnished in the study of Divinity, especially for schoole-learning and grapling with an adversary, who is not wel acquainted with him. Such is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt that we cary to these reverend persons: nay if it were not for avoiding vnnecessary tediousnesse, vvee should much farther extoll their due-deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved commendation, VVhy then doe wee basely regard them? Because vvee bee given to lust and gluttony, and they <hi>have vvritten so excellently of the Order, Rule, and Vertues of Monkes.</hi> This hangeth wonderfull well togither. Doe all vvho are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to covetousnesse, ambition, gluttony, and lust, hate monkes and monkery, &amp; al who haue prescribed good rules vnto them? Then your Pope and cardinals, and all the whole sinful Courte of Rome must stand arraigned for that crime: for eche man of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnderstanding knoweth howe they abound in those vices. And besides if precepts for Monkery bee so contrary to these sinnes, must not the practise of them in a Monkish life be much more remote from them? And vvas it never heard that Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes or Monasteries of women, haue had many younge bones of little children found in them, which came not thither vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lust: or that many Monkes were little better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen gorbellied monstrous Epicures, vvhich arose not without gluttony: or that in the elections of their Priours, Abbots and Bishoppes, there vvas infinite competition, vvith all kinde

of striving, banding and canvasing, which was not without am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition: or that some of their vowed men (especially that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fellowe mentioned by <note n="a" place="margin">De mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</note> Aeneas Sylvius) have lefte great summes of money in secret behinde them, which were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gotten nor kepte without avarice? Thus nothing can bee more certaine, then that men who loue the sinnes which you name, may be favourers of Monkes, &amp; the Monastical creatures haue &amp; do commonly bath themselues in such noted crimes.</p>

It may be questioned whether he hath or no for there is great doubte whether those bee his bookes vvherein most is contained touching that argument. But if we should allow you your desire, he hath no where saide more of that matter, then in a <note n="b" place="margin">Serm: Quomodo ornaretur Monach:</note> Sermon where he describeth the qualities of right mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kes, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which qualities these late ones are very farre distant.

But he spake thus freely to the contrary: <note n="d" place="margin">In Gen. Homil 43:</note>

imaginations. Some women perswaded by him or his, leste their husbands, put on mens apparrel, and fell to adultery. These persons lived about the time of the fore-named Fathers, who in their bookes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended the good parts which were then exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; doubtles gaue those precepts which they did giue, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the abuses. And as succeeding generations came on, did not the superstitious devises of Monks increase, as is to be seene in Evagrius? Some did shut themselues into little houses, <note n="r" place="margin">Evagr: hist Eccl. l: 1: 21:</note> which were so low &amp; narrow, as that they could neither stand vpright in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor ly otherwise then double. Some both men &amp; women living in the wildernes did onely cover their privities, &amp; for the rest went naked both in the hottest &amp; coldest wether. Some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing all foode of men, did eate only the grasse of the ground, &amp; would not endure the presence of any persons, but woulde run away and hide them in the rockes. Other counterfeyting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues fooles laboured to bee without all passion. These woulde not refuse to goe into tavernes or brothel-houses: they would be in bathes with women, and as among men they lived as men, so among women they were as women. Yet did those ages so doate vpon monkery, that even these were commended, and helde for holy men. Thus if wee take these olde lads in their best times, they had imperfections inough, but of the good qualities which were in any of them those vvho came after embraced but a few. Onely the ignorance of Anthony went almost currant through all: that was as good as hereditary to them. But the olde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voute service of God was of late turned into hypocrisie, fasting into perpetuall belly-cheere, scarcity and penury into aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and lordly possessions of landes, charity was converted into hart-burning and envie, humility into pride, sobriety into Venereous and Sodomitish lust: their piety was but formality, their idolatry was infinite. Thus it grewe forwarde by little and little, till it came to the height of vngodlinesse. Howe soone this beganne maye bee gathered by him vvho vvrote the treatise commonlye called Cyprians, <hi>De duplici martyrio,</hi> There vvee thus read, <note n="s" place="margin">Cypr. de dupl. mart.</note>

There you shall see some of them most easilie to bee overcome vvith delightes, more impatient of iniuries, more desirous of vengance then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the ordinarie people. What is the cause? Because they haue more exercised the body then the minde.</hi> This began betimes: but as they grew in yeares, so many of them grew in horrible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes. It is a long while since <note n="s" place="margin">Eccl. Hist. Ang: l: 4: 25</note> Beda lived: yet in his Ecclesiasticall story he mencioneth that a Monastery called Colindiurbem was consumed with fire, for the lasciviousnes and wantonnes which was there founde in both men and women. So did God punish them. But in S. Bernards time a carnall kinde of behavior had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-growne almost all, which caused him earnestly &amp; passionat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to complaine, <note n="t" place="margin">Bernard. in cena Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini cap: 3.</note> 
                  <hi>How many monkes be there in S. Benedicts monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who do laugh when other men doe mourne; who reioice when other are sadde.

And how this was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde amended in England, may bee testified by the survey, which by Visitation of the Kings Commissioners was taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der King Henry the eight of famous memory, when by othes of the religious persons themselues, much Sodomitry &amp; other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse was detected, and afterwarde was published to the world by a printed booke, some notes wherof are to be seene in the French Apology of <note n="u" place="margin">Cap. 21:</note> Henry Stephanus made in defence of Herodotus. Such small affinity had and haue your late monkes, with those of whom we read among the old writers. But for ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities of doctrin, especially in commending themselues, they go beyond all those of auncient times, as I will instaunce in the Franciscanes, who maintaine these points which yet are disliked by some other Papists, and by some other excused or defended.

Iewel, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward interserting his ovvne iudgement concerning many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in difference, hee groweth to this head that the onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acte way of reformation of abuses &amp; of determination of truth, is the vvorde of GOD; that it alone is to bee made the iudge. Vppon vvhich insisting, hee inferreth that therefore Maister
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:618:212"/>
Iewell <hi>gaue too much, and yeelded to the Papistes more then equity, and was too iniurious to himselfe,</hi> when hee tooke not the surer, easier &amp; shorter course of triall by the Scriptures alone, but gaue larger scope of expatiating into the Councels &amp; Fathers. But most ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdly is your Popish conclusion gathered out of this, that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore D. Humfrey knew or confessed that the Fathers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church were against vs and him. You should rather haue inferred thus much, that D. Humfrey thought that M. Iewell had a sure matter in hand, when needing to referre all but to the Scriptures, he appealed also to the Fathers; that both by the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God and man he might avouch his assertions. In case of triall for land, we know that authentical writings and evidences are the best and most absolute meanes of deciding right: but if he who oweth and possesseth the writings, knowing the integritie of his cause, shall not refuse also to haue his quarrell tried by the testimonies of indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, he hath departed so much from his owne right, and done more then he need to do. If then his friend shoulde say, that therein hee hath yeelded to more then meete, and did himselfe a wrong by it, by yeelding his adversary many exceptions, wheras he might haue tyed him onely to one, should not a stander by make an absurd collectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he should gather vpon this, that the litigants friend savv well that the witnesse of the Countrey would goe against him? And especially when he whom it most concerneth, shall by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of those to whom he appealed, make good all his assevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? This was the Bishops case, and no otherwise then thus was it reported by the Venerable Doctour. And albeit this may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to bee thus to every one who will read the narration, yet because Bristow, Campian and you take it all one from another, and other may yet take it farther, &amp; your people be still abused, as if so learned a man as D. Humfrey, had both disliked M. Iewels words, and given sentence touching the Fathers against vs; for the farther satisfaction of the Reader, I desire these thinges to be marked. First that Doctour Humfrey in that booke concerning M. Iewell, as also in his <note n="i" place="margin">Secund: pars Iesuitis</note> other against Campian, doth frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cite the old Fathers for vs, in all questions of difference that occurre, Ergo he doth not thinke that the Doctors are all on the
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:618:212"/>
Papists side, and not on the Protestants. Secondly that in'all his Lectures, Disputations and Sermons he was most copious in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and alleaging the ol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Thirdly to this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, that in the very <note n="k" place="margin">Fol. 124:</note> place where he speaketh of the Bishops chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, he putteth these wordes before; <hi>And here is necessarily to be repeated that Protestation or denunciation, which was heard out of this place</hi> of Paules Crosse, <hi>which our adversaries doe calumniate to bee vaine and frivolow: which notwithstanding they will not deny to be true who are of the better sort of wit, and of more excellent learning.</hi> Can a man speake plainer then the Doctour doth here, iustifying that to be true which the Bishop said, and calling the adversaries ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the Challenge, a calumniation? Fourthly that in the <note n="l" place="margin">Fol. 212:</note> place where he saith that M.

For what Father woulde dare to thinke, that his speeches shoulde over-rule the Scripture? As for wringing and wresting and straining, we detest it. Gods truth needeth not to be vpheld by vntruthes.

Now if there bee such doubtes as these in the Fathers, or other like, and we cannot be resolved out of these Doctours; or if question be of the verity of their doctrine, whither must we haue recourse? The Papistes will say to the Church of Rome, that is to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, but the Fathers wil tell vs to the word of God, as forth-with I shal shewe: which every way discovereth the base weakenesse of the vnCatholike Church, since the Doctors are not the touch-stone of truth, but are themselves to be tried by some thing else: they are not selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient, but all their words are to be weighed in the ballaunce of the Sanctuarie, where if they beare waight, they are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, if they be found too light, they are to bee reiected. Our ground then and foundation is not in these men, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so worthy men, but the booke of God must make the finall and irrefragable decision.</p>

                  <hi>VVarne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woord.</hi> Whether I should say this to be Father Parsons, or Father Warford, I know not well: since Warford as I am certainely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, hath perpetually free accesse to the others study, &amp; di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesteth that matter vvhich Parsons is not at leisure to put into forme, &amp; sometimes putting Epistles &amp; Prefaces to the workes of the elder Foxe, they two play handy-dandy so eche with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they thinke by a Iesuitish conveiance, they ioyntly or severally according to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>veniency of their the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses may affirme or deny any booke to be or not be the worke of Father Parsons. But whether soever of the two it be, he being charged by his adversary with the clipping of the Fathers accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the rules of the Index Expurgatorius, laboureth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voide from his side the imputation of those fraudes. And for that purpose <note n="d" place="margin">Encount. 2: cap 9:</note> citeth diverse rules prefixed by the Councel of Trent, before the Index, all which rules do touch the workes of later writers; but touching those which are ancient, he saith that thus they decree, <hi>In libris autem Catholicorum veterum, nihil mutari fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:618:222"/>
may do what they list: for since Papistes and Popishe Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours must be the Iudges, there shal bee nothing which crosseth their Antichristian doctrine, but it by and by shal be saide (even contrary to all antiquity) to be thrust in by heretikes. And what conscience they make in practising their owne rule, and keeping themselves within compasse thereof, may bee seene by that of Cyprian so handled by Pamelius as is before mencioned, where it cannot be denied but that they have altered the wordes from those which formerly were, And shal it now bee saide to bee the Printers faulte, that the words are as we reade them. Why their owne Prints, &amp; all the olde written copies have them so. Or shal it be said to be foisted in by heretikes, when so many &amp; so greate Papists as Costerius, Manutius, Morelius and the other aboue named were, yea Gratian himselfe doth put it as wee doe? The truth then is, they wil put in &amp; put out, adde, diminish, choppe, chaunge &amp; alter what they list, &amp; if any shewe can that way be made it shall be pretended to be the errour of the Printer, or the falshood of an Heretike: but if there be not so much as any cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for that pretence, yet if it bee for their purpose, it shall bee done, with hope that it shall not bee espied, or that some secrete probable reason shal be imagined wherfore iustly they might do so. In which respect I may say, that the rule is wicked &amp; the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise is worse, the one sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>y permitteth falshood, the other more audaciously doth execute it, and so even the workes of the most Auncient are daily depraved by this sinfull and deceitfull Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishe broode. So that if ever there were a fraudulent and false generation of vipers on the earth; if men that have solde them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to falshood; if such as to serve the turne of their vn-holy Father, care not what they doe which may cary any pretence, it is this vngracious and vngodly company. The Lorde discover their wickednesse to the simple people, that every one may see and detest their damnable abuses. By these plaine and evident matters, it may appeere whether the Romanists or we doe truely make more reckoning of the Fathers, since wee yeelde them so much authority as belongeth to auncient, godly, and learned men, noble lampes in the Primitive Church, and great illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the truth; they in substance overthrow all this; since we

And albeit for the whole yeere following I was sufficiently burthened with my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary businesse, &amp; therein for the space of 9. or 10. weeks, sicke and much weakened with a sharpe and vehement fever: yet my desire to dispell these foggy mists of Popery was such, that within the compasse of that time, I drew vp the first Copy of an Answere to 16. of these Romish Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Wherein rather desiring to giue to the Reader a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial then a flight satisfaction, I found by probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture that even so much would grow to a reasonable vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume: and the like course heere-after being taken with the latter part of D. Hils book, there also might arise a work of like proportion. Vpon this conceit I fell to revising &amp; wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out to the Presse that which formerly I had done, and therein by Gods blessing I went so farre, that now 6. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths since I finished so much as heere is published, some few interlacings only excepted. But when I shoulde haue proceeded to the perfecting vp of the other sixe, a burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was by my honorable Patrone imposed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither with my necessary imploime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts at Winchester since that time, hath so put me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; kept me in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I scant haue bin able to sustaine the waight

And in as much as yet for a time I'am not like to be freed from that charge, I am put to this difficulty, that either till I haue more leysure; I must stay the Answere to these tenne Chapters, being now completed by the Printer, or I must send these forth without their fellowes, which is much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to my former purpose.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding at the last I haue resolued vpon the latter of these two courses, being the rather inclined ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, because a learned man of the other Vnivetsity hath lately vn-quartered the whole Quartron of D. Hils Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which peradventure in the iudgement of many men may seeme so good a satisfaction to that which the adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie hath obiected, that my future labours in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may very well be spared. For this cause my purpose is, (giving way to my present necessarie services) to attend and expect for a while, the iudgement and Censure of men wise and learned in our Church, and afterwarde to proceede or not proceede as occasion hall require. In the meane time I may say, that the mainest and principallest bulwarkes of the Romish religion are these, which I haue already assaulted: and it is as easie a matter to go forward with the rest, as it hath beene to deale with these. Before persons which are wilfully ignoraunt, or perverse togither with their learning, Popery may bear some shew; but with such as haue the skill to displaye it, or the grace to endure the dismasking of it, it is but a painted Iesabell. Only here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the vnsearchable iudgement of God is to bee admired, and his waies which are past finding out are to be wonde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at, and that with amasement and astonishment, that there should yet be so many, who haue eies and see not, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:618:224"/>
eares and heare not, yea harts and vnderstand not, but still go forward to make vp the number of the servitors of the beast, and of the traine of Antichrist, who must haue some to adore him till the dissolution of the worlde. But to the ende that such among our Popish Countrey-men as are ordained to salvation, may be plucked out of the fire, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoveth vs who are the Ministers of the Gospell to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in preaching the Gospell to such as wil heare, and in writing, for such as will reade, that they may know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue and be saved. For the better accomplishing wherof, and for the instruction of the ignorant, who most readylie are seduced, I haue taken these paines, endevouring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver plainely and without obscurity that which I haue to saie: And for the cleering of all my Doctors both general and particular suggestions, tracing him step by step, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides discussing the maine drifte of his Reasons, togither with the validity of those Arguments, which others for the strengthening of the Romane perfidiousnesse, doe or may rest therevpon. And yet in fitting my selfe to the capacity of the vnlearned, I haue not beene altogither forgetful to giue some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment to men of more knowledge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in how farre I haue gone, it is not for me, but for others to iudge.</p>
            <p>But whereas I haue once made mention, of the expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Iesuites out of Fraunce, and the sharpe Edict which was there against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and now the report is strong, that vpon some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions they are restored thither again, (to the truth wherof in particular, I must ingenuously co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that I cannot yet attaine) the difference of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing waighed will easily aunswere for that matter, it beeing certainelie here-tofore one waie, and nowe peradventure another. In respect whereof it is not amisse to know, that

as it was longer agone that the Copy writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the Presse was finished, so it is fiue moneths since that the Printer began with this booke, howsoever sometimes this worke hath beene interrupted, one while with the danger of the Pestilence, which of late hath beene so generally spreade, &amp; another while with the publishing of divers other linal tracts, which the present occasion did offer. And this also may serue for Answer to another point, wherin my charity presumed more quietnes in some men amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

            <p>Lastly I earnestly intreate al Romishly affected English men &amp; women, that they be not so ready to harken to Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits &amp; Seminary men, as here-tofore they haue bin, &amp; to follow their lures either in spirituall or temporall matters. What they can say for their Idolatry &amp; superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is long since known, neither haue they yet brought ought of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hath received answer. And for their other beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, whither it be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dable &amp; Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or no, let their own books between the vnited &amp; dis-vnited Priests shew, wherin of late so copiously &amp; so liuely they haue disciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red each other. But if this will not serue the turne, let the practises of two Priests lately displayed &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fested by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

It is hard to say whether their attempts were more traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous against their Soveraigne, or trecherous against their frends &amp; men of their owne Religion. I take no pleasure to speak ill of those which are dead, &amp; whose bodies have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the stroke of Iustice according to their deserts. But since these thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gs were not done in a corner, but as matters exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plary to al the land, &amp; they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no way be concealed, let.

And that this was not altogither vnlikely, is plain by the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> speech of Clarke at the barre, who professed that he could bring two hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, viz. to acte such their pretended devises for their Catholik cause: &amp; yet Clarke was the lesse active Preest of the two If these felowes in a matter of that high quality spake false (which some will imagine) what trust may their favourites give them, in other their relations?

If they spake true, how feareful is the case of such as listen vnto them, who so soone, &amp; vnder such faire coulours may be circumvented? But how mercifull in the meane time, is the proceeding of his blessed Maiestie, who questioneth not with severity of iustice al those who were intangled in some circumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of that attempt (it being no hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have them discovered) but affoordeth much more clemency then other Princes in like cases have done. Let them magnify the mercy of the Lord, and his Annointed, and let them thinke and speake honorably of the Ienity of the State, which rather spareth' men apparantly ill deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then questioneth any who are tolerably innocent. And for the restlet them seriously take heede of such as have beene nouzeled vnder Cardinal Allen, Persons, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, Worthington and their adherents, least they tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bring ruine on their houses and bodies, and eternally on their soules. God wil not evermore beare those, who shut their eies and stop their eares against the truth. The Lord direct vs in his owne waies, &amp; call home such as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or by ignorance have gone astray, that at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth they may bee reduced to the sheepe-folde of Christ Iesus, to whom with his Father, and their blessed spirite bee praise for evermore,</p>
