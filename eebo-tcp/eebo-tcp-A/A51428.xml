         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION

THE BISHOP OF
DVRHAM,
FROM THE VILE AND
Scandalous Calumnies of a Libell
Intituled the Downe-fall of
Episcopacie, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath beene alwayes the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
of the evill Spirit, that
when he cannot shake Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
or undermine a well-grounded
Truth; then hee
betakes himselfe to perswade
the hearts and minds of wicked men to levell
at the worth and reputation of the chiefest
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93531:3"/>
Professours of it, to wound their lives, and
staine their good names, with reproach and
obloquie, that by such meanes those Scorners
may satisfie their owne humour, by how much
the other side is brought into hatred and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
and before they are able to vindicate
themselves by a just defence.</p>
            <p>Thus hath a late Libeller dealt, who hath
made himselfe the Author of the <hi>Downe-fall of
the Hierarchie,</hi> and telleth us at whose reputation
he doth more principally and professedly and
aime, by reason of his nourishing <hi>ignorance,
blindnesse,</hi> persecuting <hi>Orthodox Preachers,</hi> and
<hi>cherishing Popery, &amp; Papists, which if it shalbe made
good</hi> (saith he) <hi>in Thomas Duresme, the best in
the bunch, &amp;c.</hi> that so thorow the <hi>Prelate of
Durham's</hi> sides he may wound the rest of that
sacred Order; yea, and (we may adde) in some
sort Religion it selfe; which cannot but suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the while he is traduced by this wayward
generation of men at home, who by reason
of his many Elucubrations hath for many
yeares had a reverend esteeme by sundry fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
and worthy Divines of the reformed
Churches beyond the Seas in their publike
bookes and letters, accounting him a <hi>Moderne
Father,</hi> and choice <hi>Pillar of Gods Church;</hi> yea,
and by all Protestants acknowledged as an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugner
of the Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> for the space
of almost 40. yeares. All which injurious
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93531:3"/>
and uncharitable dealing notwithstanding, this
Libell might have beene contemned and passed
over (which is the best charme for such spirits)
had it beene a single paper, and not as a plague
spred by many infectious copies. The case
thus considered, it was thought fit by some
one or other, to whom the Reputation of that
R. Bishop ought to be deare and tender, and
unto whom the falsities of those imputations
are well enough discovered and knowne, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
this present Vindication in his behalfe,
thereby both to prevent the prejudice of them
who have not yet tasted of that venemous
Calumnie, &amp; also as by an Antidote, to remove
it from the hearts of such as have peradventure
sucked any dram thereof.</p>
            <p>Now that the Reader may the better have
notice of those his false accusations, it is most
necessary we first take a survey of the platform,
whereon he hath planted his sixth <hi>Canon</hi> (as he
termeth it) to batter downe the Bishops, and
(of them) chiefely the Prelate of <hi>Durham,</hi>
which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Libell.</hi> The very nature of their Office is to
thirst after the bloud of Gods Saints. <hi>Apoc. 2. 13.</hi>
where <hi>Antipas</hi> my faithfull Martyr is slaine,
there is Satans throne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Very learnedly forsooth. Was
<hi>Antipas</hi> slaine by the <hi>Angel</hi> of that Church?
(whom the Libeller unawares hath stiled <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop)</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:93531:4"/>
the Spirit in the same verse enformes us
the contrary, commending the same <hi>Angel for
holding fast his name, and not denying his faith.</hi>
Yea rather, was not <hi>Antipas</hi> himselfe (as some
write) <hi>Bishop of Pergamus,</hi> whom the <hi>Angel</hi>
(there mentioned) succeeded, and there was
put to death by the command of <hi>Domitian</hi> that
persecuting Emperour, if antiquity be of any
credit with you? For whose death, as also for
the <hi>Doctrine of Balaam,</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans</hi>
taught among them, In <hi>Pergamus</hi> (saith the
Spirit) <hi>is the seate of Antichrist.</hi> Your argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then stands thus; <hi>Antipas</hi> the good Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and faithfull Martyr of Christ was slaine
by the command of the Tyrant <hi>Domitian.
Ergo, It is the nature of Episcopacie to be bloudy and
tyrannicall.</hi> It will be an happinesse to Bishops
to have no better Accusers then such, who
cannot defame their calling, but with blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
in a manner, innumerable other Bishops,
who have been the glorious Martyrs of Christ.
But let us trie his first Battery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Libell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
               <q>Of this tyranny let one of themselves
be witnesse (out of whose mouth the Lord exacted
this testimony, Prelate <hi>Vaugham</hi> in a Speech to
Doctor <hi>Morton</hi> long agoe (now Prelate of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham)</hi>
confessed that the Persecution of those times
were worse then in Queene <hi>Maries</hi> dayes, and
gave reasons for it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Marke how he rakes the channels
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93531:4"/>
of times, whereby to throw dirt upon the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
name of a dead man, and Saint of God,
as if God had <hi>exacted out of his mouth</hi> a saying
which was never heard, and also the Reasons
thereof, which are so modest as they blush to
speake. But how will not this first Canon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyle
upon the Libeller himselfe? Did that
good Bishop (as is here alleadged) grieve at
the persecution of any of those times? then
hath this man overshot his marke, when hee
said, that the <hi>Nature of Episcopacie is to thirst af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the bloud of Gods Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Libell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 9.</note> 
               <q>Now let Prelate <hi>Morton</hi> speake how
they <hi>(meaning, persecutions)</hi> are increased in his
time, and by him: if he will not, it may be God
may exact it of him sometime with more horror of
conscience then any of his Predecessors, because
he sinnes against the greater light and more
warnings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Or rather let any rationall man
judge whether that Spirit of malignity, which
is so predominant in this man, would (in all
probability) permit him to forbeare clamou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to the High Court of Parliament against
the Bishop, if any such kinde of <hi>tyrannous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution</hi>
could not colourably be branded upon
him: yet is the Bishop beholden to this Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
for joyning him in this horrid crimination
with the most Reverend, and thrice learned the
Lord Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> who for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93531:5"/>
and innocencie of life, till this present
scandalizing time, malice it selfe could never
call into question, and therefore let this Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
expect that God will one day <hi>exact</hi> these
impudent calumniations of him with more
<hi>horror of conscience</hi> (they are his owne words)
<hi>then of any other,</hi> because he knowing him
(whom all good men doe honour and esteem)
sinnes against <hi>greater light, and more warnings.</hi>
But since he more then once retrives this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,<note place="margin">P. 9.</note>
and flies it home with more eagernesse
<note n="*" place="margin">P. 24. 25.</note> afterwards, it shall be referred to a further
consideration; and in the meane time his next
Crimination is to be examined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Libell.</hi> 
               <q>The Bishop said, that if Popery came
into <hi>England</hi> againe, the Puritans were the cause
of it,<note place="margin">P. 19.</note> even as Tenterton steeple is the cause of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine
sands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> So he, wittily you see; but yet
wilily withall, by dissembling the full expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
&amp; discourse of the Bishop, which was this;
That Schisme being a breach of the Church-fence,
if it be done by those who are guilty
thereof, it would be easie for a wild <hi>Boare</hi> out
of the <hi>Popes Forest</hi> to enter and depopulate the
Church; for what is domesticall dissention
else but as a <hi>Trojane horse</hi> importing ruine
wheresoever it is placed? However, it is to be
wished that the same conjecture may never
prove Propheticall! But this Canoneere, that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93531:5"/>
he may hit home, desireth to give instances of
his charge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Libell.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 21.</note> 
               <q>Thomas of Duresme assumeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
the highest stile of an Earle in his writings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> 
               <q>So as in one County of Northumberland
and towne of New-Castle in above 72. or more Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
besides Chappels, whereof divers Livings
of 2, 3, and 400. li. <hi>per Ann.</hi> We are credibly
informed, there's scarce a Minister left that is not
a Popish Innovatour, or not Popish, and Armintan,
or that makes conscience of Preaching.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> And why may not your infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? It will be granted that in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland
there are foure or five Livings in
Church-mens hands of 200. <hi>per Ann.</hi> or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,<note place="margin">There are but 3. Ministers colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Livings in that County by the said Bishop, all which are painfull and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox men.</note>
all the rest being of much meaner va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue,
even to 4. li. or 5. li. <hi>per Ann.</hi> The former
and best of these are supplyed by learned and
able Preachers, neither accounted <hi>Arminians,</hi>
nor <hi>Popishly addicted;</hi> and the meane provision
for the later, being either stipendaries of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriations,
or poore Vicarages in severall
Lay-Patrons gifts, is too true a cause of the
want of Preaching in those places, and the just
reason why some of the Ministers are constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to live otherwise then men in that holy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93531:6"/>
calling ought to doe: For the redresse of which,
it is well knowne to the best of the Countrey
that his Lordship hath not onely placed and
maintained severall Lecturers out of his owne
purse in some needfull places in that County,
but also had given order for that end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to preferre a Petition to the last High
Court of Parliament for a redresse herein.
Having thus visited Northumberland with the

&amp;c. Preachers, no Plants for his Palatinate:
but if you will talk of fat Parsons and Parsonages,

Preachers</hi> in the County Palatine of <hi>Durham?</hi>
you mean of your own <hi>garbe,</hi> (for that's your
phrase) otherwise you must bee let know (to
your blush, if you be not past it) that there is
no County of <hi>England</hi> (of so small an extent)
which hath so many able and sound Preachers,
and these also who make a conscience of the
faithfull discharge of their duties in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as that County Palatine hath. And lastly
in the meanest living within his Diocese there
should be want of instruction to the people,
he hath from time to time taken a strict course
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93531:6"/>
care that there should be due and constant Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techizing
of the youth in each Parish, to which
end, at his owne charge, he hath continually
supplyed them with many thousands of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes
on purpose printed for that end. But
grant that, of that number of Preachers, there
be some such as you repute <hi>Arminians,</hi> must
other mens crimes be entitled upon the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
especially since himselfe hath preferred
but a few, and those such (whether Kinsmen or
other) as both for life and sound Doctrine are

a conscionable man would have ingenuously

all <hi>Altar-worship,</hi> by condemning it as a brutish
Absurdity for a reasonable man to give wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to an unreasonable creature, which cannot
be capable thereof, but also against the very
name of <hi>Altar,</hi> in the propriety of the sense,

Papists, his Chancellour, Archdeacon, and

dealt withall for their Popery, but that
by reason of their compositions they were too

cherished, as that they continually complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of their hard usage and extremities to

it will not be denied but some of them have

               <q>The said Tho. Duresme amongst his
Palatine Souldiers most Papists in their late Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopall
broyles, was observed to have in his Coach
with him one of the most dangerous Papists in the
North, and fit to be one of his Counsell of warre
in his Regality, and in that Episcopall Quarrell
with the Scots, which being publikely taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93531:8"/>
of was very offensive to many, and scandalous
to his Majesties government, and to his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
divine Authority, to see him so accompanied,
I know not what he can say to this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> But such as were employed in any
office of nearenesse or attendance on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
can say, that in those times (he points at)
the Bishop used all care and diligence that no
Popish Recusant should be so much as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Souldier in the Regiment; which was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not for any <hi>Episcopall Quarrell,</hi> but for the
necessary defence of the Countrey. And as
touching that <hi>dangerous Papist,</hi> who was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to be with him in his Coach, as <hi>fit to be one
of his Counsell of warre in his Regality,</hi> there can
be no such called to minde, it being very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
that any such had to doe in a businesse of
that nature, and especially at that time; except
he should meane one,<note place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> E. R.</note> a tall man indeede, but
no great Souldier, a stranger to the Bishop,
saving that being lately censured at Durham
in the Commission for Causes Ecclesiasticall,
for private Popish Christnings and Marriages,
he became knowne unto him, and at that very
time had taken a suddaine journey to Awkland
for a mitigation of that censure, wherein he no
wayes prevailed. Yet the Bishop being in the
morning bound for Durham, tooke him into
the Coach, not in a civill respect onely, but to
the same purpose as <hi>Philip</hi> was in the Coach
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93531:9"/>
with the Eunuch, to conferre with him for
soules-sake, as his ordinary practise hath
beene, whensoever he met with any such Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sants.
Which surely ought not to scandalize
any that are Christianly affected. Yet let no
man wonder at this reproach, when in the very
next line he may finde him charging our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
the <hi>Lutheran Ministers in Germany with
joviality and drunkennesse,</hi> (none excepted)
three by disgracefully blasting a great part of
the reformed Church to gratifie our Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the Papists; for excuse whereof the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon</hi>

               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93531:9"/>
the Bishop of Durham did favour the said

               <hi>Answer. These dangerous meetings of most stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Papists,</hi> not onely the Bishop, but all other
his Majesties Officers in that County should
and ought to have suppressed, if any such as
this Intelligencer had discovered and made it
knowne unto them. As for <hi>Popish Baptismes,</hi>
those who came to his Cognisance received
their due punishment one with another, as hath

their <hi>Burials,</hi> if the Bishop doe suffer our

devoted for a Conniver at Papists: but if hee
suffer not the Service to be then used (which is
his constant practise) then is he taxed for a
Transgressor of the Canons. Is not this kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done? But to the point, to allow the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93531:10"/>
the use of our Church-service at their
Burials, were it not, as on the Protestant
part scandalous, so in the estimate of Papists
themselves must it not be utterly ridiculous,
to wit, that that Service should be read at
their Funerals, after they are dead, which
themselves despised, and would not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at whilest they were alive? He proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> It may be that some chiefe Towns
there have beene dens, if he call them so, as
being hidden from the Bishops knowledge,
otherwise such hath beene his strict care and
command to his Officers, that such suspected
Persons have beene sometimes found out, and
without any connivence beene proceeded
with according to Law. And it were strange
indeed, that he, who since his comming to
Durham hath written two bookes against the
Doctrine of the <hi>Romish Masse,</hi> should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse
in suppressing and abolishing of that
Idoll? Which is the lesse credible, because
there was never more preaching in that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese,
then since his comming, and that (God
be blessed) with some happy successe, both in
preserving those that were within the Net, and

all outward meanes are nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

All the answer the Bishop was willing (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
