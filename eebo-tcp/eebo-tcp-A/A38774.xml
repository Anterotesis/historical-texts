            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
JEVVS
NATION.</head>
            <p>BEloved of God, there is no true
Chriſtian, but muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
your Nation of old to be the
People choſen of God, in a ſingular
manner; and that from you we have received
the Oracles of God, and knowledge of our
Salvation: And ſince you have been under
diſſertion, groping in the dark, this 1650, we
that have received the Light which ye refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
becauſe it was ſo determined of God;
I ſay, we now knowing what you look for, and
how it is made manifeſt among us, ought
to lead you by the hand to the Light that
ſhins upon us, through this dark and tempeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Cloud of War, and to bring you to your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65618:4"/>
Meſſiah, whom ye ſeek and deſire to ſee,
though we own no Meſſiah but Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of theſe things made
me by the good hand and providence of God
upon me, (to him be the Glory) when I
ſaw in what manner you deſcribed your
Meſſiah to labour to bring you to him; for at
firſt, when I ſaw that Learned Piece of your
Famous Senator <hi>Manaſſeth Ben-Iſrael,</hi> called,
<hi>The Hope of Iſrael;</hi> an effectual door was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
unto me on your behalf, that I could
not but ſhew as <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in ſeveral Books, who
it was that you called your Meſſiah; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the more I looked into the matter, the
more and more Light God gave me to ſee the
more certainty of his Truth in manifeſting
your Meſſiah; beyond what my Tongue or Pen
could expreſs.</p>
            <p>Therefore being not ſatisfied in what I had
written, I wrote this little book following,
and directed it to <hi>Manaſſeth Ben-Iſrael;</hi> and
when I had got it Tranſlated into Latine and
written fair, I gave it him; and after a ſhort
time the Interpreter that ſpake between us,
went unto him, to know his thoughts upon it;
and he anſwered, <hi>That the time wherein their
Meſſiah ſhould appear was come, but that King</hi>Charles Steeward <hi>was he, that he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
for he could not believe that ever King</hi>Charles <hi>ſhould riſe again and be reſtored to his
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65618:4"/>
Empire;</hi> but ſaid he, Oliver <hi>Protector, or the
King of</hi> Swedland <hi>is more liker to do it then
he, and ſpecially the King of</hi> France <hi>is the moſt
likeſt to be our Meſſiah; If he be a Gentile, and
be in this part of the World; for he had,</hi> as he
ſaid, <hi>a great deal of confidence in the words of an
Ancient French Author, that declares much to
that purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then ſaid I to the Interpreter, <hi>Manaſſeth
Ben-Iſrael</hi> will not believe me; yet tell him
from me, that the Glory of the Protector, and
King of <hi>Swedland</hi> will ſoon vaniſh away:
and concerning the King of <hi>France,</hi> he is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken;
the French King is not the King of
<hi>France,</hi> but Deputy; for the King of <hi>England</hi>
is the King of <hi>France,</hi> it being conquered near
three hundred years ago by King <hi>Edward</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi>
And moreover, tell him that many which
were well-wiſhers to King <hi>Charles</hi> then they
were told of his coming to his <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
anſwered, <hi>That they ſhould<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>ve to ſee it,</hi>
were taken away by death, for a reward of
their unbelief, as Mr. <hi>White</hi> Priſoner at the
Fleet and others have obſerved it, ſo he may
die quickly alſo: But I ſay, he that lives
five years to an end, ſhall ſee King <hi>Charles
Steeward</hi> flouriſh on his Throne to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the World, for God will bring
him in without blood-ſhed.</p>
            <p>But I had no anſwer to theſe laſt words:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65618:5"/>
Therefore finding <hi>Ben-Iſrael</hi> not to believe, I
left him, and purpoſed ſpeedily to direct this
Book to you in general, and put it out in
Print with ſome Addition; being perſwaded
that ſome of your Nation have the Engliſh
Tongue, that are able to Tranſlate it into ſuch
a Language as all may underſtand it.</p>
            <p>The main cauſe why <hi>Manaſſeth Ben-Iſrael</hi>
cannot believe, is becauſe of the low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and the great power of
his Enemies at preſent: What of all that?
doth not he himſelf ſay in the 26. Sect of
his Book, called <hi>The Hope of Iſrael,</hi> That all
your Wiſemen which ſpeaks of your Meſſiah,
ſay, <hi>That he muſt be ſlain, and then riſe again
to be your Captain and Deliverer?</hi> But ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
King <hi>Charles</hi> be ſo low, that he is a dead
man, for ſo he is by the Edicts of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
Cannot God raiſe him again? and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he will do it: For, we have many An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Propheticks; ſaying, which tells us
that a dead King ſhall riſe and do glorious
things: One is this,
<q>
                  <l>When the dead King ſhall ſet on his Crown,</l>
                  <l>then ſhall the World turn upſide down;</l>
                  <l>And <hi>London</hi> in Truth ſhall tremble that day,</l>
                  <l>expecting the words the dead King ſhall ſay:</l>
                  <l>But he ſhall treat them well, that it be a wonder,</l>
                  <l>and ſhall ſettle Truth, Peace and good order.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:65618:5"/>
Anothers this:
<q>When the dead King ſets on his Throne, Grace
ſhall grow to them that walks in his way, then
all men ſhall enjoy the main Reſurrection, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
men of Religion, namely, all men that
have been true; but falſe men will run away to
hide themſelves, being not able to abide the
preſence of him that ſits on the Throne.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And doubtleſs all this is ſpoken of King
<hi>Charles Steeward,</hi> for he conſiſts all of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Love. When he was in <hi>France,</hi>
the people roſe againſt the French King and
his Mother, that they were forced to flee; for
that Nation thought to do as <hi>England</hi> did,
and deſtroy the French King; for they made
great proviſion for War, and had hired the
Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> to come with a great Army
to help them; but King <hi>Charles</hi> ſaved them
by his Wiſdom, for he went to <hi>Lorain,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him to go back again, and went to both
ſides, brought them together and made them
good Friends again: Then the people ſeeing
the great work that he had done, cryed him
up to be the man of God, in ſo much that at
laſt the French King and his Council became
Jealous of him, and they joyned themſelves
with his Enemy, and moſt unnaturally, for he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65618:6"/>
was their near Kinſman, and moſt ungratful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in regard he had ſaved them; they forced
him to go out of <hi>France,</hi> as he was forced to
go out of <hi>England;</hi> and that is in God's Book
of Remembrace, the French ſhall be called
to account for it one day.</p>
            <p>Again, when King <hi>Charles</hi> went to <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and all his Nobles there were Enemies
one to the other; he preſently by his loving
Wiſdom made them all good friends, to the
admiration of the people: So that I may
ſurely ſay there is not ſuch another Peace-maker
in the World, and yet <hi>Manaſſeth
Ben-Iſrael</hi> think this King ſhall not riſe again;
I am ſorry to ſee the hardneſs of his Heart.</p>
            <p>But beloved, take you notice of what I ſay
for a ſign to you, if King <hi>Charles Steeward,</hi>
King of <hi>England,</hi> do not come into his
Throne within this five years, without one
drop of blood ſpilt in the cauſe, believe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of what I ſay in this Book; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſome of thoſe that took upon them to
judge the Old King, this Kings Father, &amp; moſt
cruelly murthered him; and yet will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and come unto the King for mercy,
moſt die for it, the King ſhall not ſave them;
for Law and Juſtice ſhall take place where
mercy is refuſed.</p>
            <p>Now there is no people under Heaven, that
boaſt and ſtand ſo much upon their Sword as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65618:6"/>
theſe States-people of <hi>England</hi> do; yet God will
order it ſo, for King <hi>Charles</hi> his ſake, that their
Sword which they glory in, ſhall fall out of
their hands, and they ſhall not know how nor
which way they loſt it; and God will put it
into the hand of King <hi>Charles,</hi> ſo that all the
world will wonder at the ſtrangneſs of his
Salvation; and they ſhall glorifie God on his
behalf, when they ſee ſuch an excellent thing
done that no age can paralel.</p>
            <p>And when right is done to the King and

State of <hi>Holand</hi> though they be now ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

            <p>Notwithſtanding, the Falſe Envious, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidions,

not quiet but reprocheth the King with
foul Language, becauſe of his former af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65618:7"/>
by which God Refined and fitted
him for future glory, and takes all occaſion
and advantage to do what miſchief they can
to the King and his Subjects: And though
God in that time ſend the Plague among
them for it, ſo that they dye by thouſands at
a time; yet they will not forbear, but ſtill go
on in their malice againſt the King, that God
might utterly deſtroy them, and the Engliſh
Enemies that go to them, by the Sword,
Plague and Famine; and blot out their
Names from being a State under Heaven, for
ſo God will fight againſt all the Enemies of
King <hi>Charles;</hi> and proud <hi>Holand</hi> ſhall be
made the firſt Object of Gods wrath, againſt
them that fight againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe
him: but do you depart from <hi>Holand</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
            <p>Therefore bleſſed and happy ſhall thoſe
Kings and people be that ſhall take their
Power and Authority from King <hi>Charles,</hi> and
live under his protection; for all his proud
Enemies that ſhall deſpiſe him, and refuſe to

God with King <hi>Charles</hi> will do a new work
upon the Earth, and bring all the world unto

            <p>But which way that Redemption ſhall be,
no man can tell, but onely ſo far as we may
gather out of the Prophets; That at that

under the leading of a Prince, whom ſome
Rabbins in the Talmud, and in ſome places of
of the <hi>Caldy</hi> Pharaphraſe, do call Meſſiah the

make mention of Meſſiah, the Son of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim;</hi>
where they ſay, that he ſhall dye in

expound that of <hi>Zech. 12. 10. And they ſhall
look upon me whom they have pierced, and they

and ſhall be Captain of all the Ten
Tribe, who give their Name to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that their firſt King <hi>Ieroboam</hi> was of that
Tribe; not without cauſe do they call him
the Son of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> for he was the true Type
of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in his impriſonment
and future happineſs, add to this that he was
ſo long hid from his Brethren, that they
knew him not, as in like manner the Ten
Tribes are at this day: who are led Captive

That Meſſiah of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſhall die in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail

riſe again, that he may enjoy the Dignity, not
of a Kingly Scepter, but the office only of a

Jew, deſcended from the Loins of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and the Reaſon he gives
for it is, becauſe that their firſt King <hi>Ieroboam</hi>

for they not knowing how to call him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
improperly call him the Son of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi>

<hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 12. 16. and King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> calls the

came out of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> only he
ſuppoſeth, becauſe King <hi>Solomon, made him
Ruler over the houſe of</hi> Joſeph, 1 King. 11. 28.
that argueth no ſuch thing, but rather that he
was of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> for Kings uſe to
prefer their own kin, and put them into pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

both Jew and Gentile. And King <hi>Charles Stee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
tis Gods choſen Veſſel to deliver us all;
and when you obey your King Jeſus Chriſt,
then ſhall you have this preheminencie above
all the Nations in the World; you will have

in the World, as all Chriſtian Kings
confeſs now, and all others muſt do it: And
he that Ruleth you as his Vice Roy, ſhall be
higher then any of them, and ſhall be over
them alſo, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was over all the Nobles
in <hi>Egypt;</hi> they being the Subjects of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, we have had ſixteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

and do obtain Eternal Life by him.</p>
            <p>Oh! do you now receive him from us?
who now tenders Jeſus Chriſt unto you for

happy and obtain Eternal Life by him, and
enjoy your own Land again? for certainly,
there is no other means to ſave you or us but
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65618:10"/>
he. Alas beloved, all other means without
him are vain, for he only is appointed of God
to ſave the World; Prayers, Sacrifices,
Kings, Princes and whatſoever elſe that is or
can be named, will do no good to them that
have not Jeſus Chriſt to appeaſe Gods wrath
againſt them, for the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> and their

manifeſt in the 26 Sect. of your Book,
called <hi>The Hope of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, King <hi>Charles Steeward,</hi> Son to the

you call your Meſſiah Captain and Deliverer,
who will bring you to preſent happineſs, if you

againſt God, and their Meſſiah appointed of
God for them; and therefore if they come,
they ſhall in a ſhort time be ſpoiled and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I that tell you theſe things am a man
that have had the Spirit of Propheſie this
twenty four years, and I have declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
twenty two years agone; all the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that came ſince upon this Nation, as

then I was a Priſoner three years upon that

my Book, called <hi>A voice from Heaven,</hi> and my
Book called the <hi>Eccho to the Voice from
Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I tell you that King <hi>Charles Steeward</hi>
by deſcent, as his Star did manifeſt, is the
firſt Born of <hi>Iaphet</hi> the Elder Son of <hi>Noah,
Gene.</hi> 10. 21. And therefore the ſaid
King <hi>Charles</hi> by right is Heir to all the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65618:12"/>
World: And God will give him and his Seed-Royal
in due Seaſon the preheminence of it:
And all the Jews ſhall be converted unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 56. and be an eminent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
(under him and his Seed-Royal) in places
of preferment, and in your own Land Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.
Thus much I ſee from the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
and Viſions.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, How can King <hi>Charles</hi> be
the ſaid Meſſiah, ſeeing our Wiſemen ſay
that he muſt be the Son of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and come
of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and that he muſt
die in the laſt War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and
afterward riſe again for to enjoy the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of a Vice Roy, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I anſwer, that the two Meſſiahs are ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
in them <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Iaphet,</hi> becauſe they
were to come out of their Loyns; Jeſus of
<hi>Shem</hi> and of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David; Charles</hi>
of <hi>Iapeht,</hi> and by adoption in Jeſus: Of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and <hi>Ephraim</hi> or by imputation, and not
by a carnal Generation; becauſe <hi>Iaphet</hi> the
Elder was to come firſt into the Tent of
<hi>Shem,</hi> and ſo to be exalted by that voluntary
Act of condeſcending, and giving the honour
to his Brother <hi>Shem,</hi> according to the will
of his Father. Therefore the ſaying of <hi>Noah</hi>
to his ſons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 25, 26, 27. is the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65618:13"/>
Ground-work of all that is ſpoken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Meſſiah; and from that Ground did
all the Prophets Propheſie of the Meſſiahs;
yet there was ground given to <hi>Noah</hi> for his
ſaying to his Sons, From the Beginning
<hi>Cain</hi> ſhould have had condeſcended to <hi>Abel;</hi>
for God ordained it then that the Elder in
love and reſpect ſhould ſerve the Younger;
for God had reſpect to <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould
have had reſpect unto him for that cauſe,
and not to have hated him and ſlain him
for it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay King <hi>Charles</hi> is called the Son of
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> not that he cometh out of his Loyns,
but becauſe he is like unto him; for as <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
was beloved of his Father above all his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren,
in ſo much that he made him a
Coat of Honour, as Kings Children had
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 18. It being of divers colours like
a Kings Parliament Robe; for which cauſe
he was hated of his Bretheren, and becauſe of
his faithfulneſs to his Father and his Viſions,
they hated him yet more, and ſold him
away to the <hi>Iſhmalits Gen.</hi> 37. So in like-manner
becauſe King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of God his Father, and honoured above
all his Scots Bretheren; they hated him, and
becauſe of his Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs and Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of God they hated him yet more, and ſold
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65618:13"/>
him away to the Engliſh Parliament Marchants:
And as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was long in affliction before he
was exalted, <hi>Gen. 39. Gen.</hi> 40. So King <hi>Charles</hi>
ſuffered much for a long time, being impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and at laſt ſlain, and he ſhall be likewiſe
exalted by his Reſurrection in the King
<hi>Charles</hi> his Son, both in perſon and power,
as he ſaith (in the concluſion of his laſt ſpeech
to his Son in his book) <hi>Let my Memory with
my Name ever live in you,</hi> for the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that God would raiſe him up again in
his Son.</p>
            <p>And as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> being a Stranger in <hi>Egypt,</hi> yet
was he exalted above all the <hi>Egyptians</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> there King, who adopted him
and gave him that power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41. So King
<hi>Charles</hi> being a Stranger by Nation, and
not a Jew, ſhall be exalted above all the
Jews, except Jeſus the King, who doth adopte
him, and give him that power; In theſe things
King <hi>Charles</hi> is like <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by an Allegory he may be called his
Son.</p>
            <p>Thus he is alſo an <hi>Eprathite.</hi> I have all
wayes found that <hi>England</hi> in Scripture is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
to us by Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
in <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 45. is called the glorious
holy Mountain between the Seas. And that
the Propheſie of <hi>Hoſea</hi> which ſpeaks much
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65618:14"/>
of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> is very much fulfilled among us
now, for <hi>England</hi> feeded one Winde, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
after the Eaſt Winde, which hath bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the glory of our Church and Kingdom,
and made it deſolate, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12. 1. For fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the Winde-breath and lyes of Sectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries
coming from <hi>New England, Holand,</hi> and
other places Eaſt from us, hath ſpoiled the
glory of our Nation: And much more I
could ſhew to prove that <hi>England</hi> in Scripture
is ſignified by Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and ſpecially
is that <hi>Ephratah</hi> ſpoken of by <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 132.
5. 6. and by <hi>Micah.</hi> 5. 2. From whence your
Meſſiah comes, for the preſent King <hi>Charles
Steeward</hi> is an Engliſh man born, but an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrathite</hi>
born in Mount <hi>Ephraim</hi> by Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
account. And I finde that there was in
the Country of <hi>Iſrael</hi> two ſorts of <hi>Ephrathies:</hi>
Firſt, the Seed of <hi>Levi</hi> born in the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
were called <hi>Ephrathites 1 Sam.</hi> 1. 1. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
they that were of the Seed of <hi>Caleb,</hi> by

called <hi>Ephrathites, Ruth</hi> 1. 2. And theſe laſt
<hi>Ephrathites</hi> did much ſignifie the Engliſh;
for <hi>Ephratah,</hi> who was joyn'd to <hi>Caleb</hi> of the
Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> was an obſcure woman whoſe
kindred is not known, which woman ſignifies
a ſtrange Land that ſhould bring forth light
to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which woman is firſt called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrah,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:65618:14"/>
that is a Mother 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 19. and then
after that is called <hi>Epratah, 1 Chorn.</hi> 2. 24. 50. 1
<hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 4. that is Mother of many Nations, as
<hi>Abraham</hi> was firſt called <hi>Abram,</hi> that is a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then afterwards called <hi>Abraham,</hi> that
is a Father of many Nations, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5. yet it is
more then probable that this woman called
<hi>Ephratah</hi> was a Gentile, becauſe the place
from whence her Name is derived, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.
16. 19. was called <hi>Ephrah</hi> by the Ancient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitance
of the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> I mean
ſome Holy Ones, ſuch as <hi>Melchizedek</hi> and
the like, elſe the Name <hi>Ephratah</hi> had not
been of ſuch eſteem in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as we ſee <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
and <hi>Micah</hi> laies it for a Ground-work,
and as <hi>David</hi> enquiring for the Habitation of
the Mighty God of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which God of
<hi>Iacob</hi> ſignifieth the ſecond Meſſiah, by your
term, or the third perſon as we tearm it, ſaith
he, <hi>Pſ. 132. 6. Lo, we have heard of it at</hi> Ephrata<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <hi>we found it in the Fields of the Wood:</hi> Giving us
to underſtand that this place of your Meſſiah's
Birth was as hard to be found, as it is for a
ſtranger to finde a Houſe that is in the midſt
of a great Wood. Therefore if you ask our
now Engliſh Miniſters, why the Prophet
<hi>Micah.</hi> 5. 2. calls it <hi>Bethelem Ephratah?</hi>
And the Evangeliſts coating the ſame Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<hi>Mathew</hi> 2. 6. calls it <hi>Bethelem</hi> in the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65618:15"/>
Land of <hi>Iuda,</hi> they cannot anſwer you; but
the Reaſon why the Evangeliſts doth not
mention <hi>Ephratah,</hi> is becauſe that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
theſe things in part, that I now mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
unto you; namely, that there ſhould
come another great One (for your delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance)
out of ſome Country ſignified to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt and his Apoſtles, by that ſame wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
called <hi>Ephratah.</hi> And in this ſence
your Wiſemen call your Meſſiah an <hi>Epra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite,</hi>
and not that he muſt come out of the
Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> Loynally, as you ſuppoſe
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> did.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That this late War of <hi>England,</hi> in which
War King <hi>Charles</hi> the firſt died; which War
is not yet ended, nor will not end in <hi>England</hi>
is the laſt War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> may be
eaſily proved, for this Land, as our Engliſh
Chronicles report of old, until the Btittains
Conquered it, was <hi>Gogmagogs</hi> Land: As

<hi>Guild</hi>-Hall, you may ſee the very Picture of
<hi>Gogmagog,</hi> and <hi>Brittainus</hi> that ſlew him, in

how he died in the laſt War of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog,</hi>
and how he is to riſe again in his Son, to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:65618:15"/>
be according to his Name, a Steeward or a
Vice Roy under Jeſus, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was under

that remained in this Land, roſe up againſt
their King, ſold him and ſlew him, to fulfil
the Scripture: But he ſhall riſe again accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great alſo born in this

            <p n="5">5. You may know King <hi>Charles Steeward</hi>
to be the man that you look for, or your Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,

though indeed Jeſus is the moſt

you ſay againſt King <hi>Charles</hi> the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

of above three hundred Kings who
were his Fore-fathers in <hi>Scotland;</hi>
The <hi>Turk</hi> and all the Kings in the
World for Antiquity are but youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Brothers in compariſon of him,
for the firſt King of <hi>Scotland</hi> was
<hi>Gathelus Fergus</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Iaphet,</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:65618:17"/>
the Succeſſor of <hi>Melchizedek,</hi> which
<hi>Gathelus Fergus</hi> Married <hi>Scota,</hi> the
Daughter of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> that took <hi>Moſes</hi>
for her Son: and when the Plagues was
in <hi>Egypt,</hi> fearing leaſt thoſe Countries
(becauſe of their wickedneſs) ſhould
have been deſtroyed as <hi>Sodam</hi> was, <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus
Fergus</hi> and <hi>Scota</hi> withal their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
came away to Sea; and brought
with them from <hi>Bethel</hi> the very ſtone
which was <hi>Iacobs</hi> Pillow there, <hi>Gen.</hi>
28. 18, 22, and the firſt place they lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
at was <hi>Portugal:</hi> thence they came
to the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> and built a
City, calling it after the Kings Name
<hi>Knockfergus;</hi> and from thence they
came to <hi>Scotland,</hi> which they ſo Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from <hi>Scota</hi> the Queen: And
there they are, though many times
brought low, as now they are, yet an
unconquered people to this day: And
of the ſtone of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which they
brought from <hi>Bethel</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> they
made of it a Chair, in which Chair
of old they were wont to Crown their
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:65618:17"/>
Kings, but ſome hundred years agone
the Engliſh got the ſaid ſtone Chair
from them, and brought it to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
which ſtone now is to be ſeen for
a Monument in <hi>Weſtminſter Abby;</hi> I
have ſeen it my ſelf, and there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie
of it runs thus.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſhall have that Land as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Ground,</l>
               <l>If words fail not, whereſoever this Stone is
found.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And we have ſeen it partly ſo fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
for ſince King <hi>Iames</hi> came to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the <hi>Scots</hi> had <hi>England</hi> as their
own Native Land: And what beauty
every way elſe can be deſired, but is to
be found in this King, for his Wiſdom,
Godlyneſs and Valour? there is none
like him, wherefore the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
ſaid of him to the Jews, when by the
ſpirit he ſaw his glory <hi>Iſai. 33. 17. Thine
eyes ſhall ſee the King in his beauty: they
ſhall behold the Land that is very far off:</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65618:18"/>
giving you to underſtand that the King
was full of beauty, yet that the Land
of his Nativity even <hi>England</hi> was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
far from <hi>Iuda,</hi> as he ſaith again, <hi>Iſa.</hi>
30. 27. <hi>Behold the Name of the Lord
cometh from far:</hi> ſo here in alſo it is plain
that your Meſſiah was not to be a Jew,
becauſe no Jew now can deſcend of
ſuch a Noble Linage as King <hi>Charles</hi>
came from, for the Jews have been a
curſed ever in ſlavery and miſery, ſince
they cruſified the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:
and it will never be otherwayes with
them, until they confeſs him to be the
Son of God, and the onely saviour of
the world. Then ſhall the Jews have
the Glory among all Nations, as it is
written, <hi>Zech.</hi> 10. 23. ten men out of
all Languages of the Nations ſhall take
hold of him that is a Jew, ſaying, we
will go with you, for we have heard
that God is with you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. You may know King <hi>Charles
Steeward</hi> to be your Meſſiah, by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
we have a Maxime in our Engliſh
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65618:18"/>
Law, that ſaith, <hi>The King of</hi> England
<hi>never erreth nor never dieth:</hi> Which
if our Engliſh Lawyers that affirm
it, did but underſtand what they ſay,
and whereof they affirm or did appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the meaning of the firſt Authors
of the ſaid Maxime, they might
know that ſuch a Perogative as not to
ſin or to die, is a Perogative that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to Chriſt only: Therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
that our Anceſtors did believe
that Jeſus Chriſt lived in the Engliſh
King, and that he would appear in
him, as now he doth appear in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of King <hi>Charles Steeward</hi> for your
Converſion and Deliverance.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And this alſo to me is a ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that Chriſt did appear in the
ſaid King, the ſame day that the King
ſuffered, it being the 30 of <hi>Ianuary,</hi>
1648. was by the providence of God,
and appointed of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in the Callender, the relation of
Chriſt's Sufferings appointed to be
Read; as yet you that doubt may ſee it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65618:19"/>
is ſo ſet down; whereby God did
by the ſaid providence aſſure us, that
the ſame Tragedy which once was act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by the Jews on the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Jeſus, was now Re-acted at
<hi>London</hi> on the body of his Servant
<hi>Charles:</hi> So that in like manner the Son
of God here ſuffered afreſh, and was
put to an open ſhame by his Enemies,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 6. and this it was before the King
ſuffered, that morning, <hi>Ian.</hi> 30. Doctor
<hi>Iudgſon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> Read Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Prayer to him, and the Chapters
appointed for that day Morning;
the firſt being the ſeventh of <hi>Exodus,</hi>
which is very remarkable alſo, for as
in <hi>Egypt</hi> on that day, the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<hi>Moſes</hi> to be a God to <hi>Pharaoh:</hi>
So on this day in <hi>England,</hi> by the ſame
word the Lord pronounced <hi>Charles</hi> a
God to ſtand againſt all the hard
hearted <hi>Pharaohs</hi> in the World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was like <hi>Moſes</hi> in faithfulneſs
and meekneſs, <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 3. 7. yea and
in ſlowneſs of ſpeech too, for the King
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65618:19"/>
had his ſtamering, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4. 10. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Chapter was, <hi>Math.</hi> 27. and it is
the Relation of Chriſts Sufferings;
the King thought that the Biſhop read
it of purpoſe, whereupon the King ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him why he read that ſame Chapter?
ſaid he, becauſe it is the ſame that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for this morning, and when the
King found it ſo in the Calender, he
was overjoyed with it, becauſe by that
he ſaw that he ſhould be like his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
raiſed again to Life and Glory
Immortal.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I ſay it is needful for you to read
the Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, for
therein you ſhall finde your Meſſiah
moſt perfectly ſet forth, where ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he is called the Comforter,
the Spirit of Truth, the holy Ghoſt,
the Deliverer, the more ſure Word,
<hi>Iohn 14. 16, 17, 26. Iohn 16. 7, 8, 9, 10,
11, 12, 13, 14. Math. 12. 31, 32. Rom.
11. 25, 26. 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 19. and ſometimes
the Lord the Lamb or the like Titles,
1 <hi>Corin. 4. 5. Revel.</hi> 14. 1. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:65618:20"/>
more places I could ſhew
you in the New Teſtament that ſets
him ſorth, which now I omit for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
ſake; Beſides, you ſhall finde
there that you Jews are to have the
preheminence with him, for there are
a hundred forty and four thouſand
Jews ſealed for him, twelve thouſand
of every Tribe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8. and ſee that the ſame number of
Jews ſtand up with him upon Mount
<hi>Sion</hi> to war againſt the wicked, and to
overcome them, <hi>Revel. 14. 1. Revel.</hi> 17.
14. and in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. you may ſee the
Birth of your Meſſiah; who ſhall
Rule all Nations with a Rod of Iron;
and ſee how the Wicked perſecutes
his Mother, and would fain devour the
Child, but he is taken into the Throne
of God, ſo that he is out of the wicked
Dragons reach: ſome ſilly <hi>Zealots</hi> will
tell you that this Child is Jeſus Chriſt,
but you may ſay, No, for Jeſus Chriſt
himſelf ſaith, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 27, 28. That he
will give this power over Nations, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65618:20"/>
ſome other faithful perſons, now manit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſted
to be <hi>Charles Steeward,</hi> and tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he
will give him the morning Star; and
to what end ſhould Jeſus give him the
morning Star? but to teſtifie at his
Birth that <hi>Charles Steeward</hi> is the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
of God, who ſhall Rule all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with a Rod of Iron, and Jeſus
calls him his Son, who ſhall Inherit
all things, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 7. as it is Written
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 7. 8. 9. ſaying to him, <hi>Ask of me,
and I ſhall give thee the Heathen for thine
Inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the
Earth for thy poſſeſſion. Thou ſhalt break
them with a Rod of Iron, thou ſhalt daſh
them in pieces like a potters Veſſel.</hi> Now
this promiſe of Ruling over Nations
and of having the morning Star, was
obtained by the firſt <hi>Charles</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
on which the promiſe are groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
is this <hi>Revel. 2. 26, 27, 28. He that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercometh
and keepeth my works to the end,
to him will I give Power over the Nations.
And he ſhall Rule them with a Rod of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;
as the Veſſels of a Potter ſhall they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65618:21"/>
be broken to ſhivers, even as I received of
my Father. And I will give him the
Morning Star.</hi> And King <hi>Charles</hi> the
firſt is he that overcame all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of Gods Truth, who by his
death kept up Gods True VVorſhip,
and ſealed it with his blood, and ſo
obtained the promiſe for himſelf and
his Seed for ever.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And though the preſeut King
<hi>Charles Steeward</hi> be thus dignified; yet
do not you think that ever he will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
himſelf to be your Meſſiah,
for his Humility and Zeal, for the
Lord Jeſus ſhall be ſuch, that he will
not take upon him ſuch a Title as to be
called the Meſſiah. For as <hi>Iohn</hi> the
<hi>Baptiſt</hi> was ſo humble, that he would
not acknowledge himſelf to be <hi>Eliah
Iohn</hi> 1. 14. Though Jeſus Chriſt ſaith
that he was the very <hi>Eliah, Math.</hi> 11.
14. So in like manner King <hi>Charles</hi>
will be ſo humble as not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
himſelf to be your Meſſiah;
though you ſee it now manifeſted that
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65618:21"/>
he is your Meſſiah, asye call him; yet
our VViſemen and Prophets that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
him, and did propheſie of him;
durſt not call him the Meſſiah, leaſt
thereby they ſhould offend God; but
they called him by ſeveral other
names, as ſometimes the <hi>Lyon of the
North,</hi> Or the <hi>Great King of the North,
Pſal. 48. 1, 2. The dead King riſen,</hi> or the
like names; and under ſuch names will
he go and do the work of God for your
Deliverance, and under ſuch notion
ſhall he prevail againſt all that oppoſe
him until all be brought in due ſeaſon
under his Scepter: Beſides, I ſay all
theſe late tranſactions in <hi>England</hi> came
to paſs only for your ſake: God now
being mindful of his promiſe to your
Nation, for there was no other cauſe
why the people of theſe Lands ſhould
riſe againſt their King and prevail as
they did, no people under Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a better condition then they
were when this war began, but that
ſome holy Ones here had prayed for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65618:22"/>
your converſion, and God granted their
requeſt, and ſtirred up cruel Ones
to bring theſe things about to effect
it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. I ſay that you Jews ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come rightly to underſtand the
Scripture, and reconcile them, until
you come to acknowledge your King
Jeſus Chriſt to be the only Meſſiah, and
no other, for the Scripture ſpeaks but of
one Meſſiah: neither ſhall the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
ever come to underſtand them
right and reconcile them, until they
come to acknowledge Chriſt Jeſus ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

                  <p>but miſtake me not, for though the day of Iudgement in ſome places is ſaid to be as a lightning a moment, a twinckling of an eye for ſhortneſs <hi>Mat. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 27. 1 Co<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and that his people ſhall willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, <hi>Pſal. 110. 1, 2. Iſai. 33. 13.
Iſai.</hi> 63. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. And this is the
cauſe why men cannot agree about
their Meſſiah. The Jews will have
him only to be a Glorious Victorious
Warlike King: The Chriſtians will
have him only to be a poor man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65618:23"/>
any worldly pomp at all, but
they ſhould look on him as he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
firſt in Jeſus, and after in <hi>Charles:</hi>
Then their expectation on both ſides
will be anſwered, and take notice
what the Spouſe ſaith of him, <hi>Song.</hi> 5.
11. <hi>His Head is as the moſt fine Gold,
that is Ieſus;</hi> His Locks buſſie and
black as a Raven, that is <hi>Charles:</hi> Lo
here are two men diſcribed, one with
Yealow Hair like Gold, another with
Hair as black as a Raven; yet in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
number, becauſe of the Union that
is between them: And therefore I ſay
again to you, becauſe the Meſſiah in
ſome places of Scripture is ſaid to be
a poor deſpiſed perſon which none re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards;
and in other places he is ſaid
to be a moſt glorious perſon: This is the
Reaſon why men vary and differ in
their Judgements concerning the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah,
which Meſſiah was to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted
in his firſt and ſecond coming by
two perſons, yet both of them by the
Scripture ſo interwoven together, as if
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:65618:23"/>
they were but one man, wherefore few
as yet underſtand a right the Myſtery
of the Meſſiah. Moreover, I ſay when
men come to conſider what manner of
beginning and being Jeſus Chriſt had
in the world, comparing it with the
Scripture; and to conſider what
manner of beginning and being <hi>Charles</hi>
hath alſo in the World, comparing it
with the Scripture, confeſſing them
both.</p>
            <p>Then men ſhall underſtand the
Truth, and finde the Myſtery opening
it ſelf to them.</p>
            <p>Then ſhall the Jews and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
agree, for their is but a little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:
Now the Jews look for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Meſſiah; the Chriſtians
look for Chriſts ſecond coming: both
in ſubſtance is the ſelf ſame thing, yet
the danger ſtands in a miſtake of the
perſon, and the manner of his coming:
The Vulgar Chriſtians (and not the
Learned, who know it to be a Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry)
look for Jeſus to appear in a ſtrange
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65618:24"/>
manner, yet in that ſame body of fleſh
which ſuffered on the Croſs; though
himſelf and St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells them plainly
that they ſhould not ſee him, nor know
him no more in that body, <hi>Iohn 16. 10.
Corin.</hi> 5. 16. But he appears in <hi>Charles</hi>
according to the manner that you Jews
look for him: Embrace him and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, for they that refuſe him
now, ſhall be miſerable for ever and
ever.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I ſay that by conſidering theſe
things you ſhall come to underſtand
the Truth, and ſee the promiſe of God
fulfilled unto you in this point; but
take heed leaſt you be deceived in that
you believe, that your <hi>Meſſiah</hi> muſt
needs be a Jew, and come Loynally
out of <hi>Ephraim;</hi> becauſe as you ſay
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> the firſt King of the Ten
Tribes came of <hi>Ephraim;</hi> for I tell you
<hi>Ieroboam</hi> was none of that Tribe, but he
rather came of the Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> or of
the Tribe of <hi>Levi;</hi> for if <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had
come of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> he had been called
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:65618:24"/>
an <hi>Ephraimite,</hi> as you ſee <hi>Ioſhua 16. 10.
Iudges</hi> 12. 5. 6. Thoſe of the Tribe of
<hi>Ephraim</hi> are called <hi>Ephraimites;</hi> and <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>
is ſaid to be an <hi>Ephrathite, 1
Kings</hi> 11. 26. and not an <hi>Ephraimite;</hi>
and ſo as I ſaid before, the Seed of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
are called <hi>Ephrathites, Ruth.</hi> 1. 1. 2.
Yea, <hi>David</hi> himſelf is called the Son
of that <hi>Ephrathite, 1 Sam.</hi> 17. 12. And
<hi>Elkanah</hi> is called an <hi>Ephrathite,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was born in Mount <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. 1. yet he was of the Tribe of
<hi>Levi, 1 Chro.</hi> 6. 27, 28. none of the
Seed of <hi>Ephraim</hi> are called <hi>Ephrathites;</hi>
and for the place from whence <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
is ſaid to come, called <hi>Zereda;</hi> who
can tell where it was? if it be not the
City of the <hi>Zareathites,</hi> who were of the
Tribe of <hi>Iuda,</hi> and of the Seed of <hi>Caleb</hi>
by <hi>Ephratah, 1 Chron.</hi> 2. 50, 53. or
from whence <hi>Nebat</hi> and <hi>Zeruah Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
Parents came, except they came
from thence, and being alſo the Seed
of the Woman <hi>Epbratah, 1 Chron.</hi> 1. 50.
came to be called <hi>Eprathites:</hi> who can
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:65618:25"/>
tell whence they were, except they
came from <hi>Iuda?</hi> for we reed no more
of them but what we read in 1 <hi>Kings</hi>
11. 26. Yet you will ask me, how
comes <hi>David</hi> to be called the Son of
that <hi>Ephrathite,</hi> ſeeing he came not
properly of the woman <hi>Ephratah,</hi> 1
<hi>Sam. 17. 12. 1 Chron.</hi> 2. 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, <hi>David</hi> came to be called
the ſon of that <hi>Ephrathite</hi> from <hi>Boaz,</hi>
Marrying of <hi>Ruth</hi> the Wife of <hi>Malhon</hi>
the <hi>Ephrathite, Ruth</hi> 1. 1, 2. to raiſe up
his name (as he was an <hi>Ephrathite</hi>)
upon his Inheritance; ſo that <hi>Obed<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſſe</hi>
and <hi>David</hi> are ſons of that <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite</hi>
by imputation; for the bleſſing
was conferd upon <hi>Boaz,</hi> becauſe of his
kindneſs to the dead, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. but their
was a nearer Kinſman to <hi>Malhon</hi> that
refuſed to take <hi>Ruth</hi> and do it, <hi>Ruth</hi> 3.
12. And who can tell but that <hi>Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
came from that unworthy name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
Kinſman of <hi>Malhon,</hi> for it is
clear that he came not from <hi>Ephraim?</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65618:25"/>
And ſince the Scripture is ſo ſilent in
his Pedegree, if a man had a minde to
be contentious, he might hold an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that King <hi>Charles</hi> came of the
Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi> as much as <hi>Ieroboam</hi>
did by a Female line: For in old time
many Noble Chriſtian Families of
Jews came and dwelt in this Land,
whoſe Seed though obſcure, are among
us to this day, but it is uncertain, and I
ſhall not ſtand to maintain it; It is the
fault of every one, he would ingroſs all
to himſelf, his Neighbour ſhould have
nothing by his good will. The Jew
would have all the preheminence to
himſelf: The Gentile having Jeſus
and all things with him, would have
the Jews to have no ſnare with him;
but God is the Diſpoſer of all theſe
things; you Jews would have both
Meſſiah to come Loynally from your
Nation, not conſidering that God by
<hi>Noah</hi> from the beginning made the ſame
promiſe to <hi>Iaphet</hi> as he made to <hi>Shem,
Gen.</hi> 9. 26, 27. ſo that the one Meſſiah
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65618:26"/>
comes from <hi>Shem,</hi> and the other from
<hi>Iaphet;</hi> this is Gods Decree, and the
Root of the Hiſtory, and God who
hath fulfilled it in part, will have it ſo
perfectly fulfilled, though men do
what they can againſt it: Therefore
deceive not your ſelves, by expecting an
<hi>Ephraimite</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Ephraim</hi> Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to come and be your Meſſiah, for
if <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had been an <hi>Ephraimite,</hi> yet it
doth not follow that your Meſſiah muſt
needs come of that Tribe alſo; but your
Converſion myſtically, yet clear to me,
is ſet out and ſignifyed in <hi>Abraham</hi>
ſending of his ſervant to take a wife
for his ſon <hi>Iacob, Gen.</hi> 24. where you
are firſt to obſerve that by <hi>Abraham</hi> is
ſignified God the Father, by <hi>Iſaac</hi> is
ſignifyed Jeſus Chriſt, by the ſervant
is ſignified <hi>Charles Steeward,</hi> and by
the wiſe <hi>Rebeckah</hi> is ſignifyed you
Jews: Obſerve it thus again, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
is the Father of the Faithful,
that <hi>Iſaac</hi> is the promiſed Son, and that
in <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Seed (or <hi>Rebeckah</hi>) is called,

your Call and Converſion to Jeſus

that Ruled all he had: and a Gentile
of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> by which ſending of this
Steeward, <hi>Gen. 24. 2, 3, 4. Gen.</hi> 15. 2, 3.
is ſignified God ſending of <hi>Charles
Steeward</hi> to call you and bring you
to Jeſus Chriſt, as the other brought
<hi>Rebeckah</hi> to <hi>Iſaac.</hi> Now by this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem

of your Converſion to God in
Jeſus Chriſt, and that you ſhall be

Therefore him whom you call the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah
