            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Went sneaking and santring all over the Hall;</l>
               <l>And to speak for his goodness was very unwilling,</l>
               <l>Since the Cloths on his back were but all worth <hi>Six Shilling.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Tho he took it in dudgeon, and thought it was hard,</l>
               <l>To be pinch'd and abus'd by th' <hi>Yeomen o' th' Guard.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Which so often was done that a Quarrel arose,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Bacchus</hi> himself did i' th' fray interpose.</l>
               <l>But how angry he was when his Godship did hear,</l>
               <l>That the Quarrel was only 'bout paltry <hi>Small Beer,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>So before for himself he could make his report,</l>
               <l>He was threatned a Pumping, and kickt out of Court.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then the <hi>Coffee-house Liquors</hi> began for to swarm,</l>
               <l>And came up to Bar, some cold, and some warm.</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Says</hi> Bacchus, how happen'd it that in these doors,</l>
               <l>Came this Crew of <hi>half sober, half drunk</hi> Sons of Whores?</l>
               <l>But since they are here let 'em make their report,</l>
               <l>For perhaps it may give some diversion to th' Court.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then touching his <hi>Turbant</hi> by way of Respect,</l>
               <l>Stood up <hi>Coffee,</hi> and spoke to this kind of effect;</l>
               <l>That when men overheated by <hi>Wine</hi> and Debauches</l>
               <l>Had gotten their Loads, and were drunker than Roaches,</l>
               <l>By his pow'r they their sence would recover again,</l>
               <l>And no longer be Brutes, but approve themselves Men.</l>
               <l>Why then Mr. <hi>Coffee,</hi> in true sober sadness,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Says</hi> Bacchus, you think that all drinking is madness;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:55903:11"/>
But I know and am sure, when men part with their Reason,</l>
               <l>Tho Nonsence they talk, yet they never think Treason;</l>
               <l>But in drinking of thee, Men too oft frame a Plot,</l>
               <l>Which costs them their Necksâ€”so be silent you Sot.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The next that attempted to put in his Plea,</l>
               <l>Was a Drink much admir'd by the Ladies, call'd <hi>Tea.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But the Court plainly saw how he trifled and fool'd,</l>
               <l>So without much debate was his Plea over-rul'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then up to the Bar with a Countenance bold,</l>
               <l>Came another Tea Liquor by Moderns call'd <hi>Cold,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But <hi>Bacchus</hi> soon found by acquaintance with Spirits,</l>
               <l>He lately had lost very much of his merits.</l>
               <l>For a Man would soon find should he walk the Town round,</l>
               <l>Good Brandy, like Honesty, hard to be found.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Then the</hi> Ladies <hi>and</hi> Sparks <hi>admir'd Drink</hi> Chocolate,</l>
               <l>In words very modish began a short prate.</l>
               <l>How he cherisht the Spirits, and tickled the Blood,</l>
               <l>And to make the Back strong was undoubtedly good.</l>
               <l>Hah! says Bacchus, what Pimp of a Liquor is this?</l>
               <l>With the Cherish and Tickle you may if you please,</l>
               <l>Be to Streets of <hi>St. Albans,</hi> and <hi>Bridget</hi> be jogging,</l>
               <l>For if longer you stay have a care of a flogging.</l>
               <l>He is only my Fav'rite, and true <hi>Bully Rock,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>When he hugs a <hi>Half Flask,</hi> crys a <hi>Fig for the Smock,</hi>
               </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Rosa Solis</hi> spoke next, but he quickly gave o're,</l>
               <l>By <hi>Bacchus</hi> struck dumb for a Son of a Whore.</l>
