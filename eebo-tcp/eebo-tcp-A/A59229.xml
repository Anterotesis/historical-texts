            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">1. YOur Friend Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who, I thank him, professes a great deal of <hi>real kindness</hi> for mee, tells your self in the beginning of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> that <hi>your performances</hi> in your Book <hi>have been so clear and satisfactory, that hee hopes Mr. S. in stead of another Letter of directions to his Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, will write you one of Thanks, for the Reason and Kindness you have shew'd him throughout your Book.</hi> I hate to be ungratefull, and have that <hi>reall kindness</hi> for him and your self too as not to suffer your hopes to be defeated. My Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Gratitude hee concieves to spring from a twofold Head; the <hi>Reason</hi> and the <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> you have shown mee. The former of which is to be examin'd by reducing the respective parts of your Discourse to Grounds or Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; which I shall do when it shall please God to give me leasure and health to answer your Book; and I promise you faithfully to own as much Reason in it as <hi>these</hi> will allow mee: I fear you may dislike the verdict of Principles and think them <hi>discourteous</hi> because of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible genius, and <hi>self-confident</hi> too, because they love naturally to express themselves with an Assuredness, and are oft so bold as (uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Sceptical humour of others) to talk of those bug bears to Fancy, <hi>Evidence</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:50748:3"/>
               <hi>Demonstration;</hi> But be assur'd, Sir, though they are not altogether so good-natur'd nor bashfull as your timorous quivering Probabilities, which you phrase <hi>modest,</hi> yet they are very <hi>just</hi> and <hi>honest;</hi> and, as they cannot flatter you, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they injure you in the least. My other Obligation to Gratitude is <hi>the Kindness</hi> you <hi>have shew'd me;</hi> and, as Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> sayes very truly, <hi>throughout your Book,</hi> which it were a Sin to deny. For I know no greater <hi>Kindness</hi> from one that opposes me than to write in such a manner as to put himself upon the greatest Disadvantages imaginable to give me so many Advantages against him and his Cause. Nor am I to expect your Intention should go along with your Favours; 'tis abundant Kindness in an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary that by his means I enjoy the <hi>reality</hi> of the Benefit; and this I have receiv'd from you, never to bee forgotten but with Ingratitude. As oft as you omit what's important, mistake either voluntarily or weakly, triumph causlesly, injure me undeservedly, cavill groundlesly, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate from the business purposely, revile bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly, jeer sillily; or falsify and pervert my meaning or words palpably; so many <hi>reall Kindnesses</hi> you conferr upon your poor Servant, of which in this Letter of mine both to your self and the world I here make my hearty Profession and Acknowledgment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And first I am to give you very humble <hi>thanks</hi> for totally waving to take notice of my
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:50748:3"/>
Letter to my Answerer. The whole scope of it was to request you would hold to a Method which was evidently <hi>Conclusive;</hi> that you would begin with some <hi>First Principles,</hi> and vouch them to bee, as First Principles should bee, <hi>self-evident;</hi> That (as all Art and Common Sence gives it) you would not produce any Thing against Tradition till you show it depends not on Tradition for its Certainty; that you would either confess your Testimonies unapt to Certify, or declare in what their virtue of Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying consists, which must needs either show them feeble if they be such; or, if otherwise, enforce and strengthen them: That you would uphold your Arguments <hi>satisfactory,</hi> that is, able to subdue the Understanding to Assent, and show us how they come by that virtue; with diverse other <hi>Requests,</hi> not <hi>Prescriptions</hi> as you call them, onely tending to make a short End of Controversy by bringing Truth quickly to a clearing by the way of Principles. Now, who sees not that I had oblig'd my self to the same se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Laws of Concluding, by proposing them to you; and so, had you had any Principles wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be call'd such, or the confidence in your Cause to venture upon any Conclusive method, you had gain'd a notable advantage against me in laying hold of that method and obliging me to stand to it, because I was the Proposer of it. At least you might have pleas'd to have shown my Way Inconclusive, and substituted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50748:4"/>
and establish't a better, in case you had thought any Evident or Conclusive method your Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. But 'tis a manifest signe you judg'd any rigorous way of Concluding unsutable to your Causes and your own Interest; and that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue still on Foot Inconclusive &amp; endlesly-talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wayes of Discourse, (as is yours, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in being able to say a great many pretty plausible any-things to every thing) was more proportion'd and advantageous to your mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, modest, courteous and probable Faith; which is (I dare say for it) far from that Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and <hi>Self-confidence</hi> as to talk of <hi>Principles, Evidence, Demonstration,</hi> or even <hi>Certainty,</hi> unless minc't and allay'd with the Epithet <hi>Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;</hi> though you will never show us how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd <hi>possibility to be otherwise</hi> can ever convince us <hi>sufficiently</hi> to Assent the thing <hi>is so,</hi> or why a Capacity to bee false for any thing wee know, is not the very notion of Incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so most abusively pinn'd to the notion of Certainty. Now, that you should so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wave speaking to that Letter, it being parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly directed to your self, whereas the Book you pretend to answer was not; the end aym'd at in it being by all men's Confession very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portantly good, that is to shorten Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies and bring our Disputes to a period; also the method of Discoursing being (as Logick tells us) one of the <hi>praecognoscenda</hi> to the Discourse it self, and so either Disputant has right to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:50748:4"/>
it should be first treated of, though I civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>requested</hi> it of you: Lastly, it being so indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently fram'd to your or my interest, or rather totally for his who had Truth or Grounds on his side; that is, for you, were your cause so qualify'd; and, as such, equally lik't by Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Protestants as well as Catholicks: This being so, that you should so totally sleight and disre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it in these circumstances, is a clear argument you think it not safe to venture your cause and Credit upon Principles or any Evident or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive method of discoursing; and a plain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession by way of Fact that all your discourse against my Book has neither <hi>Principles</hi> to subsist by, nor <hi>Evidence</hi> to conclude by. Which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of yours though <hi>tacitly</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly</hi> exprest (for you are a <hi>modest</hi> man in all your <hi>rationall</hi> performances, and onely very brag and brisk when some jest haunts your fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or when you are dispos'd to flout and rail at the <hi>impudence</hi> of my assertions) is as high a favour as your great wit could have inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and so I am bound to yeeld you a return of Infinit Thanks for it; which I beseech you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in part of requitall, till I come to show here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after out of the nature of that Letter that all your Probable talk in this Book had been marr'd in case you had yeelded to do me the reason which I there requested</p>
            <p n="3">3. Next I am to thank you heartily that you begin your Impugnation with the most disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50748:5"/>
Cavill that perhaps has ever been heard of Intending to frame my discourse as plain and unexceptionable as I could concerning the Rule of Faith, I declared (page 4.) that I <hi>intended not rigorous definitions of either word, but onely to reflect on and make use of some Attributes, Predicates or Properties, which in the sence of such who intelligently use those words, are apprehended to bee involved in or truly appertaining to their signification,</hi> I added that I gave that caution to <hi>avoid mistake and Cavill:</hi> which might ensue upon pretence of defining, but could not upon meerly predicating, so my propositions were true: This done, I begun with the plainest say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings I could use, and thence drew on the process of my discourse by the most immediate steps I could invent. The tenour of my First discourse was thus: A Rule signifies a thing which is able to regulate him who uses it, therefore it must have in it those Qualities by which 'tis able to do that it's proper Effect; therefore it must bee knowable as to it's existence to the Persons it is to regulate; as also, it must be knowable to have in it a vertue to regulate or guide them right. Again, the word <hi>Faith</hi> being Equivocall, and sometimes taken for Conscience, sometimes for a strong Trust or Reliance, sometimes for Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or Honesty &amp;c. I had a mind to restrain it to our present purpose as it is taken for an As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the understanding upon Authority; and, so, exprest my self §. 8. that, <hi>Faith is the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:50748:5"/>
same with beleeving;</hi> thence I affirm'd something of <hi>Divine Beleef,</hi> as much as would bring me to evince this that <hi>Faith</hi> in a Christian Sence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported <hi>Knowledge of Supernaturall things;</hi> which is all I aym'd at in this Branch of my discourse. So that I us'd all the art and care I could to avoid Cavil. But Sr, I perceive to my comfort your Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity (which is one of your chief kindnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) is beyond all prevention. First, <hi>you can by no means think my explication of those Terms sufficient p.</hi> 1. you should have said <hi>those affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations true,</hi> or, those Predicates, truely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't of the subject; for this is all I aym'd at, and not to compile <hi>Explications.</hi> Next, you say, this proposition A <hi>Rule is to regulate or guide him that uses it, is a Discription;</hi> which I beseech you beleeve was never intended. Afterwards you complain I <hi>confound Rule and Guide, by making regulating and guiding equivalent;</hi> and I defend my self, that those words being vulgarly confounded may without wronging Art be us'd so till wee have occasion to distinguish them, which I have no where in my whole book: Nor had I blam'd Mr. <hi>Whitby</hi> for this but that in the very discourse where he profest to distinguish <hi>Rule</hi> from <hi>Guide,</hi> he notwithstanding, even there confounded their notions. Were I to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish them, I should (if you would not be angry) put this difference between them, that <hi>Guide</hi> hath something Personall in its significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which <hi>Rule</hi> abstracts from. But you proceed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:50748:6"/>
with your <hi>kindnesses;</hi> and (pag. 2.) call those words my <hi>definition;</hi> though (so unparallelld is your candor) you quote my words a little after that I inrended here no definitions: and then shew my <hi>definition</hi> (forsooth) Faulty, because I fell Englishmen <hi>for their clearer understanding</hi> this word, that 'tis a <hi>Thing able to regulate</hi> &amp;c. whereas <hi>regulate is less removed from the Latin</hi> &amp; so, less plain then <hi>Rule</hi> the word defined. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as your self know I meant not to define; and I beseech you beleeve mee when I tell you I as little meant to write to any English-men that did not understand the word <hi>Regulate</hi> as well as the word <hi>Rule.</hi> Yet I must <hi>define</hi> whether I will or no, though there be no other occasion why it should be so but onely that you might break a jest, which tickled your Fancy, and so your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers itcht to put it down; 'Tis a Definition of your own parallell to my counterfeited one, that a <hi>Law-giver is one that hath the power of Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> And in this you have hit right; for tis just such another definition as mine was.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After this you bring in my other Definition (as you call it) that <hi>Faith is the same with beleeving,</hi> and immediatly add my words disow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning any sayings of mine in this first discourse to be <hi>definitions</hi> at all, as had you transcrib'd a little farther you might have let the Reader see more visibly. And, so kind you are, that my very not intending to define which is alone able, one would think, to excuse all the pretended
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50748:6"/>
faults in my mistaken definitions must have a little touch of a Cavill notwithstanding from that fertil wit of yours, which minds not desert nor misdesert, but follows it's own Genius, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently pours out it self meerly to vent its exuberancy. Now the reason why those words <hi>Faith is the same with beleeving</hi> must needs be a Definition too, is Evident: you had another witty conceit came into your Fancy, which was a Country-fellows Definition, saying that <hi>an Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was as if hee should say an Invasion;</hi> which would not have fitted, unless you had made my words <hi>Faith is the same Beleeving</hi> a definition too; and it had been a thousand pitties such a pretty jest should have been lost. But, Sr. since I ment to bring my notion from a more Equivocall to a less Equivocall word, &amp; thence proceeded (as you call it) defining a great way farther, that is indeed <hi>predicating</hi> or <hi>affirming</hi> diverse other things in that §. why you should catch at my very first words, <hi>Faith is the same with beleeving,</hi> and make that alone a <hi>Definition,</hi> neglecting all the following ones, is impossible for such dull heads as mine to divine; unless it were that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-definition had a very great Ascendent and Influence over your Conscience and Sincerity as well as your Fancy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This definition of mine (to see how things will come about) <hi>puts you in mind</hi> (p. 3.) of my <hi>First Principles <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50748:7"/>
the right self-evident method hee talks so much of; and his Principles agree admirably well with his definitions. If hee had proceeded in the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and added that a Rule of Faith is a Rule of Faith, Orall Tradition is Orall Tradition, and that to say Orall Tradition is the Rule of Faith is as much as to say Orall Tradition is the Rule of Faith, the whole business had been concluded without any more ado, and I think no body would have gone about to confute him.</hi> What a terrible thing it is to deal with your great Wits! Let's see how a little honest plain Logick will dissipate this vapour. To <hi>Conclude</hi> is to show evidently that two notions wee call the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Predicate are identify'd or connected in that Proposition we call the Conclusion. To do this wee find a Third notion, call'd a <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or Argument to bee identify'd with those two, whence wee infer them to be the same: but how shall wee know that third notion to bee identify'd with those two others, that is, how shall wee know the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to bee true? By finding another <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> connected with them: And how far must this go on? Endlesly, or no? If endlesly, since every following Connexion is prov'd by some foregoing ones, in case wee cannot come to see some <hi>First</hi> Connexion or Principle, wee could conclude or deduce nothing. And how must we evidence the Connexion of the Terms (or of the Subject and Predicate) in these <hi>First</hi> Principles? By another antecedent connexion
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50748:7"/>
of those Terms with a Third? No; for these are suppos'd the <hi>First</hi> Connexions. Wherefore, since they cannot be evidenc't by any thing out of themselves and yet must be Evident, else nothing could bee evidenc't by them, it follows they must bee Evident of themselves or <hi>self-Evident.</hi> And in what consists this Self Evidence? meerly in this that no <hi>medium,</hi> middle Term or Argument can come between the notions of their Subject and Predicate; which devolves finally into this, that the Subject and Predicate are perfectly the same notion: So that all <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> about any thing is finally resolv'd into the nature or <hi>Essence</hi> of that thing, that is into that things <hi>being what it is,</hi> or which is all one it's being <hi>the same with its self,</hi> which your great Learning laughs at. Hence, <hi>what is, is;</hi> or <hi>Every thing is what it is,</hi> as plain and course as it looks, is the last resort of all Evidence in the world; and, in particular Sciences, that the Subject of that Science is what it is; <hi>as that man is a Man, Quantity is Quantity,</hi> and so, a <hi>Rule is a Rule, Faith is Faith,</hi> must principle all that can bee solidly concluded either about <hi>Man, Quantity, Rule</hi> or <hi>Faith.</hi>

Had you reflected on any maxims of Art, and not stood pursuing your affected buffonerie when it became you to discourse like a solid Scholler, you would have seen how little ground you had for your taunting non-sence.

And now, Sir, bee Judge your self, whether the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing your self thus amply to bee a disingenuous and weak Caviller, bee not strangely obliging to your thankfull Servant. Really, Sir, unless you will bee so good as to take the telling you candidly of your Faults to bee sufficient Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I am exceedingly afraid I shall live and dy in your debt.

            <p n="8">8. You are pleas'd to honour me with a very loud and heavy Calumny all over your Book, as reviling Scripture, vilifying, disgracing it, and what not.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50748:10"/>
more to do but to alledge experience confest by all, that many Sects who have the outward Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inform it with different Sences; which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently argues a Divisibility or Distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that <hi>Letter</hi> and it's <hi>Sence.</hi> Admitting then this Distinction, and that the <hi>Sence</hi> of words is the Soul of, them, I cannot allow that Letter with any propriety to be called <hi>Gods word,</hi> unless inform'd and enlivened with Gods <hi>Sence;</hi> but onely <hi>dead</hi> Characters; for sincerely, Sr, I never saw a Bible creep about and move it self that I should call it, that is, the paper and characters, <hi>Living.</hi> Now, taking those <hi>Letters</hi> in complexion with <hi>Gods Sence,</hi> and, as inform'd by it, I chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge your utmost spight which most of your book, especially the end of this Section, shows to be very bitter against me, whether you ever read any man give a higher respect to those Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles then my self. See my words <hi>Sure-Footing</hi> p. 40. &amp; 146. which you might have had the Candour to acknowledge. And as for the Author of Rushworths Dialogues whom you accuse of the same crimes I know not whether you will take my word or no, but I assure those who will, that when on occasion I was moving him to write a Comment on the Books of the New Testament, he shook his head and reply'd! <hi>Ah, Sr, do you know what you ask? They are so full of profound heavenly sence, that 'tis beyond the wit of man to declare it without injuring it;</hi> assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me it was to sublime a task and required
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50748:11"/>
such perfection of Science especially Divinity, that he durst not undertake it. I challenge you therefore as you hope to bee held an honest man, to show mee any one expression in all my writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where I speak of the Letter of Scripture in Complexion with it's Sence, (which onely is truly Gods word); otherwise then with high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est reverence; nay of that very Letter as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd by any method of arriving at a Certain and determinate Sence of it but with respect. For otherwise the meer Letter of Scripture quoted by the Devill and taken in his sence is the <hi>Devills</hi> Word, not <hi>Gods,</hi> and for the same reason the same Letter cited by you to signify <hi>your Sence</hi> is <hi>your Word,</hi> (though you tell your Auditors bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that all is <hi>Gods Word</hi> you talk out of the Pulpit) unless you first make Evident you adhere to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain method of interpreting it right, which you shall never evince; nay Certainer &amp; Solider then is the living Voice and Practice of the Church Essentiall, which you so laugh at, and would perswade your Readers to renounce and disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve <hi>it</hi> to adhere to your Grammatical Quibbling &amp; Criticisms. So that all your anger at us in reality springs hence that we will, not let <hi>Your Word</hi> bee taken for <hi>Gods,</hi> and honour'd (forsooth) and reverenc't with a sacred and Divine veneration. Hence all this heat and foam of ill language.

your Copy-hold, that, if this cheat bee once discover'd, your self, all the Books you write, nay all your whole Profession signifies just nothing. This short and plain Discourse once un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by our Readers, as I hope it will, your fierce Calumny against mee as a Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous person devolves to this that you venerate your own Talent or Fancy in sencing the Letter of Scripture as a most Sacred thing, nay place it in stead of the Holy Ghost who first dictated that Sence to the Divine Writers. And can you do mee a greater Kindness than to discover this, and bee so highly concern'd for it?</p>
            <p n="9">9. You tell the Reader <hi>p.</hi> 13. that <hi>whatever I attribute to Scripture for fashion's sake, or</hi> (say you) <hi>to avoid Calumny with the vulgar, as hee sayes very ingeniously in this Explication of the 15th. Corollary; nevertheless 'tis plain that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Hypothesis, hee cannot but look upon it as perfectly useless and pernicious.</hi> By which words you would make mee acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I attribute nothing to Scripture but <hi>to avoyd Calumny with the vulgar:</hi> whereas in the place you cite there is no such matter; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that some of our Controvertists (not I) condescended to the Protestants <hi>sleight-way</hi> of quibbling out of Scripture, lest they should ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate them to desert Scripture it self. But this is your usuall sincerity.</p>
            <p n="10">10. You quoted (after you have discours't as if there could bee no use of Scripture besides

But look there and one may read, I speak of Scripture only as ill-manag'd by you; that is, <hi>putting it without any distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Persons in the peoples hands, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it to their Interpretation to make use of it for a Rule of Faith.</hi> Now, if Scripture as mis-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd bear the same notion with Scripture it self, then you have dealt very honestly, and done mee no Kindness in falsifying my intentions evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from my words in that very place, and inveighing against mee accordingly. As for your next citation, that <hi>Scripture-words, not senc't, nor having any certain Interpreter</hi> (under which notion I express my self to take them) are waxen-natur'd, that is, appliable to diverse sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, 'tis so beat out by manifest experience, that 'tis beyond Cavill to confute it; and the very Disputes between <hi>Iohn Biddle</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants is sufficient to evince it. But your Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour is pleased to confound Scripture's Letter taken <hi>as unsenc't,</hi> with the same Letter as ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>with it's true Sence,</hi> that is, taken as <hi>God's Word;</hi> and that Letter as taken <hi>without any Certain Interpreter,</hi> with the same Letter as <hi>certainly interpreted,</hi> and then who so abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable miscreants as the poor Papists; who must bee forc't to say, not what themselves in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

say, but what their disingenuous (though even therein <hi>kind</hi> Adversaries) will needs have them say.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Your third Section tells us that you are much puzled for Instances of Traditions Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers differing in Faith; and you are so put to it that you cannot I mean (you will not) distinguish between the Head of our Church acting as a Definer of Faith or Proceeder upon Tradition, and acting as a prudent Governour. Please then to take notice how this Affair of Censuring Books is manag'd. Diverse Books, perhaps of twenty severall Authors are order'd to bee read over by some Divines, and their Judgments concerning them to bee given in, which they do: The Chief Officers of the Church perhaps have twenty other things to handle that very day; and Themselves have neither leasure to peruse the Books, nor discuss the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which coming clad in a Theologicall dress would in Prudence require a great deal of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration ere any of them were expresly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to bee declar'd against with it's pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Censure. All that the nature of their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances permits them to do is to trust those Divines, and to proceed accordingly, to warn the Faithfull to beware of those Books, in which they are inform'd there is such danger. So that the motive those Governours proceed upon is their care of preserving the Faithfull untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Judgment of Divines, not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50748:13"/>
Tradition. And, what motive proceed those Divines upon in these Censures? Upon their best skill as Divines; that is their best skill in drawing Consequences; in which neither themselves nor any else say they are Infallible; Thus much for the Censurers. Now come wee to the Person censur'd and his Books. Of what nature are they? Theologicall Discourses. And what do such Discourses rely on formally? On Tradition? Nothing less: On this hee rely'd as a <hi>Beleever</hi> or Christian, not as a <hi>Divine,</hi> but on his own humane skill in explicating Faith or it's Ground, and his talent in deducing right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences, in which also hee and every man Living is Fallible: You see, Sir, by this time the ripe fruits of your performance in this point, and that you have brought a worthy Instance of Difference amongst Reliers on Tradition, in a passage wherein neither side rely on Tradition Oh, but they contradict one another in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of Tradition: 'Tis your weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proud conjecture; and besides you cannot (I mean still, will not) distinguish between the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of Tradition (that is the Infallibility of the Living Voice and Practice of the Church Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall in conveying down uninterruptedly Christ's Doctrine) and the <hi>Explication</hi> of it; show the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> condemns the former and you have my free Confession I am at a loss for my Faith. But, though you show shee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns and censures all the later, that is all the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50748:13"/>
Explications whether made by that Authour, my self, or any other, yet, as long as she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns not the former, shee hath done nothing against Tradition; and so your wise Instance is spoil'd, as it was no other likely, being the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est you could have invented against Tradition, and the least concerning it; in regard there is not one learned Catholick in the Church that looks upon the Acts of the Roman Inquisition in Censuring Books, as on Infallible Definitions of Faith.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You'l ask, where lies the Fault in such cases? I answer, no where that I know; not in the Head of the Church, who acted the most prudently and carefully that could be in such an affair; neither censuring any particular Proposition, where there was no more Certainty to ground that Censure, than the Judgment of some Divines; and yet providing by the Cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his censure imported that the conceived harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullness in those Books might work no ill Effects: whence 'tis but an invidious presumption of your own, that <hi>perhaps the Pope is censur'd for it in England.</hi> Nor, were those Roman Divines Faul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in case they judg'd <hi>secundum ultimum poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae;</hi> but were bound in conscience to give in to the Court what they thought. Again, those <hi>Explications</hi> of Divinity-points looking new to them, and it being the naturall Genius of the Followers of Tradition to bee jealous of any thing that is new, and this not onely in Faith but also
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50748:14"/>
in Explications of Faith, in regard these pretend a coherence and connexion with Faith it self, it seems to mee to sound a laudable zeal both in them and others to bee suspicious of and less a Friend at First to what's <hi>new,</hi> 'till it bee <hi>farther lookt into</hi> and appear innocent. Nor can I say 'tis a Fault in the person censur'd, in case hee sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ment to write what he judg'd was truth and so most advantageous to the Church, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the Orders of his Chief Eccesiasticall Superiour. You see, Sir, the whole case: in which I am larger because you are <hi>kinder</hi> here than ordinary; and, your Instance falling pittiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly short, you peece it out with Falshoods (p. 22.) that <hi>wee in England censure perhaps the Pope</hi> for this Action; that the person censur'd <hi>disobeyes</hi> the <hi>Summons of his Chief Pastour;</hi> that p. 24. <hi>the Governours of the Church do professedly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish Ignorance in the Generality of the Papists for the increasing their devotion.</hi> These are grear favours indeed: you are too liberall, Sir, and will undo your self unless you restrain your hand from this profuseness of <hi>kindness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your 4th. Section is all <hi>Reason,</hi> &amp; (like the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going one in which you laid your grounds and fell to build) so strong and firm that it needs more than an ordinary blast to blow it down.

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50748:14"/>
and acquaints the Reader with a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous oversight of mine enough to overthrow my whole Book. 'Tis this, that I make Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Certainty a <hi>First</hi> and <hi>self-evident Principle, and yet go about to demonstrate it;</hi> which you soberly admonish mee to <hi>take heed how I take it upon me;</hi> that <hi>Aristotle never demonstrated First Principles, because they could not bee demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;</hi> that <hi>most prudent men are of Opinion that a self-evident principle, of all things in the world, should not bee demonstrated, because it needs not;</hi> you ask, <hi>to what end should a man write a Book to proove that, which every man must assent to without proof so soon as 'tis propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him</hi> &amp;c. Now, Sr, in my mind you should onely have combated this, and have given no other Answer to my whole Book but to this onely: for nothing can bee so senceless nor so impertinent as to go about to proove that which that which can need no proof, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently less meriting an Answer. I would then, had I been in your case, have thought it my best and most honourable play, to omit all counterfeitings of my Adversaries defining, all those multitudes of groundless Cavills, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary mistaks, Calumnies, laughing at his First Principles, Evidence, demonstration, &amp;c. together with all my wordish exceptions at his <hi>rumbling Rethorick, perching upon the nature of things, and other such</hi> expressions; and have solely apply'd my self to this one Folly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50748:15"/>
evacuating his whole Book and so excusing my Answer; And this you might have done with far greater hopes of conquering than in any of the rest; because, that a <hi>First</hi> and self-evident Principle cannot bee evidenc't seems so clear that it even looks like a First Principle it self, of which no other part of your confutation has the least Countenance or resemblance: And be assur'd, Sr, since you would not use this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against mee as you might, you shall never have mee upon the like lock again.</p>
            <p>Caught in these streights by your entangling Logick I endeavour my escape on this manner. <hi>Self-evidence</hi> is two-fold, <hi>Speculative</hi> and <hi>Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall. Speculative self-evidence</hi> it that which cannot bee <hi>made Evident</hi> by any Speculation or Skill, but is known meerly by the common light of understanding: such is that which is found in those Principles I dicourst of before, which were therefore Self-evident speculatively because, their Subject and Predicate being the very same notion, no other middle notion could come between them, by connexion with which they might bee shown connected with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: You remember them I suppose; it was they that made you and your Friends such sport in your Book. <hi>Practicall Self-evidence</hi> is that which wee are not thus imbu'd with by nature through the common light of Understanding, nor yet is it acquir'd by rationall Discourses, (for this is <hi>Evidence by-deduction,</hi> not <hi>Self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence)</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:50748:15"/>
but that which is stoln into us as it were at unawares by a common converse with things in this world, which all mankind in a manner even those who are very rude are acquainted with. Examples of the former are (if you have done laughing) <hi>A Rule is a Rule, Faith is Faith,</hi> also <hi>A whole (or a part and more) is more than a part;</hi> or, <hi>is a part and more.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the later, for your better satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I propose three or four. One shall bee that in a square space 'tis a neerer way to go from one corner to that which is opposite, by the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter, than to go by the two sides. Another shall bee that, things look less afar off and big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger neerer-hand. A third shall bee that (abstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting from madness) 'tis impossible Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or any other such (you see how kind I am to you) should take for his Text <hi>The Fool hath said in his heart there is no God,</hi> and at the same time, and in the same circumstances things stand now in <hi>England,</hi> should preach Atheism and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to perswade them out of that very Text, <hi>there is no God.</hi> The last shall bee the Existence of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> or K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. Now I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that all these are <hi>Practically-self-evident:</hi> for it was not by virtue of Speculative discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses the vulgar arriv'd to the Knowledge of these and such like things (as is evident by this that they know not how to prove these, or give an account of their assent by way of evident dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course) but by virtue of the common know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:50748:16"/>
of things in the world they are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with. Now what is thus <hi>self-evident</hi> is so far from being impossible to bee evidenc't Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that 'tis the proper task of <hi>Learned men</hi> (by which I mean not those tedious mighty men of Talk, who think it an excellent confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Sence to cavill at words and Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) to look into Nature, and discover or (if you bee not offended) <hi>demonstrate</hi> what were the proper Causes which wrought thus, after a naturall manner, that Effect call'd <hi>Certainty</hi> in rationall Souls as to all the aforesaid particulars; which found, they will appear to bee the <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> fit to demonstrate that Effect. That this is so in the two first Examples, you are so well skilled in <hi>Euclid,</hi> &amp; the mathematicks (though one Prophet T. say's I have not read him) as to know that notwithstanding this Practical-self-evidence all mankind has of them, Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians notwithstanding go about to demonstrate them speculatively without fearing to do a <hi>needless</hi> action, out of the nature of Quantity; as I make account I could demonstrate the 4th. &amp; the 3d. too out of the nature of <hi>Man,</hi> or out of this (if you please) that a <hi>man is a man</hi> or a rationall Creature, that is a Thing that acts not, if hee have the use of Reason, without a motive.</p>
            <p>To come nearer home, I concieve that 'tis to all unprejudic't and unpreoccupated Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, as are all Catholikes who have not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:50748:16"/>
their Faith from skill but by the naturall way of Education. <hi>Self-evident Practically,</hi> that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine deliver'd now as taught by Christ and his Apostles, by such as profess to have it by way of Tradition or uninterrupted Succession from them, is truly their Doctrine; or, that the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Traditions conveying down matters of Fact is practically-self-evident; and thence I proceed to look speculatively into the Causes of such an Assurance, and so demonstrate it. Which when I go about, I discover that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides what ascertain'd Humane Tradition in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing the Existence of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. or any other matter of Fact, infinite Advantages were found in Christian Tradition enabling it to bring down the first-preach't Doctrine above what was found in them. But I expatiate too far.</p>
            <p>I hope by this, Sir, you see at length what my whole Book ayms at; though (good man) you were so taken up with cavilling at little wordish Exceptions you spy'd it nor before; that is, to demonstrate by way of <hi>Speculation</hi> what I conceiv'd before to bee <hi>self-evident pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically;</hi> you see also at the same time how infinitely you oblige mee by professing your Ignorance of this point; for in so doing you profess withall that you are utterly Ignorant of what my whole Book meant. And, are not you rarely qualify'd to bee an Impugner of my Book, who are so perfectly to seek in knowing what's the main end it drives at? Is it not evident
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:50748:17"/>
hence that your endeavours to confute mee can never go to the bottom of the difficulty, but onely talk superficially, that is wordishly and withall mistakingly to some passages in it? Surely, plain reason tells us in every ordinary affair that if one man understands not the main end the other ayms at, however hee may talk prettily and express himself in good language, yet hee can never speak home and to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And as this is plain <hi>à priori</hi> from it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Cause, your Ignorance of my main intent, so you have abundantly demonstrated the same <hi>à posteriori</hi> in your whole Book; which no where (as I hope to show you hereafter) begins at the bottom; but is wholly made up of a great many aiery gay prettinesses, such as best befits one who mocks at <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration.</hi> But 'tis no matter your Friend Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> will extoll you for it the more, and the Generality of your party, who are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custom'd and educated by you to loose sermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Discourses will like it the better; whereas, had you profest the way of Evidence, you had been character'd by him as <hi>monstrously opinio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated</hi> of your self, and that kind of Readers, your onely admirers, would not have understood you.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Your second Part treats about <hi>the Properties of the Rule of Faith, and whether they agree solely to Orall Tradition.</hi> I assign'd seven; of which you are pleas'd to mistake quite no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:50748:17"/>
fewer than <hi>all.</hi> But I must not here take notice too much of your <hi>Reason,</hi> but of your Kindnesses con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradistinguisht by your Friend Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to your Reasons, that is, which are <hi>Irrationall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You tell mee <hi>p.</hi> 57. that <hi>I might have learn'd something from the same Authour from whom I borrow'd my Chief Properties of the Rule of Faith, if I had but had the patience to have consider'd his Explication of them.</hi> Surely, learned Sir, you have great skill in Judiciary Astrology; or else you deal with <hi>Lilly,</hi> and <hi>Booker;</hi> or perhaps have an inchanted Glass which discovers to you all I do in my study. For you know exactly all I do there; nay which is yet more wonderfull, all I do not. You know better than my self I never use to read the Fathers; you can pronounce fearlesly that I never read <hi>Euclid,</hi> and here you can tell to a hair where I borrow'd my <hi>Chief Properties of the Rule of Faith, and that it was Dr.</hi> Holden'<hi>s Analysis.</hi> What <hi>Mephosto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> reveals these secrets to you? But, Sir, I beg your pardon; I will not put this gift of yours upon such a score: you are a Divine, and so no doubt know these things by the Spirit of Prophecy; nor am I a little proud to know that so great a Prophet is so near related to mee by his Friendship and Kindnesses. But, Sir, take heed; even holy men and Prophets themselves have been deceiv'd sometimes. I need not quote Scripture to you, how a certain person offer'd to bee a <hi>lying Spirit in the mouth even of Prophets;</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:50748:18"/>
and as for your present Prophecy I do faithfully assure you that I never read a leaf in Dr. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's Analysis</hi> in my life; nor knew, till your Book told mee it, hee treated at all of <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Rule of Faith.</hi> The occasion of this neglect was that I was told hee went the way of <hi>Rushworth's Dialogues,</hi> which I made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I comprehended sufficiently, and so mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to peruse it. You see, Sir, what you gain by being <hi>persoually affrontive;</hi> which you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly affect in your Book to mee and others; and so studiously endeavour it that to find occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions for it, you stick not to say the most false and unjustifiable things rather than not humour that Infirmity of your Will. Now your <hi>Kindness</hi> in this partinular carriage consists in this, that you discover plainly a resolution to cavill though you engage your self by that means to assert things which may easily bee false, and which 'tis impossible for you to prove or justify were they true; which signifies you are neither too civill, over honest, nor endow'd with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding proportion of Prudence. But Mr. <hi>Stil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingfleet</hi> likes you never the less for it, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps will proclaim your praises the louder for your victory, however atchiev'd by Stratagem. <hi>Dolus an virtus.</hi>—</p>
            <p n="15">15. You are pleas'd p. 60. to Cavill that the words <hi>absolutely ascertainable to us</hi> (are as you who are master of Language, and so may say any thing, deliver your self) <hi>most contradictious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50748:18"/>
exprest.</hi> And why? because they import, <hi>with respect to us, without respect to us:</hi> As if it were such an unheard of thing that the word <hi>absolutely</hi> should ofttimes signify <hi>perfectly,</hi> as when wee say <hi>absolutely good</hi> an <hi>absolute Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Scholar,</hi> &amp;c. And then I beseech you inform mee what Contradiction there is in saying the Rule of Faith is <hi>perfectly ascertainable to us.</hi> Besides you should as well have plac't the contradictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the words <hi>absolutely ascertainable.</hi> For if it bee once sence that it is <hi>absolutely ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable,</hi> it cannot bee ill to adde <hi>to us;</hi> for the word <hi>ascertainable</hi> implies a respect to some or other. On this occasion (that I may not trouble my Reader often with such nitty Exceptions, with which your Book abounds) it were not amiss to reflect how industriously your friend Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> and you, who, as 'tis most sit, eccho mutuall praises to one another, affect and pursue such empty cavills; any misplac't word whether it happen through the Compositors let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in, in a wrong place, or printing it whennot sufficiently blotted out in the originall; any less propriety in an expression, occasion'd by the hast I was in when I writ my Appendix against him, which was sent to the press in loose Quarters of sheets; any Metaphor which light unsutable to your Cavilling Genius, as that of <hi>perching,</hi> which makes your self verry jollyly merry; any pretended degree of obscurity in a word, as that of <hi>Regulate</hi> in stead of <hi>Rule;</hi> any expression that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:50748:19"/>
sounds not roundly and tersely Rhetoricall, in a book in which I meant no Rhetorick at all: These and divers others such wordish Faults or no Faults, ('tis all one with you) are judg'd mighty pieces of ignorance according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of such aiery kind of Schollarship; and great Triumphs made upon them. Wheras I should rather wish to combat the inward meaning and sence of a discourse than it's outward dress or manner of expression, provided the manner of expressing wrong not that sence. Hence I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept mainly against the Titles of Mr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleets</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tillotsons</hi> books: It being both highly improper and abusive of the signification of words to call that a <hi>Rule</hi> which is Confessedly possible to be <hi>False,</hi> that is which possibly has no power in it to rule at all; and equally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd to call that a <hi>Rationall Account</hi> of any thing which is built on no First, that is <hi>Self-evident</hi> Principle, without which no <hi>rationall discourse</hi> can subsist nor Conclusion bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc't, as I showd lately § 5. Unless perhaps Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> takes <hi>Rationall</hi> as wee use the word <hi>reasonable</hi> when wee say a thing is <hi>reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable strong,</hi> that is wee hope it will hold, but yet wee see not but it may break. This is <hi>my</hi> way of excepting; but were Mr. <hi>Tillotson</hi> to work upon the word <hi>Rationall</hi> 'tis good luck hee is Mr. <hi>Stillingfleets dedicated</hi> and dedicating friend, for otherwise tis forty to one he would have about with him. And first he would have called
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:50748:19"/>
the Title of his Book, his <hi>Definition</hi> of it; and then have fal'n foul with him for setting forth a Book to <hi>Englishmen</hi> and using the word <hi>Rationall</hi> which was <hi>neerer the Latin,</hi> instead of the word <hi>Reasonable</hi> which was plain English, and so more intelligible to his Readers.</p>
            <p>But enough of these Fooleries; 'tis now high time I return to my Friend and his Kindnesses. Your present one, Sir, (which I acknowledge common to you and your Friend, and you ought to applaud one another for it) consists in this: that by your magnifying and frequently insisting upon exceptions against my words, not upon a <hi>Logical</hi> score, because they are Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocall or injure the Sence wee are discussing, but upon a <hi>Grammaticall,</hi> or <hi>Rhetoricall,</hi> that is a <hi>Superficiall</hi> account in which the point un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate is no way concern'd, is a very hearty acknowledgment to your Reader that you va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue the aiery gingling of words more than the solid substance of Sence; which discovers you, how much soever you have read, noted and scribled, to bee very Empty of true Learning or Science: This is a <hi>reall Kindness,</hi> Sir, and I humbly thank you both for it.</p>
            <p>Your second Section and some following ones for the main part of them speak nothing but pure <hi>Reason;</hi> I mean in your way, that is sophistically and knowingly deforming every passage you meet with. Yet to do you right you speak a great Truth in the beginning of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:50748:20"/>
your § 4. p. 65. when you say, <hi>And thus I might trace him through all the Properties of the Rule of Faith;</hi> for nothing is more Certain than that. <hi>Thus,</hi> that is, handling things as you do, one may do any thing, nay even write a Book against the First Principles themselves. The Rule of Faith being confessedly the <hi>means to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Points of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Sence</hi> or <hi>meaning</hi> of Scripture being the <hi>Points</hi> of Faith, it follows unavoidably that the Protestants must say (if they will speak sence) that the Rule of Faith must bee the <hi>means</hi> to bring them to the Sence or meaning of Scripture; for which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, the <hi>Letter</hi> of Scripture as <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficative,</hi> being sufficient, 'tis consequent they can onely mean by <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> the Letter of Scripture <hi>as significative of God's Sence</hi> or Points Faith. I beseech you, Sir, what say you to this Discourse? Do you answer it, or show that, if you take Scripture in any other Sence for Rule of Faith than as thus consider'd, you do not confound the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> with the <hi>Points of Faith?</hi> Not a jot. Nor is it your fashion to speak to my Reasons, or Consequences. Thus you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd my First Discourse, the most solid and most Fundamentall part of my Book? Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the plain sayings I built on for <hi>Definitions,</hi> denying my conclusions in a following Section, and saying something against them; but not a word I can find any where against the Proofs which inferr'd them, deduc't at large there for
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:50748:20"/>
14. §. §. together; that is from § 2. to the end. Your way of answering is generally when you are gravell'd with the Reason, to bring some ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Parallell, then laugh heartily and mock at that, and so discountenance the other. But here to do you right, you bring two very good ones, but the comfort is you understood them not to bee such, else wee should not have had them; which you put a little oddly and then triumph, and think your self victorious. Pray Sir, lend me your Parallells a while to manage. The first of them is found p. 62. concerning which I thus discourse. Taking the <hi>Statute-book</hi> for the <hi>means</hi> to convey to us the <hi>Sence</hi> of that Book or the <hi>Laws,</hi> I must still say you cannot mean by Statute-book the <hi>Sence</hi> of that Book or the <hi>Laws,</hi> that is that Book as conjoyn'd with it's <hi>Sence,</hi> for so it would signify that the <hi>same</hi> Thing is a <hi>means</hi> to it self, that is, is <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> it self: you must onely mean then by <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute-book,</hi> thus consider'd, the <hi>Letter</hi> of that book as yet unsenc't, or contradistinguisht from the same book <hi>as conjoyn'd with its sence;</hi> that is, the <hi>Letter</hi> of that Book <hi>as Significative.</hi> Thus I conceive it perfectly parallell to mine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all very rationall. But you make it amount to this <hi>p. 62. l. 13. That a Book cannot convey to a man the Knowledge of any matter, because if it did it would convey to him the Thing to bee known.</hi> The later part of which is true though I percieve you know it not; for these words <hi>[Knowledge of a
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:50748:21"/>
matter]</hi> involves in their signification <hi>[the thing Known]</hi> as if you reflect on your own words, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Thing,</hi> you will quickly discover. But the Sophistry lies in this, that when you say, <hi>a Book cannot convey,</hi> &amp;c. you equivocate in the word <hi>Book,</hi> which I contend must either be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the <hi>Letter</hi> of it <hi>in conjunction with the Sence</hi> which is the <hi>thing known,</hi> and then it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not thus accepted, bee a means of arriving at the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of the Thing or the Thing as known, for then it would signify as much as if one should say, <hi>the Letter with the thing known is the means of arriving at the thing known;</hi> or else, it must bee taken for the Letter as <hi>Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative</hi> onely, or <hi>without</hi> the Sence, and so it may bee conceiv'd a <hi>way</hi> of arriving at that <hi>Sence</hi> 'tis judg'd <hi>apt to signify.</hi> But, Sir, your contending here against a thing so Evident has a great deal of reason for it; you would have the outward Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scripture confounded with the Sense of it, that those who hear you quote the Letter, may thee fool'd to imagine you have still the Sense aoo; whereas, should these bee known to bear distinction, it would bee very obvious to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether you speak any thing of <hi>God's Word,</hi> or no, how much soever you have the outward Letter in your mouth and pen; Which reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alone if it were considerately weigh'd, would spoil all your <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> too: For thus go your <hi>First Principles;</hi> The <hi>outward Letter</hi> lying in a book must first bee call'd <hi>God's
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:50748:21"/>
Word,</hi> and held so plain that it cannot bee mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood; and then the Sence you give it must needs bee held <hi>God's Sence;</hi> which politick Principles lay'd, I see not what you are inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to those whom the Holy Ghost inspir'd; and your sayings are to have the same force, if the plot take, as the words of a Prophet or Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>list. And who would not bee angry, fume and take on against a Discourse which is likely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest you of so considerable and beneficiall a Prerogative?</p>
            <p>Your second Parallell applies my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction concerning Scripture to Orall Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for you have a speciall Faculty of your own in making men contradict themselves; thus you us'd a whole cluster of our Authours <hi>p.</hi> 119, 120. and as for poor mee, if you take mee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand I can scarce speak a word consonantly. Now, Sir, wee are thus far agreed, and better Friends than you took us to bee that I allow your Parallell to a tittle, and stick not at all to grant what you would force upon mee <hi>p.</hi> 63. that, <hi>When I say Orall Tradition is the Rule of Faith, I can onely mean by Orall Tradition the Living Voice and Practice of the Church as apt to signify the Sence of Forefathers; and not the Sence, or those Points of Faith which they are apt to signify.</hi> Also that those <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> taken for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally as the <hi>means</hi> to know Points of Faith are contradistinguish't from that Sence, or those Points, and oppos'd to it relatively as a <hi>means</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:50748:22"/>
is oppos'd to an <hi>End;</hi> and therefore taken <hi>as</hi> consider'd in this abstraction and contradistincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a <hi>Means</hi> to cause their actuall Sence in us, I say those Words and Practises are <hi>without Sence;</hi> in the same manner as a <hi>Means,</hi> taken formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for such, is without the <hi>End,</hi> and excludes it from it's notion. All this I voluntarily grant, and least you should conceit your strong Reason has brought mee to it, I let you know I ever took them so formerly: See <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 41. 2d. <hi>Edition</hi> (which I still intend to quote), <hi>By Orall or Practicall Tradition wee mean a delivery down from hand to hand (by Words and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of frequent and visible Actions confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to those Words) of the Sence and Faith of Forefathers.</hi> Where you see I make <hi>Sence</hi> or <hi>Faith</hi> the <hi>thing deliver'd;</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> the <hi>Way of delivering:</hi> which therefore must needs exclude one another formally. Yet you think you have gotten a notable advantage against mee by this Parallell Discourse, telling your Reader <hi>p. 63. When hee hath answer'd this Argument hee will have answer'd his own.</hi> A shrewd Opponent! who confutes mee by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mee to answer an Argument, thinking it would puzzle me grievously, which is my own express, and avow'd Doctrine. Is not this a strange mistake?</p>
            <p>But, Sir, let me reflect on my Obligations. First you write a Book against Tradition, and yet discover plainly in this last mistake, you
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:50748:22"/>
understand not in what I put Tradition to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, that is you impugn, I <hi>thank</hi> you, you know not what. Wee are like to find a wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of it when wee come to examin it's rationall part, which still misses in what's most substantiall and fundamentall. Next, you revile mee all over as abusing Scripture for <hi>unsenc't,</hi> or <hi>without Sence</hi> when wee speak of it as <hi>your Rule</hi> of Faith; and yet you see now wee speak the same of our own as to that point; which I am sure you think mee too highly venerate; and your mistake springs hence that (which is a shame for a Schollar, especialy for one Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> so highly praises) you understand not the nature of <hi>Abstraction,</hi> and imagine and represent mee to say 'tis <hi>devoid of sence, senceles without sence</hi> &amp;c. Which I no where affirm of it absolutely butas ti's abstractedly consider'd as a <hi>means</hi> to arrive at <hi>Sence,</hi> and <hi>as so taken</hi> it must not bee conceiv'd <hi>as having</hi> that Sence which ti's <hi>a way to arrive at.</hi> Once more for all (that I may clear your mistakes to you) know that wee make account there is the same reason for our Rule's being onely significative or a <hi>way</hi> to Sence, that is, as such <hi>not-yet senc't,</hi> as for yours: but wee put the difference here that wee make account <hi>Living voice</hi> and <hi>Constant Practice</hi> of the circumstant Faithfull of the Church Essentiall is by our perpetuall comnverse with them and other conveniencies so perfectly significative of their sence in deliver'd points or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50748:23"/>
points belonging to naturall Christianity, that they leave to the Generality no possible ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity or occasion of mistake; the persons being alive to explain themselves in any such Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if their carriage and Expressions could possibly leave any; wheras the Letter of Scripture as left to be interpreted by private heads, is given both by reason and Experience to bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly interpretable; and cannot by way of living voice apply it self pertinently to explain its own meaning when it's sence is perverted by any; but lies at the mercy of the interpreters pretending to draw it into different faces, by alluding one place to another, Criticizing, and other fallible knacks. You make a great noise all over your Book as if wee would make God unable to write intelligibly; but you beg the question all the while, which is whether God intended the Scripture for a <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> or no; for if not, then why is it not as intelligible as it need bee? Again, the question is whether God intended it for every private man to interpret, or rather that they should <hi>hear the Church</hi> in that as well as in all things else belonging to Christianity: If he did, then They (not God) lead themselves into errour though their Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Pride, which makes them usurp the Churches Prerogative. But <hi>Tuetullian</hi> long ago has given you the best Answer (de Praescrip. Haer. c. 39.) <hi>Nec periclitor dicere ipfas quoque Scripturas sic esse ex Dei voluntate compositas ut
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50748:23"/>
haereticis, materias subministrarent; cum legam oportere haereses esse quae sine Scripturis esse non possunt. Nor am I affraid to say that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves are so fram'd by the will of God that they should afford matter to Hereticks; for I read that there must bee Heresies, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scriptures could not bee.</hi> I hope now you are satisfi'd that <hi>Tertullian</hi> is as great a Reviler of the Letter of Scripture as is your Friend <hi>I. S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the point it self it needs no more to evince it to any except verball Cavillers, but this; That <hi>Sence</hi> is no where formally but in intelligent Things, that is, in our case onely in <hi>mens minds;</hi> nor can it bee otherwise in words then as in <hi>Signes</hi> that is <hi>Significatively.</hi> Since then I deny not but the protestants are to hold Scriptures Letter <hi>Apt to signify</hi> Gods Sence, as is seen <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 13. the very passage you cavil at, I wonder what you would have, or upon what Grounds you can require more.</p>
            <p>You proceed as if you meant to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm mee with your Favours and tell the Reader p. 64. <hi>it is pleasant to observe with what cross and untoward Arguments hee goes about to proove dead Characters not to have the Properties of a Rule of Faith.</hi> May not one without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of infidelity fear, Sir, that as some vessels give every thing that comes into them a tincture of the ill sent with which they are imbu'd; so every thing that passes into your Fancy grows
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50748:24"/>
               <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>untoward</hi> by a predominancy of those Qualities there? You will give the Reader <hi>a tast or two</hi> you say, but the artificiall sawce you adde to it will bee found to alter quite the naturall one of the dish it self.</p>
            <p>The first tast is that I say <hi>It cannot bee evident those Books were writ by men divinely inspir'd, till all the seeming Contradictions bee solv'd.</hi> Upon this your fluent wit works thus. <hi>How can this bee an Argument against those, who by Scriptures must mean unsenc't characters. I had thought Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions had been in the sense of words not in the Letters and Characters; but I perceive hee hath a peculiar Opinion that the four and twenty Letters contradict one another</hi> Sir. I perceive you have been us'd formerly to bee humm'd at the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity for <hi>breaking Iests</hi> when you should <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute,</hi> and have taken such a liking to the <hi>Grande</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of those Applauses, you cannot for your heart yet wean your self of that merry pin of Fancy. But though you bee <hi>pleasant</hi> as you say and follow your sport yet I must bee sober and regard the profit of our Readers. I discourse then thus. Contradictions are formally in mens minds, and <hi>significatively</hi> in <hi>words.</hi> Since then in the very place you quarrell at I allow your Tenet to bee necessarily this, that those Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are <hi>Significative</hi> of God's Sense, my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course runs evidently thus. Since God cannot tell a ly, or, (which is all one, signify a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction) if the Letter of Scripture cannot bee
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50748:24"/>
clear'd from being <hi>Significative</hi> of Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it cannot bee held of God's enditing. See you any occasion, Sir, in this plain discourse which can deserve such mirth and triumph. You might have pleased then after my words that <hi>the Protestants must mean by Scripture, unsenc't Characters,</hi> have added what imediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows there p. 13 <hi>with their Aptnes to signify to them assuredly Gods mind,</hi> which I repeat again in the same place, and then where's the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? It being very good reason in my mind to say that Gods Spirit cannot order words to bee written which signify a ly. But this passage, dear Sir, showes plainly you value honesty and fair dealing much less then your Jest, dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring a Sentence which ought necessarily go all together, to gain a sorry occasion for your pastime and merriment.</p>
            <p>The next <hi>tast</hi> you give of mee is enough to give any Reader who loves sincerity a whole belly full of your manner of confuting. 'Tis found <hi>p.</hi> 65. where you make mee say that <hi>the Scripture cannot bee the Rule of Faith, because those who are to bee rul'd and guided by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures Letter to Faith cannot bee Certain of the true Sence of it.</hi> Upon this you descant thus. <hi>Which is to say that unsenc't Letters and Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters cannot bee the Rule of Faith, because the Rule of Faith must have a certain Sence, that is, must not bee unsenc't Letters and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters; which in plain English amounts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:50748:25"/>
to thus much, Unsenc't Letters and Characters cannot bee the Rule of Faith, that they cannot.</hi> Here is not much <hi>rumbling</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> (as you call it <hi>p.</hi> 63.) but here is a strange jumbling of Sence. Let's see if I can set right what you have taken such pains to disorder. I discourse then thus, Points of Faith are determinate Sences, and Faith is Certain; therefore the Way or Means to Faith, that <hi>is the Rule of Faith,</hi> must bee a Certain Way of arriving at those determinate Sences: These Sences (say you Protestants) are arriv'd at by the <hi>Scripture's Letter</hi> signifying it to you, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must bee Certain by <hi>it</hi> that those Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Sences were mean't by God. Not that the Rule of Faith <hi>was</hi> those Sences, but the <hi>Way</hi> to <hi>them,</hi> and They the <hi>End</hi> of <hi>it,</hi> of which that Rule must bee significative (as I all over exprest) &amp; so it was properly related to those Sences as the thing Signify'd. Whence in proper Speech they are to bee called <hi>its Sence;</hi> in the same manner as 'tis call'd <hi>my Hand-writing</hi> which my Hand writ, though neither my Hand is the writing, nor involves writing in any part of it's Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but is distinguisht from it as <hi>Cause</hi> from <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;</hi> nor yet does the Letter taken as the <hi>Way</hi> to Faith, or God's Sence, imply as any part of it self the Sence 'tis to cause in my Knowing Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. If by this time you bee awake you will see how you wilfully abuse mee, and how far I am from tautologizing, which for a blind to avoid a more pertinent Answer you pretend. The pith
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:50748:25"/>
of the Cavill lies in those words in your Descant; <hi>The Rule of Faith must have a certain Sence, that is</hi> (as you put it upon mee) <hi>it must not bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senc't Letters and Characters,</hi> or it must bee <hi>senc't Letters,</hi> &amp;c. Observe the words <hi>have</hi> and <hi>bee:</hi> the former of which means no more than when wee say a Cause must <hi>have</hi> an Effect; but wee do not therefore infer that the Cause taken as a Cause has <hi>in it self</hi> that very Effect which it produces in another; for Example, the Fire which causes or <hi>heats</hi> is not <hi>heated,</hi> not the <hi>Cold</hi> that <hi>cools cooled;</hi> nor for the same reason the Letters which are the <hi>Cause</hi> of Sence in us are not, as such, <hi>senc't,</hi> that is have not that very Effect in themselves which they produce in another, <hi>viz.</hi> in the understanding: For <hi>Senc't</hi> means <hi>made</hi> to bee <hi>understood,</hi> and they cannot bee <hi>made to bee understood,</hi> taken as significative or as the <hi>way to bee understood.</hi> I hope by this you see how the Rule of Faith being the Means, Way or <hi>Cause</hi> of arriving at Faith or Sence may <hi>have</hi> a certain Sence, caus'd by it, as it's Effect, and yet it self not <hi>bee</hi> or include the Effect it causes in another, but for that very reason ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it, and so bee <hi>unsenc't;</hi> but yet <hi>significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> or <hi>apt to bee senc't.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this follows the Triumph. <hi>And thus I might trace him through all his Properties of the Rule of Faith.</hi> Which I heartily yield too, and I beleeve my Reader that examins these Passages will bee verily perswaded not onely that you <hi>may</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:50748:26"/>
do it, but that you <hi>will</hi> do it, 'tis so naturall to you, and necessary to boot. Now the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Favour you have done mee herein is that by a few unselected Passages you have so acquainted our Readers with your manner of writing and what may bee expected from it, that it will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it needless for mee to spend time in laying you open any farther. Besides I foresee your Reason (such as it is) begins to come into play. Yet some few Favours scatter'd here and there, will, I fear, not cease to sollicit my Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>You drop some of them upon my Friends. <hi>Capt. Everard</hi> you say <hi>(p. 75.) or his Friend affirm there are plain contradictions in Scripture, impossible to bee reconcil'd, and therefore Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants ought to submit to the Infallibility of the Church;</hi> instancing in the third <hi>Series</hi> of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. said there to bee <hi>fourteen;</hi> yet, counted, amount but to <hi>thirteen.</hi> And, has hee not good reason? since neither can Scripture alone recommend it self to an Unbeleever to bee of God's enditing if it bee found by him to bee significative of irreconcileable Contradictions, and so needs the Churches Authority to ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it to bee such; nor can wee have any secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity such Contradictions might not bee found in the main points of Faith themselves, did not the Churches Faith writ in her heart keep the Letter of it safe from such enormous Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Yet you must have your jest, and to bring
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:50748:26"/>
it in you constantly mistake on set purpose; asking <hi>(p.</hi> 76.) if the <hi>Infallibility of the Church can make Thirteen Fourteen: notwithstanding</hi> you say p. 75. <hi>this difficulty has been sufficiently satisfy'd by Commentators:</hi> I suppose therefore you judge those Commentators have <hi>sufficiently satisfy'd</hi> you that <hi>Thirteen</hi> are <hi>Fourteen:</hi> Any body can <hi>sufficiently</hi> satisfy any difficulty with you, provided the Church and her Infallibility have no hand in it. On this occasion I beseech you, Sir, give mee leave to ask you what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator has reconcild that most Evident Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction in your Translation of the Scripture. Look in your Psalms put in the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer, and there Ps. 105, v. 28. wee have these words; <hi>Hee sent darkness and it was dark; and they were not obedient unto his word</hi> But in the same Psalm and verse put in the middle of the Bible, these: <hi>Hee sent darkness and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word</hi> the former place sayes they were not <hi>obedient</hi> the latter they were <hi>obedient.</hi> I suppose you conceit (mistaking the whole thing) your Church without Infallibility can reconcile those things, which ours even with Infallibility is at a horrible puzzle with.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Cressy</hi>'s turn is next; against whom you have many a fling, but one especially <hi>p.</hi> 93. because hee sayes <hi>Schism is impossible</hi> in our <hi>Church.</hi> Which you call <hi>absurd</hi> and <hi>ludicrous;</hi> you tell him <hi>hee cannot deny but 'tis possible for
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:50748:27"/>
men to break from our Communion:</hi> but that the <hi>Subtility of it</hi> lies here that <hi>therfore Schism is impossible in our Church, because so soon as</hi> a man is <hi>a Schismatick</hi> hee is out of it. This done, you ask. <hi>And is it not as impossible in the Church of England?</hi> Sir, I must tell you your whole Book in a manner is compounded of putting tricks upon your Adversaries; that is putting their sayings upon such accounts they never inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, &amp; then impugning your own fictions. 'Tis not on the impossibility of any going out of us, nor meerly because whenany one is <hi>out</hi> of our Church, hee is not <hi>in it,</hi> wee ground the Necessity of our Churches Unity; but in this that her nature and Constitution is so fram'd that shee can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no division in her Bowells, but keeps her self distinguisht from Aliens. If any one recede from Faith it must bee by not hearing the present Churches living voice teaching him points which the Knowledge Practice and Expressions of the Teachers determins and make Evident what they are; whence his disbeleef, if exprest, is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent matter of Fact which is most apt to make a plain distinction between the disbeleever and the Beleevers, and an Evidence beyond Cavill for the Church Governours to proceed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This done (as likewise in the case of high disobedience against Church-Laws, or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours) shee Excommunicates, that is so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly separates the Schismaticall Offender from the Obedient Faithfull; Hence those
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50748:27"/>
Faithfull look upon him as a Rebell or Outlaw or (as our Saviour expresses) as a <hi>Heathen</hi> or, <hi>Publican;</hi> no Church-officer admits him to Sacraments but upon his pennance and Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor any Son of the Church will communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with him in Sacred duties. Pray you, Sir, is this the Temper of your <hi>Church of England?</hi> Your Rule is the Letter of Scripture as conceiv'd significative of Gods word, and this to private understandings. Again you say all necessary points of Faith are plain in it, nay that nothing is fundamentally necessary but what is plain there. Hence all that hold the Letter to bee <hi>plainly Expressive</hi> of Gods Sence and intend to hold to what they conceive <hi>plain</hi> there, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Socinians, Anabaptists, Independents or whatever other faction, all hold to your Rule of Faith, and so are all Protestants. For, if you would ty any of these to any determinable points, you force them from the Rule of Faith, <hi>Scripture as seeming plain to them,</hi> and would instead thereof bring them to a reliance on your Judgement. And if you would punish them for not doing it, you cannot evidence their Fault by way of <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> that so you may proceed upon it; for, as long as they profess their intention to hold to what <hi>seems plain</hi> to them in Scripture, and that your Text <hi>seems less plain</hi> to them there than their own, you ought not to proceed against them Ecclesiastically without disannulling your avowed Rule of Faith. And your carriage
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50748:28"/>
executes accordingly neither using Church-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline against them for Tenets, nor yet for deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or disobeying your Goverment, Episcopacy, though held by you divinely instituted: When did you put any distinction by any solemn Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical declaration between an Anabaptist, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, Socinian &amp;c. and your selves? When did you excommunicate them &amp; warn the purer Protestants by any Publick Ecclesiasticall Act not to joyn with them in Sacred Offices, but to look upon them as Aliens? Might not any of them come to receive the Communion, if hee would? or has any discipline past upon him to debar him from being admitted? None that wee see. Your Party then in indeed no Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall body, cohering by Unity of Tenets or Government, but a Medly rather consisting of men of any tenet almost, and so bears division, disunion and Schism, that is, the Formal cause of <hi>non-Entity of a Church,</hi> in it's very Bowells.</p>
            <p>These two flams of yours, are, Sir, the <hi>Favours</hi> you have done my Friends; and I can onely tell you in a country complement, I <hi>thank</hi> you as much for them, as if you had done them to my self.</p>
            <p>Seeing your Reason begin to play it's part bravely in the following part of your Book, I thought I had done my duty of <hi>Thanking:</hi> but I percieve one main Engin your Reason made use of was to make mee perpetually contradict my self. And this you perform'd by singling a
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:50748:28"/>
few words out of my Book from their fellows, introducing them in other circumstances, and so almost in every Citation falsifying my Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this purposely, as will bee seen by this that you practis'd designe and Artifice in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about. This obliges mee, in stead of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an End, to return back; and to show how sincerly you have us'd mee in almost all your Citations.</p>
            <p>I omit your false pretence that I mean't to define, contrary to my express words.</p>
            <p>You tell your Reader p. 11. That if <hi>any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to say this Book,</hi> (Scripture) <hi>depends not on Tradition for it's Sence, then the most scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous language is not bad enough; then are those Sacred writings but Ink variously fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gur'd in a Book,</hi> quoting for those words App. 4th. p. 319. But if wee look there, not a word is there found of it's <hi>depending</hi> or not depending on <hi>Tradition</hi> for it's Sence nor of making that the <hi>Cause</hi> why I us'd those words you object, &amp; cite for it; but onely that whereas my Lord of <hi>Downs</hi> sayes his Faith has for its ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Scriptures, I tell him that since he means not by the word <hi>Scripture</hi> any <hi>determinate Sence</hi> (which is the formall parts of words) hee must mean the <hi>Characters</hi> or <hi>Ink thus figur'd in a Book,</hi> as is evident; there being nothing imaginable in them besides the <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>form</hi> which, every Schollar knows, compound the thing. This being then the plain tenour of my discourse
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50748:29"/>
there, and not the least word of <hi>Tradition sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Scripture.</hi> Whatever the Truth of the Thing is, 'tis evident you have abus'd my words as found in the place you cite.</p>
            <p>My Citation p. 12. which abstracts from what security wee can have of those parts of Scripture which concern not Faith, you will needs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain to signifie <hi>no security at all either of Letter or Sence:</hi> which is neither found in my words nor meaning.</p>
            <p>How you have abus'd my words <hi>[to avoid Calumny with the Vulgar]</hi> cited by you p. 13. as also the former of those cited p. 14. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shown §. 9, and 10.</p>
            <p>P. 17. You quote my words, <hi>'Tis certain the Apostles taught the same Doctrine they writ,</hi> whence you infer they writ the same Doctrine they taught. Which your introducing Discourse would make to signifie an Equality of Extent in Writing and Tradition, by saying I grant <hi>this Doctrine</hi> (which signifies there the First deliver'd Doctrine) <hi>was afterwards by the Apostles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to writing.</hi> Whereas, whoever reads my 29th. Cor. will see I can onely mean by the word <hi>same Doctrine,</hi> a <hi>not-different</hi> Doctrine. Whatever the truth of the point is, this shows you have an habituall imperfection not to let the words you cite signifie as the Authour evidently meant them, but you must bee scruing them to serve your own turn.</p>
            <p>You quote mee p. 36. to say, that <hi>Primitive
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50748:29"/>
Antiquity learn'd their Faith by another method a long time before many of those Books were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally spread amongst the Vulgar.</hi> The summe of your Answer is, that when the Apostles <hi>who did miracles</hi> were dead, Writing then became needfull: But that in <hi>those Circumstances Orall Tradition was a sufficient way of conveying a Doctrine.</hi> What I note is that you ended your citation at the words <hi>[before those Books were universally spread amongst the Vulgar]</hi> but had you added what follow'd immediately to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat that period, <hi>[much less the Catalogue col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and acknowledged]</hi> you had been put to confess too that Tradition was a <hi>sufficient way</hi> for diverse Ages after the Apostles were dead, which had been little favourable to your Tenet. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain then that by citing mee by halves, as you do frequently, you slip the answering better half of my Arguments; and, here particularly, as appears by the words <hi>[much less]</hi> that part in which I put the <hi>most force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. 41. You put mee to <hi>say expresly</hi> that <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is the best way imaginable to convey down such Laws to us.</hi> Now if by the word <hi>such,</hi> you onely meant <hi>such as it concerns every man to bee skilfull in,</hi> and had so exprest it, you had done well, for 'tis my position; but you had brought an ill-resembling Instance of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and make mee seem to allow your Instance, and to affirm Tradition is the best way to bring down <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> as appears by your words. <hi>Mr.</hi> S.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50748:30"/>
               <hi>saith expresly it is; but how truly I appeal to the Experience, and the wisedome of our Law-givers who seem to think otherwise;</hi> making my word <hi>such,</hi> mean such as <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which is far from my meaning: in regard I judge not <hi>Magna Charta</hi> a thing in which 'tis every man's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular concern to bee skilfull in, but Lawyers onely whom others trust; few in <hi>England,</hi> but they being thoroughly acquainted with the Laws found there. Take your own Liberty, Sir, in making Parallells ('tis my Advantage you should, you pick out such aukward ones) but when you have made them, do not disingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously put them upon mee, and quote mee to <hi>say</hi> them <hi>expresly.</hi> Thus you use my words, <hi>Why may not hee mistrust his own Eyes,</hi> which (p. 16, and 17.) were apply'd by mee to the business of mistaking or not mistaking <hi>in transcribing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly</hi> a whole Book or correcting the Press, in which, we daily experience miscarriage; but you apply these words to your own senceless Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell of seeing the City of <hi>Rome</hi> p. 83, and then by such an application endeavour to make them seem ridiculous, as they must needs for you had discourst ridiculously, and by making them part of your Discourse, and not taking them as any part of mine, had made them so too. I could instance in many others of this nature, but I am too long already.</p>
            <p>P. 61. being to state the point, you alledge my words <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 13. That the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:50748:30"/>
cannot by <hi>[Scriptures] mean the Sence of them, but the Book, that is, such or such Characters not yet senc't or interpreted.</hi> And there you stop; my immediately following words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining my meaning are these: <hi>that is, such and such Characters in a Book with their Aptness to signifie to them assuredly God's mind, or ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them of their Faith.</hi> And this Explication you omit; which had been nothing had you not made an ill use of that omission; but your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills afterwards, and the loud out-cries in your Book in many places, of a <hi>senceless Book,</hi> my <hi>Ignorance</hi> of your <hi>Tenet,</hi> &amp; what not, are all groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon your own fly omitting those words in which I exprest your Tenet to bee, that those Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters were significative of your Faith; &amp; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what else you would have a Rule of Faith to bee but a <hi>Mean's to signifie to you God's Sence,</hi> or the Faith Christ taught those inspir'd Writers. It was one of my requests in my Letter that wee might agree to acknowledge what was Truth in one another's Books; but you use all the Arts Insincerity can suggest to deprave, wrest or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish my words, rather than I should appear to speak reason in any thing. All must bee mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous in your Adversary when your pregnant Fancy and dextrous pencil come to delineate it; which shews indeed much crafty wit, but I doubt the Reader will think it argues not too much Honesty.</p>
            <p>I affirm'd <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 17. that <hi>the numerous
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:50748:31"/>
Comments writ upon the Scripture and the infinite Disputes about the Sence of it even in most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning points, as in that of Christ's Divinity beat it out so plain to us that this</hi> (to wit to find out a <hi>Certain Sence of Scripture by their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation) is not the task of the Vulgar, that 'tis perfect phrenzy to deny it,</hi> which you quote p. 85. and diverse other places, leaving out still my words and sence that <hi>[this is not the task of the Vulgar;]</hi> (upon which that whole § proceeds) and impugning it accordingly: See your own words p. 86. making mee say <hi>The Protestants can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee certain of the true Sence of it,</hi> as if <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> and <hi>Vulgar</hi> were the same notion: Also p. 86. <hi>Hee tells us</hi> (say you) <hi>the numerous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Scripture are an Evidence that</hi> no man <hi>can bee Certain of the true Sence of it.</hi> This improves it into a very ample Falsification, for the word <hi>[no man]</hi> excludes all Catholikes too, and indeed all the world, however pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to interpret it; whereas I onely engage in the place cited against <hi>the Vulgar.</hi> And, after you have ended you Confute all built on your own omission of those important words, you single out (after your old fashion) two or three of my words <hi>['tis perfect phrenzy to deny it]</hi> and call it, a <hi>hot phrase;</hi> whereas 'tis very luke-warm taken in the occasion I spoke it; namely that the <hi>Vulgar</hi> could not bee <hi>certain</hi> of the <hi>right Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of Scripture,</hi> since even Learned <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators</hi> so strangely differ'd about it. How you

will clear your self of this <hi>kind</hi> Insincerity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out casting a mist before men's eyes, that they cannot read right, I cannot in your behalf ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin.</p>
            <p>P. 104, You quote mee twice as endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to prove that men may safely rely on a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and uncontroll'd Tradition.</hi> Which, though you pretend not my words, yet I count it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to impose upon mee such a Sence. <hi>Uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll'd</hi> joyn'd to Tradition is such another Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet as <hi>Sufficient</hi> joyn'd by you to <hi>Certainty.</hi> I, who contend for the <hi>absolute Certainty</hi> of Faith, would say <hi>Uncontrollable,</hi> not <hi>Uncontroll'd;</hi> for a thing may be <hi>Uncontroll'd</hi> meerly because it had the good Fortune that none had occasion to look into it, and so controll it: whereas no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can bee Uncontrollable but by virtue of it's Grounds 'tis built on, preserving it from a Possibility of <hi>ever</hi> being controll'd. Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in producing those two Citations from mee is as you declare it p. 105. is to show the <hi>Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness</hi> of my <hi>Demonstrations,</hi> that <hi>in order to demonstrate the uncertainty of Books and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings must suppose all those Principles to bee uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which (I) take to bee self-evident and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable when I am to demonstrate the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Orall Tradition.</hi> A hard case! yet it will bee harder to come of, for you never are more powerfull than when you use your wit to make Authours fall out with one another, and unnaturall mee with my self. But to the point:
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50748:32"/>
In the first Citation I say, <hi>That the common course of humane Conversation</hi> makes it a madness not to beleeve great multitudes of <hi>Knowers,</hi>—&amp;c. But I add <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 49. what you omit, that <hi>in the way of Tradition all Deliverers or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Forefathers are Knowers.—all the Knowledge requisit being of what they were taught and practic't accordingly all their lives.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, Sir, are those <hi>great multitudes</hi> of immediate <hi>Forefathers Knowers</hi> when they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver down a Book for a right one; that is, do they all <hi>know</hi> the Translation is right made, the Copy right printed or written, and all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisits which are needfull that they may bee tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said to <hi>know</hi> this Book is rightly qualify'd. You see then how far I am from contradicting my self, unless you show that I hold all Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menders or Accepters of a Book to bee <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as they are of the practicall Doctrine they were bred and brought up to, which I neither do, nor can with any Sence profess. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der also will see that the stratagem by virtue of which you made mee contradict my self, was your omitting those words of mine which made the contrary clear.</p>
            <p>The next place you cite p. 104. from mee to the same purpose, is this, that <hi>none but madmen can suspect deceit where such multitudes agree unanimously in a matter of Fact.</hi> Now the words <hi>such multitudes,</hi> mean <hi>all their immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Fore-fathers</hi> qualifi'd <hi>as Knowers,</hi> as I exprest
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50748:32"/>
myself a little before, which will veryill sute your purpose, in regard the matters of Fact employ'd about the <hi>delivering a right Book,</hi> as in transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, transcribing, pointing right &amp;c. of which their Sences onely can make them <hi>Knowers,</hi> are so inumerable, and minute, &amp; yet such that very great miscarriages may ensue upon a very little over-sight, that to think all Forefathers, can <hi>know</hi> no Fault in any of these interven'd, is such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant conceit, that onely a most obstinate passion could make a rationall soul entertain it. The point is at present that you affect to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent mee to the half part, and by that art you take mee up perpetually before I bee down; For it is not an agreement in <hi>any</hi> matter of Fact, but in such a one as may bee known by all, in which I place the force of being able to oblige others to assent to their proposalls.</p>
            <p>You treat mee far worse p. 105. making mee say that the <hi>Providence of God is no security against those Contingencies the Scripture is liable to, because wee cannot bee certain of the divine Providence or Assistance to his Church but by the Letter of Scripture;</hi> which is to put upon mee a ridiculous Argument, making mee infer <hi>there is no such Assistance,</hi> from this, that wee cannot bee Certain of it but <hi>such a way.</hi> Whereas Common sence tells every one that our <hi>Certainty</hi> being an Effect of the Thing's Existence, must depend indeed on their Existence, in regard we cannot bee <hi>Certain</hi> of what <hi>is not;</hi> But the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:50748:33"/>
things can <hi>exist</hi> whether wee bee <hi>Certain</hi> of them or no; I affirm then and charge upon you that I have no where either such words or sence in my whole book as you with a strange precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy (to say no worse) affirm p. 104. that I <hi>tell you Sure-footing</hi> p. 18. where my discourse onely pretends to show that, who will argue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly must first bee Certain of that on which hee builds his Conclusion ere hee asserts the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion it self; This was the tenour of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course there which I conceive to bee evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Cavill. If I err'd any where 'twas in sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing you onely took from Scripture that <hi>God assisted his Church in preserving a right Copy of Scripture</hi> and therefore argu'd preposterously if you inferr'd. God has a Providence over his Church in preserving right Scripture, therefore 'tis preserv'd right. But this I spoke onely with an If, and besides had good grounds for it: For I conceiv'd there being but two wayes to know this, by <hi>Revelation</hi> which you profess to have onely by way of Scripture; and by naturall Reason, whence you could not have it: For however meer nature might teach it's exact Followers there was a God, and that hee had Providence over his Creatures, (as it taught <hi>Socrates, Seneca</hi> and such like) yet I remember not that wee have any Ground to say meer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture inform'd any, God had a <hi>Church,</hi> much less that there was no way to <hi>Provide</hi> for her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in Faith, or deriving his Doctrine down
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:50748:33"/>
in her, but by way of Books. Hence I conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and conclude still it must bee either by <hi>Scripture</hi> or no way you can know God has such a kind of Providence over his Church.</p>
            <p>You are pleased to tell your Reader <hi>p.</hi> 119. that <hi>this Principle [That in matters of Religion a man cannot bee reasonably satisfy'd with any thing less than that Infallible Assurance which is wrought by Demonstration], is the main Pillar of Mr.</hi> S'<hi>s. Book;</hi> whereas I assure you, Sir, the last part of the kind slur you put upon mee, <hi>[which is wrought by Demonstration]</hi> was never either my words nor sence; neither Pillar nor the least part of <hi>Sure-footing:</hi> wherefore, as you put those words in a different Letter for mine, so you had done well to have put down the place too where those words were found; which you wisely omitted. If I had affirm'd that <hi>that Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which grounds Faith must bee wrought by Demonstration,</hi> how should I pretend the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> can bee sav'd who are manifestly incapable of Demonstration, as I also frequently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Understand then my Tenet at length, which you ought to have done e're you begun to write against it; but that to use your own words you thought it an <hi>absurd and ridiculous study to bend your brains</hi> to read my Book as <hi>you would do Euclid</hi> p. 292. which yet is no more but to consider attentively my Principles and my Consequences. My Tenet is that all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>have,</hi> and those who seek after Faith <hi>may</hi>

               <hi>have,</hi> and those who seek after Faith <hi>may have</hi> Assurance of their Faith wrought in them by <hi>Practicall Self-evidence,</hi> in the same naturall manner, but with far better Reason, than they beleeve there was a Henry the 8th. and, that 'tis onely Schollars that go about to <hi>Demonstrate</hi> what the Faithfull <hi>know,</hi> but, for want of Study or Reflexion on their own thoughts and on the Causes and Manners with which they were so assur'd, are ignorant how to make it out. I beseech you, Sir, repress this overflowing of Kindness in giving mee so many Advantages against you, and take a little pains to understand what I say, nor (to borrow your elegant expression p. 292.) suffer your self to bee so <hi>demurely discharged of a</hi> Study so necessary and so honorable.</p>
            <p>I had affirm'd in my Letter to my Answerer p. 5th. that it was <hi>a civill piece of Atheistry</hi> to say <hi>Faith is possible to bee false for any thing wee know,</hi> or that wee have onely Probability for our Faith; And you kindly tell us p. 135. that <hi>what M.</hi> S. <hi>calls a civill piece of Atheistry is advanc't in most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press terms by his best Friends.</hi> Sir, I account <hi>Rushworths Dialogues</hi> my best Friend, and I perceive you abuse the <hi>Preface</hi> of it notoriously, which was wholly design'd to evince the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry positions; citing the Author of it p. 132. to say that <hi>such a Certainty as makes the cause al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes work the same Effect though it take not away the absolute possibility of working otherwise, ought absolutely to bee reckon'd in the degree of true
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:50748:35"/>
Certainty,</hi> whereas hee only tells us there <hi>p.</hi> 7. that <hi>by Morall Certainty [some understood] such a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty as made your cause alwayes work the same Effect;</hi> whom a little after hee reprehends for undervaluing this for <hi>morall Certainty,</hi> which is <hi>true</hi> (or Physicall) <hi>Certainty;</hi> putting an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Certainty hee has that hee shall not repeat in order the same words hee spoke this last year; <hi>and yet</hi> (sayes hee) <hi>these men</hi> will say, I am <hi>onely morally Certain</hi> of it. Your injury then lyes here, that by leaving out the words at the beginning of the Citation <hi>by morall Certainty [some understood] such a Certainty</hi> &amp;c. you make <hi>him</hi> say what hee evidently makes <hi>others</hi> say, and condemns them for so saying; for hee is far from abetting their tenet tha a reall <hi>possibility to bee otherwise</hi> makes a true Certainty; but asserts that to bee <hi>truly Certain</hi> which they mistook for possible to bee otherwise or <hi>morally Certain;</hi> which is the plain tenour of his discourse, as it is the whole scope of that Preface to force the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary Position to what you would so disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuously impose upon him. The two next Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are onely mistaken; for, 'tis one thing to say what men would doe, did they love Heaven as they ought, or had they no Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in their Souls, another to ask what means is most efficacious to beget a hearty love of Heaven in their Souls; the prudentialness of their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in case of a higher probability onely, joyn'd with their undervalue of Heaven was
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:50748:36"/>
enough to make them miscarry; but 'tis a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion whether 'twas enough to elevate them suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently amidst the Temptations of our three Spirituall Enemies, to heavenly love so as to save them; or if they bee very speculative, against the Temptations of Fancy and the seeming Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the mysteries. Also 'tis another thing to ask what men should do if there were no Infallibility, or (which is all one to them) if they <hi>hold</hi> none; and, whether Infallibility or an absolute Impossibility Faith should bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, bee not incomparably the best for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and so, laid by God who ever does the best for his Creatures. As I would not therefore have the Protestants renounce all practice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion because they have not an Infallible means of knowing their Faith to bee true; so neither do I doubt, but had they such Assurance, their <hi>Faith</hi> would work through Charity with far more liveleness and steadiness than either it now does or can do.</p>
            <p>You abuse what you cite from mee p. 140. by impugning half the Sentence onely; the other half would have discoverd I spoke not of mans nature according to his morall part, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as 'tis <hi>cognoscitive</hi> and this chiefly in naturall Knowledges imprinted directly by his Senses on his Soul. Represent things truely, and then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute as much as you will, otherwise you but injure your self and abuse your Reader, while you go about with a preposterus Courtesy to oblige mee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:50748:36"/>
P. 145. According to your usuall sincerity you quote <hi>Rushworth</hi>'s Nephew to say that a few good words are to bee cast in concerning Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <hi>for the satisfaction of indifferent men who have been brought up in this verball and apparent res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Scripture;</hi> to which you add, <hi>who it seems are not yet arriv'd to that degree of Catholick Piety and Fortitude as to endeavour patiently the word of God should bee reviled and slighted.</hi> Wheras in the place you cite hee onely expresses it would bee a <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to indifferent men, <hi>to see the positions one would induce them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, maintainable by Scripture.</hi> Which is so different from the invidious meaning your malice puts upon it, and so innocent and unof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive in it self, that one who were not well acquainted with you and knew not your temper and over good nature to bee such that you car'd not to undo your self to do your Friend a <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> would wonder with what Conscience you could so wrest and pervert it.</p>
            <p>P. 146. You mention my explaining the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Tradition,</hi> which you carp at as <hi>tedious;</hi> and yet (as wee have seen by frequent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) all was too little to make you understand it, though I endeavourd there according to my utmost to render it unmistakable. But you mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take it here again, objecting that I <hi>instance in set forms, the Creed and ten Commandments, whereas the Apol. for Tradition sayes That cannot bee a Tradition which is deliver'd in set words.</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:50748:37"/>
It had been better you had put down that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors own words Apol. p. 81. which are, A <hi>Tradition (as wee have explicated it) being a Sence deliver'd</hi> &amp;c. for why was it not possible hee and I should explicate it diversly? But to the point. I speak of <hi>Tradition or delivery,</hi> you and the <hi>Apology</hi> of <hi>a Tradition</hi> or the <hi>thing deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd,</hi> which you confound. Now a <hi>Tradition</hi> or <hi>point deliver'd</hi> being <hi>Sence,</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi> abstracting from my particular manner of expressing it, hee had good reason to say there, that <hi>a Tradition</hi> is a <hi>Sence settled in the Auditor's hearts by hundreds of different Expressions explicating the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;</hi> nor do you any where find mee say but that, though the Creed and Ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bee the shortest expressions of the main points of Speculative and Practicall Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and so most sutable to the young memories I speak of, yet I no where say that Forefathers exprest the Sences contain'd in them <hi>no other way;</hi> or, that they did not deliver them <hi>in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of different Expressions,</hi> according as the manifold variety of occasions and circumstances, accidentally lighting, prompted the Fancies of the Teachers after a naturall kind of manner to declare themselves. You see, Sir, how unfortunate you are still when you would make us contradict our selves or one another; And the civillest Excuse for your perpetuall failings herein is to alledge that you are utterlyignorant of what you would impugn; and I wish that were the worst.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:50748:37"/>
You put upon mee p. 152. that unless a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to bee converted <hi>can demonstrate one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> Rule <hi>certain and Infallible, the other not, hee hath not found out the Rule of Faith.</hi> I wish you had told us where I say this, for I must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avow it as directly opposit to my Doctrine which is that our Rule of Faith's Certainty is Practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-self-evident, and known by virtue of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious familiar conversation with the nature of things, and, therefore, that persons to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted may come to Faith without demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all. I may perhaps say that in an Assent thus grounded there is found at the bottom what is <hi>demonstrable</hi> by a <hi>learned man,</hi> or apt to yeeld <hi>matter for a demonstration;</hi> but that those who come to Faith must <hi>demonstrate</hi> or <hi>frame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations</hi> (which 'tis manifest onely Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and good ones too, can do) is fa from my Tenet, however 'tis your <hi>Kindness</hi> to put it upon mee, right or wrong. You shall take your choice whether the Reader shall think you <hi>understand not</hi> the Tenet you are confuting, or that understanding it you wilfully injure it.</p>
            <p>You proceed p. 153. that <hi>according to Mr.</hi> S. <hi>Reason can never demonstrate that the one is a Certain and Infallible Rule, the other not.</hi> That <hi>never</hi> is a hard word; and it will seem won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull to some Readers I should say Reason can <hi>never demonstrate</hi> this, and yet in that very Book contend to demonstrate it by Reason my self; nay make that the main scope of my Book. But, Sir,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:50748:38"/>
those Readers, know not yet the power of your wit and sincerity, which can make mee say any thing, nay <hi>say</hi> and <hi>unsay</hi> as it pleases. Yet you quote my express words for it, <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 53. where you say I <hi>[tell</hi> you, <hi>Tradition hath for it's basis Man's Nature, not according to his Intellectualls, because they do but darkly grope in the pursuit of Science,</hi> &amp;c.] I deny them, Sir, to bee my words or sence; you have alter'd the whole face and frame of them by putting in the word <hi>Because,</hi> which makes mee discourse as if man's Intellectualls could <hi>never</hi> arrive at <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> nor consequently <hi>Certainty;</hi> and you keep the Reader from knowing the true sence of my words, by curtailing the sentence with an <hi>[&amp;c.]</hi> my words are, <hi>not according to his Intellectualls, darkly groping in the pursuit of Science, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected thoughts or Speculations, amidst the misty vapours exhal'd by his Passion predominant over his rationall will]</hi> which discovers I speak of our Intellectualls plac't in such circumstances, or employ'd about such a matter, as our Passion or Affection is apt to blind and mislead us in it, which wee experience too too often. But do I therefore affirm our understanding can <hi>never</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at Science at all, or that our Passion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hales vapours to hinder us from seeing the Truth of the first Proposition in <hi>Euclid;</hi> or was it ever heard that any man was transported so by his Passion as to deny there was a <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th? Or can any one out of Passion bee igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:50748:38"/>
of or forget what is inculcated into his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces almost every day, which naturall Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I there make the Basis of Tradition? Pray, Sir, reflect on my words once more and on the Tenour of my Discourse, and you shall see it onely says, that Tradition has for it's Basis man's Nature, not according to his <hi>morall part,</hi> which is of it self pervertible, nor yet his Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectualls as subject to his Moralls, but on <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Knowledges imprinted by direct Sensations,</hi> not subject at all to his Will, but necessary and inevitable: and when you have done this, you will easily see how you injure mee, though I expect not from you any Acknowledgment of it. You commit those Faults too often to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern your self in such a trifle as any handsome Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Your next Citation p. 153. layes on load. 'Tis taken out of my 2d. Appendix p. 183. My whole Discourse there is to show how Reason behaves her self <hi>in finding out the Authority shee is to rely on</hi> that this is God's Sence or <hi>Faith,</hi> and how <hi>in the points of Faith</hi> themselves. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the former I discourse there §. 3. and have these Expressions, that <hi>No Authority deserves assent farther than true Reason gives it to deserve; that the Church's Authority is found by my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to bee Certain;</hi> that <hi>'tis perfectly rationall to beleeve the Church assuring mee the Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is engag'd for such and such points;</hi> that <hi>Gods and the Church's Authority as Objects</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:50748:39"/>
a conceit of themselves in my mind as they are in themselves, <hi>oblig'd my Reason to conclude and my Iudgment to hold them such as they were;</hi> nor have I the least expression of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of naturall Reason's certifying mee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly of the Ground of my Faith, which can no wayes bee done by <hi>Acts of reflected Reason,</hi> (which I there speak of) but by <hi>demonstrating</hi> it. After this §. 4. I come to discourse how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently Reason bears her self in order to the <hi>points of Faith</hi> or the mysteries themselves. Hereupon I have these words. p. 183. <hi>Reason acts now much differently than formerly. Before I came at Faith shee acted about her own Objects, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives or Maxims by which shee scan'd the Autho rities wee spoke of; but in Acts of Faith shee hath nothing to do with the Objects of those Acts, or Points of Faith.</hi> Then follow immediately the words you cite, <hi>Shee is like a dim-sighted man; who us'd his Reason to find a trusty Friend to lead him in the twy-light, and then rely'd on his gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance rationally without using his own Reason at all about the Way it self.</hi> Which most plainly signifies, that, as a dim-sighted man cannot use his Reason about the Way, for that requir'd, it should well affect his Senses, and imprint it's right notion there, (which it did not,) but yet could use his Reason about chusing a trusty Friend to guide him, for this depended not on his dim-sight, but the converse and negotiation with his neighbours and relations which hee had
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:50748:39"/>
been inur'd to, and so was capable to wield and manage such a Discourse: So our Reason, <hi>dim-sighted in the Mysteries of Faith</hi> in which neither Senses nor Maxims of Human Science had given her light enough, could not employ her talent of discoursing evidently and scientifically to conclude the <hi>Points of Faith</hi> themselves; but yet was by Motives and Maxims within her own Sphere, enabled to scan the nature of <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and find out on which as on a trusty Friend shee might safely rely. This, Sir, is evidently my Discourse, from whence you will needs force mee to say Reason is dim-sighted about the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority wee come to Faith by or <hi>the Rule of Faith.</hi> Now my whole Discourse in that very place aiming at the direct contrary, and you leaving out the immediately foregoing words which clearly discover'd it, I hope you will not take it ill, Sir, if I tell you I fear any sincere Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it will judge, that though you hold Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing a Jewell, yet you would not bee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to go to too much cost for it. Especially when he reflects that you build better half your Confutation in your Book on such kind of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling mistakes, and hope to blind it and make it take by Sophister-like quibbles, flouts and jeers with which you use to sound your own tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. I expected, sweet Sir, some First Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of your Discourse, and I see now you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend those Artifices for such; none else have I met with, nor do you build on any thing so
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:50748:40"/>
much as these; but, one of these laid for a Ground, you run on with such a Carreer as if you would overthrow all the Sence and Reason that ever comes in your way.</p>
            <p>You tell mee p. 158. by a parallell Discourse to mine against my Lord of <hi>Downs</hi> that my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations are <hi>none unless I vouch some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularity in my Method above what's in others,</hi> which p. 160. you say you <hi>remember not I have done any where.</hi> It seems you read my <hi>Transition</hi> not with any sober intent to understand it and speak solidly to it, but onely to carp at it, and break jests upon it. Have you so soon forgot the pleasant mood it put you into p. 3, and 4. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test then that the Method I there declare my self to pursue is <hi>particular</hi> above what I ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in any of your Controvertists; not that they want better Parts to lay it, but because they want a good Cause to bear it, and give them leave to follow it. I declare also that I hold that Method sufficient to demonstrate by, though I pretend it not the exactest than can bee made. As for those great men whom you alledge to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in demonstrations, <hi>(Charles Thynn</hi> I leave to bear you company, you are both such merry Blades) I doubt not but, were the business well examin'd, their differences spring from not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending heedfully to the <hi>Method of concluding;</hi> and that no miscarriage could ensue in any Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, were the way of Discoursing perfectly laid, agreed to, and exactly follow'd; nay
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:50748:40"/>
that those few Differences amongst Geometrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans arise from the same defect; as, were it seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, I could show particularly (with the help of a Friend, you must think) in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous one about <hi>angulus contingentiae.</hi> But to our present purpose; meethinks, Sir, you may remember, a thing call'd a Letter to my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer, where I endeavour'd at least at some means to settle some <hi>particularity</hi> in our Method above what has been practic't in other Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies formerly, begging you would agree to it that so wee might both follow it; but you would have none you thank't mee: Since then you would not accept it when offer'd, you should not ask for it again when your Book is writ and the Circumstances of using it past. But perhaps there lies the policy of it! You end with a Glance or two at my <hi>Self-confidence?</hi> But are you Propheticall in this too, Sir, that 'tis some proud and vain humour in mee, and not rather my Assuredness of the Truth of my Cause, and of the Conclusiveness of my Method, which makes mee deliver my self undauntedly? See my Letter to my Answerer where I have these words p. 18. <hi>By this means it will bee quickly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd whether or no you have overthrown my Discourse by showing it ill-coherent, and how far 'tis faulty: that, if I cannot clear it to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, I may confess my fault and endeavour to amend it. For, however I see my Grounds evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet I am far from judging my self Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:50748:41"/>
in drawing my Consequences: though I see withall the Method I take, will not let me err much; or, if I do, my Errour will bee easily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable; because I go not about to cloud my self in Words, but to speak out, as plain as I can, from the nature of the Thing.</hi> Had you a desire to practice the due candour towards mee I should have done to you, you would not have sought occasions to put in upon a personall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding my self in my performances, which I so frequently disown and place all my advantage in my Cause and my Method. But you are angry I deliver my self so boldly in what I take to bee Truth; I beseech you, Sir, is it not naturall for any one who judges hee speaks what's Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, to express himself fear lesly when hee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes against an Adversary of the Truth whose Cause hee has espoused; as, 'tis on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for one who judges hee has onely Probability for what hee sayes, to speak dis-confidently, and condescendingly, and when hee indeed sneaks not daring to speak out, then to praise himself and his party for <hi>modest</hi> and <hi>moderate</hi> men? You know by experience, Sir, 'tis. Has there in our late age come out a Book more brisk than this of yours, not in <hi>asserting,</hi> but in scorn, and proud petulancy, and (which is to bee pittied) proud of an aiery jest or some gay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit? Shall I bee bold to tell you, Sir, what is <hi>Self confidence?</hi> To undertake to write a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course about the Ground of Faith, without so
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:50748:41"/>
much as one Principle that deserves to bee call'd such to bless himself with; to lay for Grounds all along Falsifications of his Adversaries mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and words, and then quibbling, taunting and vapouring as if all the world were his own. Lastly, to tell his Auditours soberly and sadly out the Pulpit all is <hi>God's Word</hi> hee preaches, and press they should beleeve him; and yet when hee writes against us, confess all hee preaches concerning <hi>Salvation</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> to it, <hi>may possibly bee false;</hi> that is, for any thing hee ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely <hi>knows,</hi> hee has not told them one true word all the while. This, Sir, I must needs confess, is such a Heroick strain of self-confidence that, however it bee familiar and naturall to others, yet I dispair for my part ever to attain it. To bear ones self as holding a thing a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration which he judges hee has Evidence that 'tis such, is a puling and trifling kind of <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceit;</hi> but to carry it out with the greatest Formality in the world as if it were most Certain, and yet hold at the same time and profess 'tis <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to bee false,</hi> that is, may for any thing any man <hi>knows, bee shown false to morrow,</hi> is a noble and gallant <hi>Self confidence,</hi> and such a one as fears not the face of any man living.</p>
            <p>P. 161. You come to examin my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations <hi>à priori,</hi> and in order to it, my four Grounds, which you affirm you <hi>will set down in</hi> my <hi>own words.</hi> Which intimates you <hi>did not</hi> do so <hi>formerly,</hi> though it bee your duty
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:50748:42"/>
to do it <hi>alwayes;</hi> However 'tis a Kindness which I am bound to thank you for, and as far as I discern you have not faltred in it, of which I here make my hearty Acknowledgment. But, Sir, may I not fear this particular <hi>Resolution</hi> of yours here to bee <hi>Sincere</hi> springs hence, because in this Sect. 2. where you put down my words, you do not yet go about to apply them to your Discourse, and attempt to confute; which in your next Section p. 163. you endeavour? I foresee you will bee shrew'dly tempted there, for want of other Answer, to break your <hi>resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> till wee come there then I leave you with my hearty wishes of strength &amp; constancy against that habituall Infirmity which so often overcoms all your <hi>resolutions</hi> of that nature.</p>
            <p>And wee are now come to your third Sect p. 163. (the place of the triall of your perseverance) where you begin your confute; and contend first that my Demonstration <hi>would conclude too much</hi> viz. as you tell us p. 164 that if it were true, <hi>it would bee impossible any Christian should turne Apostate or Heretick,</hi> or <hi>that any Christian should live wickedly.</hi> I marry, this were a rare Demonstration indeed! But, how comes my demonstration to bee thus guilty of a plot to make all the world Saints, or rather of drawing after it a Conclusion so extravagant. By virtue of a direct Falsification both of my words and Sence, by cogging in a word little in show but very large in Sence, namely the monosyllable
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:50748:42"/>
               <hi>[All]</hi> making my Principle run thus that the <hi>greatest hopes and fear are apply'd to the minds of all Christians;</hi> which you put down here in the Italick letter, the same you quoted my words in. I beseech you, Sir, review my <hi>own words</hi> put down lately by your self p. 161. 162. at what time you made that good resolution, and see if any such word bee there; But, what's most materiall is this; Let the Reader survey your following discourse which aims to confute mee, and hee will see'tis wholly and solely built on this word <hi>All,</hi> so that your own Falsification is still the First Principle, which gives the Strength and Life to your Confutation. What use you make of it may bee seen p. 164 l. 8. <hi>That any Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> &amp;c. Ib. l. 12. <hi>That any Christian should live wickedly</hi> l. 18. <hi>That any Christian should turn Apostate</hi> l. 26. <hi>But all Christians have those Arguments of Hopes and Fears strongly apply'd.</hi> l. ult. <hi>'Tis necessary all Christians.</hi> Again p. 165. l. 3. (which I desire the Reader to note that hee may see how bold you are in your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing things upon mee) <hi>If these causes bee put in all the Faithfull actually</hi> causing <hi>as (say you)</hi> Mr. S. <hi>saith expresly in his Grounds;</hi> Whereas I assure the Reader Mr. S. <hi>sayes expresly no such thing.</hi> But to proceed p. 165. l. 8. &amp; 9. <hi>Tis impossible there should bee any defection,</hi> &amp;c. l. 14. <hi>Tis impossible any single Christian.</hi> P. 167. <hi>It concludes there can bee no Hereticks or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states</hi> &amp;c. This, dear Sir, you use mee: First you
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:50748:43"/>
put upon mee other words and meaning, and then overthrow most powerfully not what I said or meant, but what you had counterfeited mee to do; which victorious way of confuting runs thorough the better half your Book.</p>
            <p>You affirm p. 165. that I <hi>liberally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in other places</hi> this (to wit, that <hi>'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible any single Christian should either totally Apostatize or fall into Heresie) is a genuine Consequence from my Principles.</hi> Surely, Sir, your great plot is to have mee thought a direct mad man or Frantick; For never did any man moderately in his wits advance a Position and pretend to <hi>demonstrate</hi> it, which is contrary to the Eye sight and frequent Experience of the whole world; nay write a whole Chapter as I did <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 65. how <hi>Heresies come in,</hi> and yet maintain in the same Book no man can turn Heretick that is that <hi>no Heresy could ever come in.</hi> Well, but what are those <hi>other places</hi> which must prove mee a <hi>liberal Acknowledger</hi> of such an unheard of Paradox? You assign four places p. 165, &amp; 166. The first you introduce mee thus. <hi>Hee tells us</hi> (and then you quote my words from <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 54.) <hi>That it exceeds all the power of Nature (abstracting from the Cases of madness and violent disease) to blot the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of this Doctrine out of the Soul of one single Beleevor.</hi> I assure you, Sir, I <hi>tell you</hi> no such thing, and that I have neither those words nor sense in my whole Book, which makes mee doubt you
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:50748:43"/>
did not so much as <hi>make</hi> a <hi>resolution</hi> here to <hi>set down my own words,</hi> as you did formerly; and I wish for your own sake, you did not resolve the <hi>contrary.</hi> My Doctrine is that <hi>the Knowledges of this (or Christ's) Doctrin,</hi> may be blotted, not onely out of the Soul of <hi>one single Beleever,</hi> but <hi>all</hi> Beleevers, in case it bee laid there onely opinionatively, or imprinted slightly by a flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sermon or wordish discourse, apt to go in at the one ear and out at the other. My words in that place cited are these? <hi>It exceeds all the power of nature (abstracting from madness and violent disease) to blot knowledges THUS FIXT out of the Soul of one single believer.</hi> And, what mean the words <hi>[thus fixt]</hi> 'tis told you in the same p. 54. in <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> that 'tis by <hi>so oft repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sensations;</hi> which (in the foregoing page, where that discourse begins) is explained to bee, by <hi>Impressions upon the Senses, not made once but frequently, and in most, many times every day;</hi> and that <hi>to make those more express and apt to bee taken notice of, their lives are to bee fram'd by the Precepts they hear and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Examples they see.</hi> All this is impli'd in the words <hi>[thus fixt]</hi> as found in that place; which therefore being very prudent in your generation, you demurely omitted; else it had seem'd no great Paradox (which 'tis your constant endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make mee still speak) that <hi>no one man,</hi> unlesse mad or much diseased, can forget what hee daily experiences in others
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50748:44"/>
others and practices himself. But, grant all true you pretend to, and that every man must needs have or retain the knowledge of Christs doctrin however imprinted; yet, do I any where say that <hi>no man can act against knowledge,</hi> and so <hi>relinquish Tradition,</hi> and by that means <hi>turn Apostate</hi> or <hi>Heretick?</hi> when you find that Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in mee, cite it, and let us see it, otherwise barely to alledge mee saying they cannot but <hi>know</hi> it, argues not I say they must necessarily <hi>follow</hi> it. The last of those four Citations which you bring for this point p. 166. immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows this first (now discust) in <hi>Sure footing</hi> p. 54. whence it concerns the same matter, namely the Indelibleness of Knowledges thus fixt out of the Soul of one single man; as is Evident to him that reads the passage in it's proper place; though false dealing bee so naturall to you, you assure the Reader p. 166. that in <hi>the full career of my bumbast Rhetorick I deliver it</hi> (that is, as you express it a little before the Impossibility <hi>that Tradition should fail in any one single person) roundly without fear or wit;</hi> whereas neither there nor in that whole Discourse is there one sylable concerning Traditions being <hi>adher'd</hi> to or not <hi>adher'd</hi> to, (this Subject beginning the next Discourse in these words, <hi>All this is well, may some say, in case Tradition had been ever held to)</hi> but onely of it's <hi>Certainty</hi> or <hi>Regulative virtue,</hi> founded on naturall Knowledges imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by frequented Sensations in such a manner
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:50748:44"/>
as is impossible to bee blotted out in one single Testifier or part of Tradition. I am loath to think or say too hardly of you, Sir, onely I say 'tis strange a meer Chance should produce so constant an Effect of perverting my Evident Sense (oft times words too) in each passage. It may bee the reason of your mistaking mee here and in some other passages was this, I minded not <hi>Rhetorick</hi> at all, but onely <hi>Sense;</hi> &amp; you, (as became a solid Confuter) minded not the <hi>Sence</hi> at all but onely the <hi>Rhetorick:</hi> which by mee was never aim'd at either there or in any other part of my Book: If what I write bee <hi>Truth,</hi> and my Expression <hi>Intelligible,</hi> I have my End; and can without Envy permit you to dress up your own Falshoods in the gingle of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods and empty flourishes.</p>
            <p>The second place brought to make mee <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledge</hi> that it follows from my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>no man</hi> can possibly relinquish Tradition is found in you p. 165, and 166. and thus; <hi>Since no man can hold contrary to his knowledge, nor doubt of what hee holds, nor change or innovate without knowing hee doth so, it is a manifest Impossibility a whole Age should fall into an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity so inconsistent with the nature of one sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man.</hi> Is here any liberall acknowledgment that no man can <hi>desert Tradition?</hi> Or is there a word here to that purpose? but onely, that no man can <hi>doubt of or hold the contrary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to what hee knows,</hi> nor go about so visible an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as <hi>innovating</hi> without <hi>knowing</hi> hee does so;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50748:45"/>
with which yet may well consist that not onely <hi>one single man</hi> but <hi>all mankind</hi> may (for any thing is there said) knowingly and wilfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert Tradition and turn <hi>Apostates.</hi> I wonder, learned Sir, what you are akin to that Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher who maintain'd <hi>Snow</hi> was black! you have so admirable a faculty of identifying the most disparate nay contrary notions; and by a knack of placing things in false lights, make even Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions which signifie the self-same, become perfect Contradictions.</p>
            <p>The third place of mine, which you say must make mee <hi>liberally acknowledge it a genuine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence from my Principles that 'tis impossible one single man should relinquish Tradition,</hi> is cited by you p. 166. from <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 87. That <hi>it is perhaps impossible for one single man to attempt to deceive posterity,</hi> to which you add in another Letter [by renouncing Tradition]. It had been better in such nice points to put down my own words, especially when you put them in a different Letter. Mine are, <hi>'Tis perhaps impossible that they should mislead posterity in what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves conceit to bee true;</hi> which is different from the Words and Sense you represent for mine; for many weak persons by Sophistry or fine words pretended from Scripture and baptiz'd <hi>God's Word,</hi> may bee inveigled to <hi>conceit</hi> that <hi>Tradition</hi> is false; in which case should they <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Tradition,</hi> yet they would not therefore mislead posterity from what they <hi>conceit true;</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:50748:45"/>
which is all I there say or undertake for. But, the main is, you represent mee to say, 'tis perhaps impossible <hi>in one single man;</hi> which reaches any man whether <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad;</hi> whereas my discourse there proceeds upon <hi>good</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> men onely. It begins thus p. 89. <hi>For, supposing Sanctity in the Church, that is, that multitudes in it make hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their first love—had those Fathers,</hi> (that is those <hi>Holy men) misled Posterity,</hi> &amp;c. and then follow some of the words you cite, I mean all of them that are mine. This being so, bee Judge your self, Sir, whether (bating you the <hi>perhaps,</hi> and speaking <hi>absolutely)</hi> it bee not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible</hi> for <hi>one good</hi> and <hi>holy man</hi> to <hi>mislead po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity in what he conceits to be true;</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not consist well enough with this branch of my discourse, that great multitudes may turn <hi>bad,</hi> that is, chuse some <hi>false good</hi> for their last end; and then, out of affection to that, disregard what's true, what's false, and mislead their children contrary to their own knowledge.</p>
            <p>You say p. 171. that <hi>the onely thing I offer in</hi> that discourse to prevent this Objection is this <hi>Sure-footing.</hi> p. 65. <hi>'Tis not to bee expected but some contingencies should have place where a whole Species in a manner is to bee wrought upon,</hi> &amp;c. And, had there been no more, mee thinks it might have made you wary to challenge mee with the direct contrary, had you not resolv'd to lay the necessity of my contradicting my self in every passage for one of your <hi>first Principles</hi>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:50748:46"/>
to confute mee with. But I offer'd far more and more obvious preventions than that. See the immediate <hi>Conclusion</hi> from my <hi>Grounds</hi> put down by your self p. 162. which one would think should inform you best what is the most <hi>genuine consequence</hi> from the same Principles; <hi>This put, it follows as certainly that a</hi> GREAT NUMBER OR BODY <hi>of the first Beleevers, and after-faithful in each Age, would continue to hold themselves, and teach their children as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves had been taught, that is, would follow and stick to Tradition,</hi> &amp;c. Does a <hi>great number</hi> or <hi>Body</hi> signifie <hi>all,</hi> not one excepted, which you falsly put upon mee? How disingenuous a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is this; to perswade your Reader those are <hi>not</hi> my Consequences from my Principles which I make my self, but those which you make for mee? and how do you make them? by perverting constantly my words and sense. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, you know I had writ a discourse, declaring how Heresies came to bee introduc't, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one would think any sober Confuter that were not bent upon Cavill, ere hee had chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd mee to hold that <hi>no one man could possibly turn Heretick,</hi> that is, that <hi>no Heresie could pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly come in,</hi> should have look't first in that place to see how and by what means I made Heresies <hi>actually come in.</hi> But you were resolv'd before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand what to do; that is, to make mee speak contradictions, and so it was not your Interest to see it or take notice of it. Otherwise, there
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:50748:46"/>
you had seen mee <hi>prevent</hi> all the imputations which you by virtue of your forg'd monosyllable <hi>[All]</hi> had put upon mee. See <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> p. 66. <hi>We will reflect how an Heresie is first bred. Wee must look then on Christs Church not onely as on a Congregation, having in their hearts those most powerful motives—able of their own Nature to carry each single heart possest by them,—but as on the perfectest form of a Common-wealth, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving within her self Government and Officers to take care all those Motives bee ACTUALLY APPLY'D AS MUCH AS MAY BEE to the subject Laity; and that all the sons of the Church, &amp;c.—notwithstanding, it happens sometimes that, because 'tis impossible the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of discipline should extend it self in so vast a multitude to every particular, some one or few persons by neglect of applying Christian motives to their souls, fall into extravagancies, &amp;c.—<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and—if Governours bee not vigilant and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, draw other curious or passionate men into the same faction with themselves,</hi> which words would have clearly shown you that, for want of <hi>due application,</hi> (which was one of the requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites my demonstrations went upon) the Cause fell short of producing its effect of adhering to Tradition. And this you might have seen neerer hand, namely, in the foregoing Discourse, the very same which pretended to demonstrate; where, speaking of the Application of the Cause to the Patient p. 63. 64. 65. I end thus: <hi>In a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:50748:47"/>
word, Christianity urg'd to execution, gives its followers a new Life, and a new Nature; than which a neerer Application cannot bee imagin'd.</hi> So that you see I make account it's <hi>Application</hi> depends upon it's being <hi>urg'd to Execution;</hi> and what is it that urges things to <hi>Execution,</hi> but <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Disciplin?</hi> I wish, Sir, when you are to confute a rational Discourse, you would not stand running after Butter-flies, and catching by the way childishly at this little word, and the other little word, to play upon them jestingly; but have patience to read it thorough, and take the whole substance of it into your head, and so endeavour to speak to it solidly. This is the way to benefit your Readers, (to whom you owe this duty) nay a far better to credit your self with understanding men, than all those petty tricks of impertinent Wit, and iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Expressions, which you so passionately dote upon.</p>
            <p>I am heartily weary of so illiberal a task as to spend ink and paper, much less time, in disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering mens defects; and I assure you, Sir, I am very sorry your carriage made it necessary; whereupon, though I see much rubbish of this nature behind, and have overslipt too very much, yet I should have ended, did not I find my self highly concern'd to defend one Assertion of mine, <hi>than which</hi> you (who use no <hi>hot phrases,</hi> but are all Civility and Sweetness) say p. 173. <hi>nothing can be more impudent;</hi> I humbly thank
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:50748:47"/>
you, Sir. This most impudent position is this, that <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> p. 65. being to meet with the Objection, that <hi>there have been many Hereticks or deserters of Tradition,</hi> I say, <hi>If wee look into Histories for experience of what has past in the world since the first Planting of Christianity, wee shall find far more particulars fail in propagating their kind than their faith.</hi> Now, Sir, if this bee prov'd <hi>not at all impudent,</hi> which you judge <hi>most impudent,</hi> I hope the rest, which you judge <hi>less impudent,</hi> may easily pass for <hi>blameless.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let's to work then, and because 'tis your business as well as mine, I beseech you lend mee your thoughts to go along with mine from one end of the 7th. discourse in <hi>Sure-footing</hi> to the other, Company may do much in making them attentive; otherwise, I see plainly they will stand loitering and gazing by the way at this odd word, or the inelegancy of that phrase, or noting some passages that may bee prettily mistaken and make excellent good sport; by which means You who as you say p. 292. are apt to <hi>unbend your brains without bidding,</hi> will hardly ever bee drawn to go forwards with a deliberate pace half the way. In the said dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course then p. 65. you see I design to <hi>clear an objection</hi> of my own which I conceiv'd obvious, namely that <hi>there have been actually many Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks or deserters of Tradition.</hi> I make my way to it p. 66. by asserting that the way of Tradition is as efficaciously establisht in the very grain of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:50748:48"/>
mans nature as what seems most naturall, the propagation of their kind: Hence I come at last to that <hi>most impudent</hi> assertion that <hi>more have faild in propagating their kind than their Faith.</hi> Proceeding to proove it, I show p. 66. how <hi>Heresy,</hi> or a failing to propagate Faith, happens; and, I allow p. 68. that it must bee perform'd by <hi>deserting Tradition,</hi> and chusing (at least for a show) another Rule, that so they may have occasion to break from the former Church. But I affirm withall p. 65. §. 3. that assoon as the breach is sufficienly made, and the novellists begin to bee shap't into a body, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever for a show they still would seem to keep to, yet that they presently desert the new Rule they had taken up, <hi>and the naturall way of Tradition again recovers it self;</hi> that, <hi>the Reformers themselves make use of it to keep their company together;</hi> that, <hi>Children are taught they are to beleeve their Pastors and Fathers even in interpreting Scripture;</hi> that <hi>the first Reformers punish them if they break from their body, and hold not to the Sence of Scripture they give them.</hi> And hence I conclude p. 74. that <hi>the number of the Actuall deserters of the naturall way of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition have been but few, to wit, the First Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volters that the descendents of these Revolters fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd the way of Tradition, however misplac't;</hi> then I added some considerations for Grounds to ballance the number of Failers in propagation with the number of those who faild in Tradition; and as reasons why I concluded this number less:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50748:48"/>
but you never use to speak to my reasons; onely you mistake my discourse and my conclusion to mean not onely the <hi>First breakers,</hi> but their <hi>descendents</hi> too, which I make account return naturally to the Traditionary way; then you denie and impugn like a learned logician, the Conclusion it self, amplify strangely upon your own mistake of it, instancing in all the Countries almost East, West, North and South; triumph mightily, and would have mee show you a whole nation that refus'd to marry: As if my Conclusion could not bee true, unless such a rare sight were show'd you all at a clap.</p>
            <p>E're I come closer to the proof of my Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I foresee I am to make good first that even the deserters of Tradition, when they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sufficiently enfranchiz'd from the disciplin of the former Church and that their followers settle into a kind of Body under them, bring in again the way of Tradition, or rather indeed permit nature to work both in the new brood that grow up under those Fathers who had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserted Tradition, and in those deserters themselves: nothing being more naturall than both for the Fathers, Elders or Governours, to desire and even expect the children, Posterity and Subjects should follow their judgments, and not to make themselves wiser than their betters; nor for the descendents and young ones credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously to beleeve those whom they look't upon ever with an awe and respect, and to permit their lives to bee fram'd by <hi>their</hi> conduct. I
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50748:49"/>
affirm then that even in all those Sects that have faln from the Catholick Church, whether Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, Lutherans, Presbyterians, or whatever else they bee that pretend to hold to Scripture, the Generality if not all are continu'd to the former body or immediately foregoing Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Tradition, and not by virtue of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture Evidence uniting their understandings. For what a wild conceit it is to imagin that the Children throughout a whole Kingdom of <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans</hi> for example, should still light to interpret Scripture just as did their Forefather Lutherans and thence unanimously hold to the Lutheran Profession? And the same in Protestants, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, Arians, Pelagians. And the like may bee said in some sort even of Turks and Heathens, that 'tis not the virtue of any motive that they go upon which keeps up a Succession of men of the same Tenet, but the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall force of <hi>Education</hi> at first and <hi>Custome</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which wee experience daily to have so strange a Power, that the most evident Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are scarce able to wean persons, otherwise very rationall, from the most absurd and weakly grounded Prejudices; and that to root out judgments thus planted from their Souls, seems as violently to shock and strain nature in them as if one went about to tear a limb from their Body. If it bee acknowledged then, as it must, that <hi>Education</hi> has such an incomparable force in preserving an unanimousness between Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goers
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:50748:49"/>
and Posterity, and Education consists in making the descendents think &amp; act as did their Forefathers, wee shall discover that <hi>Education</hi> hath in it the very nature of <hi>Tradition;</hi> and consequently, that 'tis by virtue of Tradition any Sect continues the same; which devolves into this, that, therefore, as soon as any Sect is form'd it returns or slides back (if it continues) naturally into the way of Tradition.</p>
            <p>I am afraid, Sir, by this time you are ready to object (for 'tis your way, out of an over-zealous affection to find Absurdities in your Adversary, to catch at any thing that seems so at first sight without maturely weighing it) that by this means I make all Protestants, Quakers, nay Turks and Heathens too of our Religion, by making them follow our Rule of Faith, Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and you have a little to that purpose p. 147. and elsewhere much more if I remember right. But, Sir, I shall undeceive you easily, by distinguishing between Tradition taken at large, or as I call it <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 74. <hi>the natural way of Tradition,</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition. <hi>That</hi> has the abetment, and Concern of many Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ties to make it follow'd, and in Publick and universally-concerning matters of fact, it layes a kind of force upon man's Nature, as in the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, <hi>Mahomet, Alexander,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This</hi> has, besides, Supernatural Assistances of the Holy Ghost, to strengthen the greatest force of Nature. But to omit other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50748:50"/>
differences, what concerns us most at present, is, that <hi>This</hi> pretends to bee an Uninterrupted Derivation from Christ, whence 'tis call'd <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> Tradition; whereas any other, for example <hi>yours</hi> in following your Fore-fathers, can pretend uninterruptedness no farther than your <hi>first Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former;</hi> whose immediate Ancestors being Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik, your chain is broke, or at an end; whence, for the same reason, this short-lin'd Tradition ought to be called <hi>his,</hi> (for example the <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran)</hi> and not <hi>Christian</hi> Tradition. The more therefore you, or any other adhere to any <hi>other</hi> Tradition, so much farther you recede from, and are more obstinate against <hi>Christian</hi> Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; since, doing so, you hold more firmly to that which was a renouncing the other.</p>
            <p>These rubs remov'd, wee advance to our point, which is to examin whether, in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, more particulars have fail'd propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their <hi>Kind</hi> than their <hi>Faith.</hi> To do this the shorter and clearer wee will pitch upon one Instance which your self mention, namely, of the vast multitudes which since <hi>Luther,</hi> in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Denmark, Sueden, England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> &amp;c. have renounc't the <hi>Roman-</hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lik Faith. And, since by our former Discourse and indeed common Sense, none in any of those Countries were <hi>Actual Deserters</hi> of Tradition (by which I mean <hi>Catholik</hi> or <hi>Christian Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)</hi> but those who once <hi>held it,</hi> which their Descendents did not, but either follow'd Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50748:50"/>
at large, or <hi>their</hi> Tradition, that is the Tradition of what these Deserters educated them to, hence wee are to exclude all the innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Descendents from those <hi>Actuall Deserters,</hi> as persons unconcern'd at all in my Discourse, my express words ever excluding them. And, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause those Deserters began not all with <hi>Luther,</hi> but some fell 20. some 40. years after him, I will put my self upon the disadvantage to put them all to be fal'n sooner, to wit, about 20. years after <hi>Luther:</hi> it being all one to our Case, for no more could fall but all those that actually then did fall (in regard wee allow their Descendents to continue their Fathers steps) though wee put them to fall all at once. Imagin then that in the Year 1537. all were fall'n that did fall ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>then, before,</hi> (I mean, before that Year, since <hi>Luther)</hi> and <hi>after</hi> that time; what proportion may wee conceive they might bear to all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes then living whether in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church, whether in those parts of the world or <hi>America,</hi> whose Conversion was then well begun? I conjecture wee should be very liberall to grant they equall'd one third (that is were the fourth) part of those who were found living, in the Year assign'd and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to Tradition.</p>
            <p>This lai'd, let us consider next how many wee may conceive to have <hi>fail'd</hi> in that Year and ever since that is for 128. Years <hi>in propagating their</hi> kind. And first wee will take a view of those
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50748:51"/>
who die by naturall Deaths or Casualties, before they enter into the ordinary Circumstance of Propagation, <hi>Marriage;</hi> and yet conduc't, in their proportion, to the instilling Faith into those they converst with. For, assoon as any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to that pitch of age as to express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Christianly in their Language and Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, 'tis evident they connaturally insinuate into others of an inferiour pitch they converse with, to their slender Degree, the same things they hold and practise; and so are truly parts of the Church Essential as <hi>delivering,</hi> or parts of <hi>Tradition;</hi> and, though wee might begin much sooner to reckon them such, yet wee will to avoid dispute take them from the age of 14. to 24. before which time if any marry, there are as many that marry later, and if this be not enough to ballance it to an Equality wee will allow all lay-people that live unmarry'd, and all that marry and yet die before they have children or never have any, into the bargain. Those then between the age of 14. and 24. reckoning the whole time of man's life 90. Years, are the 9th. part of mankind that were found living in our Age. Putting then all the present Livers in that Age to die in the Year wee pitch't upon (that so wee may for clearness reduce our Discourse to the same determinate compass of time) wee may well put the 9th. part of mankind living in that Year to die between 14. and 24. that is, to die without conducing to propagate their kind,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:50748:51"/>
though they contribute to propagate their Faith; and, if this number bee thought too great, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the healthfulness of that Age, wee will account it but a tenth part, though in truth it deserves to bee held rather an 8th. or 7th. because of the numerousness of that Decad in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the persons found Living in those Decads, beginning from the 60th. 70th. and the 80th. Year, which are very few. Certain then 'tis according to our best morall Estimation a tenth part of mankind within that prefixt Year die (I mean a tenth part of those who do then die) who have had a hand in propagating Faith and not their Kind. Next, let us multiply that tenths part by the number of the Years elaps't since, that is, from the Year 1537. that is for 128. Years, and 'tis plain that wee shall have 128. tenths, that is near 13. times as many as liv'd in that whole Year. Wherefore, the Actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Deserters of Tradition reaching but to one 4th. of the mankind that liv'd in that Year as was shown above, it follows that the number of those since <hi>Luther,</hi> who dy'd without propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their kind amounts to 4. times thirteen times, that is, above 50. times more than those who <hi>actually deserted Tradition since that</hi> time or those who fail'd to propagate their Faith.</p>
            <p>Again, let us weigh the multitudes found in any one Year to belong to the whole Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Body of the Catholik Church, whereever
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:50748:52"/>
extended, with the innumerable Companies of all the several Religious Orders of men and women with their Lay-Attendants, and consider what proportion they may be held to bear to the whole Body of the Church living in the same Year, and so, to those that die in that Year: That wee may not exceed, wee will allot them to take up but a four hundreth part of the Church; nay (that wee may no more be troubled with Mr. <hi>Tillotsons</hi> uncharitable railery p. 172. 173.) wee will allow them to amount but to a five<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hundreth part of those who liv'd or dy'd in that Year wee pitcht on; that is there died that Year onely a fivehundreth part of the Church that propagated their Faith and not their kind; which low number is a most advantageous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of ours, if wee take out as wee ought all those that dy'd from 14. to 24. formerly spoken of. But, bee it onely a fivehundreth part; yet this multiply'd by 128. the number of the Years since, there being four times 128. found in 500. rises to bee a full fourth part of the Totall living in the Year 537. that is full as many as were the <hi>Actuall deserters</hi> of Tradition since Luther. Add, that the persons now insisted on (of whom wee might double the number,) are all of them absolutely the most Eminent parts of Tradition that are, viz. the whole entire Body of the Church Governours or <hi>Ecclesiado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens;</hi> a very few of whom experience has taught us to have been able to propagate our
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:50748:52"/>
Holy Catholik Faith to many Nations in a few Years; the rest such whose exemplary devout lives exhibit the practice of Christianity in so eminent a perfection, and with such influence over the hearts of the Generality, that next to the Sacred Authority, and Exalted Sanctity of the others, nothing more fruitfully propagates Christian Life and Doctrin than those who are thus barren to the world.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the number of Propagaters of their Faith, and not their Kind amongst those who were formerly Catholikes; but what a strange counterpoise does it add, if wee go about to compute those vast Nations which since <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> have of new accru'd to Tradition, and who have been spiritually <hi>geniti in Evangelio;</hi> and this, (which enhances our Advantage) not by Lineall Descendents in the same place, but a few Externs, and in such places, to wit, Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, where there has been no Deserters of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition formerly, nor any since to diminish their number by their counterballance. Whence I have title to add not onely the first Adherers to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Religion there, but also all their Poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity since who have stuck to it, they being Clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to Tradition, and so counterdistinguish't to Relinquishers of Tradition. Which if wee compute ever since the time about <hi>Luther,</hi> who can averr (considering the vastness of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories they possess) they equall not the Totall of the Deserters of Tradition that have been
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:50748:53"/>
from the beginning of the Church.</p>
            <p>One Consideration is yet more than all the rest; but, I must not lay claim to it at present, lest I break bargain, having confin'd my self to the circumstance of time since <hi>Luther;</hi> yet 'tis not unlawfull to mention it. 'Tis this; that for diverse Centuries before <hi>Luther</hi> there had not been any considerable number of Actuall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters of Tradition, (as who is read in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Histories cannot but know) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all Followers of it, that is, Propagaters of it practically to the immediately undergrowing Faithfull. During which time if wee calculate how many, both in those lay-persons who dy'd from 14. to 24. and all those Religious and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Persons, the best Propagaters of Faith, fail'd in propagating their kind, it will bee very difficult (I had almost said, most impudent) to deny but they unproportionably almost exceed the number of the Actuall Deserters of Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that have been since Christ. For I see no reason to iudge by what I have read in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall History, that the number of the Actuall Relinquishers of the Church have exceeded the number of the Churches Totall, taken in any determinate time, thrice repeated; If you can show there were more, you may please to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us with the sight. In the mean time I hope you understand by this time my position is so secure that I can allow you 40. times as many, and yet fear no danger of being <hi>most impudent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:50748:53"/>
You may alledge perhaps this is but an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion now, but was not my Sense when I writ. To which I answer, I have shown it to have been my meaning already out of my plain words, and whoever reads <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 74. and 75. shall see there expresly the Grounds laid for each branch of this discourse: which, Sir, had you been pleas'd to read over with a mind, to admit them into your understanding faculty, you might have sav'd mee this labour of dilating on them, and your self the blemish of ranting against a position as that <hi>than which nothing can bee more impudent,</hi> which onely your careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to read it, or resolution not to heed it, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd from being <hi>most innocent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were not unseasonable perhaps, if I should here amuse you with another Paradox, namely that the <hi>deserting</hi> Tradition <hi>strengthens</hi> it; I mean, that, Tradition, when a Heresy arises, gains more of Intensiveness and vigor, than it loses in it's Extensiveness; nay that the Intensiveness which accrues to it by that means is the way to make it branch out afterwards into a far greater Extent. I begin my Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this from your words p. 176. <hi>If I should see a whole nation fail because no body would marry or contribute to propagate</hi> &amp;c. By which I perceive you misunderstand the nature of the things in hand. In the business of <hi>marriage</hi> there is nothing to contrast with it on the other side, but being naturall and held withall a holy state, they that
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:50748:54"/>
will (that is, they who will not voluntarily oblige themselves to another holier) may undertake it; whence it has no Universal Opposit, and so takes it's free course, when convenient, and is liable onely to common Contingencies. But in things of <hi>Corrupt Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> the matter is carry'd quite otherwise; and, because either side has a great opposition against the other, and withall a <hi>very great,</hi> or rather a kind of <hi>Universal</hi> sway and force, hence the course of such things consists in a kind of Undulation: So that, now, Corrupt Nature when shee finds her self a little more free, follows her own tendency or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension, and bears downwards; and now again Supernatural and Gracious Assistances with which the Wisdome of the Eternal Father had furnish't his Church superabundantly, being shock't and excited even by this contrary motion of Nature, begin to put themselves forwards into an opposit motion, and strive more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously to raise themselves upwards. For example; <hi>Disciplin,</hi> which is to <hi>apply</hi> Christian motives, by tract of time grows remiss in the Church; hence decay of virtue, dissoluteness of life, addiction to material goods, and, consequently Ignorance, creep in by insensible degrees into diverse parts, so that it happens there are multitudes of corrupt Members in the Church, and regardless of any duty; who, therefore, want nothing but a fair occasion, and one to lead them to break all ties of Virtue and Obedience, and run into the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:50748:54"/>
utmost Extravagancies. Nor can wee think but in the course of such a vast variety as is found in a World, now and then there will bee found amongst those wicked men some notable fellow, of a subtle wit, a bold spirit, and a plausible tongue, so circumstanc't that hee can hope for Impunity by the friendship of some great person, and so dares give way to his proud desire of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving followers, or his private spleen, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Church's Faith, and shake of the yoak of her disciplin. Hereupon, the rampires of Government and disciplin being forc't and violently broken down, presently like a Torrent or Inundation all those whose hearts were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with spiritual pride, or other vices, like brute beasts, leap after one another out of the Fold of the Church, and threaten to trample down all that's Sacred; Reviling the Church, and laying to her charge all the faults found in particular persons, as if they were Effects of her Doctrin; though their own knowledge tells them otherwise; and make use of failings in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Governours to renounce and extirpate the Government it self.</p>
            <p>On the contrary those good Catholikes who by this <hi>Trial are made manifest,</hi> stir up their zeal both in behalf of their Faith and their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, instituted by Christ; and detest the vicious Lives and Pride of those Rebels, the Parents of such a horrid Revolt. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, alarm'd, begin to look into the Cause
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:50748:55"/>
of this distraction, and to provide wholesome Remedies. They call Councils (Generall ones if need bee) to straiten afresh Ecclesiasticall Disciplin; enjoyning the Officers of the Church to stand every one to his Charge. They take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to promote worthy Officers, and to advance Ecclesiastical Learning; they recommend afresh by their grave Authority the points of Faith, to the <hi>Ecclesia Credens,</hi> as the <hi>depositum</hi> preserv'd uninterruptedly in the Church from Christ and his Apostles, and establish them in a particular beleef of them; nay make these more intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and rational by Explicating them more at large; or, if the Heretical party involve and confound them in ambiguous words, they <hi>define</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> them in language most properly suting to the sence writ in the hearts of the Faithfull; and, lastly, anathematize the Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if they prudently judge their contumacy irreducible; that, so, the remaining Body may concieve a just horror and aversion against that Rebellious party, and bee preserv'd uninfected with their contagious Communion. All which Advantages and much more are visibly found in the Change made in the Church by that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough-renowned Synod the Council of Trent occasion'd by <hi>Luthers</hi> fall. Nor is this all; for the Faithfull not onely grow more virtuous by the reformation of Church-disciplin, but even by the Calumnies of their Adversaries: Again, the learned party in the Church are exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:50748:55"/>
to far greater industry, and consequently Knowledge, by the insulting opposition of the Churches enemies: whose disgracing points of Faith for absurd and contradictions, stir up divines to show their conformity with acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd naturall Truths, as does their calling into question the Ground and Certainty of Faith, open the understandings of those who defend it, to look into the Causes on which Gods sweet and strong Providence has founded it's infallible Perpetuity, and so demonstrate it. A task no Heretick durst ever attempt, finding Principles failing him to begin with; that is, Causes laid by Gods Providence to build his Congregation on; whence all they can do is to talk gaily and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly about the Conclusions themselves and laugh at Principles.</p>
            <p>From which discourse is Evident that by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Heresy (which purifies the Church of all her ill humors, and rectifies and makes sound what remains) <hi>Tradition</hi> renews as it were it's Youth and recovers it's vigor; whence also it must needs Propagate and extend it self still unto more and more Subjects, as is also daily Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc't. 'Tis seen also that the abundance of corrupt Humors begets Heresy at First; for multitudes fall away <hi>then,</hi> wheras <hi>afterwards</hi> scarce two or three in any Age desert the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Banner. It appears also that Secular interest or desire of Liberty and Spirituall Pride, not zeal of Truth begun and continu'd the breach; I
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:50748:56"/>
mean in the Leaders; for afterwads they are content to remain where they are without troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themselves to propagate the Truth to other Nations; nay, they have let the <hi>large region of Nubia</hi> run to wrack (for as Mr. T. to make us smile, tells us p. 174. <hi>Alvarez</hi> sayes, it was <hi>for want of Ministers)</hi> and never sent so much as one single Protestant Parson to assist them. It shows also, how unconcern'd the Catholik Churches Stability is in all the Heresies that have or shall fall; since they onely tend to confirm and radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate more deeply in the hearts of the Faithfull the Points of Faith they renounc't; to occasion reformation of disciplin and so to purify their virtue. Lastly, it shows how Tradition or the Delivery of Faith by the Living Voice and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Catholik Church is so immovably planted by the hand of the Almighty, that it loses nothing by all the Actuall Deserters of it that ever have been, but is by that means onely prun'd of it's saples branches to shoot out in due season livelier and farther. But, to return my Friend.</p>
            <p>I hope Sir you will pardon mee if I have rather taken pains to open your understanding a little in acquainting it more fully with that part of my doctrin is totally mistook, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with your Faults; in lieu of which I here pardon you all the Injuries you have done my meaning or words in neer the other half your book, that is from p. 176. to p. 300. though I see
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:50748:56"/>
them many, and some of them very gross ones. The Testimony part I would not <hi>here</hi> neglect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as you shall see shortly, they concern not my book as any <hi>proofs</hi> of the point, and so are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to bee allow'd room in my future Answer: which designes nothing but against your reasons. You are resolv'd to bee brief in them, and I hope to bee briefer; in which, I thank you, you have helpt mee much by your manner of handling them. I will pass by divers of your little quirks upon my whether real or pretended mistakes in things unconcerning, and onely touch upon what is more pertinent.</p>
            <p>And first, I am sorry I must begin with the old complaint that you mistake quite (whether purposely or no let others judge) what was my intent in producing those Testimonies. Can you really and in your heart think they were intended against the Protestants, that you set your selves so formally to answer them? or can you judge mee so weak a Disputant as to quote against you the 2d. Council of <hi>Nice</hi> or the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Trent</hi> so elaborately; whereas I know you would laugh at their Authority as heartily as you did at my First Principles? Sure if I meant it I am the First Catholick Controvertist that ever fell into such an errour. My intent, manifest in the Title and the whole course of my writing there was this, that having deduc't many particulars concerning the Rule of Faith
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:50748:57"/>
which manner of Explication might seem new to Catholik Controvertists, I would endeavour to show to them rather than to you that both others of old, and the Catholik Church at present favourd my Explication. This was my main scope, however, as divers Testimonies gave mee occasion, I apply'd them by the way against Protestants.</p>
            <p>Your second mistake is found p. 304. where you accuse mee to have <hi>committed as shamefull a circle,</hi> &amp;c. and why, because according to mee Scripture depends upon Tradition for it's Sense, and yet I bring Scripture for Tradition. Sir, my Tenet is, that nothing can sence Scripture with the <hi>Certainty</hi> requisit to build Faith upon but Tradition; which yet well consists with this, that both you and I may use our private wits to discourse topically what sence the words seem most favourably to bear. And you may see I could mean no more by the many deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons I make thence alluding to my Tenet, which yet I am far from your humour of thinking all to bee pure <hi>God's Word</hi> or <hi>Faith,</hi> nor yet <hi>Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,</hi> as you put it upon mee in other Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies p. 308. Though I make account I use never a Citation thence, but to my judgment I durst venture to defend in the way of human skill, proceeding on such Maxims as are us'd in word-skirmishes, to sound far more favourably for mee than for you.</p>
            <p>But let's see what work you make with my
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:50748:57"/>
Authorities. After you have unworthily abus'd <hi>Rushworth,</hi> in alledging him rawly to say <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is no more fit to convince, than a Beetle is to cut withall,</hi> whereas his Discourse runs thus, that as hee who maintains a Beetle can cut must cut with it, but cannot in reason oblige others to do so; so they who <hi>hold Scripture is the true Iudge of Controversies, and fit and able to decide all quarrells and dissentions against the Christian Faith, bind themselves,</hi> &amp;c. After this prank (I say) of the old stamp, you put down p. 303. three of my Testimonies from Scripture, and immediately give a very full and ample Answer to them all in these words. <hi>From which Texts</hi> if Mr. S. can prove <hi>Tradition to bee the onely Rule of Faith, any more than the Philosopher Stone or the Longitude may bee prov'd from the 1 Cap. of</hi> Genesis, <hi>I am content they should pass for valid Testimonies.</hi> To which my parallell Answer is this. <hi>From which Reply, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant experience of the like formerly, if it bee not evident that Mr.</hi> T. <hi>will never with his good will deal sincerely with his Adversary, but in stead of confuting him, impose on him still a False meaning, and impugn that in stead of him, I will yeeld all his frothy Book to be solid Reason.</hi> I beseech you, Sir, where do you find mee say or make show of producing those Testimonies to prove <hi>Tradition the onely Rule of Faith.</hi> For Truth's sake use your Eyes and read. Do not I express my self <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 126. to produce
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:50748:58"/>
the first Citation to show how Scripture <hi>seconds</hi> or abets my foregoing Discourse meerly as to the <hi>Self-evidence</hi> of the Rule of Faith. Does not the second contend for the <hi>Orality</hi> of the Rule of Faith, it's <hi>Uninterruptedness,</hi> and <hi>perpetuall Assistance of God's Spirit,</hi> and the third of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing it by the way of living Sense in <hi>men's hearts?</hi> And, though I say those places speak not of <hi>Books,</hi> but deliver themselves in words not competent to another Rule, yet I contend not they <hi>exclude</hi> another Rule, or say there is but <hi>one Rule</hi> and no more. There was indeed p. 12. another Testimony from St. <hi>Paul,</hi> contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing the <hi>Law of Grace</hi> from <hi>Moses his Law,</hi> which sounded exclusively; but you were pleas'd to omit it, and so I shall let it stand where it did.</p>
            <p>You advance to my Testimonies from Fathers and Councils, and never was young gentleman so fond and glad that hee had found a hare sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as you are to have discovered whence I had those Citations: Presently <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, all is mirth and triumph and Jubilee. You are a Seer, Sir, and will find out the Truth by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and so I had as good ingenuously confess it. 'Twas thus then. When my book was nere printed, some Friends, who had read my <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,</hi> dealt with mee to add some Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; alledging that, in regard I follow'd a way of Explication which was unusuall, it would give it a greater currency to show it consonant,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:50748:58"/>
though not in the whole Body of it, yet in the most concerning particulars to the Sentiments both of the former and present Church. I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw the disadvantage my little time would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily cause me; yet, willing to defer to the Judgment of my Betters, I resolv'd it. Casting about in what Common-place-book I might best look, for I had not time to rummage Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, nor am I so rich as to have a plentifull one of my own, it came into my mind there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse of that nature in that book where you made so fortunate a Set, and caught such a covy of Citations in one net together. I ask't first the Authour's leave, who answer'd, that when a Book was once made publick it was any one's that would use it; nor knew I, till you came to teach mee more manners, I ow'd any account to any man else; neither do I think your self in your Sermons stand quoting all the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place-books or private Authours where you meet a Testimony or Sentence transcrib'd you make use of. Hereupon I took the book with mee to a Friend's Chamber near the Press, where Proofs already expected my correcting hand; and there, having no other book by mee, fell to work. This hast made mee examin nothing, being very secure of the perfect sincerity of the Authour I rely'd on, but put them down in his words and order. This, Sir, is candidly the true History of that affair, which will spoil much of your discourteous vapour, showing a great deal
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:50748:59"/>
of empty vanity in you, to magnifie so highly such petty trifles, and so totally unconcerning the main of the business You laugh p. 305. that I who confest my self a <hi>bad Transcriber,</hi> transcrib'd him; how childish a Cavill is this? As if every one who is to bring Testimonies, whether hee like his task or no, must not <hi>tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe</hi> them from some place or other; yet you tell mee ironically, you <hi>will do mee the right to assure the Reader</hi> (that I) <hi>do it very punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and exactly.</hi> I wish, to requite you, Sir, I <hi>could assure the Reader</hi> you had as <hi>punctually</hi> and <hi>exactly transcrib'd mee;</hi> you had sav'd a great deal of precious credit by it, and I a great deal of precious time and ungratefull pains in laying open your Insincerity. But, to our Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
            <p>The first is from the Synod of <hi>Lateran.</hi> The force of which you say p. 306. <hi>lies in the word [deliver'd] which is indifferently us'd for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance by writings or word of mouth.</hi> But, Sir, there are also in that Testimony the words <hi>prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> and <hi>teaching,</hi> and I do not beleeve it is so <hi>Indifferent</hi> to you whether you <hi>preach</hi> by <hi>word of mouth</hi> or no, that you should say the word <hi>Preaching</hi> sounds not conveyance of a thing <hi>orally.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Testimony has the same Exception, and the same Answer. But you say this Council particularly this part of the Epistle were except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against by some. What matter's it, so they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:50748:59"/>
did not except against it for this passage or this Doctrin (which may serve for Answer also to the mistaking Exceptions against the 7th. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councill which follows next) Thus <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> are both excepted against, yet are both commonly alledg'd and allow'd where the Reasons of those Exceptions have no place.</p>
            <p>Next follow your Answers to the Fathers I alledg'd. But first p. 310. you must mistake <hi>Rushworth,</hi> next mee. For <hi>Rushworth</hi> speaks not (I mean in the first Citation) of <hi>Delivery,</hi> but of a point <hi>delivered;</hi> nor do I here intend to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> thence the Certainty of Delivery or Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which you proceed upon; for, making <hi>Fathers</hi> parts of <hi>Tradition,</hi> it would make the same thing prove it self. Understand then right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sir, what I am about, and then I shall accept your impugning it for a favour. <hi>The Truth of the thing</hi> is one thing, and the <hi>Iudgment of a person concerning it,</hi> is another; And 'tis not to evince the Truth of the point I produce these Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, for in the order of Discoursing the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Traditions (or <hi>First Authority's)</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, antecedes and gives strength to all the other inferiour and dependent ones. What I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aim at then is only to show that <hi>thus they judg'd</hi> (not to convince the Truth of the Thing from their Judgment) and thence to show my self not to be <hi>singular</hi> in thus judging. Whence also 'tis that I entitled this part <hi>Consent of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> &amp;c. Retract then, I beseech you, Sir, any
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:50748:60"/>
such thoughts or expressions as that I would hence <hi>convince Tradition to be the whole Truth of Faith, demonstrate, prove it:</hi> For I intend to prove no more by the rest then by those from the Council of Trent, which onely aim to show that so and so that Council said and held.</p>
            <p>The First Testimony of a Father is Pope <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestines;</hi> the <hi>force of which you think quite spoild</hi> (p. 310.) by <hi>Binnius his other Reading</hi> of such a word. And why I pray? unless he could make it out his reading were true, the other false; which I see not attempted. But you let it pass, and answer that <hi>[retain'd by Succession from the Apostles till this very time]</hi> may mean <hi>by Scripture, as well as by Orall Tradition.</hi> I conceive not, and I give you my reason; because, who make <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> their Rule, are unconcern'd whether their <hi>Faith was retaind to this very time from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles by Succession,</hi> or no: For, though all the world apostatiz'd, and so interrupted that <hi>Succession,</hi> yet, as long as they have the Letter of Scripture, it being <hi>plain to all,</hi> their Faith is retain'd still. What you quote this Father afterwards to say of Scripture, wee heartily say Amen to, so you mean by <hi>Scriptures</hi> that Book <hi>sen'ct by its proper Interpreter</hi> (as to points of Faith) the <hi>Church.</hi> And, you are to show he meant otherwise.</p>
            <p>You choke with an &amp;c. better half of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Testimony p. 311. which spoils your answer to the first; for it speaks of his <hi>present dayes</hi>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:50748:60"/>
when the Scripture was not onely left by the Apostles, but spread and to bee had, and yet that <hi>many nations of those Barbarians who beleeve in Christ, had</hi> (even then) <hi>salvation writ in their hearts without Characters and Ink, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently keeping the ancient Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Substance of your Answer to <hi>Origen</hi> 312. is onely this, that unless I mean <hi>by Churches Tradition preserv'd by order of Succession, mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call interpretations of Scripture</hi> so deliver'd down, you <hi>assure</hi> mee <hi>Origen is not for my turn.</hi> And I <hi>assure</hi> you, Sir, 'tis so learned an Answer that I dare not oppose it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tertullian</hi> is next, to whom by offering to wave him, you show your self 312. <hi>little a Friend; and no kindness is lost for hee is as little a Friend to you</hi> driving such as you in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions from any Title to dispute out of or even handle Scripture, yet you say he saies no more but <hi>beleeve what is</hi> [Traditum] deliverd; though as alledg'd by mee <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 133. hee sayes <hi>much more</hi> in a large intire Testimony which you not so much as mention. You tell mee also hee meant <hi>deliver'd by the Scriptures,</hi> but you strain hard to make it come in. And <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> is the unlikeliest man in the world to provoke to the Scriptures, who tells us (de praescrip. c. 16.) <hi>Nihil proficit congressus Scripturarum, nisi plane ut aut Stomachi quis ineat eversionem, aut cerebri. Scripture-disputes avail nothing but meerly either to make ones Stomack or his head turn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:50748:61"/>
But, alas, Sir how are you gravell'd with the two First Testimonies from <hi>Athanasius</hi> and how slightly you pass them over p. 313. The Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants first maxim is Beleeve no men, <hi>nor Ancestors nor Church, but search</hi> the <hi>Scriptures, that is seek for your Faith there:</hi> Against which way his whole discourse is bent, as may bee seen surefoot: p. 133. 134. Is <hi>Faiths coming</hi> down by <hi>Ancestours</hi> the same as <hi>coming down by a book?</hi> or doe not the words, <hi>[from Christ by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers]</hi> mean <hi>[by words expressing the Sense in their hearts,]</hi> but <hi>[by a book not to bee Senc't by them, but plain of it self?]</hi> The third Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony expresly saies. <hi>'Tis to bee answer'd to those things [which alone of it self suffices] that those are not of the Orthodox Church, and that our Ancestors never held so.</hi> You tell mee <hi>it is a gross errour</hi> that hee thought this alone (or without Scripture) <hi>might bee sufficient;</hi> I wonder what mean the words <hi>[which alone of it self suffices:]</hi> if they bee not exclusive of any thing else as <hi>necessary,</hi> words have lost their significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I my reason. I but, hee quotes Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it afterwards! True; and hee expresses himself to do it <hi>lest</hi> Adversaries <hi>from his being wholly silent should take occasion to bee more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.</hi> That is, the reason of the thing requir'd it not, but the unresaonableness of the Carping humour of Adversaries. You alledge his words <hi>That Faith which was profest by the Fathers in the</hi> Nicene <hi>Council according to the Scriptures</hi> 315.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50748:61"/>
l. 3. 4. &amp;c. <hi>is to mee sufficient,</hi> &amp;c. Whence your discourse makes his <hi>opinion</hi> to bee that <hi>Scripture</hi> is the <hi>sufficient Rule of Faith.</hi> Lord? Sir, where are your thoughts wandring? or what's the Nominative Case in that clause <hi>[is to mee sufficient]</hi> to the word <hi>is?</hi> Is it not <hi>that Faith:</hi> to wit, the <hi>Nicene,</hi> which you mistake for the <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> and joyn the Epithet, <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> to Rule of Faith, which in the Testimony is joyned to Faith? Your conceit that <hi>it seems hence the Scripture was to him the Rule to judge the Creeds of Generall Councills</hi> is a very weak one: hee told you before his Faith came to him by <hi>Tradition of Ancestours;</hi> all that is here inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated is that hee judg'd the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed to be <hi>according to the Scriptures;</hi> and what Catholik judges not so of that and the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> too, and yet holds not <hi>Scripture</hi> which is to bee interpreted by the Church the <hi>Rule and Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard to judge the Church by?</hi> To use your own words p. 332. <hi>You use a wretched importunity to perswade Testimonies to bee pertinent;</hi> yet all will not do, and your too violent straining them makes them the more confess their naturall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy.</p>
            <p>But now comes the Testimony of <hi>Clemens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus,</hi> charg'd to be taken (not by mee, but by the Authour I borrowed it of) out of the middle of a long Sentence, and both before it and after it <hi>Scripture</hi> nam'd so as to make it quite opposit to our Tenet. I have already gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50748:62"/>
account of my action; and my Adversary, now become my Judge, charges it not wholly upon mee. Alas, I am not able to read the Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies in the books and understand them there, 'tis such a peece of mastery; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am fain to take them upon trust from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that <hi>can</hi> read them there. But my <hi>Sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, how hee will acquit himself of so foul an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation is left to any Ingenuous Papist to judge</hi> &amp;c, Sir, let mee tell you, you should consider circumstances ere you come to lay on such heavy charges. I beseech you was the book in which this Seducer (forsooth) us'd this Testimony writ against Protestants who hold <hi>Scripture, the Rule of Faith,</hi> or against some Catholik Divines holding the Opinion of <hi>Personall Infallibility?</hi> Clearly against the later. This being so what was hee concern'd to transcribe the whole large Testimony, no wrong being done to them? ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther position of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Tradition,</hi> which hee cites, or of <hi>Scripture</hi> which hee cites not, equally making against that Tenet; or rather that passage of <hi>Ecclesiasticall Tradition,</hi> being far more efficacious upon them than that which concern'd <hi>Scripture</hi> which they account not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory unless interpreted by the Church. By this time the Reader will discern there was a great deal of rashness in the Accuser, but no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sincerity at all in the Alledger. Nor is there the least danger of the Testimonies following, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding them who <hi>patch together abundance of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:50748:62"/>
false words and fictions that they may seem ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally not to admit the Scriptures;</hi> For what is this to us whose endeavours are to lay <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> beginning from First Principles why wee and every man may and ought <hi>rationally admit the Scriptures;</hi> and neither make our Faith ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by admitting into it what's uncertain, nor leaving any excuse to Atheisticall Impiety in not admitting what's Certain? This is the summe of my aim and endeavours, though nothing will content you, but that wee admit the Letter to bee plain to all, and, by consequence, to you; and then your Fancy is to bee accepted for God's Word, and your pride of understanding will bee well at ease.</p>
            <p>You pass over nine of my Testimonies; two from St. <hi>Basil,</hi> and three from St. <hi>Austin,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by mee <hi>Sure-footing</hi> p. 135, 136, 137. one from <hi>Ireneus,</hi> and two from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and another from St. <hi>Peter Chrysologus, Sure-footing</hi> p. 138, 139. sleighting them as but a <hi>few;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, speaking of Testimonies from the Fathers, as you do here, you had answer'd but eight in all; which you seem by your words to judge such a great multitude in comparison of 9, and those 9, or <hi>those few which remain</hi> (as you call them) so inconsiderable for their number in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the other numerous or innumera le 8, that the paucity of their number made them less deserve speaking to. Yet a careless generall kind of Answer you give such as it is p. 318. tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:50748:63"/>
the Reader that <hi>there is nothing of Argument in those few which remain, but from the ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this word Tradition;</hi> which wee will needs take for <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> You add p. 318. that <hi>you need not show this of every one of them in particular; for, whosoever shall read them with this Key, will find that they are of no force to conclude what hee drives at.</hi> I was going, Sir, to use your own words, and to ask <hi>with what face</hi> you could pretend <hi>this?</hi> Let's bring the book; I'le undertake it shall not blush to tell you how careless you are of what you say. I omit that the word <hi>Tradition</hi> doth by Ecclesiasticall use signifie in the first place <hi>unwritten Tradition.</hi> Moreover, that wee may let Mercy triumph over Justice, wee will pardon the first Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; found p. 135. though St. <hi>Basil</hi> by counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing <hi>Tradition of Faith,</hi> to the <hi>conceits</hi> of the Heretick <hi>Eunomius</hi> seems to mean by <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> Sense receiv'd from Fathers attesting; this being the most opposit to Conceits or new-inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fancies that can bee; for even an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Scripture may bee a Conceit or Fancy newly invented, whereas what's barely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd cannot bee such.</p>
            <p>The 2d. is, the same St. <hi>Basil</hi>'s p. 136. <hi>Let Tradition bridle thee; Our Lord taught thus, the Apostles preach't it, the Fathers conserv'd it, our Ancestours confirm'd it, bee content to say as thou art taught.</hi> Is not here enough to signifie <hi>unwritten Tradition?</hi> Did Christ <hi>teach it</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50748:63"/>
it in a <hi>written Book?</hi> or the Apostles preach it by <hi>book</hi> or is the <hi>perpetuating</hi> it by <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Ancestours</hi> the keeping it by way of <hi>writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The third is St. <hi>Austin's</hi> p. 136. <hi>I will rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve those things which are Celebrated now by the Consent of Learned and unlearned, and are confirm'd throughout all</hi> Nations <hi>by most grave Authority.</hi> Is <hi>universall consent</hi> and most <hi>grave Authority of all nations,</hi> the book of Scripture or written Tradition? or rather is it not most Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently unwritten universall <hi>Tradition</hi> or Sense in the hearts of <hi>all Beleevers</hi> learned and unlearned, or the Church Essentiall?</p>
            <p>The 4th is from the same St. <hi>Austin. 'Tis manifest that the Authority of the Catholik Church is of force to cause Faith and assurance.</hi> Do these words <hi>[Authority of the Catholick Church]</hi> mean the <hi>Book of Scriptures?</hi> Or can I desire more then this Father offers mee in express terms? or a greater Testimony that you are to seek for an Answer to it then the strange Evasion you substitute instead of a reply? Especially if wee take the Testimony immediatly following, <hi>which from the best establisht Seats of the Apostles even to this very day is strengthen'd by the Series of Bishops succeeding them; and by the Assertion of so many nations.</hi> Is here the word <hi>Tradition</hi> pretended Indifferent and apt to bee taken ambiguously? and not rather <hi>Assertions of so many nations,</hi> or <hi>Consent of nations,</hi> and <hi>Authority of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholik Church, of force to cause Faith and Assu
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:50748:64"/>
rance?</hi> which to demonstrate is the whole En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour of Sure-fooring.</p>
            <p>The 5th is the same Fathers cited p. 137. <hi>The Faithfull do possess perseveringly a Rule of Faith common to little and great in the Church.</hi> Is the word <hi>Church</hi> the same with the word <hi>Tradition</hi> or in danger of being ambiguous, or (as you say of the word <hi>Tradition p. 318.) commonly us'd by the Fathers to signify to us the Scriptures?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 6th. is of St. <hi>Irenaeus. All those who will hear Truth may at present perfectly discern in the Church the Tradition of the Apostles, manifest in the whole world.</hi> What means the world <hi>[at present]</hi> but that the Tradition of the Apostles is yet vigorous and fresh in the Church? which remark had very unfitly suted with <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 7th and 8th are Tertullians. Both say the same Sence, that what is <hi>establisht</hi> as <hi>Sacred</hi> or <hi>profest</hi> at this <hi>present</hi> day in the Churches of the Apostles is <hi>manifestly deliver'd by</hi> the Apostles or a <hi>Tradition of the Apostles;</hi> which is incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to Scripture, it not being a Tradition or point <hi>delivered,</hi> but the <hi>Delivery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last is of Chrysologus, which has indeed the word <hi>Tradition,</hi> but by the additionall words <hi>[of the Fathers]</hi> not left ambiguous but determin'd to unwritten Tradition: For the Fathers according to you are not to give, or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver down the Sence of Scriptures, it being plain of it self.</p>
            <p>This Sir, is the upshot of your skill in <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book-learning;</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:50748:64"/>
the three first Testimonies from Scripture you answerd not, mistaking quite what they were brought for; the 4th you omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. You have given pittiful answers to eight from the Fathers and shufled off nine more without answer, pleading you had given us a Key to open them which was never made for those locks. By which I see you reserve your greatest <hi>Kindnesses,</hi> like a right friendly man, till the last.</p>
            <p>You will not have the Councill of Trent make Tradition <hi>the onely Rule of Faith;</hi> you had oblig'd mee, had you answer'd my reason for it in my 4th note p. 145. 146. But this is not your way; you still slip over my reasons all along as if none had been brought, and then say some sleight thing or other to the Conclusion, as if it had never been <hi>inferrd</hi> by mee, but meerly <hi>gratis</hi> and rawly affirm'd. I have explicated our Divines that seem to differ from mee herein, <hi>Sure footing</hi> p. 187. 188. and the Council it self takes my part in it, by <hi>defining</hi> and <hi>practising</hi> the taking the Sence of Scripture from that <hi>quod tenuit &amp; tenet Sanct a Mater Ecclesia,</hi> which, in this antecedency to Scriptures Sence, can no where bee had but from Tradition. You cavill at mee for <hi>not putting down the words in which that Councill declares it self to honour the Holy Scripture and Tradition with equall pious affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reverence.</hi> Why should I? you see I was very short in all my allegations thence and rather
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:50748:65"/>
touch't at them for Catholicks to read them more at large, than transcrib'd them fully. But how groundless your Cavill is may bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood hence that I took notice of a far more dangerous point to wit it's putting the Holy Scriptures constantly <hi>before Tradition,</hi> and show'd good reason why? But you approve not even of any honour done to the Scriptures upon those Terms; and your interest makes you wish that rather it's <hi>Letter</hi> and <hi>Sence</hi> both should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main uncertain, than it should owe any thing to the Catholick Church. You ask how an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle and Evangelist <hi>should bee more present by the Scripture</hi> ascertain'd as to words and Sence <hi>then by or all Tradition?</hi> I answer, because that Book is in that case Evident to bee peculiarly and adequately his, whereas Orall Tradition was common to all; and 'tis doubtable what hand some of those Apostles or Evangelists might have had in the source of that which was line<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally deriv'd to us.</p>
            <p>Sir, I wonder how you hit so right once as not to answer likewise the Testimony I brought p. 152. of the Catholick Clergy's adhering to Tradition in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ick of the breach, you might as well have spoke to that as to the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> &amp; divers others: But I perceive it had some peculiar difficulty, as had divers of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected nine, else your Genius leads you natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to flie at any thing that has but the sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance or even name of a Testimony: whereas,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50748:65"/>
unactive I stoop at no such game till I see certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 'tis worth my pains; and I fear yours will scarce prove so</p>
            <p>THey come in play p. 320. And because they are huddled together here something confusedly, it were not amiss to sort them under Dr. <hi>Pierce's</hi> Heads found <hi>Sure-footing,</hi> p. 170.</p>
            <p>To the first Head, which comprises those which are onely brought to vapour with, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs that of St. <hi>Hierom.</hi> p. 323.</p>
            <p>To the second Head, which consists of those which are <hi>raw, unapply'd, and onely say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in common which never comes home to the point,</hi> belong all those of <hi>Eusebius.</hi> That of St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and St. <hi>Austin</hi>'s p. 324. of <hi>Iustin</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> p. 325.

            <p>To the 7th. Head, which comprises those which are false, and signifie not the thing they are quoted for, appertain that of <hi>Ireneus</hi> p. 326. of St. <hi>Austin,</hi> St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> and the 2d. of <hi>Theoph. Alexandrinus</hi> p. 330.</p>

            <p>St. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Testimony was writ by him to defend an Errour, which both wee and the Protestants hold for such, and therefore no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> sayes) <hi>more errantium ratiocinaretur,</hi> hee discoursed after the rate of those that err; that is, assumes false Grounds to build his errour on. Whence the inferring an acknowledg'd false Conclusion from it, is an argument rather his Principle was not sound.</p>
            <p>I know, Sir, you will fume at this usage of your Testimonies: but with what reason? For first, you putting them down rawly, without particularizing their force or import, or driving them home to any point, my very sorting them under these Heads, sounds a greater particularity in my Exceptions and Answer, than you show'd any in alledging them. Next, you had refus'd to do mee the reason I begg'd in my Letter to my Answerer §. 8. in vouching you Testimonies to bee <hi>Conclusive</hi> or Satisfactory; which unless you did, I had already told you there it was my resolution to give them no other Answer. And I shall candidly make known my Intention why I <hi>do</hi> so, and <hi>shall ever do so,</hi> till you come to some good point in that particular. I had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd what multitudes of voluminous Books had and might bee writ in the way of Citation without any possibility of <hi>satisfying,</hi> that is, to the extream loss of time, and prejudice to ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:50748:66"/>
souls, while any Citation however qualify'd was admitted, and no Principles laid to sort them, and show which were Conclusive; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I judg'd it the best way to drive you from that insignificant, and endless way of writing, to tell in short my exceptions against each Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and to force you to vouch them <hi>Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive.</hi> And I pray, why should I or any be put to show each of those Citations, to our excessive pains, inefficacious, whereas your self, who is the Alledger, will not take pains to show any one of them to bee efficacious? But your way here is the weakest in that kind I ever read or heard of. You huddle together a clutter of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, never apply them particularly as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly did mine: Overleap all considerations of their qualifications, <hi>nakedly set them down,</hi> (as you say p. 332) and then tell us <hi>they are enough to satisfie any unpassionate Reader</hi> that <hi>dare trust himself with the use of his own Eyes and Reason.</hi> Which is plausible indeed to flatter fools that are passionately self-conceited, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise I conceive <hi>an unpassionate Reader</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much more, if he ever knew what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy meant. Hee would know the variety of Circumstances, Antecedents, Consequents, &amp;c. Besides, speaking Equivocally or Rhetorically, not distinctly and literally, may alter every Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony there; Above all hee would consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were expressive onely of some persons <hi>Opinions,</hi> and not rather of the <hi>solid</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:50748:67"/>
               <hi>sense</hi> of the faithful in that Age; vvithout which they want the nature of Testimonies. Is it <hi>clear to every man's Eyes and Reason,</hi> none of these or other faults render all yours Inefficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? Is it <hi>clear</hi> that when they say Scripture is <hi>plain,</hi> they mean plain <hi>to all,</hi> even Heathens that never heard of Faith, (such must bee the <hi>Plainness</hi> of the <hi>Rule of Faith)</hi> or onely to those who have learn't Christian Doctrin <hi>already</hi> by the <hi>Church;</hi> that is, who bring their Rule <hi>with them.</hi> I am sure St. <hi>Austin de Doctrinâ Christianâ,</hi> your best Testimony, speaks of such Readers as are <hi>timentes Deum ac pietate mansueti,</hi> those <hi>which fear God, and are meek with piety;</hi> that is those which are not onely <hi>Faithful</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians already,</hi> but <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>good Christians;</hi> which makes it nothing to your purpose. Again, some one passage may bee so plain as a learned man may in the opinion of learned men plainly confound an Adversary; but will it bee clear and plain in all necessary points to the vulgar, who hear a great many hard words brought on both sides, and have no skill to judge who has the better in such contests? yet the <hi>Rule of Faith</hi> must bee <hi>plain even</hi> to the vulgar, and able to give them Satisfaction. Again, when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers provoke to the Scripture, is it not against those who <hi>deny</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> but <hi>accept</hi> the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and so the necessity of disputing out of some commonly-acknowledg'd Principle, may bee the onely reason they take that method?
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:50748:67"/>
'Tis evidently so, in that you quote from St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> against <hi>Maximinus</hi> p. 329. and against the Donatists, who deny'd the Judgment of the Catholik Church <hi>quae ubique terrarum diffundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur;</hi> and so hee was to prove his point <hi>ubi sit Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia,</hi> out of Scripture or no way. Again, is it clear out of the Citations <hi>nakedly set down,</hi> what went before and after? Is it clear for example that when they speak highly of Scripture, they mean not Scripture <hi>unsenc't,</hi> but onely taken as <hi>Significative</hi> of God's sence, as it must, to bee <hi>the Rule of Faith;</hi> or, if of Scripture <hi>senc't,</hi> they mean not <hi>senc't by the Church,</hi> but by the <hi>human skill</hi> of private persons, which is the true point between us? St. <hi>Austin</hi> without doubt makes the Church the <hi>Interpreter</hi> of Scripture, as is clearly seen by his Discourse at the end of his 17. Chap. <hi>Of the Profit of Beleeving,</hi> which spoils your pretence to his Authority. Nay, do not they often mean by <hi>Scripture</hi> the very <hi>Sence</hi> of it, that is <hi>Christs Doctrine</hi> or the <hi>Gospel?</hi> As oft as you hear them speak of the <hi>Things that are written,</hi> or call them <hi>Principles,</hi> or <hi>The Rule of Truth</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> or speak of <hi>conforming other Doctrines to them,</hi> and such like, so oft they speak of the <hi>Doctrin</hi> it self contain'd in Scripture, or the <hi>Truths</hi> found there. Such is that of <hi>Clemens</hi> cited by you p. 316. 317. which speaks meerly of the <hi>Sence</hi> of it, or the <hi>Truths</hi> in it, which hee makes deservedly the <hi>Rule</hi> to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:50748:68"/>
other <hi>Truths;</hi> and hence, now hee names <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> then, the <hi>Tradition of the Church,</hi> then <hi>Scripture</hi> again, it being indifferent to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the same <hi>Sense</hi> (which hee onely intends) being included in both. Such is also evidently your best Testimony, to wit, that of <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> which speaks of the <hi>Gospell</hi> it self, <hi>preach't</hi> and <hi>writ;</hi> that is, clearly of the Sence indifferent to either way of Expression. But what is this or indeed all that is said there to the <hi>Letter of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture</hi> taken as <hi>Significative of God's Sense,</hi> that is, not for that <hi>Sense,</hi> nor as <hi>including</hi> it, but as the <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Way</hi> to it (as it must bee taken when 'tis meant for a <hi>Rule of Faith)</hi> and the plainness and Certainty of that <hi>Way,</hi> to all that are yet to come to Faith, taking that Letter as interpretable by private Skill and Maxims of Language-learning, which is the true point be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and us? Bring Testimonies for <hi>this,</hi> and you will do wonders. To use your own words p. 318. <hi>I need not shew</hi> what I have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours't here <hi>of every of his Testimonies in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; for, whosoever shall read them with this Key will find they are of no force to conclude what hee drives</hi> (or ought to drive) <hi>at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am loath to suggest any Jealousie of your Insincerity in all these Citations, though you have seldome fail'd in that point. Present my service to your Friend Mr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and assure him hee shall not bee neglected, though there were no
