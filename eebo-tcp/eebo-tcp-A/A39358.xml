         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LETTER Torn in PIECES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHatsoever Errors, or Miscarriages in Government, Our Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign K C. the First had been Guilty of (either through ill Advice, or the Common Frailty of all Mankind) most evident it is that he made full satisfaction for them in Granting the <hi>Petition of Right:</hi> And as to those <hi>Fears, and Jealousies,</hi> which were rais'd against Him after the Granting of that Petition, as if he Design'd to Act Contrary to the Laws of the Land, so that he could not undertake to justifie His Actions to His own Parliament, and to all the World, as agreeable to His Just and Honourable Professions, to prevent all Appearance of Reason for such Fears and Jealousies, he bound himself by a Law not to <hi>Dissolve</hi> the then Present Parliament as long as they desir'd to <hi>Continue;</hi> upon which Act His Majesty Reflects thus in His <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>By this Act of highest Confidence, I hoped for ever to shut out, and lock the Door, upon all present Jealousies, and Future Mistakes; I confess I did not thereby intend to shut my self our of Doors, as some Men have now requited me.</p>
               <p>True, It was an Act unparallel'd by any of my Predecessors; yet cannot in Reason admit any worse Interpretation than this, of an Extream Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence I had, that my Subjects would not make ill use of an Act, by which I declar'd so much to trust them as to deny My self in so high a point of My Prerogative. Sure it had argued a very short sight of things, and Extream Fatuiry of Mind in Me, so far to bind My own Hands at their Request, if I had shortly meant to have used a Sword against them.</p>
               <p>To thee, O my God, do I still Appeal whose All-Discerning Justice sees through all the Disguises of Mens Pretensions, and Deceitful Darknesses of their Hearts.</p>
               <p>Let thy Grace Teach me wisely to enjoy as well the frustratings, as the fulfillings of my best hopes, and most <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Thus have they Requited me Evil for Good, and Hatred for my Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Will towards them. O Lord, be thou my Pilot in this dark and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Storm, &amp;c.</p>
            </q>
            <p>All Men but such as are Blinded by the Darkness of HELLISH Malice may clearly Perceive that this Most Christian Prince, by the Excess of His Desires to satisfie the utmost Doubts, and suppress the Fears of any of His Subjects, did so Strengthen the Hands of the <hi>Traiterous</hi> and <hi>Sediticus,</hi> that they Acted so Subtilly and Vigorously upon a Pretence of the <hi>Authority of Parliament,</hi> that within a few Years they got their KING into their Power, and Murther'd Him (to the Regret even of divers both of the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons,</hi> who continued <hi>Sitting</hi> till they were <hi>Excluded</hi> by the ARMY:) And so in the sight of all the World, they Subverted the whole Government both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> I shall here Recite the <hi>Relation</hi> of some of their Unparallel'd <hi>Enormities,</hi> and most Prodigious <hi>Outrage</hi> which was Publisht by a Person that had a full View of them, <q>In the Mystery of the Two <hi>Juntoes,</hi> Presbyterians, and Independents, <hi>P.</hi> 3. We find these words: There hath been given away to Members openly (besides innumerable private cheats mutually conniv'd at) at least 300000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, besides Rich Offices, Imployments in Money, Committees, Sequestrations, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Advantages. Such as have gone beyond the Authority given by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Sequestred Men unjustly, and so withheld their goods under pretence thereof; and such as have Levied Taxes Three or Four Times over, are quit from private Actions, and the Benefit of Law, and Justice taken from the Oppressed to secure Country Committees and Sequestrators, and others (not Prerogative, but Legislative) Thieves, contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which says, (<hi>Nulli negabimus, nulli differemus justitiam, aut rectum</hi>) We will deny, nor defer Justice, and Right to no Man. Oh, Prodigeous Acts, and of greater Tyranny than any <hi>King</hi> ever durst Adventure upon! <hi>P.</hi> 6. How frequently the Country Committees Act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws of the Land — How they ordinarily turn well-affected Men out of their Freeholds, and Goods, Imprison, and beat their Persons, without any known Charge, Accuser, or Witness against them; nay, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them, as in the Case of Dr. <hi>Rawleigh,</hi> Killed in Prison at <hi>Wells</hi> by the Committees Marshal; and the poor Men Murthered at <hi>Bridge-Water,</hi> whose Bloods were shed like the Blood of a Dog, and no real Prosecution thereof. — How they Excluded all other Magistracy, Ingrossing to themselves the Power of Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Church-Wardens, &amp;c. in an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary way; keeping Troops of Horse upon Pay and Free Quarters, for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109235:3"/>
their Guard, like the Thirty Tyrants of <hi>Athens;</hi> and if any but speak of calling them to give an Account, they presently Vote him a Delinquent, and Sequester him.</q>

                  <hi>Anthony Nichols</hi> was Arrested upon the way into <hi>Cornwal</hi> by the Army, and dispightfully used, and when the General was inclined to free him, <hi>Cromwell</hi> told him he was a <hi>Traytor to the Army,</hi> You see now upon whom they meant to fix the Peoples <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> for where no <hi>Allegiance</hi> is Due, there can be no <hi>Treason. P.</hi> 47. The Speaker pulled a Letter out of his Pocket from the General, and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Council of the Army; it was accompanied with a Remonstrance of Villainous Language and Threats against those Members that Sate (while the Two Speakers were with the Army; calling them <hi>Pretended Members,</hi> charging them (in General) with <hi>Treason, Treachery,</hi> a <hi>Breach of Trust;</hi> and protested if they shall presume to stir before they have cleared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they did not give their Assent to such and such Votes, they should sit at their peril, and he would take them as Prisoners of War and try them at a Council of War. What King of <hi>England</hi> ever of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd so great a Violence to the Fundamental Privileges of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as to deny them the Liberty of Voting <hi>I</hi> and <hi>No</hi> freely? Certainly, <hi>the little Finger of a Jack Cade, or a Watt Tyler,</hi> is far heavier than the <hi>Loyns</hi> of any King. <hi>P.</hi> 66. In the Third Year of KING CHARLES, the Lords and Commons in their Petition of Right (when not above 2000, or 3000 Souldiers were Thinly Quartered upon the People but for a Month or Two, Complained thereof to His Majesty, as a great Grievance, contrary to the Laws, and Customs of the Realm, and humbly Prayed as their Right and Liberty, according to the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom, that he would remove them, and that his People might not be so burthened in times to come; which His Majesty Graciously Granted. Yet now we are Ten Thousand times more oppressed with them, and if these Quarterers offer Violence, or Villainous usage to any man in his House, or Family; or commit Murther, or Fellony, they are Protected against the Laws, and Justice of the Land, and <hi>Triable only by a Council of War</hi> at the Head-Quarters, where a Man can neither obtain Justice, nor seek it with safety — Tho' the Kings Oversights must be <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gically</hi> publisht to the World, yet the Hainous Crimes of the <hi>Godly</hi> must ly hid under the Mask of Religion: P. 91. You now make all that is or can be near and dear to the People, liable to the Passions of Three Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee Men to Judge and Execute, according to their Discretion without Law, or so much as a formality thereof.</q>

One day an Officer of the Army having taken some Members going to the House, and secured them in the <hi>Tobacco Room,</hi> under Guard; the Speaker not being able to muster enough to make a House, was fain to send to the said Officer, to lend him his said Prisoners to make up a free Parliament, <hi>P.</hi> 35.

            <p>And now Reader, I shall most earnestly entreat thee to Consider whether LUDLOW, and His <hi>Complices,</hi> or KING CHARLES the First, offer'd greater Violence to the LAWS of this Kingdom; yea whether the <hi>Distemper</hi> which the <hi>Body Politick</hi> Labour'd under by reason of the Miscarriages of the King in His Government, were not as Inconsiderable, in Comparison of what it suffer'd by the <hi>Outrages</hi> of the Prevailing Rebels, as a very Tolerable <hi>Ague</hi> of short continuance would be in a Mans Body, in Comparison of the PLAGUE. I think it necessary I should take particular Notice of LUD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOW's Attempt to expose the Memory of this Blessed Prince to the <hi>Odium</hi> of the Populace, by telling them that he did lend Eight Ships to the <hi>French</hi> King to Fight against the Miserable Protestants of <hi>Rochel,</hi> Letter <hi>P.</hi> 10. I shall not undertake to Explain the <hi>Intrigues</hi> of that Affair, the Lending of those Ships, but this. I shall Affirm that most certainly it was not done out of any Ill Will to the <hi>French Protestants;</hi> and that the King was so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Enemy to those Protestants, that he was their Great Friend, and most Charitable Assistant: Which I shall here prove by the Testimony of those Protestants themselves, in a Letter to His Majesty, in the <hi>Suppliment to the CABALA; P.</hi> 204.</p>

                  <p>THe Knowledge, and Resentment, which it hath pleased your Majesty to take of the Misery of the afflicted Churches of <hi>France,</hi> hath given us the boldness to awaken Your Compassion in such measure as our Calamities are Aggravated by the unmerciful Rigour of our Persecutors; and as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Storm doth Threaten near at hand the Total Ruine and Lamentable Destruction of that which the Mercy of God had yet kept intire unto us, since the Desolation of <hi>Rochel:</hi> And as we have adored with Humility the Judgment in this bad Success (which we impute only to his Wrath justly kindled against us for our Sins) so our silence could be thought no less than

Ingratitude, if we had not at the beginning of our Assembly resolved the most Humble and Affectionate acknowledgment, which we now render to your Majesty, for the Great Succor which you have sent us, Interesting your self so far in the grief of our Oppression, and in the means of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>

               <hi>P. 208.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> to His Majesty of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> 12 of <hi>March.</hi> 1628.</p>
            <p>
               <q>THe greatest Support which God hath raised unto them, is the Succour our Churches have, and do look to receive, from Your Majesty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>In the same Book P. 232 I find a Council Table Order against hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mass at Embassadours Houses; <hi>March</hi> 10. 1629.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>At this Sitting, the Lord Viscount <hi>Dorchester</hi> Declared, That His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty being inform'd of bold and open repair made to several places, and especially to the Houses of Foraign Ambassadours, for the hearing of Mass, which the Laws and Statutes of this Kingdom do expresly forbid his Subjects to frequent: And considering in His Princely Wisdom, both the Publick Scandals, and dangerous Consequence thereof, is resolv'd to take present Order for the stopping of this evil before it spread it self any farther: And for this purpose has Commanded me to acquaint the Board with his Pleasure in that behalf, &amp;c.</q> By this and a multitude of other Passages in the Reign of this Blessed Prince, it is manifest how far He was from being a <hi>Papist,</hi> tho' to Persons of that Perswasion, He often shew'd his Christian Lenity and Royal Compassion. His own words are most Efficacious to convince the most stubborn of his Enemies of the sincerity of His RELIGION, which was always accompanied with <hi>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory,</hi> so that in all his Conflicts, He was <hi>more than Conquerour.</hi> His Expressions are so Genuine and Unaffected, so Lively and Vigorous, that any man who understands them must needs be <hi>sensible,</hi> that they are the True and Lively POURTRAITURE of his Conceptions. <q>I shall therefore recite some more of them upon the many Jealousies raised, and Scandals cast upon the King, to stir up the People against Him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I will not justifie beyond humane errours and frailties my Self, or my Counsellours; they might be subject to some miscarriages, yet such as were far more repairable, than those Enormous extravagancies, wherewith some men have now, even wildred, and almost quite lost both Church and State.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>No men were more willing to complain, than I was to redress what I saw in reason was either done, or advised amiss; and this I thought I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109235:5"/>
had done, even beyond the expectation of moderate Men; who were sorry to see Me prone even to injure Myself, out of a Zeal to relieve My Subjects.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Time will best inform My Subjects, that those are the best pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servers of their true Liberty, who allow themselves the least Licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness against, or beyond the Laws.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>They will feel it at last to their cost, that it is impossible those men should be really tender of their Fellow-Subjects Liberties, who have the hardiness to use their King with so severe restraints; against all Laws, both Divine, and Humane.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For Mine Honour I am well assured, that as Mine Innocency is clear before God, in point of any Calamities they object; so My Reputation shall like the Sun (after Owles and Bats have had their freedom in the Night, and darker times) rise and recover it self to such a degree of Splendour, as those feral Birds shall be grieved to behold, and unable to bear. For never were any Princes more glorious than those whom God hath suffer'd to be tried in the Furnace of Afflictions, by their Injurious Subjects. Nor shall their black vails be able to hide the shine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of My Face, while God gives Me a heart frequently and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to converse with him, from whom alone are all the Traditions of true Glory and Majesty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Thou, O Lord, knowest My Reproach and my Dishonour, My Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries are all before thee.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>My Soul is among Lyons, even them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, their tongue a sharp sword.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Mine Enemies Reproach Me all the day long, and those that are mad against Me, are sworn together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>O my God, how long shall the sons of men turn my glory into shame? how long shall they love vanity, and seek after lies?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Teach me <hi>Dauids</hi> patience, and <hi>Hezekiak'</hi>s devotion, that I may look to thy mercy through man's malice, and see thy justice in their sin.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Though they curse, do thou bless, and I shall be blessed, and made a blessing to my People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To them He shall be a Blessing indeed, in this and in all future Ages, who shall have the Grace to Imitate the Example of His Virtues, by a sincere and constant dependance upon the Divine Wisdom, Power and Goodness, Loving in Sincerity the worst of their Enemies, and rejoycing in the greatest of their Sufferings.</p>
