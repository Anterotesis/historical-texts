         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have almoſt daily occaſion, as well to reverence,
as remember, this gracious diſpenſation of God
(which elſewhere I have taken knowledge of
in ſome of my writings) that whereas his Saints
and Servants commonly lie under the ſorrow
and ſhame of many infirmities, and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
doings, yet he ſo governs and orders the
ill will of their adverſaries, that they ſeldom in their defamations or
hard ſpeakings againſt them, hit upon theſe; but commonly lay the
burden upon the whole ſhoulder, where the Saints are ſtrongeſt and
beſt able to bear it, charging them with ſuch crimes and matters
of diſparagement, not onely whereof they are altogether innocent
and free, but which are moſt contrary to their choiceſt vertues, and
to the tenour of ſuch practiſes, which are their chiefeſt honour and
commendation. <hi>Joſeph</hi> as great a pattern of chaſtity, as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
was of faith, was yet defamed and accuſed, as an Adulterer,
and a violent attempter of the chaſtitie of others.<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 39. 17.</note>

was <hi>meek above all the men on earth,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>For my ſelf, I know my ſelf to be compaſſed about with as many
infirmities, as the weakeſt of men, and my great unworthineſſe in
many things is <hi>daily before me;</hi> yet it hath pleaſed my God, <hi>whom
I ſerve in the Goſpel of his dear Son,</hi> ſtill to hide my nakedneſſe
from mine enemies, though many in number, and diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
after it; and ſo to diſpoſe of their hatred and ill will againſt
me, that the fiery darts of their accuſations have ſtill hit where
my breſt-plate of righteouſneſſe is, and hath been moſt firme, and
of beſt proof. It is too much for me to ſay of my ſelf, nor will
I ſay it; but it would be a truth comely enough in the mouths of
ſome others, to ſay, that I am, if not the beſt yet none of the worſt
Friends, which the Divine Authority of the Scriptures hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men; and that I have been as diligent, as faithfull, as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
an Aſſertor thereof, as any of thoſe, who think themſelves
more worthy of the crown. All that I ſhall ſay of my ſelf in this
behalf, is, that if I have done any ſervice for the world, ſince
my entrance into it, or if the ſouls and conſciences of men have any
cauſe at all to bleſſe me, it is, becauſe I have cloathed them with
ſtrength and confidence of the royall parentage and deſcent of the
Scriptures, and ſubdued their fears and jealouſies of any ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(in that kinde) under their feet; or rather that I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
with <hi>all my heart, and all my ſoul,</hi> to do them. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
with what importune clamour, and virulency of ſpirit,
I have been of late traduced, not onely to vulgar cognizance, but
to Authority it ſelf, as an enemy unto, and oppoſer of the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Originall of the Scriptures, by ſome, who out of zeal to God
(for ſo they gloſſe the practiſe) neglect their own Trades and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
to follow Satans, <hi>in accuſing the Brethren,</hi>
               <note n="h" place="margin">Revel. 12. 10.</note> is ſo well
known throughout the City, that any farther information from me,
would be an impertinency. But though <hi>Joſeph</hi> was accuſed as an
enemy to the chaſtity of his miſtreſſe, yet the true reaſon and ground
of his accuſation (as the Scripture informeth us) was, not his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
but his faithfulneſſe, thereunto; in like manner, though the
matter of my accuſation from the mouths of men, he oppoſition to
the Scriptures; yet I make little queſtion, but that the reall and
true cauſe hereof, was not my oppoſing, but my avouching the
<pb facs="tcp:114089:3"/>
Scriptures, as the Oracles, or word of God, by a ſtrong and
pregnant eviction from them of a notorious unworthineſſe in thoſe
practiſes and proceedings againſt the Saints, wherein theſe men
with their fellows, were, to the reproach, not of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
onely, but of humanity it ſelf, engaged. <hi>But all things</hi> (ſaith
the Apoſtle) <hi>that are</hi> [to be] <hi>reproved, are made manifeſt by
the light: for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light. i.</hi> is by
this act of manifeſtation or diſcovery, clearly evinced to be light,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 13. And as <hi>Joſeph's</hi> Miſtreſſe accuſed him to his Lord,
for an adulterous attempt upon her, becauſe he refuſed to be adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
with her; ſo becauſe I have conſtantly refuſed to misfigure
the face of the Scriptures, and deſtroy the character of the Divine
glory which is ſtamped upon them, by compelling them to ſerve in
the wars of High Presbyterie, againſt both themſelves, the Saints,
and the Truth; therefore have theſe men accuſed me before Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as if I had blaſphemed their honour, and contradicted
that manifeſt and pregnant Relation, wherein they ſtand unto
God, as their Father. That herein I charge them not, but with
the royall aſſent of Truth, is evident from hence: There is ſcarce
any Divine, or Proteſtant Author, having a like occaſion to ſpeak
of the ſame ſubject, but have expreſſed themſelves upon the point
wherein I am made an offender, in
terms far more obnoxious to exception
then mine,<note n="a" place="margin">No tranſlation is ſimply authenticall, or the undoubted word of God. In the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed word of God, there can be no errour. But in tranſlations there may be, and are errours. The Bible tranſlated therefore is not the undoubted word of God, &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Featly</hi> in his Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>The Dippers dips,</hi> p. 1. 2. This Treatiſe was printed with Licenſe, and ſince reprinted 5. or 6. times, long ſince the ſitting of this preſent Parliament; no man, that ever I have heard of, finding himſelf agrieved in the leaſt, at any of theſe expreſſions.</note> and yet my accuſers are
all thoughts made for them and as men
in whoſe mouths there are neither com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
nor reproofs. Why? theſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
either have ordered the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and High Presbyterie, and made
them to agree; or elſe they had no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to take notice of any diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between them. But becauſe I
have ſo demonſtratively proved that
the Scriptures, and High Presbyterie,
point, like Eaſt and Weſt, one diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trally
oppoſite to the other, <hi>Ergo,</hi>
therefore my ſaying, <hi>that it is no
foundation of Chriſtian Religion, to beleeve that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
<pb facs="tcp:114089:4"/>
Scriptures are the word of God,</hi> is a deniall of the Divine
Authority of the Scriptures ſimply, though another mans ſaying
twice as much, would have amounted to no ſuch ſum of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But that I daily <hi>fight with beaſts at Epheſus, after the
manner of men, what advantageth it me;</hi> if the Scriptures be
not the word of God? Or why have I bought ſo many Scripture
Truths at ſuch great rates as I have done, as with the loſſe of
Friends, credit, eſteem with men, eſtate, yea of all hope, that I ſay
not poſſibility, of bettering my portion and condition in the world,
as low as it is, if I beleeve them not to be the word of God? Why
did I ſo lately ſuffer a Sequeſtration from, or ejection out of
my free hold, (the beſt means I had in the world, for the ſupport
and livelyhood of my ſelf, wife, and ſeven children) for none other
cauſe, or crime that ever I could hear of, but for endeavouring to
<hi>go before others in an example of a reall Reformation (.i.</hi> For
my conſcientious and faithfull obſervance of the ſolemn Covenant,
after by publique Order and injunction from Authority, I had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it) if I believe not the Scriptures to be the word of God?
Certainly if I did not really and cordially beleeve them to be the
word of God, I would beleeve them as prudently, as many others
do: I would ſo beleeve them, as not to be diſturbed by them, or
any thing in them, in my worldly intereſts: I would ſo believe
them, as to keep fair quarter with ſoft raiment, great purſes, full
tables, and benches of honour, notwithſtanding: nor would I ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
the leaſt degree of my hope of riſing in the world, upon the
ſervice of any thing whatſoever contained in them. Nay, did I
not verily believe them to be the word of God, I would not for their
ſakes, nor for the vindication of any thing which they ſay, expoſe
my ſelf, as now I do, to the clamorous, and ſtingling tongues of an
ill imployed, and (I fear) a worſe ſpirited generation of informers
(God <hi>forgive them,</hi> for I hope charitably, that <hi>they know not
what they do)</hi> I would write no books that ſhould deſerve burning
by the common Hangman,<note n="*" place="margin">Some of my accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers made it their moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate requeſt, that my late book might be burnt by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Hangman</note> but ſuch onely which ſhould be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
to, and judged worthy to be ſold, at the ſigne of the Bible it
ſelf. For I confeſſe, that I am neither Stoick, nor Cynick: I had
rather abound, then be in want: I had rather have the good wills,
and the good words of my generation, then their bad; and that the
greatneſſe of this world ſhould rather ſmile, then frown, upon me.
<pb facs="tcp:114089:4"/>
And for the acquirement and injoyment of my deſires in all theſe
I conceive I had as fair and large opportunities, as others of my
Brethren in the Miniſtery, and had a price in my hand, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
(I make no queſtion) for the purchaſe, as many of thoſe, who
have bought, poſſeſſe, and injoy: whoſe felicity or advancement by
their purchaſe, I (God is my witneſſe) no waies emulate or envy.
For I judge it (in many caſes) beſt for the peace, and accomodation
of the world, that they ſhould enjoy the great things of the
world, who leaſt know how to want them, or what to do without
them. But that which mainly ſeparated between me, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of my deſires in this kinde, was nothing elſe, but my belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Scriptures to be the word of God: this principle within
me, was (I confeſſe) too ſtiffe and ſtately to bow down at the feet
of worldly accomodations, and theſe on the other hand thought
themſelves too good, to ſubject themſelves unto, or comport with
that my principle: and ſince they thus mutually reſented the geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
and temper one of another, they have been ſtrangers, and kept
at a diſtance, and by this time ſcarce know, remember, or take much
care one for the other. It was a very irrationall and incongruous
imputation which ſome caſt upon <hi>Paul,</hi> that he ſhould <hi>preach Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,</hi>
when as he ſuffered ſo deeply as he did, for non-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
at leaſt for non-practiſing of it. <hi>And I Brethren</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>if I yet preach circumciſion, why do I yet ſuffer perſecution?
then is the offence of the croſſe ceaſed.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5. 11.</note> And certainly, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
and conſidering men being Judges, my accuſation of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the divine Authority of the Scriptures, is every whit as ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

<hi>I thought</hi> (ſaith he, to him) <hi>to promote thee to

the pretended crime of denying the Divine Authority of the

his belief of the Divine Authority of the Scriptures, with

either of theſe upon any lighter or looſer foundation, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority

this paſſage of Scripture, as undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comporting with ſuch a practiſe, which
(it ſeems) too much comports with their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
I mean, the inflicting of civill puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by the Magiſtrate, upon ſpirituall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents
(perſons uttering, or teaching er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous
doctrines in Religion) and having had no occaſion mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,
to argue this, as I had for ſeverall others, in my late
Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>Hagio-maſtix,</hi> &amp;c. I conceive it may be a
good and acceptable ſervice both unto God and man, to make a
diſtrict and narrow ſearch into the minde of the one in it, for
the accomodation, and benefit of the other; partly in rectify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the judgements and practiſe of ſome, partly in preſerving
others from undue ſufferings. We ſhall ſteer our inquiry by the
compaſſe, partly of the ſence &amp; minde of the holy Ghoſt in other
Scriptures; partly of the coherence and ſcope of the context;
partly, of the ſence and import of the words themſelves; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the analogy of phraſe or manner of expreſſion found
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114089:7"/>
elſewhere in Scripture: partly alſo of the apprehenſions and
judgements, of the beſt and ſoundeſt Expoſitors we have had
opportunity to ſee, and conſult about the meaning of the place.
So then, that the Holy Ghoſt had no intent as all to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the interpoſall of the civill Sword, for the ſuppreſſion
or puniſhment of errour, or Hereſies under the Goſpel (leaſt of
all, in theſe times, or, in the Churches of the Gentiles) will
clearly appear, if not <hi>diviſim,</hi> yet <hi>conjunctim,</hi> by theſe enſuing
conſiderations.</p>
            <p>1. It clearly appears from the two preceding verſes (the
firſt and ſecond of this chapter: and indeed from the whole,
both precedent and ſubſequent chapters) that what is ſpoken
in this third verſe, concerning the high diſpleaſure, which <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and mothers</hi> ſhould conceive againſt their children, when
they ſhould <hi>prophecie lies in the name of the Lord,</hi> reſpecteth
onely the Nation, and Church of the Jews. Nor is there the
leaſt hint or intimation given in the context, that any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in the ſaid verſe, relates unto the Gentiles. For. i. <hi>(v.</hi> 1.)
he mentions onely <hi>the houſe of David, and the inhabitants of
Jeruſalem</hi> (1. the Jews, of what rank or condition ſoever,
noble, or ignoble) as thoſe, for, or, unto whom, <hi>the fountain
for ſin, and for uncleanneſſe,</hi> there ſpoken of, was to <hi>be opened.</hi>
Upon the ſame terms he expreſſeth himſelf in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> thus
<hi>Mat. 15. 24. I am not ſent, but unto the loſt ſheep of the houſe of
Iſrael:</hi> meaning, that he was not ſent by his Father, to miniſter
in the daies of his fleſh, either by preaching the word of the
Kingdom, or confirming it mith miracles, but onely unto the
Jews: in which reſpect the Apoſtle calleth him a <hi>miniſter of the

that he <hi>was not ſent, but to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of
Iſrael,</hi> ſpeaketh, onely and determinately of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the Gentiles in the expreſsion; in like manner, when
the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaking and prophecying of him, and of his
ſending into the world, under the metaphor of a <hi>fountain</hi> to be
<hi>opened to the houſe of David, and to the inhabitants of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
&amp;c.</hi> cannot reaſonably be conceived, in ſuch an expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to minde the Gentiles, but the Jews onely. Eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that this prophecie of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the bleſsing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114089:7"/>
he ſhould bring with him, was not ſimply directed unto the
Jews, and unto them onely, by the gracious appointment of
God, but it was directed and ſent unto them, being now in a
dejected and low condition, on purpoſe for their incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and erection, as appears, <hi>Ezra</hi> 5. 1. and all Expoſitors
agree. Now when God is well pleaſed with the Jews, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
their comfort or incouragement by a meſſage from
himſelf by his Prophets, he is not wont to ſpeak of the calling
of the Gentiles, or of making theſe equall, or ſuperiour, in
holy priviledges, unto them: but when he puts this ingredient
into any ſuch addreſſement of himſelf unto them, it ſtill argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his diſpleaſure and diſcontentment with them, according to
what himſelf expreſſeth by the mouth of <hi>Moſes</hi> (a little before
his death) <hi>They have moved me to jealouſie, with that which is
not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities:
and I will move them to jealouſie with thoſe, which are not a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,

            <p>If it be objected and ſaid; yea, but if this be foretold by

they lawfully may, much leſſe that of duty they ought, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
or act their zeal after the ſame manner, or with the ſelf
ſame kinde of expreſsion. It was lawfull for the Apoſtles, to
be as zealous againſt the enemies of God and of Chriſt, as it
was for <hi>Eliah;</hi> yet it was not as lawfull for them to expreſſe
their zeal by <hi>calling for fire from heaven to conſume them,</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Luk 9. 54.</note> as
it was for him. So it is not onely as lawfull, but neceſſary alſo
by way of duty, for the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to be as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
for the glory of God, and for the peace and ſafety of their
people, as either <hi>Phineas,</hi> or the ſame <hi>Eliah</hi> was: but it is not
as lawfull for them, either to thruſt adulterers or adultereſſes
thorow with ſpears or javelins, as <hi>Phineas</hi> did; nor to ſlay Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Prieſts with their own hands, as did <hi>Eliah.</hi> In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
it may be as lawfull, yea, and a matter of duty lying as
much upon Parents, whether naturall or civill, now, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
with the ſame meaſure and ſtrength of zeal, againſt their
reſpective children, in caſes of thoſe ſinfull miſdemeanours ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
in the Scripture in hand, as it was heretofore either for
the one kind of Parent or the other, amongſt the Jews, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
againſt theirs; and yet withall they may ſin grievouſly, in
caſe they ſhall utter their zeal in ſuch outward actings againſt
them, as the other did. The reaſon of the difference is, becauſe
God hath now under the Goſpel appointed other methods and
means for the vindication of his glory, and the peace of his
people, againſt the enemies of both, differing from thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
under the Law (as hath been argued, and proved in the
preceeding Treatiſe.) And as the Jews, though (as the Apoſtle
teſtifies of them) they had <hi>a zeal of God,</hi> [that is, either for the
glory of <hi>God,</hi> or for the obtaining of his favour]<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 10. 2.</note> yet this
<hi>zeal</hi> of theirs <hi>not</hi> being <hi>according to knowledge.</hi> 1. Not being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
or acted according to the will and minde of God reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Scriptures in that behalf, but according to their own
erroneous ſenſe &amp; miſapprehenſions herein, ſinned greatly, even
to the loſſe of the favour of God for ever, in, and by ſuch an exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114089:9"/>
or acting of it: in like manner, men may be very <hi>zealouſly</hi>
affected, either to promote the glory of God, or to procure
his love and favour; and yet by ſeeking to effect either the one,
or the other, by means diſallowed by God in the Scriptures,
they may both highly diſhonour him on the one hand, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
his diſpleaſure, inſtead of his favour, on the other, And
that temptations in this kinde are very incident to perſons of
zealous affections and deſires for Gods glory, appears by the
character of thoſe times, wherein, as our Saviour informes his
Diſciples, whoſoever <hi>killeth them, will think that he doth God
ſervice.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="margin">Iob. 16. 2.</note> Whoſoever <hi>killeth them, will thinke, &amp;c.</hi> This note
of univerſality, <hi>whoſoever,</hi> imports, that there would not be
onely one, or two, or ſome leſſe conſiderable numbers of men,
that would ſtumble at the ſtone here ſpoken of, but that this
would be a common or generall practiſe, countenanced and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
if not enacted, by the Authority of States and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.
The obnoxiouſneſſe of zeal to the ſaid temptation, might
be further confirmed by that example of the <hi>Jews,</hi> recorded,
<hi>Act.</hi> 13. 15. who are there ſaid to have <hi>ſtirred up the</hi> devout <hi>and
honourable women, and the chief men of the city, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

God, and yet perſecuted this way</hi> (the way of Chriſt) <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

caſe that cometh to paſſe, which Chriſt here commandeth us to
take heed of, that is, the wheat is pluckt up with the tares; which
is an horrible ſin before God, and can never be excuſed. Here then
conſider, how madly we have gone to work, who would needs
compell unto the Faith, Turks by war, Heretiques by fire, Jews
through fear of death and other injuries, and pull up the tares by
our own ſtrength, as if we were a kinde of men by our ſelves,
who had power over the hearts and ſpirits of men, and as if it
were in our hand to bring men unto righteouſneſs and true godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
We by ſuch a courſe, pull men quite away from the
word, by ſlaying them, that it cannot work any thing upon
them: and ſo, as much as in us lieth, we make our ſelves guilty

Long before <hi>Luther, Auſtin</hi> expounded the ſame Parable
much after the ſame manner, carrying the ſcope and importance
of it to the very ſame point: which expoſition of <hi>Auſtin,
Muſculus</hi> in his <hi>Comon Places (cap. de Haereſi)</hi> having at large
rehearſed, concludes thus: <hi>Haec Auguſtinus: quibus contra occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores
haereticorum parabolam zizaniorum convenientiſſimè, meo
judicio, exponit. i.</hi> Thus <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in which paſſage he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
the parable of the Tares, and that (in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
moſt appoſitely and properly, againſt thoſe that
would have Heretiques put to death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The ſame</hi> Luther, <hi>elſewhere writeth, and argueth thus.</hi>
That Heretiques ſhould be burnt is contrary to the will and
minde of the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>This I prove, firſt, from the experience of the whole
Church, which from her firſt beginnings never burnt an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique
nor ever will burn any: It would be a ſtrange
thing, that in ſo many ages none ſhould be burnt, if the
Spirit of God had declared himſelf for it. But <hi>[the Papiſts]</hi>
will ſay: <hi>John Huſſe,</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> were burnt at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
I anſwer,</hi> I ſpeak of Heretiques: as for <hi>John Huſſe</hi> and
the ſaid <hi>Jerome,</hi> they were Orthodox men, they being Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques,
Apoſtates, and Antichriſts diſciples, (as appears by what
was formerly ſaid) who burnt them. In imitation of whoſe
example, other murtherers alſo in other places, burnt and
ſlew the Saints of Chriſt, amongſt whom <hi>Jerome Savano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola,</hi>
with thoſe that followed him, may be numbred.</p>
            <p>Secondly, from the Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2. They ſhall turn
their ſwords into Plough-ſhares, and their ſpears into pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
books. And <hi>cap.</hi> 11. They ſhall not kill, nor hurt in all
my holy mountain. And Chriſt committed no manner of arms
or weapons at all to his Apoſtles; nor did he injoyn any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
puniſhment, then that he, who ſhould refuſe to hear the
Church, ſhould be counted as an Heathen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. And
the Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. teacheth to avoid a man that is an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique,
but doth not command that he ſhould be put to death,
either by fire, or ſword. And to the Corinths he ſaith:
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114089:12"/>
there muſt be Herefies, that thoſe which are approved may be
made manifeſt. But what will your holineſs, moſt holy Lord,
here ſay? <hi>Luke</hi> 9. when the Diſciples would have brought
down fire from Heaven to deſtroy a city, Chriſt reſtrained
them; ſaying, you know not of what ſpirit ye are the children.
The Son of man came not to deſtroy mens lives, but to ſave
them: This is that which I have ſaid, and now ſay again,
Chriſt himſelf being my maſter [in it] that they, who perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
men with fire, are not children of the good ſpirit. Of what
ſpirit then? even of the evil ſpirit, who was a murtherer
from the beginning.</p>
            <p>Chriſt would not compell men by force or fire, to the faith. He
gave the ſword of the ſpirit, that the children of his ſpirit ſhould
fight with that. But for this ſword of the ſpirit (the word of God)
the Pope with his Popelings have laid it up in bench-holes
amongſt worms and moths, and are become ſtout hunters,
and <hi>Nimrods</hi> in the earth, who do whatſoever they pleaſe, in
the Name of the old Caldean God, <hi>Ur,</hi> or Fire; that ſo
<hi>Babylon</hi> the latter may in every thing reſemble <hi>Babylon</hi> the
former: this <hi>Babylon</hi> burnt the fore-fathers of Chriſt; the
other, burns his children. The ſame God of them both, <hi>Ur,</hi> or
Fire, always burns and rageth.</p>
            <p>But even theſe men themſelves in their moſt ſacred Canons,
prohibite armes unto Clergy men; and would have the Church to
pray effectually for the preſervation of the life of a Clergy man,
when he is delivered to the ſecular Judicatory. But by ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
as this, they do but make a mock of the death of innocent
men. For in the mean time, the Pope, the Prince of the Clergy,
with all the Kings, make moſt bloody and cruell wars: yea, what
havock and ſlaughters of men are there not made by his command?
when doth he not call in to him the ſecular arm, ſo terrifying the
world with both deaths? And yet the prime Clergy man himſelf
doth not bear arms, whileſt he prays devourly for thoſe that are
to be ſlain, and is earneſt, that they may be diſpatched out of hand,
and that they be narrowly ſearched after, and found out in every
corner of the world. O Satan, Satan, Satan, wo unto thee with

they ſhall be my people. And they ſhall teach no more every man
his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord:
for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them, unto the greateſt
of them, ſaith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I
will remember their ſin no more,</hi> Ier. 31. 33, 34. Theſe, with
many more paſſages of like tendencie and import in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
plainly ſhew, that God hath yet amongſt the ſealed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of his counſels and decrees, precious thoughts towards his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114089:15"/>
ancient people, the nation of the Iews; purpoſing in his time
to build them up again into a Church of far more Inward grace
and holineſs; into a nation, of far more outward beauty,
ſtrength, and glory, then ever was their portion ſince they
firſt became a Church or nation, unto this day, either in the one
kinde, or in the other. Now then I conceive, that the intent
and ſcope, of the Prophet <hi>Zacharie,</hi> in the firſt part of his 13.
Chapter, to the end of <hi>ver.</hi> 6. was to encourage and raiſe the
faint ſpirits of that ſmall remnant of his nation to whom he
was ſent by God with the meſſage of this prophecie, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
unto them, how glorious a Church and nation God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to make of them and their poſterity in time; and what
a ſpirit, and rich anointing of zeal and holineſs, and knowledge
and purity of Religion, ſhould be found upon them in that day;
inſomuch that no touch or tincture of Idolatrie, no mixture of
errour or falſe doctrine, ſhould deface their beauty, or ſtain the
brightneſs of their glory: yea, and that their zeal towards God,
his Law and truth ſhould be ſo exceeding fervent and ſtrong,
that it ſhall command and ſubdue under it, all carnall, yea or
naturall affections, diſpoſitions, and deſires, all other ends, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
and intentions whatſoever.</p>
            <p>By the way this interpretation doth neither ſuppoſe or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
either that there will be any ſon, or child, that ſhall then
<hi>prophecie lies amongst them;</hi> or that parents whether Fathers
or mothers, ſhould or would ſlay them, or <hi>thruſt them through,</hi>
in caſe they did; but ſuch expreſſions as theſe are <hi>figurative</hi> (as
we lately heard from Mr. <hi>Deodate,</hi> and our Engliſh Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon the Bible) <hi>taken from what was commanded againſt
falſe Prophets,</hi> Deut. 13. that is, they only note or expreſs,
ſuch a degree, meaſure, or intenſneſs of zeal to the truth and
puritie of Religion, which God in his Law commanded to be
expreſſed by naturall parents, againſt their children, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
againſt perſons in neereſt and deareſt relation to them, in
the caſe of ſeducement to Idolatrie. Now as the ſame degree,
either of love, or hatred, doth not neceſſarily import a ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
indentitie or ſameneſs of expreſſion, but a generical only,
<hi>viz.</hi> by way of equipollencie, or equivalencie, yea and this only,
when there is occaſion or opportunity: in like manner it is no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114089:15"/>
ways neceſſary, that they who are as zealous for the truth and
Law of God, as thoſe Parents were, who in vindication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
did lay violent hands upon their own naturall children,
ſhould act or expreſs this their zeal, with the ſelf ſame kinde
of expreſſion (I mean, ſhould ſlay their children alſo) there
being ſeveral other ways and kinds of expreſſion, by which
the greateſt zeal for the Truth and purity of Religion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the nature of man is capable, may be proportionably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
and expreſſed, upon occaſion.</p>
            <p>But for the interpretation of the place in hand, laſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and explained, there are theſe reaſons, abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
(as I conceive) to carry it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, there is ſcarce any figure, or propriety of ſpeech more
frequent in the Scripture, then to expreſs a proper and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
ſenſe by words importing another ſenſe equivalent to it.
Thus God promiſeth victories, and deliverances to his people,
by ſaying, <hi>(Pſal.</hi> 68. 22.) <hi>I will bring again from Baſhan; I

            <p>Thirdly, the context it ſelf, and the ſeries thereof, plainly

10. 11. &amp; 12. of the preceding Chapter, the Prophet clearly
deſcribes that great and generall converſion of this people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114089:16"/>
to God, partly by the cauſes or means of it, partly by the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
or effects of it. <hi>And I will poure upon the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the spirit of grace and of
ſupplications, and they ſhall look upon me whom they have
pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his
onely ſon, and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him, as one that is in
bitterneſs for his firſt-born. In that day there ſhall be a great
mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the
valley of Megiddon. And the land ſhall mourn, every family
apart, the family of the houſe of David apart, and their wives
apart: the family of the houſe of Nathan apart, and their wives
apart: the family of the houſe of Levi apart, and their wives
apart: the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart. And
all the families that remain, (viz.</hi> all beſides theſe) <hi>every fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
apart, and their wives apart.</hi> Firſt, evident it is, that the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the things here ſpoken, carries the ſcope and intent
of the paſſage directly upon the nation and people of the Jews,
and doth not ſuffer it to be underſtood of any other. This
needs no other proof; except (haply) a ſecond and more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
peruſall of the words. Secondly, as evident it is, that it
relates, not to a remnant, or leſſer part, but to the generality,
or body of this Nation. <hi>And the land ſhall mourn</hi> (ſaith the

Fourthly, It no where appeareth, either by the Scriptures,
or by any Hiſtory of credit, nor is it in it ſelf a thing any
ways probable, or worthy belief, that ever the nation of the
Jews (I mean, the main body, or generality of them) were
ever ſo zealouſly affected to the truth and purity of Religion,
ſince the time when this Propheſie was uttered, as the tenour
and import hereof ſeems to bear and require. Nay, ſince the
promulgation of the Goſpel in the world (which is the time
conteſted for by many, as wherein the ſaid Propheſie, was to
take place and be fulfilled) the generality of this Nation hath
been ſo far from any zeal for the Truth, that they have been as
violent and deſperate oppoſers of it, as any other Nation, or
generation of men in the world. Therefore (doubtleſs) the
days appointed for the accompliſhment of the Propheſie in
hand, are not yet come.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Severall other of the Prophets of God are wont
in their writings, upon the like occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> for the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church and People of God in their days being
under any affliction or diſcouragement, yea, and otherwiſe, to
re-minde them of the ſaid <hi>Jubilean</hi> times, which God hath in
ſtore amongſt his treaſures, for them and their poſterities, and
will bring forth and give into their boſoms in his appointed
ſeaſon. See <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. &amp; 35. Chapters throughout. And again,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17, 18. and to the end. And yet again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 20.
to the end. See alſo <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32. and to the end of the
Chapter. Other places of like import, as very obvious, and
frequent both in theſe and other Prophets: Yea, I conceive,
that there is ſcarce any one of all the Prophets, (if any) but
in ſome place or other, caſts an eye (at leaſt) upon thoſe times
and days we ſpeak of, though in ſome of them it be hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
where. The ground of my conception in this, is, that of
<hi>Peter</hi> formerly touched, where ſpeaking of <hi>the times of a Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of all things</hi> [to the Jewiſh nation, as was ſaid] he adds
<hi>which God hath ſpoken of by the mouth of all his Prophets, ſince the
world began.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly and laſtly, it ſeems by a brief touch which I finde in
<hi>Grotius</hi> Commentaries upon the Scripture in debate, that the
Expoſition laſt propounded and hitherto argued for, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed

ſome other things the Rabbins fondly refer and apply to the
time after the Reſurrection. What they may further mean by the
<hi>Reſurrection,</hi> I am not able to ſay: but doubtleſs they include
herein, or preſuppoſe that happy and bleſſed eſtate of their
nation, which <hi>Peter</hi> cals (as we have heard) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>the reſtitution of all things,</hi> and which hath been their earneſt
and conſtant expectation for many generations, and is not
let fall by them to this day.</p>
            <p>By that which hath been taken into conſideration in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
to diſcover the minde of God in the Scripture firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
it fully appears, that there is but a very ſlender appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in it of any ground, (if any at all) whereon to build the
lawfulneſs of any compulſory proceedings by way of civill pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie,
whether death, or other, againſt Perſons deemed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
in theſe times of the Goſpel. This <hi>trumpet gives no
diſtinct ſound</hi> at all to <hi>prepare</hi> any man to that <hi>battell.</hi> But when
men <hi>delight in war,</hi> the whiſtling of the wind will ſerve for a
ſignall, It is the obſervation of an Engliſh Divine, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
where ever they meet with the word, fire, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
they finde a proof for purgatory, <hi>A deceived heart</hi> (ſaith
the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> concerning the Idolater) <hi>hath turned him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
that he cannot deliver his ſoul:</hi>

and gratifie their affections with the belief of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
before they have ſeriouſly and impartially debated the
truth of it: the <hi>ſhadows of the mountains</hi> will <hi>ſeem men</hi> unto
them, for the guard and ſupport of it: and on the contrary,
the ſtrongeſt men will ſeem but as the ſhadows of mountains
unto them, for the eviction and dethroning of it.</p>
