         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MY Anſwer to <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s <hi>Challenge</hi> was in terms

unjuſtly that Character upon me &amp; my Friends,
which is moſt deſervedly their own, thereby concealing
and ſecuring the Offender, and ſubſtituting the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent

expoſing us to the Bate of the rude and ignorant Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude:
But it is our Lot, and mine at this time more

            </p>
            <p>But let us hear what he ſayes to prove that my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

him, <q>That it was unfairly done of him to chuſe the
<hi>Barbican-Meeting,</hi> to divulge his Challenge to me,
which I had receiv'd no notice of.</q> To this he replies;
<hi>That the Meeting was occaſion'd by the</hi> Quakers <hi>Appeal:</hi>
Which, beſide that it is nothing to the Purpoſe, is a
great Untruth: Did we occaſion any Meeting, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we were concerned to be preſent without our Notice
and Conſent, either as to Matter or Manner, Time or
Place, taking the word <hi>Occaſion</hi> in the common Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of it? No-body ſurely, but <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> and
ſuch Prejudgers can think ſo. For Shame be Juſt!</p>
            <p>But he believes <hi>ſuch a Critical Seaſon ſeldom happens,
wherein both</hi> G. W. <hi>and I before ſo long a Seaſon out
of the Reach of ſo publick a Concern.</hi> What then!
Therefore were we not then out of Reach? What
would he be at? Lamentable Weakneſs! Is this to
juſtifie his <hi>Cowardly Brags?</hi> I will call them ſo now,
ſince ſofter Terms fair'd ſo ill at his hands. But let
<hi>J. F</hi> know, that for that Glorious Goſpel of Jeſus
Chriſt, our Lord, he with as much Envy as Untruth

Places, and that for Weeks, and ſometimes
Moneths, where no Letters can be ſent to us with any
previous Knowledge where to find us; inſomuch as
that our neareſt and deareſt Relations may have taken
their Leave of this World, and exchanged their Houſe

Money by it, is not expoſed to that and many other
Hardſhips.</p>
            <p>But to palliate the Injuſt Procedure of the <hi>Baptiſts</hi>
againſt us at their firſt <hi>Barbican-Meeting,</hi> he tells us a
Tail of <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s ſurprizing him with a Diſpute
upon three dayes Notice, which he ſaith, was not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

of our Friends, to wit, <hi>Mutual Conſent;</hi> which gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

our Friends, and if he might have Opportunity, to allay
the Heat of this Vapouring Adverſary. <hi>2dly,</hi> It was
ſo far left with <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> either to <hi>accept</hi> or <hi>reject,</hi> as
that it was moſt remote from the Thoughts of <hi>G. W.</hi>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60239:3"/>
ſome of our Friends near the Place of his Reſidence,
which, as I am informed, he declined: I blame him
not for doing ſo. But ſuppoſe <hi>G. W.</hi> was as culpable
as he repreſents him, who ſo little deſerved his Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
how doth this excuſe <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> or extenuate his
own Injuſtice, who without any Notice given to <hi>G. W.</hi>
or my ſelf, did ſo publickly at <hi>Barbican</hi> in our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
abuſe the one, and challenge forth the other in
Defence of himſelf and Friends, from a Charge
then exhibited by him againſt our Faith and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
ſuggeſting to the Auditory, as if what were
in Reality but his own crooked Conſequences (deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of us) had been the expreſs Articles of our Creed.
If yet he can preſume to believe himſelf Modeſt, Juſt
or Chriſtian, his Caſe is deſperate, and I heartily pitty
his Miſtake.</p>
            <p>But he faults me for ſaying, <q>He could not but know
of my being at a great Diſtance;</q> telling me, That
<hi>I either make him an Extraordinary</hi> Gnoſtick, <hi>or my
ſelf ſuch an Over-Laſher as needs to have my words well
meaſured after me.</hi> Truly if <hi>J. Faldo</hi> hath the Doing
of it, I am ſure to be wronged, unleſs he hath changed
his Wont. How near a kin he is to the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> in
other Reſpects, I will not undertake to determine;
only if what <hi>Epiphamus</hi> writes of their Self Conceit, be
true, J. F. has printed himſelf one of the Extraordinarieſt
<hi>Gnoſticks</hi> of this Age: But I will ſtand to my words,
that he muſt needs know of my Abſence; for they that
gave him notice of the Meeting, being ſome of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
concern'd, might alſo inform him, that I was at a
great diſtance, they receiving that Anſwer: But left
he ſhould deny all this, as proba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Gloſs upon the Word EAST, doth the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to an Hairs breadth; for unleſs J. <hi>Faldo</hi>'s Ears
happen like J. <hi>Ives</hi>'s, to be all of a ſudden thick of
Hearing, or to have as great an Impediment as <hi>T. Hick</hi>'s
Tongue (that is, in Caſes unpleaſant to them) he
could not but obſerve, that <hi>W. K.</hi> inſinuated, as if I
had Voyag'd to the <hi>Eaſt-Land,</hi> or the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> too
far for the Noiſe of J. <hi>Faldo</hi>'s Charge to be heard, as
<hi>Empty</hi> as it was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I muſt not forget, and yet take
no Delight to remember, that Grave Perſon purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
left out <hi>England,</hi> joyn'd to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> in the Letter, that
he might better break his Jeſt.</p>
            <p>But be it as it will, I cannot but return J. <hi>Faldo</hi> an
<hi>Alluſion</hi> in his firſt Book, it may be, not in the very
Words, yet the ſame Senſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That he doth with me

            </p>
            <p>I further told him, as he obſerves, <q>that I had twice
Defended our Faith in Print againſt him, and that a
conſiderable Book lay at his Door unanſwer'd.</q> To this
he gives me ſeveral Returns, worth noting, for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
or other: one is this, <hi>That he perfectly knows the
Contrary;</hi> To what? <hi>That I have twice defended our
Belief:</hi> The Quibble is here; I have twice <hi>Writ,</hi> but
not twice <hi>Defended;</hi> notable! but he goes of late for
a <hi>Critick.</hi> however, who ſay ſo? <hi>John Faldo.</hi> Doth
he prove as well as ſay? <hi>No ſuch matter.</hi> He would
not be miſtaken, yet in aſſerting he tranſcends; for he
further tells us, <hi>That I have not overthrown one Line of
his books;</hi> in which, as he explicitely proves his own
Impudence and Oſtentation, ſo implicitely he calls
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60239:4"/>
many, far from <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> as he terms it, <hi>Fools</hi> or

            <p>But to the next Reaſon; <hi>My Prints have confirmed
him;</hi> which, though no Evidence to others of the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs
of his Belief, yet a great one to me, that
that Scripture is fulfilling upon him, <hi>Wicked Men ſhall

            <p>He tells us, <hi>That it is not a Conſiderable Book.</hi> Who

not leſs deſerving his Pains, then thoſe his firſt Book
pretended to refute: If he doth, he would have done
well to point in what; if he doth not, why doth he not

            <p>Well, but ther's more behind, <hi>viz. Whatever Qualities
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60239:4"/>
my laſt Book had,</hi> he tells me, <hi>it is more then I knew, that
ever he ſaw it; He is ſure, I never laid it at his Door, by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
one of them to him.</hi> If he had ſaid, by receiving one of
them it had paſt him; for I might have ſent it, &amp; it might
have many ways miſcarried: But I will not preſs him
with this, nor talk either of <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> or <hi>Over-Laſhers</hi>
to Laſh him with. And that I may right my ſelf, and
ſhew him how willing I was it ſhould lie at his Door,
I did to the beſt of my remembrance, order him one,
and if it came not to his hand, it neither accuſeth me,
nor excuſeth him. <hi>J. Faldo</hi> ſent me none of his, and
I think I never gave that for a Reaſon why either of
them lay at my Door.</p>
            <p>But it ſeems <hi>J. Faldo</hi> hath lately been at <hi>Bedlam,</hi> and
one would think ſo by the <hi>Story</hi> he tells; an Impertinent
one it is Some Body ſaid ſomething of <hi>W. P.</hi> &amp;c. but <hi>Who</hi>
he knows not; here is the Upſhot. What I ſhould ſay I
know not; for he neither directs me to the Perſon, nor
Houſe: So I muſt be contented to leave it as I found it,
with <hi>J. Faldo</hi> and <hi>Bedlam,</hi> a Place that ſuits the Relation.</p>
            <p>He hath not yet done: <hi>My Book is ſaid to be printed in</hi>
1673. <hi>and it ſtuck in the Birth till many Months were
paſt of the Year</hi> 1674. This hits the Book in the Head,
provided the <hi>Title-Page</hi> may ſtand for one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But how
doth <hi>J. Faldo</hi> know it ſtook ſo many Moneths in 1674?
Which way came he ſo well acquainted with the Secrets
of the Preſs? But let us ſee what this <hi>Objection</hi> amounts
to. The <hi>Title</hi> is either printed firſt, or laſt: If <hi>firſt,</hi> ſay
in 73. would he have the Printer foreſee all thoſe Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
that may obſtruct the coming forth of the Book
till 74. in order to ſet down 73, 74? This were to make
a <hi>Gnoſtick</hi> of him with a Witneſs; or if he doth not, his
Book ſhall be charg'd with an <hi>Vntruth:</hi> If the <hi>Title</hi> be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60239:5"/>
printed <hi>laſt</hi> (which I ſuppoſe is not common) ſay in 74.
and he ſets down 74. he tells an <hi>Vntruth</hi> of the <hi>Book,</hi>
though not of the <hi>Title:</hi> Should the Printer then have
ſet it down 73, 74. becauſe ſome of the <hi>Book</hi> was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in 73. this had been an <hi>Vntruth</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Title
Page;</hi> for that was all and only printed in 74.</p>
            <p>That ever a man that loved <hi>Reputation</hi> at the rate they
that know him ſay he doth, ſhould be ſo <hi>Idle in Print!</hi>
Suppoſe his Obſervation true; Is the <hi>Book</hi> therefore not
<hi>Conſiderable?</hi> or doth it not lye at his Door? or is <hi>W. P.</hi>
to be blamed, which is the Buſineſs in hand? What he
would be at I know not; unleſs he deſign'd to ſhew
that he is a <hi>Critick</hi> and well skill'd in <hi>Annals:</hi> but I am
of Opinion that <hi>Baronius</hi> (after the old Proverb) <hi>may
ſleep in a whole Skin</hi> for all <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Attempts.</p>
            <p>His next Reaſon for not giving my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
is, as he ſayes elſewhere, <hi>Magnipotent. I have two
Thouſand Pounds</hi> per ann. <hi>in Poſſeſſion, as reported: I
may waſte Paper, but he</hi> (Alas for him!) <hi>muſt write no
more then is deem'd Convenient and Satisfactory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I perceive that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> is govern'd much by <hi>Reports,</hi>
and that may be one <hi>Reaſen</hi> why the Man reports ſo
much <hi>Vntruth:</hi> But if he will make the Report good,
I will give him a Years Rent, and let him waſte Paper,
or waſte it in Paper, and then call it an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to <hi>W. P.</hi>
if he pleaſeth. I obſerve that his Want of it is the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his not being a better Friend to the Printer; for
his words, that <hi>He muſt write no more then what is deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
convenient,</hi> imply, that had he wherewithal, he might
Write and <hi>Waſte,</hi> and Waſte and <hi>Write.</hi> But what is the
true <hi>Engliſh</hi> of this Apologetical Sentence? It is to be
ſuſpected this, viz. <hi>I muſt write no more then can be ſold:
The Book-ſellers do not deem more of my Writings Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60239:5"/>
and Satisfactory;</hi> For I cannot believe that J. F.
could not write what he deems both Convenient and
Satisfactory. But what is become of that greedy <hi>Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite
in Learned and Vnlearned after his Books,</hi> not only
certified by the <hi>Book-ſellers,</hi> but with a moſt nauſeous
<hi>Self Glorying</hi> proclaimed by himſelf in his <hi>Vindication?</hi>
For my part, I know not what elſe to infer from all this
then that his Books are become a Drug; at leaſt, they ſo
far ſtick undigeſted in the Peoples Stomachs, if not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold
in the Bookſellers Shops, as there is neither Appetite
enough in the one, nor Room enough in the other for
more of the Labours of the <hi>Author of Quakeriſm No
Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he thanks me that I have put one <hi>Argument</hi> into
his Mouth, viz. <hi>Wherefore hath</hi> W. P. <hi>made ſuch a Busſie
againſt Mr.</hi> Hicks <hi>and me, ſeeing he hath not toucht, or
much leſs anſwer'd the far greater part of my firſt Book?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh that <hi>J. Faldo</hi> would but learn to write <hi>Truth,</hi> and
not cover great Weakneſs and Baleneſs with ſo much
<hi>Vntruth!</hi> Have I not anſwered to every <hi>Charge</hi> in the
firſt Book? Examin'd 2, 3, 4 or 5. of his <hi>Witneſſes</hi> at a
time to each Charge; <hi>that is,</hi> Teſtimonies out of our
Friends Books, he brought to juſtifie it? It ſeems then
that my not fully Anſwering of his <hi>firſt</hi> Book is one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why he hath hitherto declin'd Publiſhing ſomething
againſt my ſecond; but had the Man been of this Mind
before, doubtleſs he would never have writ a <hi>Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſaith J. F. to my <hi>ſecond Book,</hi> wherein I
charge him in Point of <hi>Fact</hi> with ſo many horrid <hi>Abuſes
or our Principles and Writings?</hi> Not one word, unleſs
that it is a conſiderable Book for <hi>Railing, Confidence,

                  </gap>deſty?</hi> Am I not like to be cur'd of my
<hi>Confidence</hi> by a <hi>Curb</hi> made up of ſuch Links? Certainly
unleſs <hi>J. Faldo</hi> hath as little Brains, as this Character of
my Book ſhows him to have of <hi>Honeſty,</hi> he cannot think
tkis <hi>Entertainment</hi> ſhould prevail with me to ſtep over
the Kennel to meet ſuch A—. If ever Man was
wrong'd, I am in that Expreſſion; though his <hi>Saying</hi> and
<hi>Not Proving</hi> helps it a little. I will at preſent overlook
all but the laſt Ill Quality he faſtens upon my <hi>Rejoynder,</hi>
and that is, <hi>Not fairly citing his Reply:</hi> I think I may ſay,
I have quoted the better half of his <hi>Reply</hi> into my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynder,</hi>
and that with ſuch Diſtinction as any Capacity
may diſcern his Matter from mine; And where he hath
quoted One Line of mine, I have quoted Three of his.
But I cannot think this the Way to <hi>Carb my Confidence;</hi>
or to <hi>Act</hi> the <hi>Modeſt Man,</hi> To <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Not Prove;</hi>
Nay, to Overlook ſo much <hi>Charg'd</hi> and <hi>Proved</hi> againſt
him <hi>in my Rejoynder,</hi> That is, <hi>Vnfairly Citing us, groſly
Perverting what is cited, Adding or Diminiſhing, as beſt
anſwer'd his Ends; overlooking my Matter &amp; Arguments,
and evading the Strength of moſt of what he cited; Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Conſequences unfairly drawn upon us for our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and abuſing our Writings to maintain that Abuſe;</hi>
which is not only prov'd in the Body of the Diſcourſe,
but ſumm'd up at the End of my <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> to help the
Readers Memory. And ſo far hath the Man been from

               </gap>trinally, that he ſuffers himſelf

is no Argument to do Indiſcretly a third time, becauſe
a Man hath done ſo twice before. Had I return'd him
a <hi>Seurrilousc Frothy &amp; Evaſive Pamphlet</hi> (like his <hi>Reply</hi>)
to his great Book, I ſhould have blam'd my ſelf, not him;
but I did conſcientiouſly conſider it, and beſtow'd a large
&amp; grave Diſcourſe upon it, faithfully citing, and (I hope)
as fully enervating it. But to this he objects, &amp; that ſeems
the Strength of his <hi>Sheet,</hi> if there be any in it; that is, <hi>That
he made 12 Citations out of our own Books, and brought</hi> 13
<hi>Texts of <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

but that he had aggravated his Evil by groſly <hi>Abuſing our
Books, to prove his Infamous Charge:</hi> Now I would fain
know, if it became not <hi>J. Faldo</hi> rather to have ſhown
how weakly I invalidated his Evidence, and prov'd him
as <hi>Abuſer of our Words,</hi> then to tell the World <hi>I took but
Two into Conſideration;</hi> for if he be gone upon them,
he is gone upon all; for they are not a Jot more to his
Purpoſe, if ſo much, as thoſe examin'd: And I did not
holy my ſelf oblieged to anſwer every impertinent Line
in his Book: If I skipt the Strength of his Evidence, or
that thoſe I left had ſomething not expreſt or implyed in
the other, it had been proper for him to have particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and expreſly excepted againſt me; all which he not
doing, <hi>his Objection is frivolous,</hi> and amounts to no
more then a mean <hi>Shuffle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he tells the World, <hi>That alſo a whole Chapter of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60239:7"/>
Apoſtolical Inſpirations lye at my Door untoucht, and that
they may judge at what rate I have anſwer'd his Book.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor Man! Is this all he can do, after he hath thought
fit to give us a ſecond Book? Muſt his firſt be his <hi>Aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>
ſtill? Why did he not tell T. H. and W K. ſo to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
his coming to <hi>Barbican?</hi> Is he for <hi>Diſputing</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
and yet not for <hi>Writing?</hi> It ſeems then
that <hi>it is not deem'd Inconvenient to Diſpute, but Write.</hi>
Well! But why will <hi>J. Faldo</hi> drop things againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and, as he terms it, <hi>put Inſtances in my Mouth,</hi> to
prove him a moſt <hi>Diſingenuous and Impudent Perſon?</hi>
for did I not tell him, <q>That what concern'd us upon the
Point of <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> I had treated at large elſe where,
and there was no need of a Repetition?</q> Now hath he
ſhown or attempted an Enervation of that? <hi>Nothing
leſs.</hi> Or that we were concern'd in that more then in his
4th Chapter? <hi>No ſuch Matter.</hi> Or hath he given us
one Reaſon, why I ought to have conſider'd it? Or dare
he ſay, the other contain'd not the Matter of it? What
more can we ſay to a Man of this Fore-head? I told him
of <hi>Scores of Paſſages given by him under our Name, he had
not ſo much as cited Perſon or Book for, as well as abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
willfully abuſed by him, that he did cite:</hi> To all
which he is as mute as if I had never accuſed him, or he
had nothing to ſay in his own Vindication. Is his <hi>Recri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination</hi>
(ſuppoſe a Reaſon for it in its place) a valid
<hi>Anſwer?</hi> Would he have thought this enough to his two
Books? How eaſily could we have told J. F. <hi>Thou haſt
abuſed our Religion, Books and Perſons;</hi> but would he
have accepted this as a ſufficient <hi>Anſwer or Rejoynder?</hi>
He tells the World <hi>of our Denying the Man's Nature,
or Man Chirſt Jeſus,</hi> and brings a Company of wreſted
and miſapplyed Sentences to vail his Abuſe from the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60239:7"/>
Vulgar; who moſt faithfully and honeſtly believe it, and
never ſpeak or write undervaluingly of it: But becauſe

we make void the ourward Coming &amp; Sufferings of Chriſt,
and utterly deny and reject him, as he is the Man Chriſt
Jeſus.</hi> I wiſh for their ſakes that thus traduce us, they
were as far from drawing ſuch <hi>Conſequences,</hi> as our
<hi>Faith</hi> is from countenancing them. Of this I have ſpoak
ſo largely both in my <hi>Anſwer</hi> and <hi>Rejoynder</hi> diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
overlookt by this Adverſary.</p>
            <p>But he faults me for ſaying, <hi>That</hi> W. Smith<hi>'s Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi>
is ſcripturally written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but never takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his unworthy <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> nor my <hi>Anſwer,</hi> as he
ought to have done. The Matter was this: <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
making uſe of this Inſtance, to prove we preferr'd our
own Writings before the Scriptures, viz. <hi>That we call'd
our own Sayings &amp; Books, The Voice of the Son of God was
uttered forth by him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Truths Principles; Shield of
Truth,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer'd, that thoſe Titles were given with
reſpect to that Divine Truth they declar'd of and teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto; not in Compariſon with the Scriptures: That
not one of thoſe Books were deſtitute of Scripture; but
it either <hi>generally</hi> writ in a <hi>Scriptural Styl,</hi> or <hi>particularly</hi>
defended by expreſs <hi>Scripture cited;</hi> therefore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
the Scripture muſt alſo partake with them in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
of thoſe famous Titles: And thus far have they the
<hi>Preference</hi> that they are quoted on purpoſe to give the
Truth we write of greater Credit; What is that greater
Credit then to be exactly agreeable with them?</p>
            <p>This and more I gave for <hi>Anſwer;</hi> He replieth thu:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:60239:8"/>
I leave it to my Reader to give a Name to this Paſſage,
the like to which for a daring Vntruth the World hath
ſcarcely been acquainted with; yet the Man pretends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
all other Graces, to * Infallibility.</p>
            <p>It is frequent with him, and that Sort of <hi>Adverſaries,</hi> to fling
<hi>Infallibility</hi> in our Teeth; and here he doth it with <hi>manifeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion,</hi>
as if it was a greater Evil to be <hi>Infallible,</hi> then to <hi>Err;</hi> but
let the Reader know, that we do not ſo much as pretend to any ſuch
Thing, as meer Men; for as ſuch, <hi>Humanum eſt crrare;</hi> but in
our Judgment of the Things of God, ſo far as we receive it from
the <hi>Grace</hi> of God. And if this be a Piece of <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in J <hi>Faldo</hi>'s Account, the Scripture muſt
anſwer for it; only I cannot but take Notice how he beats the Air,
who either defends or oppoſeth any Religion upon <hi>Fallible Grounds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In many a large Libel I could produce, where there is
not one Quotation of Scripture. <hi>W. Smith</hi> in his Directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
for Religious Principles, conſiſting of above 200. Pages,
hath not one Scripture quoted, not one Exhortation to read
the Scriptures; but as his main Scope, denyes and throws
Dirt upon them.</p>
            <p>This was <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Reply, I ſhall now contract the
Subſtance of my Rejoynder to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> I did not ſay that there was not one Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
plenty of expreſs Scripture, but that <hi>thoſe</hi> Books
(whoſe Titles he quoted) were either generally in a
Scripture Style, or particularly defended by plenty of
expreſs Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To confute me, he produceth one of thoſe
Books, wherein he ſaith, one Scripture was not quoted;
as if that was ſufficient to prove, it was not written gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in a Scripture Style one half of the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ueſtion; Upon
which I made him this Challenge, to give me one
Book out of a Scripture ſtyle, that is not Controverſial,
or any Controverſial Book without expreſs Scripture
cited: If he could not, his vain Inſulte ſhould fall upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60239:8"/>
his own Head. In this particular, though he has ove
lookt all the reſt of my Diſcourſe in Defence of our
<hi>Faith, Writings</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> he undertakes me in his
pretended <hi>Curb</hi> to my <hi>Confidence,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>To
accept</hi> W. P<hi>'s Challenge is no bold thing; and to ſhew
his unparallel'd. Falſehood and Confidence, I ſhall need
to give you but a few Inſtances out of</hi> W. Smith's Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm
and Primer.</p>
            <p>But <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> Three inſtances, few enough to be ſure,
prove 200 Pages <hi>generally</hi> unſcriptural, the Terms of
the Queſtion? Methinks this ſhews more <hi>Confidence</hi>
then a Man that undertakes to <hi>Curb</hi> another Man's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

ancient <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which is undeniable with <hi>J. Faldo,</hi>
and that ſcuh an unſcriptural uſe may be called an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,
and that the Pope be a Man, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Sin, as alſo <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> I ſuppoſe, and many more do
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60239:9"/>
conceive, and all this Scripturally; then, I hope, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
with any ſober Pretence be deny'd but that <hi>W. S</hi>'s
Anſwer is very Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>l. But what makes this great
<hi>Pretender to Truth and Modeſty</hi> decline taking any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of that Charge I publiſht againſt him upon occaſion
of his moſt groſs <hi>Abuſe</hi> of <hi>W. Smith</hi> upon theſe words?
who would needs have it, that <hi>W. Smith</hi> calls the Lord's
Supper the <hi>Pope's Invention,</hi> when I expreſly proved
out of the ſame place, that <hi>W. Smith</hi> intended it of the
preſent Practice of them, and not of any primitive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution?
<hi>W. Smith</hi>'s words are theſe: <q>The whole
Practice of thoſe things as THEY USE them,
had their Inſtitution by the Pope, and were never SO
ordained of Chriſt; for he did not ordain <hi>Sprinkling of
Water in a Child's face, or to make a Sign of a Croſs in
his forehead, nor God-fathers and God-mothers to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
for it; neither did he ordain Bread and VVine to
be SO</hi> (or after that Manner) <hi>uſed and received.</hi>
               </q> If
this be to make <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Supper Popiſh,</hi> what
becomes of his <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> and all <hi>Protestants,</hi>
that maintain the ſame reſpectively? But moſt evident
it is, <hi>VV. Smith</hi> intended not that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>Supper</hi>
uſed by the Ancient <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> but moſt true it is, that
<hi>J. Faldo</hi> made <hi>VV. Smith</hi> to intend ſo. I leave the
Reader to give a Name to this Carriage; the like to
which for a <hi>Daring Perverſion</hi> I yet know nobody guilty
of, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> and <hi>T. Hicks</hi> excepted.</p>
            <p>Now for the next Inſtance brought to prove our Books
unſcripturally written.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Child,</hi> Then the Scriptures are to be owned and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
as a true Teſtimony of what the Saints were
made Partakers of in that Day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60239:9"/>
               <hi>Father,</hi> Yes, they are to be owned and believed, and they
that do not ſo they are to be denyed.</p>
            <p>An admirable Confeſſion to the Scriptures: Is this
the way to prove <hi>W. Smith's</hi> Book unſcripturally writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?
That there is not an Exhortation to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and that the whole ſcope of it is, to throw Dirt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, yea, to <hi>deny</hi> them, though <hi>J. Faldo</hi> himſelf
tells us, that <hi>W. Smith,</hi> teacheth <hi>that thoſe ought to be
denyed that do not own them;</hi> but the Truth is, <hi>J. Faldo's</hi>
Proofs againſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> are like <hi>Hebrew</hi> to be read
backwards; He hath a Faculty beyond the common
rate of men, to facilitate his own Confutation. But
he makes <hi>W. Smith</hi> further to Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Thou muſt take heed Child, of giving more unto the
Scriptures, then unto them belongs, leſt in ſo doing thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſheſt
from the Glory of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>What of all this? May not People <hi>Idolize,</hi> as well as
undervalue <hi>the Scriptures?</hi> Ought they to be put <hi>in the
room of Chriſt?</hi> Or is it ill done, to exhort People <hi>to
prefer</hi> Chriſt <hi>before the Scriptures?</hi> How can <hi>J. Faldo</hi>
call this part of <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s Anſwer Unſcriptural, and yet
believe thoſe words of Chriſt be any part of Scripture?
<hi>Search</hi> (or rather, <hi>ye</hi> ſearch) <hi>the Scriptures, for in them ye
think ye have Eternal Life, &amp; they are they which teſtifie
of me, &amp; ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life,</hi>
Joh. 5. 39, 40. <hi>I am the Way, the Truth and the Life,</hi>
Joh. 14. 6. Chriſt himſelf here teacheth us, to give him
the <hi>Preference;</hi> and implicitely rebuketh the <hi>Jews</hi> from
expecting Eternal Life in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> rather then in
<hi>Him,</hi> who is the Way, the Truth and the Life.</p>
            <p>His laſt Inſtance is this:</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Child,</hi> I am ſenſible that there is ſomething in my

            <p>Father, <hi>That is the true Light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Child,</hi>
               <q>But if I ſhould turn to it, and obey it when it
reproveth me for Sin, is there Power in it to ſave me
from Sin, and to deliver me from Iniquity?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father,</hi> Yes, Child; All Power in Heaven and Earth
is in it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now judge <hi>Reader,</hi> ſaith J. F. If all theſe things are
contain'd in the Scripture. But I will help the <hi>Reader</hi> to
judge rightly in this matter; and queſtion not if by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
he means as he ought, <hi>the Subſtance of ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers,</hi>
and not that they are ſo laid down, to prove them,
to be according to Scripture; and therefore Scriptural.</p>
            <p>Iſt, That it is <hi>God,</hi> who <hi>ſearcheth the Heart, tryeth
the Reins, and telleth unto Man his Thoughts,</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
affirms; and I know no body that pretends to
<hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> denyeth it.</p>
            <p>2. The Apoſtle aſſerts, <hi>That which may be known of
God is manifeſt men; for God hath ſhown it unto them,</hi>
Rom. 1. 19.</p>
            <p>3. That it was the Apoſtolical Meſſage, <hi>That God is
Light,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5.</p>
            <p>4. That whatſoever doth make manifeſt is Light, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ.</hi>
5 13.</p>
            <p>5. That <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is God over all, bleſſed forever,
<hi>is that True Light, which</hi> (thus) <hi>enlightneth every man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. That all Power in Heaven and in Earth belongs to
Chriſt, the true Light.</p>
            <p>Now unleſs he denyes, <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt</hi> to
be <hi>Light,</hi> or, that <hi>He,</hi> the true Light, ſo ſearcheth,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or that all Power in Heaven and Earth belongs
to <hi>Him</hi> it will naturally follow, that to ſay, <hi>All Power
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60239:10"/>
in Heaven and in Earth belongs to God, Chriſt</hi> or the
<hi>Light</hi> of the World, is <hi>Equivalent:</hi> For we do not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert,

I have taken great Care with ſeveral others,
to explain our Belief in this matter, if poſſible, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
ſuch Evil-minded Men as this <hi>Adverſary,</hi> from
making ſo Ill and Uſe of our Innocent Expreſſions, and
giving their own monſtrous Conſequences for our Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptural
Principles.</p>
            <p>Thus much to evidence to my Reader, how ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
J. F. flung <hi>Vnparall<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

me for aſſerting, that thoſe Books before mention'd
were generally written in a Scripture Style; and with
what Weakneſs he hath endeavour'd to diſprove me.</p>
            <p>I ſhall among a multitude of Inſtances that might be
given, produce 10. to ſhow to my Reader with what
Truth thoſe Imputations belong to <hi>J. Faldo,</hi> and how
exactly he character'd himſelf when he beſtow'd that
Reflection upon me.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>J. Faldo</hi> affirms that <hi>W. Smith</hi> not only quoted ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Scripture &amp; writ unſcripturally, but <hi>that he had not
one Exhortation to read the Scriptures, nay, that the main
Deſign of the Book was to deny them, and throw Dirt upon
them;</hi> yet J. F. thus cites him concerning the Scriptures:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Child, Then the S<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father,</hi> Yes, they are to he OWN'D &amp; BELIEV'D,
and they that do not ſo are to be DENIED.</p>
            <p>To this let me add another notable Paſſage in the
ſame Diſcourſe, cited by me in that very Page of my
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60239:11"/>
               <hi>Rejoynder,</hi> where my <hi>Challenge</hi> lay (which he thought
no Boldneſs to accept) though he was ſo modeſt, as not
to be ſo bold with this Paſſage.</p>

are given forth and recorded without?</q>
            </p>

receiv'd the ſame Spirit from whom they were given forth;
for unto ſuch they are</hi> PROFITABLE, <hi>and</hi> MAKE
WISE <hi>unto Salvation; and are unto them of Service, for</hi>
INSTRUCTION, EDIFICATION &amp; COMFORT,
Rejoynd. <hi>pag.</hi> 61. Is there no <hi>Exhortation</hi> lodg'd in
theſe words? And is this to <hi>Deny</hi> or <hi>throw Dirt</hi> upon
the Scriptures? If any ſhall object <hi>W. Smith</hi>'s making
the <hi>Spirit neceſſary to the profitable Reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
let them go to <hi>W. Tindal, J. Bradford,</hi> Bp. <hi>Jewel,

Catalogue of <hi>Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. My ſecond Inſtance ſhall be this, That he makes
<hi>W. Smith</hi> call the Scriptures <hi>Traditions of Men, Earthly

of Scripture as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed, and to thoſe Ends,
makes men harder to be wrought upon to true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
then the Heathen, <hi>J. Faldo</hi> infers, <hi>that reading the

            <p>Thus much, and I wiſh here had been no occaſion for
this, to evidence the falſe and unworthy Practice of <hi>J.

touch upon his <hi>Confidence.</hi> ſince he hath intituled me
to an unparallel'd ſhare, and counts himſelf the fit Perſon
to <hi>Curb</hi> me for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>J. Faldo</hi> began with us in a great Book called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm
No Christianity;</hi> I anſwered him in a Book, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
<hi>Quakeriſm a New Nickname for Old Christianity;</hi>
againſt this he put forth his <hi>Vindication,</hi> unto which I
made my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> conſiſting of TWENTY THREE
CHAPTERS, in which I vindicated our Principles, ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
them of thoſe frightful Vizards and hateful Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes

iin favor of the whole above TWO HUNDRED

            <p>Beſides all this I faulted his Conduct and Behaviour in

<hi>Paper</hi> to bind it, which when all came to all, <hi>was but ſome
of the Contents of his firſt Book twice largely anſwered;</hi>
and becauſe no farther Notice was taken of this <hi>Giant,</hi>
partly by not receiving his Paper ſo ſoon as might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
and partly by reaſon of theſe other Conteſts that
claim Precedency; That he might not be thought <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Body,</hi>
when ſo many ſtrove to be <hi>Some-Body</hi> againſt us,
he prints it, without all conſideration had to my <hi>Rejoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
or ſo much as an <hi>Apology</hi> for his <hi>Silence</hi> to it, which
at leaſt had become a <hi>Modeſt Perſon</hi> to give: After all
this can any man think <hi>J. Faldo</hi> Baſhful, or one that is
ſo out of Love with <hi>Confidence</hi> in himſelf, as that he is
fit to <hi>Curb</hi> it in others? Me thinks he ſhould not believe
that repetitious <hi>Farthing</hi> or <hi>Half-penny Paper</hi> feat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
toi excuſe him; or ſo ſufficient to acquit him of
old Debts, as that without any <hi>Breach of Modeſty</hi> or
common <hi>Honeſty,</hi> he might encreaſe his former Score by
freſh <hi>Charges:</hi> It is but reaſonable that he ſhould make
good what he hath done firſt; and not, that we ſhould
gratifie every importinent, tautological <hi>Humor</hi> of <hi>J. F.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſaith <hi>John Faldo,</hi> to this part of my <hi>Anſwer</hi>
to his <hi>Challenge? viz.</hi> 
               <q>But that I may acquit my ſelf of
that Duty incumbent on me for the Truth, I do
hereby ſignifie, That in as much as the <hi>Controverſie</hi>
depending between <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> &amp;c. and us, takes in
the moſt of the particulars of his <hi>Charge,</hi> we freely
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60239:13"/>
conſent, that he ſhould come in with them for a Share
as <hi>Confederate</hi> in the ſame work, and uſe his utmoſt
Abilities to maintain his Accuſations; <hi>And, if in any
thing his Charge is ſingular, we ſhall be ready to hear
and fairly debate it at the ſame Meeting or Meetings, to
avoid freſh and unneſſary Conteſts, as much as juſtly
may be.</hi>
               </q> To this he thus Replieth:</p>
            <p>1. I muſt fall into a Confederacy which the Antipaedo-baptiſts,
in the ſame Work: Hold a little Mr. Penn!
If I have my Option, I muſt deal with you ſingly; More
confuſe rather then aſſiſt: But it ſeems I muſt be wholely
at your Appointment; for, although you had conſented
that in your Conteſt about <hi>Mr. Hicks's Dialogues</hi> there
ſhould four of each Party have Liberty to ſpeak; yet I no
ſooner began to oppoſe you (being deſired to be one of the
four) but you told me, you were not to diſpute with me, but
<hi>Mr. Hicks,</hi> and call'd to <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> and were follow'd by the
<hi>Quakers</hi> Clamours of <hi>Hicks, Hicks,</hi> which anſwer'd your
End, and forc'd my Silence.</p>
            <p>Contradiction and <hi>Falſhood</hi> make up this <hi>Paragraph.</hi>
Was he not of the <hi>Confederacy,</hi> when he tells us him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that he was not only a <hi>Party</hi> with them, but <hi>One of
the four</hi> pitcht upon to mannage their Cauſe?</p>
            <p>But if he have his <hi>Option,</hi> he muſt deal with me ſingly.</p>
            <p>It is time for him indeed, who hath been a double-dealing
ſo long: But certainly, if the man were not
more then ordinarily fond of hearing himſelf talk, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagantly
ambitious of a ſingle Crown, he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with a <hi>Partner;</hi> but this <hi>Option</hi> holds no Concord
with his <hi>Adoption</hi> into the <hi>Confederacy:</hi> He hath begun
already as one of the four, what hinders that he ſhould
not continue ſo? But he thinks <hi>that more then one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds
rather then aſſiſts:</hi> If ſo, what made <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> have
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60239:13"/>
three to help him? And why did <hi>J. Faldo</hi> attempt it?
Certainly he did not deſign to confound <hi>T. Hicks.</hi> To
all this <hi>Confuſion</hi> of his let me add his <hi>Vntruth:</hi> He
chargeth me with telling him at the <hi>Barbican</hi>-Meeting
when he began to ſpeak, <hi>I was not there to diſpute with
him,</hi> which is falſe to a Title; Either his <hi>Ears</hi> were as
infirm, as his <hi>Voice</hi> was low, or elſe he ſaith this to ſerve
his preſent occaſion: however, I ſaid no ſuch thing; but
underſtanding it to be him that ſpoak from ſome better
acquainted with his * perſon, I anſwered,<note place="margin">I never ſaw him before; and he aſſerts in his this printed Paper, that he never ſaw me till the <hi>Barbican</hi> Meeting, yet ſeveral Moueths before in his printed Vindication he ſaith, he had ſpoaken with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>
               <hi>Thus the Noiſe
of the Multitude was ſo great,
We could not hear what he
ſaid;</hi> Though had I given that
Anſwer he made for me, I
think it had been very reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
ſince he never told us, <hi>That he was One of the four;</hi>
beſides, more then that fixt Number had ſpoaken before
him. <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>ſhould clamour,</hi> Hicks, Hicks,
<hi>to anſwer my End, and force his Silence,</hi> is as true as the
reſt; It was the Multitude that frequently and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
cryed, <hi>Hicks, Hicks, Hicks;</hi> as looking upon
it unreaſonable that one who had ſhown himſelf ſo arch
in abuſing us, ſhould pretend ſuch Inability to anſwer
our Charge, as that other Folks muſt moſtly mannage
his Affair. But that to ſilence him was to anſwer my
End, is both to tell A—and proclaim the good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
he has of himſelf, as if it ſtood our Cauſe ſo
much upon, to have him ſilent, and <hi>T. Hicks</hi> ſpeak,
Poor <hi>T. Hicks!</hi> this was not kindly done of J. F. but
perhaps he meant it of his better Elocution and Skill
in ſtating the Queſtion, recommended to us in his <hi>Curb</hi>
to my <hi>Confidence:</hi> Modeſt Man that he would be
thought!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:60239:14"/>
But what ſaith he to this part of my fair Offer, That
<hi>if in any thing his Charge be ſingular, we ſhould be ready
to debate it at the ſame Meeting or Meetings with the</hi>
Baptiſts, <hi>to avoid Vnneceſſary Contests;</hi> ſince moſt of
the Particulars of his Charge are taken in by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
depending between us and the <hi>Baptists: It is
not only an Vntruth</hi> (ſayes J. F.) <hi>but a meer Shift; for
in the One and Twenty Propoſals to be debated by them,
there is not one of the Particulars of my Charge: Beſides
in Poſition to be diſputed on, not only the Matter, but the
Form, and each Term is of great Conſideration.</hi> Which
is as much as to ſay, if I underſtand <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that after we have diſputed the Matter of the ſame
Queſtions with <hi>T. H.</hi> and his Three Aſſiſtants, they
muſt be diſputed over again upon <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s new Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
which one Nice and Humorſom Impertinency ſhall
make Diſputes both Endleſs and Uſeleſs: Let him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
his Skill upon <hi>T. Hicks,</hi> his Cauſe wants it, and
do their utmoſt together. But he would faſten an
Untruth upon me, for ſaying, that moſt of the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
of his Charge are taken into that Controverſie,
affirming, <hi>That in our One and Twenty Propoſals there
was not one of the Particulars of his Charge;</hi> To which
I need ſay no more but this, The Charge we exhibited
againſt <hi>T. Hicks</hi> contain'd ſo many particular Charges:
I grant they related to Matter of Fact, and in that ſenſe
the Particulars of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Charge againſt us, were
not explicitly there; yet they that pleaſe to read what
follows the One and Twenty Particulars, as given in to
the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> exhibited and read at <hi>Barbican,</hi> and ſince
printed in our <hi>firſt Account,</hi> they will find that we offer
after a full Conſideration and Determination upon the
foreſaid Particulars, <hi>to come to Doctrinal Points, which
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60239:14"/>
are chiefly in Controverſie between us and them upon</hi>
T. Hicks<hi>'s Three Dialogues;</hi> and I hope <hi>J. Faldo</hi> is not
grown quite ſo deſperate as to deny that moſt, if not
all the Particulars of his Charge, fall in with <hi>T. Hicks</hi>'s
Attempts againſt us, and that materially too. I have
heard as if ſuch a Confeſſion was one part of his
Speech at the firſt <hi>Barbican</hi>-Meeting: However, if he
denyes their Endeavours to have been ſo harmonious, I
offer to prove them ſo; but could I not do it, yet I
made Proviſion for him, wherein his Caſe is ſingular.
Beſides, I deſire the <hi>Reader</hi> to take notice, I did not
ſay, the Particulars of <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Charge were expreſt
in the Catalogue of our Charge of Matter of Fact a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<hi>T. Hicks,</hi> but that <hi>they fell in with the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,</hi>
which word <hi>Controverſie</hi> takes in both <hi>Fact</hi> and
<hi>Doctrine:</hi> And ſince he could fall in with <hi>T. Hicks</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> at <hi>Barbican,</hi> wherein he was not
concerned there can be no juſt Pretence for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
falling in with <hi>T. H.</hi> in Matter of Doctrine, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he is concerned: So that, in ſhort, I am neither guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Vntruth.</hi> who never ſaid, that moſt of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
of his Charge were concerned in the One and
Twenty Particulars of Fact exhibited againſt <hi>T. H.</hi>
but in the <hi>Controverſie,</hi> which is moſt true; nor yet
of <hi>Shiſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ng,</hi> in referring him to our Meeting with <hi>T.
Hicks,</hi> ſince I therein only offer what his own Words
and Practice countenance me in eſpecially, ſince I fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
added (as before ſaid) That <hi>if in any thing his
Charge was ſingular</hi> from that Controverſie, <hi>we ſhould
be ready to hear and fairly debate at the ſame Meeting,</hi> to
avoid freſh and unneceſſary Conteſts. One would think
this were pretty fair to a Man under <hi>J. Faldo</hi>'s Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
with us. I leave the <hi>Reader</hi> to ſay where the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60239:15"/>
               <hi>Shift</hi> and the <hi>Vntruth</hi> lieth. Only let me add Two
Paſſages more, that will not a little help him to make a
true Judgmenr of the Man.</p>
            <p>The one is his telling the World, <hi>That by my Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript
Letter to him, I do in effect unſay all again, that
I ſaid of accepting his Challenge in my Printed An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi>
and yet neither prints the Letter, though but
ſhort, nor that Paſſage he faſtens his Conſequence upon.
Its true, I told him, that it was our preſent Reſolution to
ſtick to the Matter of Fact againſt <hi>T. H.</hi> and ſo much he
prints; but what is that to the Purpoſe? Will any ſcuh
Paſſage bear an <hi>Ergo,</hi> W. Penn <hi>unſaith all he ſaid
of Accepting the Challenge, &amp;c?</hi> Or, <hi>therefore</hi> W. Penn
<hi>will never proceed to Matter of Doctrine, becauſe he firſt
reſolves to ſtick to Matter of Fact,</hi> the Method agreed
upon?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The other Paſſage is this:</hi> For my part, though I ſhall
not refuſe any Opportunity offered to defend the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>
Religion from its Adverſaries; yet I expect that Mr.
<hi>Penn</hi> ſhall undertake to defend the <hi>Quakers</hi> (and himſelf
eſpecially) from my Charge, intire as it is exhibited, and
until then I ſhall look on him as declining it.</p>
            <p>At what rate I decline a Meeting, and how well <hi>J. Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
proves it, impartial men may judge: But one would
think by what he ſaith, as if he were another <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
and the <hi>Quakers</hi> a pack of obſtinate <hi>Heathens,</hi>
He is unfit to defend <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> whoſe Works prove
he doth not underſtand it, unleſs the <hi>Jew</hi> outward with
all his Envy, be the <hi>Jew</hi> inward; or a froward <hi>Phariſee,</hi>
a good <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> No, No. <hi>J. Faldo</hi> we affirm hath
firſt charged impious Errors upon us, and then abuſed
our Writings to countenance them with; And though
this be largely and effectually diſcovered in not only my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60239:15"/>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> (at which he let fly a <hi>ſquibbing Reply</hi>) but in
my <hi>Rejoynder</hi> too (being a more particular Reſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the whole Controverſie, and unto which he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
yet made any Return) we ſee he hath Forehead e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to inſinuate as if the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſtill remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defended.
This is the man that undertakes to <hi>Cure my
Confidenct,</hi> who begs ſo unreaſonably and importunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and doth as good as threaten, if I refuſe his Terms;
and which aggravates the Matter, he would have Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
believe, that I ſhift defending the <hi>Quakers,</hi> whilſt
he is yet ſo manifeſt a Debtor to our Defences.</p>
            <p>Well, but for all this, that it may ſufficiently appear
we neither did not do decline a Meeting with him; Let
it be obſerved, <hi>1ſt,</hi> That I gave him timely Notice of
our <hi>Wheeler ſtreet-Meeting,</hi> with an Invitation to be
there, and went more in Expectation of him then <hi>T.
Hicks,</hi> from a Report that <hi>T. H.</hi> would not, but
that <hi>John Faldo</hi> intended to be preſent, though both
thought fit to be abſent. <hi>2dly,</hi> If he yet thinks it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to imbrace that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ffer already made, <hi>viz. To be
one of the four,</hi> a Place he confeſſeth to have accepted
at the <hi>Barbican-Meeting,</hi> even about another man's
Fact. Or <hi>Laſtly,</hi> If through the Apprehenſion he hath
of <hi>T. H</hi>'s <hi>ill Elocution,</hi> and great Conceit he hath of his
own Oratory, with his better Skill at <hi>Forming</hi> and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
the Queſtion, he can prevail with the <hi>Baptists,</hi>
to be their Mouth in the preſent Controverſie, we ſhall
through God's Aſſiſtance be ready to embrace any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
Time and Place for a free and publick Meeting.</p>
            <p>And that he may not think himſelf unconcerned in
this Propoſal, nor want any Encouragement we can
well give him to accept it, I do hereby offer at ſuch a
Meeting or Meetings, firſt, <hi>To prove him as well as</hi> T.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60239:16"/>
Hicks, <hi>an Abuſer of us and our Writings by Forgery and
Perverſion;</hi> And next, <hi>to maintain thoſe Doctrines
which are indeed believed and aſſerted by us, to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and therefore</hi> Chriſtian. And if this will not
pleaſe him, I ſhall not think my ſelf oblieged to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
every nice and critical Humor he is troubled with;
but leave him to tire himſelf with the Pain of his own
manifeſt and merited Diſquiet: Though my Soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeecheth
Almighty God, if it pleaſe him, to turn him
and the Hearts of our Enemies, that they may ſee how
much they wound <hi>Christianity,</hi> in pretending to defend
it, and grieve that Holy Spirit which would lead them
into Holineſs, Meekneſs, Patience and Love, by theſe
Tempeſtuous Aſſaults upon the Faith, Practice and
Perſons of their Harmleſs Neighbours.</p>
