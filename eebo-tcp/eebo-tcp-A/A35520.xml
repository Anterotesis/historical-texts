            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Our Book is ſomewhat large, the moſt of the heads and ſtrength of his Book being ſpoken too particularly, but take it throughout, and I believe, thou will find ſuch a pack of confuſion as thou haſt not heard, and malicious ſpitefull words, againſt God, and Chriſt the light,
<pb facs="tcp:108232:3"/>
which may be found in his Book, we have not wronged it, but he hath not paged his Book, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we could not quote it here.</p>
            <p>And theſe things which he hath aſſerted and laid down, he is to make good by Scripture, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diminiſhing, for we will have plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, alſo an Anſwer to his Challenge, for him to make good all his aſſertions by Scripture without ading to it, and alſo ſome Queries here is for him to Anſwer, and to clear himſelf if that he can by Scripture, which we believe it will not clear him, and ſo farewell.</p>
            <p>From them that loves truth and peace to all Mankind.</p>

            <p>You might have had an Anſwer ſooner, but it was long before we had his Book, and when we had it, was fain to take it in pieces, and many perticuler Perſons were concerned in it, who ſome of them lives 60. miles one from another, and the Book being called for ſo haſtily again; he boaſted, that we could not Anſwer it, but that was but little to us, for it was truth that we mind.</p>

            <head>This is An ANSWER To JOHN VVIGGANS Book, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WEE hearing of a Book that <hi>John VViggan</hi> had given forth againſt us, in which are many lies and ſcandals, and he the ſaid <hi>John Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> directing one of them to <hi>Randal Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Thomas Hardy</hi> Deputy-Goalers, as he calls them, but he might have ſaid to the Head-Keeper and Under-Keeper.</p>
            <p>And alſo this Book being diſperced abroad in the Country through him, it was hard for us to get a ſight of it; but at laſt it was given to us by the Under-Keeper, and after a while fetched it away, it concerns many Friends, ſome that are 60. miles of, and ſome above 20. yet this <hi>John VViggan,</hi> nor none of his Company, (who ſayes he give it forth to convince us of ſome of our errors, and alſo a Challenge in it) were not ſo civil, as to give us ever a Copy of it, or the thing it ſelf, and when that friends asked him for the Book, he replyed, if we would pay for write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over, we might have a Copy of it, who hath not forgot his old Prieſt tricks, to make people to pay him for his lies, and by this all ſober people, whoſe minds ſtands without partiality, may judge of this Mans works, who pretended to convince us of our errors, (as he ſayes) and gives forth a Challenge, and publiſheth part of a private letter, and what he pleaſeth, and never directs it, nor his Book, to the Authors, and whom it doth concern.</p>
            <p>And now whether or no this man, hath not loſt the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon civility, and underſtanding that is amongſt Men, and boaſts of his works, which he kept hid from us, though through great
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:108232:4"/>
difficulty we have gotten a Copy for a little time, wherein all Men may judge by this carriage, and practice of his, in boaſting of his works abroad, and keeping them from them they do concern, they may ſee it is the work of darkneſs, and of error, and one that is afraid of the light, and a great part of his Book (as the Reader may read and ſee) is againſt the common ſalvation to all Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Jude;</hi> and to be one that denyes the Lord that bought them, as in <hi>Peter;</hi> and all his force and ſtrength is to the denying of <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine and Teſtimony, and that which he came to be a witneſs of, the true light which enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World, <hi>John</hi> the firſt.</p>
            <p>And alſo the force of his matter is, to throw away the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Prophets concerning Chriſt the ſalvation to the ends of the Earth, to Mankind, to poor loſt Man, and alſo to deny the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God to poor Creatures, which ſaith God will give him for a Covenant of light to the Gentiles, (ſpeaking of Chriſt) who ſhall be his ſalvation to the ends of the Earth, and a New-Covenant to the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Judah;</hi> and this was to all people, both <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and this light and Covenant, is by him denyed; but to ſome as he ſayes, and ſo he is one that makes Sects amongſt the Creatures of God, and divides, being in the errour and darkneſs himſelf; being void of the mind of God, his Prophets and Apoſtles, and alſo denying the love of God to the World; who ſo loved the World, mark, take notice poor people, that God gave his only begotten Son into the World, to ſave the World, and not to condemn the World, (as he doth, who ſaith they have not a light to ſave them, and they have not the ſpirit of God) but that the World through him might be ſaved; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Chriſt ſaith, I am the light of the World, now he doth not ſay, I am the light of the Saints only, (as <hi>John Wiggan</hi> ſaith) but of the World which be in darkneſs.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt ſaith believe in the light, whileſt ye have the light, ſhewing that they have the light before they are believers, that they may be children of the light, <hi>John</hi> 12. and alſo he <hi>John Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> makes void the grace of God (as may be ſeen in his Book) which hath appeared to all men, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks to <hi>Titus,</hi> which brings ſalvation, and this grace is ſufficient, and ſo his work is to prove, that the World and wicked Men have not a ſaving-light,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:108232:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor have not the Spirit of God, contrary to the Scriptures of Truth, as will be proved hereafter; and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> makes people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve through this, that Chriſt did not come to ſave the World; ſo is of that race that would fruſtrate the grace of God, and of them that forbid the Apoſtles to ſpeak to the Gentiles; but hath not <hi>John Wiggan</hi> had one Hundred pound a year of the States, and taken Collections of ſuch as he looked upon to be wicked people, and had not the Spirit, nor a ſaving Light; yea, and preached the Scriptures to them, which are the things of God, and all people you know, that no man can know the things of God, without the Spirit of God, you know the Scriptures ſaith ſo.</p>
            <p>And whether all men will not judge, whether this man is not grown ſenſleſs, or he hath cracked his Brain through his fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Nay, would not this <hi>John Wiggan</hi> preach, if the Powers would give him two or three Hundred pounds a year, to preach the Scriptures, which are the things of God to the World, which he ſaith hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, nor a ſaving Light, hath he not the conſcience to take this, and bleſs them though the World did not underſtand the things of God, and what do you think of all the <hi>Independants</hi> that he preached too, and hath left, and now turned <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> it may be he thinks that is a better Commons and Paſture, to maintain him in; for hath <hi>John Wiggan</hi> reſtored that which he had of them at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and other places? for we ſay that it is but juſt, that he ſhould do ſo.</p>
            <p>For to preach to a people that hath not a ſaving light, nor the Spirit, the things of God, they that cannot underſtand them, without the Spirit, and to take money of them, is it not a robing of them, and a cheating of them; and ought he not in juſtice to make reſtitution, for we do not know a greater enemy to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and plain Scriptures, this day in <hi>England</hi> then he is, as his practice hath made it manifeſt; and as for all his ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous expreſſions in his private papers, we ſhall not ſend abroad, but let them lie upon him together with his lyes, nor lay open his nakedneſs, we need not, for he hath laid it open in his own Book ſufficiently, as will be manifeſt to every impartial Reader.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That Paper which was ſent unto <hi>Thomas Hardy</hi> by <hi>Thomas Curwen,</hi> it was not ſent up and down in the Country as his was, but if he had ſent for a Coppy of it, he might have had one; ſo we
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108232:5"/>
did not ſerve him, as he hath done us; and if there had been any errors, they ſhould have been made manifeſt, (but he hath not) that the Reader might have read them, for we are not afraid of our deeds coming to the Light.</p>
            <p>And our Paper was neither partial nor confuſed, as it will manifeſt it ſelf, and it is to the honour of truth.</p>
            <p>And its he that ſwallowes up the ſimple in errors, (as he ſpeaks of,) and hath vomited out the ſame again; how many hath he vomited out about <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> but ſwallowed them up but for gain, and that which he hath vindicated is error.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, he was provoked to this debate with the <hi>Quakers;</hi> that is falſe, for it was his own Challenge; for friends would have diſcourſed with him in a Chriſtian way, in his own Chamber, which he denyed, and bid them depart his Chamber; and when Friends have come up in a Chriſtian way to him, he hath threatned them by calling for the Jaylor; and another time when <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> came up in a Chriſtian way, he ſhaked him by his Coat, as though he would have tore it from off his back, to thruſt him out of his Chamber, though often he came into our Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and we never ſerved him ſo, but diſcourſed as long as he would. But this is the thing, Major <hi>Wiggan</hi> in calling the Jaylor he wanted his Mageſtrates Sword, like a perſecuting <hi>Jew, Help men of Iſrael againſt the Apoſtles, for theſe are the men that turnes the World upſide down.</hi> And this is <hi>John Wiggans</hi> patience and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ſpirit, as he calls it; and he being a Priſoner we would never have brought him to publick ſhame, but he himſelf hath brought it, therefore he may blame himſelf.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſpeaks of being provoked, to the debate in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of truth. Nay <hi>John,</hi> thou art out of love, that art ſo ſoon provoked; and its truth that torments thee, becauſe thou canſt not defend thy errors, thou canſt not chop and change with truth, as thou didſt with the people at <hi>Mancheſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what thou haſt ſet down afterward will appear. And the contention of the Meeting was through thy ſelf, for thou waſt the firſt man that brake the order, (which was that all might ſpeak one by one) and burſt out into a laughter, (when others were ſpeeking of the things of God) in an uncivil and immodeſt way, which begot thy own people into the ſame, and ſo raiſed up the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108232:5"/>
rude and uncivil ſpirit in thy own people, that ſome was fain to rebuke thee, who were ſpeaking of the things of God; for the things of God are weighty, and (as the Scriptures ſaith) the fools heart is filled full of Laughter, and that is the mark of a fool; and thou waſt too hot and paſſionate to talk ſoberly: And doſt thou not remember what a paſſion thou was in, when thou diſcourſed with <hi>Richard Hubberthorn</hi> at <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> when one of thy own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did reprove thee; and doeſt thou not remember what violent hands thou laid upon <hi>John Abrams,</hi> when he and <hi>James Harriſon</hi> came to diſcourſe with thee of the things of God in a Chriſtian way, and what a rage, fury and paſſion thou waſt in, is not this a mark of a Novice, ſoon angry, and are not theſe unclean hands lifted up to God, will God accept them?</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſpeaks of Boaſting, that is thy own, &amp; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that thou would diſcourſe upon was thy own chuſing, though nothing thou haſt cleared to this day by the Scriptures of Truth, but manifeſted thy ſelf further in error; and as for detecting our perſons and carriages thou canſt not, but thy own carriage is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; and ſo thou maiſt take ſhame that pleads againſt Truth, but God will honour his Truth, and them that ſtands for it, and happy would it be for thee if a place of repentance were found for thee, though thou maiſt have had many <hi>Eſaus</hi> Tears proceeded from thee through thy Agonies. And the unſavory fruits thou ſpeaks of, is thy own, by which thou deceives the Ignorant, and the leaſt that is ſimple in the truth diſcernes thee, thy ſpirit and principle, and are reclaimed from the error of thy way, and that makes thee ſo rage againſt them.</p>
            <p>And as for thy additional accompt thou haſt given forth, by diſcourſe concerning the Light in every man, and thy interpreting the Scriptures, which indeed is perverting the Scriptures by thy addition, as will be further manifeſted and proved. And as for thy ſaying, if any of them ſhall yet perſiſt to maintain their error, here you will find an offer further to debate the difference betwixt us before any perſon in Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's Truth we maintain, againſt thy errors, as we have done to all thy Brethren before thee till this day, who are all come to nought, who have made ſuch havock upon us and our Goods; we have maintained it, and ſhall maintain it with our Lives to

Death, againſt thy errors before what Mageſtrate thou wilt, as after will be manifeſt, or when thou wilt, or where thou wilt, for its truth we ſtand for, and ſuffer for. And as for the perticulars, that thou wilt ſuffer for as well as we, and art not in the ſame Principle, Bower and ſpirit, as the Saints be in, in that thou ſuffers but as an evil doer.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou talkeſt of a meaſure of the Spirit of God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto thee, this is but to cover thy lies and errors, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive withal; for if thou wert in the meaſure of the Spirit of God thy ſelf, thou wouldſt not deny it in others; and ſo in this thou art an enemy in thy Spirit to every thing that we ſtand for, becauſe thou art not in the Spirit.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The diſpute was not <hi>George Foxes,</hi> nor <hi>John Stubbs,</hi> but <hi>Thomas Curwens,</hi> and <hi>William Wilſons,</hi> but <hi>George Fox,</hi> and <hi>John Stubbs,</hi> liberty being granted, <hi>George Fox</hi> hearing ſuch groſs er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors laid down by <hi>John Wiggan,</hi> he ſpake ſomething to contradict them by Scriptures, they being ſo groſs and manifeſt; and ſo this Book of <hi>Wiggans</hi> is not only a relation of that, but of many other things of his own addition, and private things ſent-abroad by him, and the truth of it all may be ſeen in the following anſwer.</p>
            <p>And what I <hi>Tho. Curwen</hi> ſaid to thee as thou paſſed through the great Hall, thou being a deceiver of the people, I bid thee leave of thy deceiving; as yet thou couldeſt never clear thy ſelf of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a deceiver, nor haſt not done in thy Book: And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>thy anſwer was mild, to this purpoſe</hi> ſaid thou ſo, <hi>Conſider well what thou haſt ſaid, and whether thou canſt make good thy words, and tell me as I come back whom I have deceived, and wherewith I have deceived any, or how thou canſt prove me a deceiver?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here thou praiſes thy ſelf of thy mildneſs, if another had done it, it had been better for thee; what was thy mildneſs to me in thy Chamber, when I came to diſcourſe with thee of the things of God, thou laid violent hands upon me, and like to have torn my Coat off my back, to haile me out of thy Chamber, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108232:6"/>
this was not Chriſtian like; and whereas thou (lyer) bid me tell thee as thou came back that is a lye, and thy voice I knew to be the voice of a ſtranger, and now thou haſt made it manifeſt who denies Chriſt the Light to be ſaving; and whereas thou wouldeſt know whom thou haſt deceived, there came a Woman from <hi>London</hi> to thee, to declare againſt thee, whom thou haſt long deceived.</p>
            <p>And there came a Man from <hi>Stopphed,</hi> whom thou had deceived, to cry againſt thee, and there came <hi>James Parke</hi> to cry againſt thee and to diſcourſe with thee of thy deceivableneſs, who ſaw thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and turned away from thee, when they came to the light of Chriſt Jeſus which manifeſted thee, and ſaw thee to be a Preacher againſt Chriſt the light; and all may ſee herein what is the end of thy Preaching, when thy work is to bring people from the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly light of Chriſt Jeſus within them; and lead them into imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and whimſies, and fancies of thy own brain, and many others about <hi>Mancheſter</hi> which might be inſtanced, which ſome of them hath been with thee here, which thou long kept from the light of Chriſt Jeſus within them, who now praiſe the Lord that they are come from under the bondage, and have found Chriſt their Saviour and Leader and Light which thou denyeſt.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt that I was raſh, &amp; my cenſures ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in ſaying thou taught the way, and know it not thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thou haſt manifeſted thou doſt not know the way, for there is but one way to God, who is Chriſt, the Light that doth enlighten everyman, who doth enlighten the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> &amp; is the glory of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Light, and I am the way to the Father, and no man comes to the Father but by me.</hi> And this Light in every man thou denies to be ſaving, which we ſay it is ſaving or condemning; to them that love it, it's ſaving, and to them that hate it, it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning: and ſo it's manifeſt that thou art a confeſſer of him, and a teacher of him in words as other Sects are; and the Devil could preach Chriſt in words without him, (and ſaid thou art the Son of God) as thou doſt who denies him to be a Light in all men ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly, and ſo doth all the Sects in Chriſtendom that preaches Chriſt in words for an end, and their gain, as thou did at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> at thy Chapels, and preached up thy <hi>Independant</hi> way; and thou left the people in deluſion; didſt thou know Chriſt then, though
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108232:7"/>
thou preacht him in words, and ſo doth all theſe before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed know Chriſt the way, and ſuch as held forth the Doctrine of Devils; Commanding to abſtain from Meats, and forbiding to Marry, who went about to deceive (the Chriſtians and people of Chriſt the way,) in words for ſome end, but not in truth; and Antichriſts are not they, ſuch as pretend to preach Chriſt in words, and yet knows him not, who is a myſtery. Anſwer me plainly, didſt thou ever hear Chriſts voice at any time, or haſt thou ſeen his ſhape? for if thou hadſt known him the way, thou would not have deny'd his Light to be ſaving to the World. And haſt thou not read <hi>Colloſ.</hi> of ſome that intruded into theſe things they never ſaw, which neglected Chriſt the body and head, who is the way and Light, &amp;c. And whereas thou ſayes it is not poſſible to teach the way, and know it not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. 4, 5. 27, 28. 12. the Phariſees and the Prieſts preached Chriſt to come to <hi>Herod;</hi> and told when he ſhould be born, by the Scriptures, and yet knew him not to be the way when he came, but perſecuted him when he came, as thou may know by the Scriptures when Chriſt roſe, and yet thou knoweſt him not to be the Way, the Truth and the Life, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him to be the ſaving Light ſpoken of in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. And my words was not harſh nor raſh cenſure, but in plainneſs and truth, as thou haſt made it appear.</p>
            <p>And as for me <hi>William Wilſon,</hi> I know nothing elſe thou liveſt in but beggarly Rudiments, who denies Chriſt to be a ſaving Light, who enlightens every man; who ſhuts up the Gates of Heaven againſt men, and will neither go in thy ſelf, nor ſuffer others to go in. And ſhew me by plain Scripture where Chriſt calls taking of Bread and Wine an Ordinance? for we do drink of the Vine, and and eat of the Bread that comes down from Heaven: And my words were neither harſh nor raſh, therefore thou doſt us wrong to ſay ſo, and to blame us, and exclaime againſt us</p>
            <p>Theſe Queries as followeth were ſent to <hi>John Wiggan</hi> to anſwer by me <hi>Thomas Curwen,</hi> and are unanſwered to this day; and he complaines he wanted time, and hath had them above halfe a year, when ſuch a man as he is looked upon, might have anſwered them in halfe a day.</p>

            <p>Anſwer theſe Queries in a Scripture way in writing, and bring forth thy deeds to the Light, or elſe I do intend to ſtick a Coppy of them on thy Door tomorrow. From thy friend <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> the fifth day of the firſt Moneth 1664. directed for <hi>John Wiggan</hi> theſe.</p>
            <p>And theſe Queries were ſent to <hi>John Wiggan</hi> to be anſwered by him; and becauſe I ſaid if he would not anſwer them I would ſtick them on the door tomorrow, he ſayes he has but a ſhort time and yet in this half year he hath not anſwered them, but he hath publiſhed them in his Book to his ſhame, without an anſwer, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting his inſufficiency to reſolve doubts and Queſtions in weighty matters to ſhuffle them off to the Reader; he calls them frivilous, and they ſtand ſtill unanſwered by him, for if he had told us that he had been uncapable or unable of anſwering them, we would ſo have taken it; but he being a man ſo much looked upon, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing ſuch high things he was able to reſolve doubts and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which if he had been a man as he is looked upon, he would have been aſhamed to have publiſhed them to the Reader unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; and we did not boaſtingly ſend the Queries to thee, nor ſought advantage againſt thee, but that the plain truth might have been manifeſted by thee if thou hadſt had it, but its manifeſt to the contrary; and the Queries are pythy and full, and ſome of them Queries about mans Salvation; but thou ſcornes and ſcoffes at them, and calls them frivilous, and ſayeſt thou had ſome weighty matter which we do not know any thou hadſt, without it was to ſtudy ſomething againſt the ſaving Light, to preach to thy people, which was not a thing of ſo great weight, who runs one while to thee, and another while to other Prieſts, who are uneſtabliſht like thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>And in thy Letter to my firſt paper thou ſeems to be offended,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:108232:8"/>
becauſe that I ſaid that thou was offended for calling thee a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver of the people, &amp;c. it manifeſts thou art offended by thy ſpeaking of it ſo much abroad. And as concerning my ſaying thou taught the way to others, and knew it not thy ſelf, that is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, and I did ſpeak forth the words of truth and ſoberneſs to thee, as being often burthened with hearing thy ſtrange voice, &amp; ſavouring thee to be out of the Spirit that gave forth the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And for making it appear whom thou haſt deceived that I have done before, and whom thou haſt deceived, and how, in drawing them from the pure Light of Chriſt, which is ſaving, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man; and for thy ſaying there will be but little truth found in ſaying thou taught thy way to others, and it will be hard for me to prove or any of my friends, thou haſt proved it thy ſelf, and I have proved it ſufficiently here before, and alſo it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the diſpute, but that thou art more minded to cavil then obey the truth, and its no matter of thee ſaying my words are improper, when thou wilt not believe plain Scripture, when as thou bids me tell thee where the Apoſtle ſaid ſome preached the way, the truth, and the life, and yet knew him not, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed him in words, and denyed him in life, ſuch as the Apoſtle calls evil doers, evil beaſts, and ſlow bellies, and teaches for filthy lukre, as thou haſt done who is a ſayer and not a doer, and ſuch as preacht Chriſt of envy as thou doſt, and added afflictions to the Apoſtles bonds, thoſe knew not Chriſt the way and the life, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was in it, for they were in the envy and ſtrife, as thou art; and thoſe are unlike to know him (though they may preach him in words, for envy blinded them as it hath done thee, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. 15. but did not thoſe falſe Apoſtles, deceitfull workers transforming themſelves into the Apoſtles of Chriſt, preach Chriſt in words as thou doeſt; how could they have gone about to deceive the Saints which believed in Chriſt, and were they not deſpiſers of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt as thou art; nay, did they not boaſt that they were Miniſters of Chriſt, as thou doeſt, and denyed his life as thou doeſt, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 11. from the 13. to the 23. and did not Chriſt ſpeak of ſuch who preached in his name, and in his name caſt out Devils, and I do not believe that ever thou came to ſee ſo far as theſe did; and yet he ſaid depart from me ye workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

and the falſe Prophets in the 24. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> who ſaid loe here is Chriſt, and loe there, theſe was Preachers of Chriſt in words, under a pretence to bring them to a falſe Chriſt, and Chriſt ſaid go not forth after them, for he would come and dwell in them, and this thou cannot abide to hear ſpoken on, of Chriſt being in men a ſaving Light, and doſt thou not know that many has a form of Godlineſs, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. and what form is that, is it not the Scriptures that ſpeaks of God and Chriſt, and denies the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, wherein I feel thee to be one, who are to be turned away from, who withſtand the truth, and many of thy Hearers turned away from thee, whom thou led away Captive: And what wiſe man canſay I have wronged the Apoſtles words in this, for I have not wronged the Apoſtles words, but thou wrongeſt me, and thou doſt not preach the Love of Chriſt, who denies the Light, Chriſt, to be ſaving that enlightens all men, and Chriſt is the way, the Truth, and the Life, who ever preach him, or for what ever end they preach him for, and we ſet up the Chriſt Jeſus the Apoſtles preached, and ſet up, the Light of the World which the Prophets propheſied of, but thou preacheſt another as was ſaid before, who denies his Light to be a ſaving Light in all men; though ſome men neglect their Salvation, as thou may read in the Scriptures, and we have the ſame Goſpel the Apoſtles had, and preached (to wit) the power of God which I do believe thou was never yet in, for if thou had thou would not have changed ſo, and have left thy people for what haſt thou left that Chriſt thou preached to the <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,</hi> or haſt thou reſtored the Money which thou got amongſt them, ſo confeſs the truth? for I never changed ſince I knew the Truth, the ſame Chriſt the Apoſtles preacht; and the true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion I believe thou hath to ſeek it, who denies the Light, and ſo in meekneſs and fear I declare to thee, we own no other Chriſt Jeſus, then the Apoſtles preacht, and ſet up, and this Chriſt Jeſus I am not aſhamed to confeſs before all, who is the Light that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens all men that comes into the World, who is the Salvation to the ends of the Earth, who taſted death for every man and this is Gods Love to Mankind.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, thou will not anſwer my Queries, nor ſatisfie me, nor any Queriſt; in this thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf and ſpirit what it is; and haſt denyed a Chriſtian Spirit, who ſhould be

            <p>And thou ſayeſt thou haſt in readineſs to anſwer in love; thoſe Queries was in Love ſent to thee, but this is but a ſhift and a boaſt; for if thou hadſt not anſwered them in love to us, who thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts thy enemies, though thou haſt called us thy friends, thou might have anſwered them for their ſakes thou ſent thy Book too, if thou hadſt no love to enemies.</p>

            <p>And <hi>Thomas Curwens</hi> ſecond Paper, wherein he ſhewes <hi>John Wiggan</hi> he has not anſwered his Queries, and how that he would come into his Chamber to diſcourſe about one Query, which <hi>John Wiggan</hi> had choſen out, that Query which ſpeaks of Chriſt being the ſaving Light that doth enlighten every man that comes into the World, and this Chriſtian way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>John Wiggan</hi> denyed, though before he had ſpoken of a meeting betwixt him and our Friends, when and where a meeting might be had in a quiet way; and when we came into his Chamber (he having put it to us before when and where, which we looked upon his own Chamber to be the beſt and civil'ſt) he contradicts his own words, and again challenges us down into the Shire-Hall; and thou diſputing about this Query, did not ſatisfie me, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the other I ſtuck the Paper on the Door according to my word, which thou haſt neither anſwered in Writing nor word to this day, and my word is made good to thee or any rational man. Concerning ſuch as get the form of Godlineſs, and preaches Him, and knowes him not, and thou geting the Apoſtles words, and out of their life and power, thou art he that wrongeſt the Apoſtles; and whereas thou ſayeſt the Apoſtles uſeth no ſuch words; that is cleared before.</p>
            <p>And my ſecond Paper which was brought to thee was not with that purpoſe to diſturb thee, but that thou might have ſeen thy ſelf, if thou would not have ſhut thine eyes, and here I clear things over again to thee, if thou wilt not hide thy ſelf from the Light thou may ſee, and that I neither wrong the Apoſtles nor thee, but am one with the Apoſtles againſt ſuch as thou art.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou faith thou art not inclined to multiply words to occaſion ſtrife, and yet thou contradicts thy ſelf, and multiplys many words to no purpoſe againſt the ſaving Light of Chriſt, and which is ſaving, who ſaid he would give for a Covenant of Light, and is the peace between God and man; and that which thou multiplys is againſt him, which occaſions nothing but ſtrife and confuſion, and not peace, for the Peace is in Chriſt, the Light which thou canſt not abide to hear on, that every man has a ſaving
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:108232:10"/>
Light; becauſe it marrs thy trade, and thy great <hi>Diana</hi> would be taken away (to wit) thy Gain; for preaching Chriſt the Light, mar'd the great <hi>Diana</hi> and all the Workmens Gain, as thou may read in the <hi>Acts:</hi> And thou ſaid thou would meet us in a ſpirit of Love and meekneſs, but it proved otherwiſe, when thou appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the diſpute. And whereas thou ſayeſt in thy Anſwer to <hi>Thomas</hi> ſecond Letter, that thou wouldeſt treat with <hi>Thomas</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Light, and any other point, and ſaith I was over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in ſaying I was miſtaken, if thou thinkeſt I ſhould leave it to thee to appoint time and place, and had left it to me before, both when and where, as may be ſeen in thy Letter, and here is thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; and when I had appointed the Meeting when and where according to thy own Challenge, when now thou ſay'ſt after thou had left it to me, when and where; and we appointed thy own Chamber, then thou deny'ſt us coming there except thou hadſt invited us, thou cameſt often into our Chamber without inviting, and thou denyed us for appointing the place, and ſaid we were over confident, and ſo forſook thy own propoſition, and appointed another place; and ſo this is no honour for to publiſh abroad ſuch things: and this is thy ſeeking after truth, which was but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and not in reality, and friends did meet with thee, and did diſcourſe with thee, and when the day came thou ſtood not to that neither, but found ſome excuſe, and when thou didſt come, Friends ſpoke to thee concerning thy own words and promiſes, and how thou didſt not ſtand to thy words, promiſes and time, in thy Challenge, but ſhuffled and altered, and as thou ſayeſt falſly that thee was challenged by us firſt, that is falſe, for the Queries was ſent to thee to anſwer in Writing, or elſe we would ſtick them on the Door, and thou vapoured and challenged, and left it to us, and then denyed it again, ſaid this day and the other day, and brake thy own word and promiſe, which cauſed many to come out of the Country to ſee thy own folly, and thou was the occaſion of the Diſpute, for we would have diſcourſed with thee in a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an way, which thou denyedſt it in thy Chamber, which we would have granted thee to have come into Ours, if thou hadſt deſired it; and all thy dayes work was to ſtand in oppoſition againſt Truth, Chriſt the Light that enlightens every man; and inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing people to the Light thou turns them to darkneſs from the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:108232:11"/>
Light: And whereas thou ſay'ſt becauſe I did not ſet thy Letter by mine upon the Door, therefore I ſavour of a fleſhly ſpirit in divers Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>That which thou has particularized I anſwer, for not ſetting it upon the Door, becauſe it was not an Anſwer to my Queries, therefore thou ſavours more of a fleſhly ſpirit, who did not anſwer them, nor convinc'd me wherein I had done wrong.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> and <hi>William Wilſon</hi> when we came to conferr with thee about the Meeting according to thy former Challenge, which thou villifies us, and ſayes we came to provoke thee, and with many heavy cenſures, as <hi>John Cowert</hi> can witneſs; now ye people of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> may ſee what a ſufficient witneſs he hath brought to be a witneſs for him, who is a common Drunkard; this you may judge what ſpirit his Book came from, for thou at that time in thy Chamber didſt lay down for Doctrine and Principles, that the Scriptures was the Author of thy faith; who art ignorant of the Scriptures, and of the Miniſters who taught the Chriſtians that Chriſt Jeſus was the Author and finiſher of their faith, and as for hard or heavy cenſures we deny them, for we ſpeak the truth in plainneſs, and thou wouldſt not meet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy own Challenge, but puting us off from time to time, that was the occaſion of our coming unto thee, to thy Chamber; but thou ſhould have ſet down thy own carriage and behaviour in envy and malice towards us in thy Chamber, who ſweld, and puft, and bid us go out of thy Chamber, why did we come there, after thou had challenged us, for we came to thee about thy Challenge, and the Meeting, and thou in a fury cryed get you out, get you out of my Chamber, what do you do here? As though we could not be admitted into thy preſence thou was ſo high, and ſcornful, and for thy ſaying thou was forced to intreat us to go out of thy Chamber, thou was paſt intreating, thou had like to have laid violent hands upon me, as thou didſt afterwards; and if thou hadſt not given us a meeting being thine own Challenge, how could we judge otherwiſe, but that-thou dar'ſt not ſtand to thy word, &amp; it's a lye in ſaying we provoked thee to it, it was thy own Challenge, and then thou ſpeaking with <hi>R. C.</hi> and <hi>R. J.</hi> about the Meeting, and appointed when the day and hour ſhould be, and that thou was willing to give <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> and others a meeting
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:108232:11"/>
according to thy former Challenge and thou would diſpute about Chriſt the Light, that enlightens every man that comes into the World, by the Lords aſſiſtance; but this Lord failed thee, for poor old <hi>Henry Wood</hi> a labouring man that cannot read a word on a Book, gravelled thee ſo, that thou was not able to anſwer him; and as for <hi>R. C.</hi> and <hi>R. J.</hi> what language doſt thou give them now, who accounted them ſober men before; thy mind is ſoon altered and changed; <hi>John Wiggan</hi> diſprove that Chriſt doth not enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten every man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light, or that the Light where with every man is enlightened is not ſaving; Mark people, the Light in it ſelf is not ſaving, and then the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency is in the Light according to his judgment; but we ſay there is ſufficiency in the Light, for God ſaith my Grace is ſufficient, which none can deny but that the Grace is this Light; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Chriſt the Light which doth enlighten all, &amp;c. that, that is not ſaving is contrary to the Scriptures, which ſaith Chriſt is the Salvation to the ends of the Earth; Chriſt ſaith I am the Light, <hi>John</hi> 1. 8. 12. and this Light Chriſt is ſufficient to ſave and to give the knowledge of God, <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. but as Chriſt ſaith in <hi>John</hi> 3. 20. Some hates the Light, and as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, ſome rebell againſt it, in whoſe ſteps <hi>John Wiggan</hi> thou art found.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt firſt, <hi>that nothing be aſſerted but what may be proved by Scripture, and that nothing be determined but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures;</hi> &amp; in thy Anſwer thou could make nothing good that thou didſt aſſert againſt the Light of Chriſt which thou oppoſes; for that which thou didſt aſſert was againſt the plain Scripture and the words of Chriſt in which thou confutes thy ſelf, whoſe determination if it had been poſſible was to oppoſe the Scripture, inſtead of aſſerting by Scripture, what thou did'ſt aſſert.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>that the Meeting may be peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet, without railing or reproachful ſpeeches, and that the whole dehate may be carried on with a ſpirit Love and meekneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. John</hi> thou and thy people quickly broke this order, doſt thou not remember what a heat and paſſion thou was in, cocking up thy Hat like a Ranter, and thy people of ſuch a heat, that <hi>John Berley</hi> was fain to ſtand up and reprove one of them, and <hi>G. F.</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten bid you be ſober, for the things of God was weighty, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:108232:12"/>
ſhould be ſpoken of in the fear of God, and that he ſhould not be ſo raſh and haſty.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Meeting may be orderly and without confuſion, that is that one may have as much time allowed to ſpeak as another, and that but one ſpeak at once, and that none diſturbe him that is ſpeaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I wonder <hi>John Wiggan</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to publiſh ſuch things in the ſight of men! for thou was the firſt man that made a diſturbance, that ſpake when another was ſpeaking, (to wit) <hi>William Wilſon,</hi> and afterwards when <hi>George Fox</hi> was ſpeaking, and afterwards thy people ran into the ſame, and ſo broke your own order, and run into confuſion, and when thou ſhould have anſwered to the people to the matter, thou fell a preaching to the people, and when I <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> would have ſtood up and have ſpoken, thou would not let me; ſo that I ſee thou art nothing but a man of fair words, ſo thou didſt not give time but thou brakeſt the time, and therefore was we forced to cry for order ſo oft' amongſt you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4ly.</hi> And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>that the Meeting may continue three houres, and at the moſt not exceed four, becauſe of the occaſions of friends afterwards, if theſe be concented unto, let him that is appointed to treat with me, ſubſcribe his name, &amp;c.</hi> and what we could not agreed to <hi>R. C. R. J.</hi> let him know.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Moſt of this was done according to his deſire, and let him take what time he would to oppoſe Chriſt the light which lightens every Man that comes into the World, and though he had his will granted, all he did was to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And all people may ſee whether this was a rational Letter or no, and how that we would not limit the truth to an hour, (as he did before) for the Spirit of truth is not to be limited, though that we let him take his own proffer, and go away when he would, and thou ſhould not have ſpoken of points wherein this paper differed from thine, but thou ſhould have perticularized them, that the Reader might have ſeen them and whereas thou ſaidſt, we ſaid that thou durſt not meet us, therefore thou ſenteſt another paper; why if thou had ſaid thou would not have met us, thou might have ſaid ſo, for it was thy own Challenge at firſt, and not ours, and thou ſhould have named them that ſaid ſo, for no Man put thee upon it at firſt to ſpeak againſt the light of Chriſt, but thy own mind, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:108232:12"/>
thou ſayeſt in thy next Letter, <hi>about the third hour, in the fore-part of the Day, which I call the ninth hour;</hi> and <hi>Jo. Wiggan,</hi> was it but three houres ſince it was Day to the ninth hour, I pray thee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer me theſe natural things, for thou haſt not anſwered me the ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>And ſo, afterwards when thou hadſt denyed thy firſt Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to us, that we ſhould appoint time and place, we left it to thee to appoint time and place, and ſo took thy own, who had contradicted thy former, who would not grant to us that which we granted to thee; and whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>my friend, and I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thee to diſpute againſt the Light of Chriſt,</hi> thou ſay'ſt not true, for it was thy own Challenge, for we but bid thee make good thy Challenge, and that which thou had ſo boldly aſſerted againſt Chriſt the Light.</p>
            <p>And as for thy ſaying, <hi>thou would maintain in the ſtrength of the Lord thy aſſertion (to wit) that Chriſt did not enlighten every Man that comes into the World, with a ſaving light, neither that the Light wherewith all Men is enlightened, is ſaving;</hi> and this neither thee nor all thy people, with all the ſtrength you had could do, but that which thou did maintain, was to your own ſhame.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt thou would do it through the ſtrength of the Lord, that was falſe, for all thy ſtrength was to fight againſt the Lord, <hi>who is the Saviour of all men, eſpecially of them that believe;</hi> ſo ſaith ahe Apoſtle.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. And whereas thou ſay'ſt over and over again, <hi>that all things ſhould be proved by the Scripture;</hi> and thou proves nothing to the matter.</item>
               <item>2. And whereas thou ſay'ſt again and again, <hi>that the Meeting may be peaceable and quiet;</hi> and thou was the firſt man that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed it.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>the words were left out as railing and reproachful ſpeeches;</hi> (we thought thou would call the plain truth rayling) and thou <hi>hoping that the thing would be ſo carried on;</hi> it was ſo on our part, but thou and thy people brake out into diſorder, and ſcornful ſpeeches, that thou was often reproved for thy immodeſty; and as I ſaid before thou was the firſt man that was diſorderly as thou ſpeaks on over again; as alſo thou was the firſt man that very uncivilly brake the order of one ſpeaking at once, neither didſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:108232:13"/>
thou obſerve it; and as for limiting time and hour, that is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered before, and ſeeing the Meeting was put off with a pretence by the Jaylor as thou ſayeſt, we met with thee another day ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy appointment, and we know thou didſt make an Oration before the meeting, and then propounded that which thou could not maintain, <hi>That Chriſt doth not enlighten every man with a ſaving Light, that comes into the World, &amp;c.</hi> And I <hi>John Stubbs</hi> ſtood up and told thee, that Chriſt did enlighten every man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light; and <hi>Richard Cubban</hi> did not alter what thou had ſpoken and written, as the Reader may ſee in thy Book; and why doſt thou ſay that I <hi>Richard Cubban</hi> was perſwaded with much ado, for when thou would not ſtand to what thou had written and ſpoken, then I ſtood to what thou would agree to, and this was but a ſhift from thy own words, we lookt thou ſhould have made every word good, thou had wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and ſpoken, but thou ſhifts from thy own words, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we let thee have what words thou would ſtand to.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>I</hi> (John Wiggan) <hi>proceeded to prove, premiſing firſt that the Queſtion was not, whethere there be ſome Light that comes into the World, nor whether Chriſt do not enlighten true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers with a ſaving Light, foraſmuch as I denyed not but did affirme there was ſome Light in every man that comes into the World, and true Believers was enlightened with a ſaving Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In thy aſſertion there was no mention of unbelievers as all may ſee in thy Book, but thy aſſertion is, Chriſt doth not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten every man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light; then Believers are not according to thy words, for thou ſayeſt, the Light wherewith every man is enlightened withal (which we ſay is the Light of Chriſt) is not ſaving; and yet again thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts thy ſelf, and ſaith Believers are lightened with a ſaving Light; but and if Believers be enlightened with a ſaving Light, and unbelievers be not, how are they then condemned for their unbeliefe; this Queſtion neither thee nor thy people could anſwer.</p>
            <p>For thy proof that Chriſt doth not enlighten every man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light, thou ſayeſt, <hi>that Chriſt doth not enlighten no man but by his Spirit; but Chriſt doth not give his Spirit to every man that comes into the World, therefore he doth not enlighten every Man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light.</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:108232:13"/>
Theſe words proves nothing at all but thy own ignorance of the Scriptures; for God ſaith by his Prophet, <hi>that he would pour out his Spirit upon all Fleſh in the latter dayes:</hi> And the Apoſtles ſaw thoſe dayes come in their time, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and ſo this being proved that God pours out his Spirit upon all Fleſh, then he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light according to thy own aſſertion; and ſo this overthrows thy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing aſſertion; <hi>And the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man to profit withal, 1 Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Now thou contradicts the Apoſtle here, the true Miniſter he ſaith every man, but thou gives him the lie, and ſaith, not every man, God gives his Spirit unto; but we ſay with the Apoſtles and the Prophets that God hath given his Spirit to all, as in <hi>Joel 2. Acts 2. 1. Cor.</hi> 12. and they that do not profit in the Spirit, are ſuch as grieves it and quenches it, and rebells againſt it; as in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. and many other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which might be mentioned: and as for the many Scriptures thou haſt quoted they are to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And thou ſayeſt, <hi>that thy firſt Propoſition is clear, from Iſai.</hi> 59. 12. this contradicts thy Propoſition, this ſpeaks of the New Covenant Chriſt; and in the 60. <hi>Chap. ver.</hi> 3. and the 11. 12. how that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that wicked people ſhould come to the Light, ſpeaking of Chriſt; and this quite makes againſt thee; that ſaith Chriſt, doth not enlighten every man with a ſaving Light; and <hi>John</hi> 4. 16, 17. but thou ſhouldſt have read the 16. of <hi>John</hi> as well as that, where thou may read they have the ſame Comforter, the ſpirit of truth, which leads the Saints into all Truth; and how can thou or the World receive this Spirit, which will not believe in the Light but hates it? ſo this proves that all men have the Spirit, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes thy aſſertion, and Chriſt the Corner-ſtone breaks thee to pieces, who oppoſes him and the plain Scripture, which all people may read; and leaves out that which makes againſt thee, and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 17, 18. becauſe the Saints had the ſpirit of Wiſdom, and the eyes of their underſtandings was enlightened; this thou brings to oppoſe Chriſt the Light, and the Apoſtles Doctrine and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that Chriſt did not enlighten every man that comes into the World, and his Light is not ſaving; which thou might as well deny Chriſt and ſay he is not ſaving, who is the Light; for none of theſe Scriptures doth ſay that Chriſt doth not enlighten every
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:108232:14"/>
man that comes into the World with a ſaving Light; and <hi>John</hi> 16. 13. makes nothing for thy purpoſe; and whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>Neither is there any other way by which Chriſt doth infuſe a ſaving Light into any man but by his Spirit, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11, and 12. <hi>verſ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I pray you all people read this Scripture over, and ſee whether there be any ſuch word as Infuſing a ſaving Light into any man, but by his ſpirit; you may ſee how he wrongs the Apoſtles words, with his own words, and wrongs <hi>John</hi>'s words alſo; for we know that the natural man knows not the things of God, but by the Spirit they are underſtood; for the Natural man quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and grieves the ſpirit of God, and ſo walks deſpitefully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit of Grace, therefore this is no proof that he hath it not, becauſe he cannot diſcern the things of God, for the things of God are opened to him as he obeyes the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>And thou ſaith, <hi>the aſſumtion is proved by</hi> Jude, <hi>that ſome are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, not having the ſpirit:</hi> this of <hi>Jude</hi> proves that they had it, and went in the error of <hi>Ballaam</hi> from the Spirit; and theſe could ſpeak the high words, but it was in hypocriſie; and ſo this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture clearly overthrowes thy argument, which thou takes for a proof againſt <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine, who ſaith, Chriſt doth enlighten every man that comes into the World; And <hi>John</hi> the 14. 17. which thou brings to prove that Chriſt doth not enlighten every man that comes into the world with a ſaving Light; which ſaith no ſuch thing, but proves thy own weakneſs and ignorance; for how ſhould the world know Chriſt, or ſee him; when they hate his Light that comes from him, and will not come to it becauſe it doth reprove them, and there Chriſt the Light <hi>teſtifies againſt the World, becauſe their deeds be evil;</hi> read <hi>John</hi> the third, and other places. Again, thou bringeſt <hi>Romans</hi> the 8. 9. to prove thy aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſayes, <hi>ſome men have not the Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> Now people, ſee if this Scripture doth ſay in plain words that ſome men have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, and ſee how he has wronged the Apoſtle, and perverted his words; and whether the Apoſtle did not tell them (in the firſt of the <hi>Romans)</hi> who were wicked people, <hi>That, that which might be known of God was manifeſted in them:</hi> yet they Reprobated from it, and ſo their hearts were darkened, and ſo was not led by the Spirit as the Saints was, and ſo they that quench the Spirit, and will not have it to lead them, how are they Chriſts?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:108232:14"/>
and ſo mark, the ſame Chapter in the following words, <hi>They that are led by the Spirit of God they are the Sons of God.</hi> And ſo thou may ſee how thou goes about to overthrow the Apoſtles words and Chriſts Doctrine; thou hath a ſtrange Doctrine and Preaching of thine, to preach to the world, and tell them they have not the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor a ſaving Light. And ſo all thy Teſtimonies thou haſt brought doth not prove thy Propoſition to be true, that Chriſt doth not give his Spirit to every man that comes into the World, which the 16. of <hi>John</hi> overthrowes thee.</p>
            <p>And I diſliking thy aſſumption, (as thou calleſt it, but many ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people doth not know what thou meaneſt, but thou would cover thy ſelf by thy dark words;) for no proof that thou brought was to purpoſe; for that of <hi>Jude</hi> which ſpeaks of ſuch as went in the way of <hi>Cain;</hi> I ſay <hi>Cain</hi> had talked with God, and heard his voice though he was a wicked man; and this thou brings to prove, that wicked men have not the Spirit, and doth not know the things of God, but <hi>Cain</hi> knew God, for he talked with him, and that muſt be by the Spirit; and thoſe that <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of were ſuch as had been with them, and went from them into the way of <hi>Cain;</hi> or how could it have been ſaid they had err'd, and had not the ſpirit and the way.</p>
            <p>And here people may ſee thou neither knows the Scriptures, nor the power of God, as wiſe as thou thinks thou art, for my words were not, that they loſt it, but that they err'd from it, according to the Scripture; and why could thou not put in all my words I ſpoke, but perus'd my words, and ſo left out that which pinched thee; for I have borne my Teſtimony amongſt many of your people, both in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and other places, which many is come from you, and ſees your deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wayes of darkeneſs oppoſing the Light; for I my ſelf was one of you, and now walkes in the light of the Lamb, Glory for ever to the Higheſt; And why doth thou wrong me, for I denyed thy Propoſition, and held forth Chriſt the Saving Light.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt by the way, <hi>If a Scripture pinch us, we will not ſtick to give a meaning to it, and ſuch an one as may beſt ſuite our purpoſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is falſe, for I gave no meanings to the Scriptures

            <p>And as for thy charging us with diſorder as I ſaid before, thou was the firſt man that was diſorderly, and thou ſpake when ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſpeaking, and thy people many of them ſpake together; and why doſt thou complain and ſay ſome of us ſpake, one after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for this was the agreement that one ſhould ſpeak after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;

and that thou could not have time to anſwer, and thou had more time then any, but its thou that did not ſpeak to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, but fell to preaching to the people; and thou wrongeſt us, for we ſpoke orderly one after another, except we ſpoke when you were ſpeaking diſorderly, and of your ſpeaking unreverently of the things of God, and our asking the queſtions was to have thee make good the thing in hand, which thou could not do; and this is thy ſhift, to ſay, <hi>thou was obſtructed;</hi> but tell me who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thee, for not anſwering <hi>T.

            <p>And as for <hi>G.

And the thing that thou laid down before the people was, <hi>that ſome men that comes into the World hath not the Spirit;</hi> and thou would prove it out of <hi>Jude;</hi> and when the Scripture was read, there was no ſuch words, and yet he affirmed the ſame thing, though he could not prove it, perverting many Scriptures, and yet could not make any to ſuite his purpoſe, and when <hi>G.

            <p>The Apoſtle doth not ſay it was to the Saints only, but to every man, and Chriſt ſaith, what I ſay unto you, I ſay unto all men, watch and pray, and how can they pray without the ſpirit? and people, you know it was the falſe Prophets that limited the Holy one; and if the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> every one, had a manifeſtation of the ſpirit, here is an [If] it ſeems thou queſtions this, whether they had or no; and ſay'ſt thou, <hi>Every man that cometh into the World hath not a manifeſtation of the Spirit,</hi> as before its proved out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>John</hi> 16. and the Apoſtles words was every man, and not every Saint; doſt thou not pervert the Apoſtles words here, and alſo them that were Baptiſed by one Spirit, into one body; which were Saints; and this thou brings to prove, that the world that quenches, and grieveth, and rebelleth againſt, and errs from the Spirit of God, hath it not to reprove them; which any that reads, but Scriptures may ſee thy ignorance and darkneſs; and whereas thou gain-ſayeſt, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks only that the manifeſtation of the ſpirit of every man that was Baptized by one ſpirit, into one body; and made to drink into one ſpirit and not to every man that comes into the world.</p>
            <p>Now people look this Chapter thorow, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 12. whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye do find theſe words of <hi>John Wiggan</hi>'s in it or no, that it is onely to them that believe and are Baptized, and whether the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle has theſe Limits, as he hath, and whether his words be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them that are baptized, and made to drink into the one ſpirit, and doth the Apoſtle ſay to every Saint, and every one that is bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into the ſpirit, and not to every man that comes into the World, doth the Apoſtle ſay theſe words, but are not his words
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:108232:17"/>
every man, and not every Saint? and for the ſame words uſed in the 11. of <hi>Corinthians,</hi> makes nothing for thy purpoſe, that all men have not the ſpirit, for that is ſpoken to them that came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into one place, there the Apoſtle diſtinguiſhes his own words; what ſhifts art thou put too for to pervert the Truth.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, this is ſaid to every man of them and not every man that comes into the World; and now people ſee whether the Apoſtle ſaith, the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every one of you only, and ſee how he contradicts himſelf with the Scriptures he brings, and would pervert it; for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man; and not to every one of you, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. and its given to them to profit withal, whether they do or not, and Gods ſpirit is pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon all fleſh, and ſo this Scripture makes nothing for thy purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Exodus</hi> 19. 5. this doth not oppoſe Gods pouring out of his Spirit upon all Fleſh <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. was brought, how that God gave his good ſpirit to ſuch as rebelled againſt him; which thou affirmed that wicked men had not the Spirit of God; and we know that the <hi>Jewes</hi> was called the Church and people of God, though many of them fell, for their wickedneſs; but theſe that rebelled againſt it, had it, that were wicked people, which thou denyed, and ſaid, that no wicked people had the Spirit of God, which after thou confeſſed, and ſo haſt overthrown thy Aſſertion; and ſo thou ſaith and unſaith.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou ſaith, though it be ſaid he gave them his good Spirit, it will not follow that every particular or individual Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elite had this good Spirit, but ſuch as were Iſraelites indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou haſt confeſſed that the Righteous hath the Spirit of God, ſo thou art to prove that the wicked hath it not, and in <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the firſt, there is nothing ſpoken in that Chapter, that God doth not pour out his Spirit upon all Fleſh, and that wicked men hath not the ſpirit; there is nothing at all for his purpoſe; all that reads it may ſee: And as for <hi>Romans</hi> 2. 28, 29. this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds thee; all that reads it may ſee, for this brings people to the ſpirit of God in them, that they may be Jewes in the ſpirit; and the <hi>Romans</hi> its known, they had been Heathens and wicked

            <p>And whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>that ſaying in the 9. of Nehem. muſt be reſerved thus,</hi> Moſes <hi>had that good Spirit, and God promiſed to take off that good ſpirit that was upon him, and put upon the ſeventy Elders, Numb. 11. 17. thus</hi> Joſhuah <hi>was a man in whom was the Spirit, Num. 27. 18. and had another ſpirit than many others had, and was fitted thereby for the conduct of the Congregation, Numb. 27. 16. but it cannot hence be inſerted,</hi> that all or any of the fleſhly ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or <hi>ſuch as were born after the fleſh had the ſpirit, but ſuch onely as were born after the Spirit, Gall.</hi> 4. 23, 29.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And whereas, thou ſayeſt, <hi>all that do grieve, vex, and reſiſt the Spirit of God, have it not; but they reſiſt the Spirit of God in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:</hi> This is thy meaning, we know they reſiſt the Spirit of God in the Prophets, when they firſt grieve it in themſelves, as thou doſt; and as in the fourth of <hi>John</hi> the World receives him not; how ſhould they; when they hate the Light, and reſiſt it, as thou doſt; but the Spirit reproves them, therefore, they have it, though they cannot receiveit, nor receive Chriſt, but hate him, and ſo it is thou that grieves Gods ſpirit in his Servants.</p>
            <p>And whereas, thou ſayeſt, <hi>when Steven ſaid they do reſiſt the holy Ghoſt, it was the Spirit in him, by which he ſpake, as in</hi> Acts 6. 10.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:108232:18"/>
               <hi>as in like manner they reſiſted the ſpirit in the Prophets, as</hi> Acts 7. 52. <hi>which of the Prophets have not your Fathers perſecuted, &amp;c.</hi> This a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain is thy meaning, but the Scriptures doth not ſay as thou ſaith, for thoſe that reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt in <hi>Stephen</hi> had received the Law of God by the diſpoſition of Angels, &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 53. now the Law of God was the things of God, and the Angels miniſtring Spirits; ſo theſe that had the things of God had the ſpirit of God, and when they kept not the Law of God they quenched and reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſpirit of God, both in themſelves and others.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>when the mighty power of God was put forth in ſignes and wonders in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Wilderneſs,</hi> Numb. 14. 11. 22. <hi>and they believing not his Spirit not in them, but put forth thoſe mighty workes; and ſpeaking in</hi> Joſhuah <hi>and other faithful Witneſſes for God in that day; thus the ſpirit of God was vexed in</hi> Noah <hi>and</hi> Lot, <hi>by the wickedneſs of the Old World, and not in the wicked, who being ſtrangers, and without God in the world.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> None of theſe Scriptures doth ſay as thou ſay'ſt, that the wicked had not the Spirit of God to grieve, but that it was only grieved in <hi>Joſhuah, Noah,</hi> and ſuch like; as for <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. ſuch as had ſeen the wonders of God ten times, and yet did not hearken to the voice of God, and therefore they erred in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, as <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. now how can theſe hear the voice of God and have not the ſpirit of God.</p>
            <p>And the Apoſtle ſaid, they did all drink of the ſpiritual Rock, and all eat of the ſpiritual Meat, and the Rock that followed them was Chriſt; and yet thou ſay'ſt, they had not the Spirit of God to grieve in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 4, 5. and when they luſted and tempted God, and murmured againſt God and fell, then they grieved Gods ſpirit; and yet thou ſay'ſt, they had it not to grieve, but it was only grieved in others; and had it been Righteous with the Lord in one day to cauſe 23000. to fall, if they had not grieved his Spirit which he gave them, and ſo they griev'd him: and doſt thou not believe that the Apoſtle and thoſe <hi>Corinthians</hi> had the ſpirit of God, who ſayes, let not us tempt God, as they tempted him, nor murmur as they murmured; and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. the Apoſtle ſayes to day if you will hear [his voice] harden not your hearts as in the provocation in the day of temptation in the Wilderneſs, when your fathers ſaw my works, I was grieved with that generation they

do always erre in their hearts, and what did they erre from in their hearts, if it was not from the ſpirit, for when they had heard God, they did provoke him, though all that came out of <hi>Egipt</hi> did not provoke him, for as the Goſpel being preached to all Nations, the word was preached to them, but the word did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. and in <hi>Rom. 10. The word of faith which they preached was in the mouth, and in the heart,</hi> which all had heard, and can any hear the word, and have not the ſpirit, and is not the word ſpiritual, for doth not the Apoſtle ſay to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which had been Heathens, and <hi>Moſes</hi> to the <hi>Jewes, Deut.</hi> 30. from the 10. to 15. verſ. which ſaith, <hi>It was not far off, nor hidden from them,</hi> which ſaith, they need not ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend up into Heaven, or beyond the Sea to bring it, but the word is very nigh, even in thy heart, and in thy mouth, that thou maiſt do it,</hi> ſo good, and evil, life, and death, was ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and this was ſpoken as well to thoſe that did diſobey God, and for their wickedneſſe, ſhould be ſcattered among the Nations; if hap'ly thence they ſhould turn from their wickedneſs, and turn unto the Lord, and then they need not ſay, who ſhall go up to Heaven, or to beyond the Sea to bring the word, for it was very nigh them, in their hearts, and in their mouths, that they might obey and do it, and the Scripture witneſſes the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this upon many of them.</p>

            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 7, 8. if I depart, I will ſend the Comforter, &amp;c. thou ſaiſt by this promiſe Chriſt makes, is to ſend the holy Ghoſt after his departure; it is evident enough that this Scripture can be no proof of thy aſſertion, (to wit) that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that comes into the world hath not the holy Ghoſt; for if every man had him when he came into the world, what need was there he ſhould be ſent to them, after Chriſts Aſcenſion? nay ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this ſhews they had him not before he was ſent, and ſo not till after Chriſts departure, which deſtroyes thy opinion; yet thou grants the holy Ghoſt is come after Chriſt aſcended, to the Apoſtles, and to reprove the World; ſo by this thou haſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown thy own opinion and aſſertion; and we ſay that Chriſt doth enlighten every man that comes into the World, and is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the Light is ſaving; and the holy Ghoſt is given to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the World, and lead the Saints; and its proved before that the wicked reſiſted the holy Ghoſt, before Chriſt came in the fleſh, and the holy Ghoſt was given to the Diſciples after Chriſt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, and he ſhould reprove the World; but thou denies it, and ſayes, they have it not; and ſo demes plain Scripture, and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:108232:20"/>
perverts our Words; for our Words is, <hi>That Chriſt doth enlighten every Man that comes into the World;</hi> and ſayes, believe in the Light, and the holy Ghoſt reproves the World for their unbelief in the Light which leads the Saints unto all Truth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Thou ſayes, <hi>this promiſe is made particularly to the Diſciples of Chriſt, I will ſend him to you, and not unto the World.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Why doſt thou wrong the Scriptures, doth it not ſay, when he comes, <hi>He ſhall reprove the World of Sin, Righteouſneſs, and Judgment; of Sin, becauſe they believe not in him;</hi> was he ſent then only to the Diſciples, and not to the World? read <hi>Iohn</hi> 26. 7, 8, 9, 10. over again, and ſee thy own ignorance and darkneſs; and its ſufficiently proved that the wicked reſiſted the holy Ghoſt before Chriſt came; as alſo they that killed the Prophets, and alſo its proved that Chriſt did ſend the Comforter to his Diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Aſcenſion, which Spirit ſhould reprove the World; and though the Diſciples were led into all truth by the Spirit, by which they was to preach the Goſpel to all Nations, that the name of Chriſt might be ſpread over all; this doth not diſprove the ſpirit of reproving the World; which thou in thy ignorance brings to prove that the World hath not the ſpirit to reprove them; and in the 17. of <hi>John</hi> Chriſt ſaith, that they all may be one as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me, and I in them, that the World may believe that thou haſt ſent me: Now how can the Worldbelieve, if they have not the Light and the Spirit in them to believe in, ſeeing Believers <hi>hath the witneſs in themſelves?</hi> and as for Chriſts Miracles and ſignes which ſome believed, and ſome gain-ſaid; for ſome ſaid, he did Miracles by the Prince of Devils, ſuch ſtop their eares and cloſed their eyes, leaſt they ſhould be converted; as <hi>Acts</hi> 27.</p>
            <p>And thou ſayeſt, the holy Ghoſt was poured upon none but who repented and believed; this is thy ſaying, who art ignorant of the Scriptures, which ſaith, <hi>God would pour out his Spirit upon all Fleſh, Acts 2. Joel 2, Joh.</hi> 16. and ſuch as repented and believed received the holy Ghoſt, and others reſiſted it, and quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it, ſo that here is a difference betwixt the Believers and Unbelievers, for the one receives it, the other rejects it, though it be powred out upon all, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Word was ſowne in the Field (which is the World)</hi> it was ſowne upon all Grounds, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>the Thorney, the Bryrie, the High-way, and the ſtony Ground;</hi> but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:108232:20"/>
who brought forth fruit, <hi>but the good Ground, Mat.</hi> 13. and this ſufficiently proves that the ſpirit is powred upon all fleſh, and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. which ſpeaks of ſuch <hi>as were once enlightened, and had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of the Heavenly gift, and was made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and taſted of the good Word of God, and if they ſhall fall away, it were impoſſible to renew them again to repentance, ſeeing they crucify (the Lord of Glory) the Son of God afreſh, and put him to open ſhame;</hi> and now Prieſt <hi>Wiggan</hi> ſayes, theſe wicked men had not the ſpirit, nor was not enlightened, yet they crucifyed Chriſt afreſh, and put him to open ſhame; and thus with his wiſdome he abuſes the Scriptures, though he hath long made a Trade of them.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou makes a preamble upon our words, wherein we replyed to thy aſſertion (to wit) that no wicked man had the ſpirit of God, but only the Saints, and thou did affirm that <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> had not the ſpirit of God; and we proved that <hi>Balaam</hi> had the ſpirit of God, and heard the word and voice of God, as <hi>Numh.</hi> 24. and now thou haſt overthrown thy own aſſertion, and confeſſes that <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> had the ſpirit of God, which thou confeſſes was wicked men, and thus thou haſt ſplit thy ſelf upon the Rock, and overthrown thy Foundation, for before thou af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed none had the ſpirit of God but believers; and <hi>Balaam</hi> prophecyed of great things to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and God ſpoke to him, and we know there is a difference betwixt thoſe that grieves the ſpirit, and thoſe that walks in it; and before thou was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of theſe Scriptures, as <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> having the ſpirit of God, and now thou confeſſes that wicked men may have it upon ſome occaſions, but ſayes all wicked men hath it not, read over again <hi>Joh. 16.

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:108232:21"/>
and ſo confuted thy Aſſertion; and whereas thou wreſts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the Scriptures, and ſayes, <hi>Balaam</hi> did not ſee the Starr of <hi>Jacob,</hi> which it is ſaid at a full ſtop, by <hi>Balaam, there ſhall come a Starr out of Jacob, and a Scepter ſhall riſe out of Iſrael:</hi> Now how could he propheſie of it, if he did not ſee it? and this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes thee and thy Aſſertion, who never ſaw ſo far as <hi>Balaam</hi> did.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>they ſhall ſee him when every eye ſees him;</hi> by this thou confounds thy own aſſertion, for none can ſee God or Chriſt without the Light of the Spirit; and thou confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes every eye ſhall ſee him; and we may help thee a little further, <hi>for every tongue ſhall confeſs, and every Knee ſhall bow, at the name of Jeſus;</hi> if thou knew what his Name is, then thou mighteſt know that the <hi>Light of the body is the Eye,</hi> which ſees God.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou brings <hi>Job,</hi> who ſaid, when I ſee for my ſelf, and with my eyes, and this thou brings to prove that <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> ſhould not ſee till the latter day; and thou maiſt read <hi>Job,</hi> and confute thy ſelf, <hi>Job</hi> 42. who ſaith, <hi>I have heard of thee by the hearing of the eare, but now my eye ſeeth thee,</hi> here <hi>Job</hi> was a true Prophet, for before he ſaid he ſhould ſee him, now he ſayes he did ſee him, and thus thy ignorance (knowes not Scriptures) appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and we know what the Believers ſaw, and are ſatisfyed, and we believe thou haſt not come ſo far as <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſſe, nor heard the voice of God as he did, though thou would ſit as a Judge of the World, and in the Saints conditions.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, that the Spirit of God dwelt no more in <hi>Balaam,</hi> then the Angel of the Lord dwelt in the <hi>Aſſe;</hi> and one of thy people ſaid, (which thou ſay'ſt is no <hi>Baptiſt)</hi> that <hi>Balaam</hi> had no more ſpirit then his Horſe; he was one of thy followers, and took thy part, and thou didſt not gain-ſay him then; and now thou ſay'ſt in effect the ſame that he did.</p>
            <p>And that the ſpirit of God dwelt no more in <hi>Balaam</hi> then the Angel did in the Aſſe; then let all people read <hi>Numb. 22. Numb. 23.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:108232:21"/>
greedily after the error of <hi>Balaam</hi> for gifts and rewards; does not thou remember a difference bewixt 40 <hi>l.</hi> and 100 <hi>l.</hi> for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching about <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> and who ſhould have had this, <hi>John;</hi> and God teſtified againſt the error of <hi>Balaam,</hi> but not againſt the Aſſe, as in <hi>Jude;</hi> and here its proved <hi>Balaam</hi> had more ſpirit then his Horſe, (as you called him) which overthrowes the aſſertion of thee and thy fellowes: And whereas thou makes a great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, becauſe, we ſaid he was a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> if thou be a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thy Principle, and was one with thee, and why doſt thou deny him now.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>there is a Light or Law in every man, which convinceth and reproves of ſin, and this made</hi> Judas <hi>bring the money back again, and this</hi> (thou ſayeſt) <hi>doth not reprove of unbeliefs Judas</hi> was made a partaker of the Miniſtry, and had he no more then a natural man, is this according to thy knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? did this which convinced <hi>Judas</hi> not reprove him of his unbelief? did it not make him confeſs he had ſinned in betraying the Innocent blood? did he not ſee his unbelief and wickedneſs here, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. and to prove thy aſſertion thou brings <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 14, 15. which ſayes the Gentiles that have not the Law, do the things contained in the Law, ſhews the work of the Law written in their hearts, their conſciences bearing witneſs, &amp;c. and if thou read the 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> thou may ſee that this witneſs ſpeaks, <hi>in the day that God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> hereby it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that in the day when God ſhall judge the ſecrets of men by Jeſus Chriſt, this ſpirit which lead the Gentiles to do thoſe things contained in the Law, will juſtifie them; <hi>and this uncircumciſion</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>ſhall be counted Circumciſion,</hi> as <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. and doth not this Light which judges the ſecrets of all hearts by Jeſus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of unbelief; ſo here thou haſt belyed the Apoſtle, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as thou ſayeſt, this was before that promiſe in the 16. of <hi>John,</hi> we know that—and whereas thou ſayeſt, that this ſpirit of truth was to convince the World of Sin, as in the 16. of <hi>John,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; here thou haſt overthrown that which thou aſſerted in the publick meeting, for therein thou aſſerted that none had the ſpirit but Believers, and this Scripture was to convince thee, for that which convinced the Gentiles was within, by which they knew God, and was not that by the Spirit? elſe how came they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:108232:22"/>
to be baptized in the ſpirit, and circumciſion in the ſpirit, and thus one while thou confeſſes, and another while denies, and ſo is in confuſion; and goes about to bring one Scripture to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw another, to thy own deſtruction; for when the Holy Ghoſt was come, when the Apoſtle preached to the <hi>Romans</hi> and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which he ſpoke of, and preached to, was become the true Circumciſion in the ſpirit, and the Holy Ghoſt was come then which was promiſed.</p>
            <p>And in all thy Anſwers, it doth not diſprove the Scripture, which ſaith, the World hath the Holy Ghoſt to reprove them; but Chriſts words which is our aſſertion ſtands, and thou and thy aſſertion by thy former arguments is ſhaken, and ſo it is proved that the wicked and unregenerate hath the Holy Ghoſt, which thou confeſſes is the ſpirit of Chriſt, though they grieve it, and all the Scriptures thou brought proves nothing to the contrary, but overthrowes thy aſſertion, and <hi>John</hi> 14. 17. is anſwered before, for the World and thou art unlike to receive the ſpirit of truth, when you reject and oppoſe the Light, and will not receive it, which you ſhould believe in; for if you receiv'd it, it would not reprove you, but you would have fellowſhip in it; &amp; why doſt thou judge the World hath it not, when thou confeſſeth thou hath it, and is in the ſame nature of the world, in envy, malice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 9. proves nothing to thy aſſertion, but ſaith, the Saints was not in the fleſh, and they that quench and grieve the ſpirit of God, and will not have the ſpirit of God, but it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for their ſin, &amp;c. how can they be ſaid to be Chriſts, when they will not have the ſpirit of Chriſt to lead them; and <hi>Jude</hi> 19. is clear againſt thy aſſertion, which ſpeaks of ſuch as had the ſpirit, and erred from it, and ſo became like <hi>Sodons,</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Core,</hi> and <hi>Balaam,</hi> theſe thou brings to prove that wicked men has not the ſpirit of God over and over, <hi>Balaam</hi> had the ſpirit of God, that is proved in <hi>Numbers;</hi> and in <hi>Geneſis</hi> it is proved that <hi>Cain</hi> talked with God, and heard his voice, and he could not do that without the ſpirit; and <hi>Core</hi> knew the power of God that brought him forth of <hi>Egipt,</hi> and was not he of the tribe of <hi>Levie</hi> that miniſtred in the Prieſts office, and was he like to medle in the things of God without the ſpirit; though theſe err'd from the ſpirit, as in <hi>Jude,</hi> and ſo became ſenſual. And thou had more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:108232:22"/>
to hold forth thy errors, then others had to hold forth Truth; and as the Serpent led <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Evah</hi> from Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs to the Tree, by which they fell, ſo thou his Meſſenger leads people from the ſpirit of God within them, to ſomething without them.</p>
            <p>Whereas thou ſay'ſt in thy ſecond Argument, <hi>whom Chriſt ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with a ſaving Light into their hearts, he cauſeth the Glorious light of the Goſpel to ſhine,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 4, 6. <hi>but he cauſeth not the Glorious light of the Goſpel to ſhine into the hearts of every one that comes into the World, for the Goſpel is hid to ſome, to whom the God of this world, hath blinded the mind of them that believe not, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>And thou manifeſted that thou was not a rational man, as <hi>George Fox</hi> could thee, both in thy practice and carriage in the Meeting; who brake the Order amongſt us, which was, that all might ſpeak one by one; and thy laying violent hands upon <hi>Tho. Curwen;</hi> and

what <hi>Margaret Fell</hi> ſpoke of, thou haſt made manifeſt that to the full, and my words, <hi>Io.

That he by the grace of God, ſhould <hi>taſt Death for every Man; The Love of Chriſt conſtraines us, becauſe we thus judge, that if Chriſt dyed for all, then all were dead, and he did dye for all; that they that live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that dyed for all, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. 15. and here thy judgment is contrary to the Apoſtles, as thou may ſee, what error thou and thy People are in, contrary to the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou haſt Publiſhed ſome part of (I) <hi>Iames Parkes</hi> Letter, what was thou aſhamed to Publiſh it all, that the People might have ſeen the whole Letter, but thou ſerves my Letter, as thou doſt the Scriptures, take part, and leave out part, as thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the old Deceiver did, <hi>Mat.</hi> the 4. and my Letter is true to thee, for thou long deceived me, and led me Captive in Error and blindneſs, where thou art thy ſelf, and alſo many others, from the Light of Chriſt Jeſus; and I told thee, and writ this to thee in private, which thou haſt made publick; and it is well thou haſt, that others may ſee thy folly and madneſs, who keepeſt people from the light and ſalvation, but praiſed be the Lord I have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped thy error.

know that thou, and all the Generation of Prieſts have ſtruck at, till you are all tumbled down your ſelves; but Chriſt our Corner ſtone, and Foundation, and Light, never fell; but thine is fallen, and therefore thou rageſt: And we do affirm in our words and printed Books, that Chriſt, who ſays he is the Light, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 8, he is the Dore, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. he is the quickning Spirit, and he is the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone which God hath laid in Sion, he is the Truth, and he is the <hi>All,</hi> and in all and above all, according to Scripture; and to be believed in, <hi>And</hi> hath enlightned every man that comes into the world; and he is the Redeemer and the word; and this thou deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, Chriſt the Light, the Quickning Spirit, the Way, the Truth, the Corner ſtone, the Word, the Foundation, the Redeemer and the <hi>All;</hi> And here indeed, thou haſt denyed the Corner ſtone, and Chriſt Jeſus, which the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles teſtified of; ſo thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf againſt them: So never take their words to make a Trade of any more.</p>
            <p>And thou canſt not call Chriſt the Light, a Quickning Spirit, the Way, the Truth, the Word, the Foundation, the Corner ſtone, the Redeemer, this thou canſt not call the True Jeſus thou ſayſt, We do believe thee, and that thou art an Enemy to him, and them that walk in his light are manifeſt: and therefore have I <hi>Richard Gubbam</hi> proved thee a falſe Prophet and Antichriſt, according to thy own-words, and we are come to Repentance, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Truth, and thy ways be detected, whereby many ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hearts be turned from them, and ſo now we are many of us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived from ſuch deceivers as thee, who calls Chriſt the Light, the Word, the Way, the Truth, deceiving, but the Lord rebuke thee who ſtrives to keep Ignorant ſimple people from the Light, and in darkneſs thou wouldſt aſpire up as a Judge of all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and knows not thy own to be miſerable, blind and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. yet thou tell'ſt the Reader what the Light is, and what it can do, and what it cannot do; and of what uſe it is, when thou in the darkneſs cannot comprehend it.</p>

               <hi>And</hi> whereas thou ſaiſt <hi>it is a great Light, and yet but a Candle Light, a created Light, ſpringing up with Man in his natural birth, leading him to know ſomething of his Creator, and of his duty to him; alſo diſcovering tranſgreſſions againſt the Law of workes, which he was under; the Tenor whereof is this; doe this and live, Rom. 9. And this it may doe, where Chriſt the way, the truth, and the life, is not ſo much as heard of; thus it was in</hi> Adam <hi>when he had ſinned, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the promiſe of grace was held forth in the ſeed of the Woman, Gen. 3. 15. the Light and Law within him diſcovered ſin unto him, but mark the effect, horrour and amazement ſeized upon him; I was afraid and hid my ſelf, Gen. 3. 10. for this Law ſpeakes nothing but wrath to all, that are in the fall, Rom. 4. 15. notwithſtanding amendment, and the moſt exact future obedience they can yield to it.</hi>

Light, God created the Sun, Moon, and Starrs, and was this the created Light that made <hi>Adam</hi> to hide himſelf; and did this created Light ſpringing up with man in his natural birth, which thou calls the candle and ſpirit of the Natural man, which knowes not the things of God, <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and this thou brought before, and is this created light the Law of works; do this and live; and is this created light the ſpirit of man, that leads him to horror and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement: Nay, it is a divine Light that lets a man ſee himſelf; and all thoſe Scriptures doth not ſpeak of a created light, or a Candle light, which is the ſpirit of a Natural man, leading him to know ſomething of his Creator, and of his duty to him: when the Scripture ſaith, the Natural man knowes not the things of Gods how ignorant and carnal art thou, was the Law of works the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Light ſpringing up, with the Natural man; for that was the Law of God which is ſpiritual, which ſaith, do this and live; as in the <hi>Romans.</hi> And how was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world; if <hi>Adam</hi> had no more but a natural light ſpringing up with man, and is the Image of God, Righteouſneſs and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which he was made in, a Created light, and the Candle and Spirit of the Natural man, as thou ſaiſt formerly; in this thou ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſts both thy ignorance and contradictions: For, that of God in all men, by which they knew their Creator, and the things of him; it is by his ſpirit by which thou haſt ſaid, they may know their Creator by a Created Light, and by a Candle, which is the Spirit of a Natural man. And thus, thou haſt overthrown thy own Aſſertion, and oppoſes the Covenant of Light, Chriſt Jeſus, and art contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 11. and what is this to the purpoſe, as all being concluded under ſin, we know that, and we know that the Law is ſpiritual, and what it can do; but we own Chriſt the end of the Law, for it ſerved, till Chriſt the ſeed came, who gives Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> whereas thou ſaiſt, the Light which thou called natural, and making no diſtinction in this place betwixt that which is natural, and that which is ſpiritual, but ſaith <hi>the Light flowes from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Nature, rightly called natural, and not ſpiritual;</hi> and this thou would ſet up in oppoſition againſt Chriſt the Light, for the Apoſtle ſpoke to the <hi>Romans,</hi> how they were from the Light, and from the Law, and while men be in that which flowes from the

Natural Man, they know not, neither the Law that is Spiritual, nor the Light of Chriſt; and Men obeying the Light of Chriſt, or the Law of God; it is not by that which flowes from nature, but from that which gives them a ſpiritual underſtanding; for the natural man doth not know the things of God, and all thoſe Scriptures in the <hi>Romans, Galatians,</hi> and <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is nothing to the matter of thy purpoſe, concerning the Light of Chriſt that doth enlighten every man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> whereas thou ſayeſt, <hi>This Light knowes nothing of the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Goſpel miniſtry, hid in God, nothing of Redemption by Chriſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Gods good pleaſure, and purpoſe of Grace; nothing of the Law of faith, the tenour whereof is this, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This all may ſee how thou haſt contradicted thy ſelf, by thy former words, for thou ſayes, that this Light is able to ſeek or feel after God his Creator, and is in a capacity of knowing much of Him, as a Creator, at leaſt his Eternal power, and Godhead; and can this Light let them know the Eternal Power and Godhead, and nothing of Chriſt, who is the power of God; and nothing of the Goſpel which is the power of God; and can a man know ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Creator, and nothing of his Favour; for is not his grace his favour; and they that lived in the Law was juſtified; and they that were obedient ſaw Chriſt the end of the Law, and came to him who is the end of the Law; and beyond the Natural man's ſpirit which thou talks of, ſo faſt to no purpoſe, but manifeſts thy confuſion, <hi>For to know God is Eternal Life, Joh.</hi> 17. 3. and that is beyond thy Natural Man's Light; and we do know that they that believe in Chriſt Jeſus the Light (which thou oppoſeſt) ſhall have Eternal Life; and we know that the Law of Faith is not natural, nor the Light of Chriſt that doth enlighten every man, nor the Law of God, nor the promiſe of God with all the rights held in the Faith; and the ſeed Chriſt ſhall bruſe the Serpents head; and he is come a Light and Salvation to the ends of the Earth, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens every man; and we know the Law of Faith is Spiritual; and whereas thou ſay'ſt, the Law of Works ſprings up with Man's Nature; and the Law is Spiritual, and then this Natural ſprings up with the Spiritural: Why how now <hi>John,</hi> where finds thou this in the Scripture, the Law is receiv'd from God, and not ſpringing up with man; what non-ſence and confuſion is this, what a Mechanick man art thou.</p>

the Natural Light, the Created light, the Natural man, Chriſt, nor worſhipped it, but thou muſt write to them that doth ſo; yet thou art ſlack enough to do that I believe; but it is Chriſt the light that doth enlighten every man that comes into the World; that's it thou calls, a fictious Chriſt, and an Idol, if thou would ſpeak plainly; who is given for a Covenant, a light to the Gentiles, and the Glory of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> whom we witneſs, and have the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 32,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> whereas thou ſpeaks, <hi>of denying the true Jeſus Emanuel, God and man in union, whom his own perſon without us, not ours, hath by one offering once for ever wrought eternal Redemption for us, and is the alone object of Faith.</hi>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:108232:32"/>
Natural mans ſpirit, and a Created light, and a Natural light.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As</hi> to thy Objection which is againſt <hi>John,</hi> who ſaith, this is the true light that enlightens every man that comes into the World: Would <hi>John</hi> have bid them believe in it, except it had been Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 7, 8, 9. and this is an invincible proof againſt thy aſſertion, and all the people thou doſt deceive; and <hi>John</hi> was a true Witneſs, but thou art a falſe; and <hi>John</hi> bore a true witneſs to the Light, but thou bears falſe witneſs againſt the light; and ſo thou turns people from light to darkneſs; and the true Apoſtle turned them from darkneſs to the light, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 6.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And</hi> whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>We write in ſeveral Books, as may be ſeen, this light Chriſt is God, the Lord God, and the Lamb, the Object of Faith; and this true Light which is Chriſt, enlightens not ſome, but every man coming into the World; and therefore, it muſt needs be ſaving, and that this light can be meant for no other then of Chriſt, they further alleage</hi> John 3. 12. &amp; 12. 35, 36. <hi>where it is plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt that Chriſt is the Light.</hi>

            <p>Whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>We have perverted many Scriptures;</hi> That is falſe, for we ſpeak them as they are, but it is manifeſt thou haſt per verted many, and quoted many falſe; and many people that doth not know thy ſubtle devices, but takes all things for granted, without any trial, ſuch thou may deceive; for thy Book manifeſts it ſelf ſufficiently, if it had not been anſwered; but only for the ſake of the ſimple, which thou keeps under thee in thy error and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:108232:32"/>
deluſion, that they might ſee thee, and come from under thy ſnare; for we are ſatisfied as to our ſelves; for thy work is only to keep people in darkneſs from the light; and we are come from under thy Captivity, and ſee thy ſubtlety and ſnares, and know what thou can ſay, and long enough ſince ſaw thy confuſion.</p>
            <p>And thou ſay'ſt, when it is ſaid, that was the true light which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteneth every man that comes into the World, <hi>It muſt be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,</hi> firſt, <hi>who this true Light is;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>how he doth enlighten every man that comes into the World: for</hi> firſt, <hi>the Scriptures do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that this true Light is the word God, by whom the World was made; thus it is ſaid,</hi> Joh. 11. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God; all things was made by him, that is, by the Word God:</hi> John <hi>was ſent to bear witneſs of the Light, that is, of the word God, that was the true Light, that is, the word God; even he by whom the World was made, he was in the World, and the World knew him not, which was the Creator and former of all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this you may ſee how he hath perverted the Scriptures, and overthrown his Aſſertion, and his former Writings in his Books; for he ſaith, that the light which lighteneth every man that comes into the World, which <hi>John</hi> bore Teſtimony of, is the word God, by which all things was made and created, which men was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in, this was not a ſaving light ſaith he, though it be Divine; and doth he not call it a Created light, a Natural light, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a Natural Man, and now it is God, and not ſaving; for the Scripture ſaith, the Word was with God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. and this ſpeaks of Chriſt, and Chriſts Name is called, <hi>the Word of God,</hi> Rev. 19 <hi>&amp; 13. and the Word was with God;</hi> (that thou haſt left out,) <hi>and this Word became Fleſh.</hi> So he goes about to prove that Chriſt was not the Word with the Father before the World began, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scripture, which ſaith, I was with him in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith; and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Glorifie thou me with the ſame Glory which I had with thee before the World was,</hi> Joh. 17.</p>
            <p>And again thou ſay'ſt, <hi>The Word God thus conſidered, is the true light, the fountain, and original of all lights, according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 1 Joh. 1. 5. God is light, and in him is no darkneſs at all; this is he in whom was life, and the life was the light of men, in whom we live, move, and have our being, we are his off-ſpring, and he is the fountain both of light and life, to all beings according to their capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:108232:33"/>
as their Creator; and thus we may ſee what this true light is, the word God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> And yet thou ſaiſt before, this was not ſaving, this true Light, this word God, how dark art thou, is not Chriſt called God, and his Name the Word of God, Emanual God with us, and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. the Heavens and the Earth, which are now by the ſame Word, are kept in ſtore, &amp;c.

            <p>And thou ſaiſt 2ly. <hi>How doth he enlighten every man that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; and ſaiſt in another place, the word God, or God the word, as Creator of all things doth enlighten every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, by ſetting up in every man a ſpirit and Law in his heart, by which he lives, which is called the Candle of the Lord, Prov. 20. 27 of which Spirit and law I have ſpoken before.</hi>

witneſs of him, and cryed ſaying, this was he of whom I ſpeak, <hi>He that cometh after me, is preferred before me;</hi> and called Chriſt, <hi>the Lamb of God that took away the ſins of the World;</hi> and this Light by which all things was made and Created, <hi>He came unto his own, and they received him not;</hi> ſome hated the Light, and ſtopt their ears, and ſhut their eyes, and would not ſee, leſt they ſhould be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; (as thou doſt) <hi>But to as many as received him, he gave power to become the Sons of God; them that believed in his Name, and his name is the Word of God, Rev.</hi> 19.

            <p>And whereas thou ſay'ſt, <hi>It may be further obſerved that Chriſt is not once named in all, or any of the firſt nine Verſes of the firſt of John, but only the Word.</hi>

            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>Chriſt the word being imbodied in Fleſh, he is thenceforth called Chriſt the Lord, or the Lords Chriſt, and no otherwiſe doth he bear that Name, but as he is the word made Fleſh, to be ſeen and believed on, it is not the word alone, nor the fleſh alone, but the word and fleſh in union, that is called Chriſt; and is a Light to lighten the Gentiles, till then there was no ſuch thing as a Chriſt, or a Light to the Gentiles, but only in a promiſe.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is thy ſaying, and not <hi>Iohns,</hi> thou haſt wronged thoſe Scriptures, for none of them doth ſay that Chriſt did not come to enlighten every man that comes into the world, but only thoſe that believe, thou haſt not proved this by the Scriptures, though thou haſt perverted many: for <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. ſaid he was the true light that lighteth every man that comes into the world; And thou ſaiſt, but only thoſe that believe: And Chriſt ſays, <hi>I am the light of the World,</hi> and believe in the light, And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 19. 8. 12. doth not ſay there, he hath only enlightned ſome, but all good and bad, ſuch as hate the light and would not come to it, leſt the light ſhould reprove them whoſe deeds be evil, this is thy condition; And <hi>the Condemnation is becauſe that light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds be evil, but he that doth truth, cometh to the light, that his deeds may be manifeſt, that they are wrought in God;</hi> but thou art not come to the light, whoſe deeds be evil, and ſo manifeſts that they are not wrought in God, but fights againſt it.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſpeaks, <hi>The word made fleſh is he that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to be a Covenant to the people, and a Light to the Gentiles, who brings into the world a Life and Light far exceeding the Light that was ſet up in every man that comes into the world, by the word Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</hi>

created Light, and made Light) And doth give life; And doſt thou not mean the Scripture, when thou ſpeaks of the word Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator? For we have good reaſon to ſuſpect thee, ſeeing thou ſaid to me <hi>(Thomas Curwen,</hi> and to <hi>William Wilſon)</hi> in thy Chamber, <hi>That the Scriptures were the Author of thy Faith;</hi> for the reſt of thy Generation uſed to tell us, That the Scriptures was the word, and the Light of the Creator, is a Natural and a created Light, and the Spirit of a natural man (that knows the things of God) And this is the Light that <hi>John</hi> came to bear witneſs of, ſaiſt thou.</p>
            <p>And this thy miſerable darkneſs, in ſaying <hi>Iohn</hi> came to bear witneſs of a created and natural Light, and Spirit of a man, and a natural mans Conſcience, That he ſhould be ſent of God, to bear this witneſs; <hi>For as many as received him,</hi> (this light which did enlighten them) <hi>became the Sons of God,</hi> but <hi>they that hated this light, it became their Condemnation</hi> Joh. 3. Joh. 1. 12. And thou, nor none will never receive Life nor Son-ſhip, but as they receive the Light which thou hates, &amp; makes ſuch outrage againſt, but that Light which <hi>Iohn</hi> bore witneſs of, which thou bears witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, has ript off thy covering, &amp; manifeſted thy deeds, &amp; turned thy inſide out: And the Light is a ſtumbling block to thee, and a Rock of offence, for it ſeems, it has offended thee, an thou that would not have the Light, will not have the Son, and ſo has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied thy ſelf of Life, yet thou wilt bow the knee, and ſpit in his face, and ſay, is not this the Carpenters Son, the natural Light, like the Jews: And where doth the Scripture ſay (which thou haſt perverted) that <hi>Iohn</hi> came to bear witneſs of the Light, the Word, Creator, and not of Chriſt the Ligh the Word; Make this good, by plain Scripture, without thy immaginations, and before they be born again, they muſt believe in the Light, <hi>Iohn</hi> the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
            <p>And ſo men are in Death and Darkneſs, and hates the Light as thou doſt, and remains in the Natural State, while they hate the Light, for that which makes manifeſt is the Light, <hi>Ioh. 3. Epheſ.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
            <p>And thou ſaiſt, <hi>The neglect of this diſtinction of the word Creator, and the Word made Fleſh (which is ſo plainly laid down in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

as hath been ſhewed) is the ground of the great miſtake of many, who not conſidering what is teſtified of the word as Creator, do confound that light which is ſet up by him, (as ſuch) in every man, with that Light which he gives as he is the word made fleſh, and ſo call the light ſaving, which is but Natural, ſpringing up with him in his Creation; yea, hence they call that Light, Chriſt, which is but the Law written in the heart, whereas Chriſt is the Law-giver, and ſo cannot be the Law.</hi>

And there is three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, VVord, and Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are one;</hi> (he doth not ſay two words,) <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 7.

            <p>And the light which is Natural, that comes from the word Creator, by which they may know the Eternal power and God-head, as thou ſaiſt before, by which they may ſeek and feel after God, and brings <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. which ſaith, <hi>The Natural man doth not know nor perceive the things of God.</hi>

            <p>Was there ever ſuch confuſion as this? for they that had that which let them ſee the Eternal Power and God-head, was by that which might be known of God, which was manifeſt in them; for that which brings people to know the Eternal Power and God-head, and to feel and ſeek after him, and to know much of the Creator, <hi>is not a Natural light,</hi> as thou ſaiſt doth, but it is a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Light;</hi> and it is thou that confounds thy ſelf with thy own imaginations, and diſtinctions, and wrongs and abuſes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and is not fit to take them into thy mouth; for thou haſt made a trade of them too long, and the Light Chriſt Jeſus, who ends the Law. And where doth the Scripture ſpeak of a Natural light, and a Created Light, from the word Creator, ſpringing up with people in their Creation? for a Natural light makes him but

            <p>And whereas thou writes to thy people to keep them from the Light Chriſt Jeſus, which light thou art afraid of coming to, but many is come to it: And further thou tells thy people of <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,</hi> nay they are far off that; thou and thy people are rather in ſcorn againſt the Light of Chriſt, and calls it natural: And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>How deſtructive and pernitious will the light of Chriſt which we ſpeak of</hi> (and <hi>Iohn</hi> bore teſtimonie of) <hi>prove to pretious ſouls;</hi> And thou ſaiſt, <hi>Admit this grand lye for the Corner ſtone, and the whole ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure will conſiſt of lyes.</hi>

            <p>And thou ſaiſt, <hi>Open this as the firſt door of entrance (as they do) and it leads into a Babell of Confuſion and Errors, no ſooner is a man entred in at this deadly Gate, but he is in the City Tohn where firſt (if his eyes be anointed with Eye-ſalve by the true Ieſus) he may behold this Image of Iealouſie, viz. the light that is in every man that comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world.</hi>

Epiſt. ver. 14. our Friends ſalute, and greet the Friends;</hi> and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we ſay Friends, and Meeting; this is to ſet forth a new Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus thou maliciouſly ſaith; but thou art a manifeſt lyar, both by our words and Writings; for, we call our <hi>Meetings, Churches,</hi> and our <hi>Friends, Brethren</hi> and <hi>Siſters;</hi> and ſo here it will be ſeen, that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:108232:38"/>
we do not characterize our ſelves by new Names, which thou haſt falſly, and maliciouſly charged upon us; But, thou haſt given thy ſelf up to forge lies, and work wickedneſs; for no other Jeſus but him, <hi>who is the ſame to day, yeſterday, and for ever,</hi> do we own; who is the Light of the World, and enlightens every man that comes into the World, which hath been proved before; whom <hi>John</hi> was ſent of God to bear witneſs of, that all through him might believe; and as many as receives him he gives power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God; which thou blaſphemouſly calls Chriſt the Light an Idol, and Natural light.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>VVe cannot find the Names or Offices of Paſtor, Elder, Deacon, Teacher, which Chriſt ſet in his Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here the very common people will witneſs againſt thee that thou lyeſt; for the work ſhewes it by the care and order that nothing is lacking; for we have more in our Church then the Names of thoſe Offices, we have the fruits of them, for nothing is wanting amongſt us; we have the Great Biſhop, <hi>&amp; are taught of God, &amp; do know the Lord from the greateſt to the leaſt, Heb.</hi> 8. But what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your Teachers and Paſtors, and Deacons, who made ſuch a noyſe againſt us a few years ago, who had the Name but out of the life and power.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>VVe do not alledge Scripture for our Doctrine for proof, but VVomen ſpeak in our Meetings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here again thou adds lyes, to lyes, and delights in lyes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 4. and art <hi>a deceitful witneſs ſpeaking lyes,</hi> Prov. 14. 25. <hi>and haſt bent thy tongue like a Bow for lyes,</hi> Jer. 6. <hi>and ſo ſpeaking lyes in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, 1 Tim.</hi> 14. for we had never meeting nor diſcourſe with people, but we prov'd our Doctrine by Scripture; and at the laſt diſpute thou had Scripture brought to prove the truth againſt thee; and out of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jade,</hi> proved thee to be the man that denyed the Lord that bought thee.</p>
            <p>And as for thy denying Womens ſpeaking, thon has herein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted thy ignorance of the Scripture; for Chriſt ſeat <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> firſt to declare his Reſurrection unto his Diſciples, <hi>Marke</hi> 16. and that the Daughter of <hi>Phanitel ſhe declared of Chriſt to all that looked for Redemption in Jeruſalem.</hi> Luke 2. <hi>And.</hi> Phebe <hi>a Servant of the Church;</hi> which in ſome Tranſlations is <hi>a Paſtor;</hi> And <hi>Priſcilla and Aquilla Inſtructor's;</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> had four Daughters Propheſied;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:108232:38"/>
               <hi>And women were Labourers with the Apoſtle in the Goſpel,</hi> Read Acts and Romans 16. Women propheſied 1 Cor. 11. And Acts 2. &amp; Joel 2. Sons and Daughters propheſie.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>John Wiggan</hi> can make no diſtinction between thoſe women that are forbibden to ſpeak, and thoſe who are incouraged and commended; his envy hath ſo blinded him, but limits the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, that his folly might be manifeſt to all men, for Chriſt in the male and female was not to be limited, nor propheſye to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, 1 Theſ. 5. but thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf to be contrary to Chriſt and his Miniſters, and ſo proved thy ſelf to be a falſe Miniſter, and one of the falſe Teachers, that puts no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pretious and the vile, and a walker in lyes, Jer. 23. And ſo it is thou that teacheſt lyes in the name of the Lord; And was <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla, Phebe Anna,</hi> the reſt of the Women the Apoſtle forbids ſpeaking as in Tim. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doſt thou apply the ſcripture, and wickedly, but this Manifeſts thy Judgment of them, but thou art more ignorant than ſome of the Baptiſts, for ſome of the Baptiſts would allow women to ſpeak, but thy envy hath eaten out thy ſight, and the leaſt of our Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſees thee to make lyes thy refuge, and who lives in the truth ſees thee.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>We ſay the Scriptures are not a rule of Faith and Converſation to walk by, hence it is that Chriſts Water Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and Supper, and his Cenſures are rejected.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Scripture be thy rule for thy life and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then why doſt not thou obey it? For if the Scripture be thy rule, then thou muſt burn offerings, and ſacrifices; and if but part of it be thy Rule; why didſt not thou ſet down what part it is? But we ſay Chriſt is our rule (which doth alſo the Scriptures) <hi>Math.</hi> 2. 6. Where it is ſaid <hi>he ſhall rule the people, and he is the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and finiſher of our Faith.</hi> And give us that Scripture that ſaith, the Scripture is the Author of mans Faith, and mans rule; And as for thy Bread and wine and outward waſhings, thou knowſt little more than that, nor hardly that, for if thou didſt, thou would'ſt have anſwered my queries, but thou dareſt not confeſs to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Apoſtle was in, And we look at things that be Eternal, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:108232:39"/>
the outward things, we know them where they be, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny nothing in its place, but our life is in Chriſt; but thou ſhelters thy ſelf in outward things, to keep alive in thy old nature, out of the Baptiſm into the Death of Chriſt, <hi>Rom</hi> 6. 3. And as for thy Cenſures; you have cenſured one another, till you are broken to pieces; And where doth the Scripture ſpeak of Chriſts Cenſures; And Chriſt being within, he is the Rule and Ruler, and King, (this is Scripture) within the Saints, 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 27. Chriſt in you, 2 Cor. 4. Canſt thou not ſee this Scripture within, but thou haſt made a trade of them ſo long, that thy gain hath blinded thee, and was not all the Scriptures given forth from the Spirit of God within, by inſpiration of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and is not the new Covenant, the Law written in the heart, the Scripture within, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. Jer. 31, 30. and this Scripture within, thou makes a mock and ſcoff at.</p>
            <p>And the ſame Goſpel as ever was, the power of God we own, and are not aſhamed of Rom. 1. 16. <hi>VVhich Goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God to Salvation,</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>the ſpirit of truth ſhould lead them into all truth;</hi> And was not that their Rule, and if the Scripture be the Rule, what was the guide into the Rule to know the things of God, for thou ſayeſt the Natural man know not the things of God, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned; then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit muſt be the Rule; and they that are the ſons of God are led by the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. and Joh. 14. And is not the Law written in the heart, the perfect Law of liberty, the Law of Love, the Law of faith in the heart; doſt not thou ſee this is a Scripture <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 25. Heb. 8. Rom. 3. 17. And is not this faith within to be obeyed, Rom. 10. doſt thou not here manifeſt thy darkneſs to all people, and is not this faith held in a pure Conſcience, which the juſt lives by, 1 Tim. 1. 19. Thou mightſt be aſham'd to ſcoff at the practice of the Saints, and at the Scriptures; but in thy dead faith thou calls Light darkneſs, and darkneſs light, as in <hi>Iſay:</hi> Who makes ſuch an outrage againſt the Light, becauſe we ſay the light is in the heart, and the Spirit of God to guide us, is within, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Scripture which ſpeaks of the Rule of Faith, Let Chriſt Rule in your hearts by faith. Thou haſt put him out of his place, &amp; preferred the Scripture before him: And what Rule had <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Saints in the old world before the Scripture was written.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſpeaks falſly, <hi>accuſing and ſpeaking untruths,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:108232:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and perſecuting with the tongue and Acts of injuſtice, and thou ſayes this we do in obedience to God, and to our Guide.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thus thou further vents thy lies and malice; for, the Lord God who is pure, and Chriſt our Light leads us to no ſuch thing but we ſpeaking truth to thee, and tells thee what thou art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flattery; therefore, makes thou thy complaint of perſecution with the Tongue; but, thou haſt the perſecuting tongue; and when thou proves thy other ſlanders againſt us, then may thou have a further Anſwer, for we own no injuſtice.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>we ſay the Light in every man is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of faith, and a common ſufficient Light, that it is Salvation to all that obey it, and that we teach free Will, &amp;c.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here again thou adds lye to lye, perverting our words as thou doſt the Scriptures, and ſpeaking thy own, for we ſay Chriſt is the Light of the World, and his Grace is ſufficient for all, and hath appeared to all men, <hi>Tit. 2. and believe in the Light,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8, 12. and Chriſt the Light is the Author of faith, and we ſay it is not he that wills or runs, but that God ſhews mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which none is to abuſe.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>We teach and ſet up an inherent legal Righteouſneſs, denying the imputed Righteouſneſs of Chriſt wrought in his own perſon without us; that Chriſt fulfilling the Law in us, or his ſpirit, mortifying, or ſanctifying, and fulfilling the Law in us, is Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; therefore, no coming of Chriſt but that within, and ſo deny the 2d. coming of Chriſt, contrary to Scripture, &amp; theſe &amp; many more Arminian, Popiſh &amp; long ſince profligated errors is laid upon their ſandy foundation.</hi>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Here thou adds more lies, for Chriſts ſecond coming we do not deny, and he the Righteouſneſs of God we own, and never denyed, and it is a falſe ſlander of thee to ſay otherwiſe; and our foundation is Chriſt, which thou wickedly calls Sandy, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28. who is a tryed ſtone, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and the legal Righteouſneſs is thy own, its none of ours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and the Righteouſneſs of Faith which ſaith the word is nigh thee in thy heart, and in thy mouth, we own; which thou enviouſly calls an inherent legal Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Romans</hi> 10. And that which Chriſt wrought and did in is own perſon, and ſuffered without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> for Mankind we own, and never denyed which thou malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſlanders us with the contrary, and he is revealed within us,

and that makes thee to rage; and all our Books which thou ſpeaks of, are according to the Scripturea of Truth, and to Chriſts and the Apoſtles Doctrine; but thy principles are according to the old errors thou ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>But thou ſaiſt thou haſt done with our Principles, thou needs not enlarge upon our Hay, Wood, and Stubble, being aſſured the removing of our Foundation, which thou ſaiſt thou haſt done, will bring down our whole building.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We are Gods building, 1 Cor. 3. And we have a building of God, Epheſ. 2, and Chriſt is our Foundation, which remains and ſtands ſure, 2 Tim.

Zach. 8. 12. Eph. 2. 2. Tim. 2. And as for hay, wood, and ſtuble, it is thy own, and will be burnt up, who has denyed Chriſt the Light, the foundation; and called him a natural, and created Light, and Idol; but thy foundation and building is down together, it's hard to know where it ſtood; And where are all your Builders and Daubers; and now after all thy ſlanders and raylings, thou wouldſt make people believe thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt our perſons, And when thou haſt uttered all thy lyes and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, thou in hypocriſie and feigned humility, would make people believe thou pittieſt us; But we know what thy pitty is; But we are come to the true Jeſus, who takes pity of our ſouls; though thou long deceived many of us; I believe that few people would hardly have believed that there had been ſo much poiſon &amp; venom in thee, &amp; thou haſt denyed Chriſt, the Light, the way, truth &amp; life, &amp; calls him natural and created, and ſo art in the error thou ſpeaks of, and thy bowels is the belly of Hell, <hi>Jonah.</hi> 2.

            <p>And if thou hadſt written fewer errors, it had been better for thee; but praiſed be the Lord God, thy deeds are brought to light and this is a poor ſhift for thee to come off ſo, after thou haſt laid down thy aſſertions and cannot maintain them, nor canſt not make them good; for our queſtions was learned queſtions and tended not to ſtrife, and yet ſtands on thy head unanſwered; and thou and all which thou haſt declared, hath been againſt God and Chriſt, ſo that thou art one that bears falſe witneſs againſt him, not for him: And thou haſt manifeſted the error of thy judgment, for thy underſtanding is error, <hi>Pſal. 19.

               </gap>ail ſo. Alſs, for anſwering thy book it did not ſo much concern <hi>G. F.</hi> but many particulars which were ſome of them 60 miles one off another; and thy book which we had with much adoe from you, which ye were afraid ſhould have come to the light, it was ſuch a work of darkneſſe; and it was but a few dayes time in our hands, which they were not likely to anſwer it in ſo ſhort a time, beſides called on of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be taken from us, it was an uncertain thing for us to come to anſwer it, or go about that work, but at laſt we were fain to take it in pieces, and get it Copyed over in pieces, there was ſuch haſte with you, and this ſhews you were afraid to have it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; whereof <hi>John Wigans</hi> Wife, and ſome of his miſ-led people, made a boaſt as though we could not anſwer it, before we could have it, which he hath ſmall reaſon for, as they that reads it in meckneſſe ſees his folly, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. And that which we writ was true to thy condition, thou haſt proved it. And whereas thou art grieved becauſe the Goalers and Priſoners ſhould ſee thy fruits laid open, becauſe we ſent Letters to them to give unto thee, when thou thy ſelf would not take them of us; and we did not ſend for our Letters again, as thou didſt thy Book, or ſome through thy means; not being afraid who ſee them or read them. And herein thou condemns thy ſelf, for thou directed thy book to the Goaler, and ſent it into the Towne before it came to us; ſo in this thou haſt judged thy ſelf, for thou didſt not ſo much as direct that a Copy of it ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to us, and ſo thou renders thy ſelf both obnoxious and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in thy Book and practice. And what thou haſt been is known, and there is things yet to be manifeſt, which is a ſhame to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and ſo thou haſt thy ſelf begotten in many men a true opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that thou art a hainous offender, in ſpeaking ſuch words, and writing ſuch things againſt Chriſt the Light. And we know
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:108232:45"/>
none that hath ſent thee any Letters ſealed, but there hath been a name ſubſcribed to them. And as for ſcorning, jearing, and frothy expreſſions, that's thy own condition <hi>John,</hi> and not ours; and why didſt thou not put thoſe letters (ſent without names) into thy book, that the wiſe Reader might have ſeen them (if there were ſuch) and have judged of them.</p>
            <p>And as for me <hi>Thomas Curwen,</hi> who ſent ſeveral papers to thee, being burthened with thy wickedneſſe, who had publiſhed thy lies abroad in the Name of the Lord, and waſt aſhamed and afraid that we ſhould have them, though thou promiſed often we ſhould have them in words, and now that we have it, it muſt but be a fortnight, being a ſhort time for them who are above 60. miles from one another: and thou haſt done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly in that thou haſt not put down my whole letters, and the occaſion of them, for there is no wiſe man will judge but that there was ſome reaſon why I ſhould ſend ſuch words to thee: And did not froth, and rage, and fury appear in thee, when thou laid violent hands on me, and pull'd my coat like to tare it off my back? and canſt thou lift ſuch unholy hands and fiſts of wickedneſſe unto the Lord in prayer? and will God accept thy ſacrifice which is like <hi>Cains?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when I did peruſe thy book, I found it did not prove thy aſſertion, <hi>viz. That Chriſt the light is not ſaving:</hi> It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is but as Chaff and dirt; and thou perverts, and wreſts, &amp; adds to many Scriptures, ſeemingly to prove thy aſſertion good, which thou couldſt not, for which, I ſay, the plagues of God ſhall be added unto thee, according to the Scriptures, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. To which <hi>John Wigan,</hi> in his wonted fury and rage ſaid, <hi>The plagues of God was upon me, and we all ſpake from the ſpirit of the Devil.</hi> yet this man before his companions would ſeem to be humble, and a meek man, through his feigned words would ſeem to Juſtifie himſelf.</p>
            <p>And for thy ſawcy language, and ill-bred behaviour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerlineſſe, if thou had put all my letter down, the Reader might have ſeen why I charge thoſe things upon thee. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had good ground to ſpeak theſe words through all thy words and carriages towards me, and alſo thy abuſive and ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous, and ſawcy expreſſions to my Eſteemed friend in the truth,

               <hi>M. F.</hi> which if thou hadſt had either civility, or the reaſon of a man, or any regard to virtue, thou would have been aſhamed to utter or have written ſuch things as thou didſt; but thou haſt abuſed her letters as thou haſt done mine, and taken that which thou thinks may be for thy advantage, and wreſts our words as thou haſt done the Scriptures, and left out that in our letters which was the cauſe we ſpoke thoſe things unto thee, and plainly ſhew the cauſe, which if any deſire to know the cauſe, we have them to ſhew, for if we ſhould put them in our book they would make it too great a volume, too great, together with thy ſlanderous letters, and that thou ſhould vomit ſo many ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in thy book, which thou would not let us have but only a few dayes, and then thou glories and boaſts, in which time thou knew we could not anſwer them, the particulars concerned in it being ſo far diſtant one from another.</p>
            <p>And <hi>John,</hi> if <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> Husbandman, which is a better Calling then thy Trade, who hath often been moved of the Lord to write to thee, is able to indict letters, having been often bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with thy hypocriſie and vain deceit, and fleſhly perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which thou haſt charged falſely upon me in a letter. And here thou publiſhes that which thou knows not, ſlandering us both with that which thou art ignorant of, not knowing but another might do it, and ſo haſt publiſhed thy ignorance. Doſt thou think this will ſtand amongſt wiſe men? And thou haſt ſaid thou will never learn in my Maſters School, which is Chriſt the Light, nor come to the Law which is the Schoolmaſter until Chriſt, which thou art ignorant of both. And within all this time thou might have anſwered my Queries, if thou had been in the meekneſſe, but it is manifeſt thou art choaked with evil, and envy, and poſſeſt with a bitter ſpirit, that thou haſt not pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do good.</p>
            <p>And as for thy dreaming, it is manifeſt if thou hadſt been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, thou would have anſwered my. Queries, and cleared thy aſſertion, and convict me if I had oppoſed my ſelf; but thou haſt denyed this office and work, and in ſtead of giving ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction herein, thou haſt publiſhed thy own ſhame. I would not have thee to envy me ſo much, for the good I have to thee, for which of thoſe things doſt thou thus deal with me? Is it not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:108232:46"/>
becauſe I have told thee the truth? for which of thoſe good deeds doſt thou rail of me ſo faſt? Was it not a good deed, to tell thee thou was a Deceiver, knowirg thee to be ſo? for now thy fruits makes thee manifeſt to be a deceiver, and whom thou haſt deceived, 2 <hi>Pet. 2. Mat.</hi> 7. 24. And whereas thou haſt pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a few lines out of <hi>James Parkes</hi> private letter ſent unto thee, whom thou ſeems to pretend love to, and now publiſhes them, and this was thy love; was it not time for me to forſake thee, being long deceived by thee, and has known thy Principles and thee long, and thy feigned love: but ſhould thou not have put all my letter down, that the Reader might have ſeen it, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with thy words, which was the occaſion of it: and the words which thou ſlanderouſly ſpoke in ſecret, but thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf, that thy ſolly may appear, which cannot abide plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but my letter is true to thy condition, and thou wilt find it ſo. And I tell thee it was a fraudulous part of thee to publiſh a part of my letter, and not all, or other Friends letters either, and far off the truth, and below a wiſe man, but it is well that thou haſt publiſhed ſo much as thou haſt done, that people may read thy book, and ſee the words come true upon thee.</p>

               <p>Again in thy ſecond letter to me thou haſt ſent writ theſe words; <hi>its likely thou haſt never been ſo plainly told that thou ſets up an idol,</hi> if thou call the light that <hi>is in every man that comes into the world, Chriſt the Redeemer, and if thou worſhips that light as the Redeemer, that thou art an Idolater:</hi> It ſeems by theſe words, that thou haſt writ theſe words in thy former letter, which I ſent back with the anſwer, and ſo hath not the words there written here to produce, but here is enough and ſufficient to manifeſt thee an abſolute blaſphemer againſt Chriſt and the holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Light of Chriſt Jeſus which we bear witneſſe of, which hath lighted every man thats come into the world, is the ſame light which <hi>John</hi> bore witneſſe <note place="margin">

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:108232:47"/>
after this child was born, his fathers mouth was opened in praiſes unto the Lord, being dumb ſince the Angel ſpoke to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not fully believe, and his father <hi>Zacharias</hi> was filled with the holy Ghoſt, and propheſied of Chriſt ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath viſited and redeemed his people,</hi> and ſo to the end of the Chapter, as you may read, <hi>ver.</hi> 76. and <hi>the child ſhall be called the Prophet of the highest</hi> [to wit Chriſt] and <hi>thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his waies to give knowledg of ſalvation unto his people, by the Remiſſion of their ſins;</hi> and Chriſt himſelf bore witneſſe of <hi>John,</hi> Mat. 11. and ſaid, <hi>he was more than a Prophet,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>of all that were born of women, there was not a greater then</hi> John, and ſaid he was <hi>a burning and ſhining light,</hi> as you may read. For this is he of whom it is written, <hi>Behold I ſend my meſſenger before thy face, which ſhall prepare thy way before thee,</hi> ver. 10. and if ye will receive it, this is the <hi>Elias</hi> which was for to come; for all the Prophets and the Law prophecyed until <hi>John, He that hath an ear to hear let him hear,</hi> ver. 13, 14, 15. and the Apoſtle bore witneſſe of <hi>Iohn,</hi> and ſaid, as John <hi>fulfilled his courſe</hi> Acts 13. he ſaid, <hi>Whom think ye that I am, I am not he, but there cometh one after me, the ſhoes of whoſe feet</hi> I <hi>am not worthy to looſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus far we have proved unto you what <hi>Iohn</hi> was, that he was ſent of God to bear witneſſe of Chriſt by theſe Scriptures, with many more which might be inſtanced concerning <hi>John.</hi> Now we ſhall go to <hi>Johns</hi> teſtimony, and witneſſe which he bore of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>John 1. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the ſame was in the beginning with God; All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made, in him was life, and this life was the light of men.</hi> This is he which <hi>John</hi> bore witneſſe of, this ſame <hi>John</hi> came for a witneſſe to bear witneſſe of this Light, that all men through him might believe, as you may ſee proved by all the foregoing prophecies of him; he ſaid, <hi>He was not the light, but was ſent to bear witneſſe of the light that was the true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi> This is the light and no other which we witneſſe, and bear teſtimony of, which <hi>John Wigan</hi> ſaith is an idol; <hi>He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not, but as many as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:108232:48"/>
received him, to them he gave power to become the ſons of God,</hi> even to them that believed on his name, not to ſuch unbelievers as <hi>John Wigan,</hi> who denies him, which was born <hi>not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God;</hi> This <hi>John Wigan</hi> calls an idol. <hi>And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory, as of the only begotten ſon of God, full of grace and truth; John</hi> bore witneſſe of him, and cryed, ſaying, <hi>This is he of whom I ſpoke, he that cometh after me, who is preferred before me,</hi> ver. 15.</p>
               <p>Now here the reader may ſee <hi>J.

They asked him, why baptizeſt thou then? and <hi>John</hi> anſwered, ſaying, I baptize with water, but there ſtandeth one among you, whom ye know not, he it is, who coming after me, is preferred before me, &amp;c. <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. ver. 26. 27. Here <hi>John</hi> beares witneſs of him, according to the propheſies; the next day <hi>John</hi> ſeeth Jeſus coming unto him, and ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God which taketh away the ſin of the world.</hi> This is he of whom I ſaid, after me cometh a man which is preferred before me, for he was before me, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. 30. This is he whom we worſhip as our redeemer, whom <hi>J. W.</hi> ſaith, to worſhip is to ſet up a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Idolatry then that of <hi>Jeroboams,</hi> and of the Papiſts, and <hi>John</hi> ſaith further, that he ſhould be made manifeſt to Iſrael, therefore am I come baptizing with water, and <hi>John</hi> bore record, ſaying, <hi>I ſaw the Spirit deſcending from Heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him, and I knew him not, but he that ſent me to baptize with water, the ſame ſaid unto me, upon whom thou ſhalt ſee the ſpirit deſcending and remaining on him, the ſame is he that baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And I ſaw and bare record that this is the Son of God; and this is he whom <hi>J. W.</hi> ſaith, whoſo worſhips, worſhips an Idol. And the next day <hi>John</hi> ſaw Jeſus walking, and looking upon him ſaid <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:108232:48"/>
the Lamb of God;</hi> and ſo this is a part of <hi>Johns</hi> Record and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which he hath borne of the Son of God, the light of the world that hath lighted every man that cometh into the world; with ſeverall more, as the ſcripture will teſtifie, who Baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt; and this is he which <hi>J. W. deſires</hi> the people with whom he has to do, and all others with fear and trembling to conſider how injurious this opinion is, and how pernicious and deſtructive ſuch a ſandy Foundation will prove to pretious ſoules; for admit this Grand lye for the corner ſtone, and the whole ſuperſtructure will conſiſt of lyes, ſaith he, and open this as the firſt door of entrance (as they do) and it leads into a <hi>Babel</hi> of Confuſion and Errors; no ſooner is a man entred in at this deadly gate, but he is in the City <hi>Tohu,</hi> where firſt, if his eyes be anointed with eye ſalve by the true Jeſus, he may behold this Image of Iealouſie (the Light that is in every man that comes into the World.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Here I deſire the reader but ſoberly, and ſeriouſly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of this mans doctrine, and compare it with the foregoing proofes, with what ſhall be hereafter, and let him Judg whether it be not as abſolute blaſphemie as a man can ſpeak, and that according to the full proofe of the ſcriptures, for Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. 12. where Jeſus ſaith, <hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not abide in darkneſſe, but have the Light of life.</hi> And again, in <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. Jeſus cryed, and ſaith, he that believeth on me, believes not on me, but on him that ſent me, &amp; he that ſeeth me, ſeeth him that ſent me. 45. I am come a light into the world, that whoſoever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eleeveth in me ſhall not abide in darkneſs, 46. and in the 36. while ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be children of the light. Theſe words ſpake Jeſus, who Baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt, which <hi>J. W,</hi> ſaith, If this lye for the corner ſtone, all the Superſtructure will conſiſt of lyes. If any man walk in the day, he ſtumbleth not becauſe he ſeeth the light of the world <hi>Jo.</hi> 11. 9.</p>
               <p>Now I deſire the reader will ſeriouſly conſider, whether <hi>J. W.</hi> be not highly guilty of Blaſphemy, and one with thoſe Phariſees who was grieved when Chriſt wrought miracles, and caſt out Devils, and turned and converted many unto God, when he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the ſtrong mans houſe, and bound the ſtrong man, and ſpoiled his goods, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. So <hi>J. W.</hi> is grieved that there ſhould
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:108232:49"/>
be ſo many turned unto God, and afraid for the time to come, loſt there ſhould be more, and therefore he ſtrikes at Chriſt Jeſus, the Light and Corner ſtone, which he calls a lie, as thoſe Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees did againſt Chriſt formerly; But Chriſts anſwer is, <hi>If I caſt out Devils by the power of God, then the Kingdome of God is come unto you; elſe how can one enter, &amp;c?</hi> which <hi>J. W.</hi> denies, that the Kingdome of God ſhould be come unto the Phariſees, or unto the world, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. blaſphemouſly againſt Chriſts own words. But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>all manner of blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the bluſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;</hi> which <hi>J. W.</hi> is guilty of, in his wicked blaſphemous words and writings, it is paſt my knowledge how often. And therefore Chriſts words are fully manifeſted upon him, who ſaith in the 32. <hi>verſe. Whoſoever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man, it ſhall be forgiven him, but whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the holy Ghoſt, it ſhall never be forgiven him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come,</hi> Mark 3. 28, 29. Luke 12. 10. This ſtands good upon <hi>J. W.</hi> for ever, if Chriſt be God who baptized with the holy Ghoſt, <hi>J. W.</hi> is a blaſphemer againſt him. And ſo I deſire the Reader to conſider without prejudice of what is proved, and furthermore whether he be not one with thoſe Jews that were filled with envy when they ſaw the multitudes, and ſpake againſt thoſe things that were ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> Contradicting and Blaſpheming, <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 45. And alſo one with <hi>Elimas</hi> the Sorcerer who withſtood <hi>Paul,</hi> and went about to turn the deputie from the faith. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And alſo one and the ſame with thoſe Jews whom <hi>Paul</hi> was preſſed in ſpirit to teſtify unto, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and when they oppoſed themſelves and Blaſphemed, he ſhook his garment and ſaid unto them, your blood be upon your own heads I am clean, &amp;c. <hi>Acts.</hi> 18. 5, 6. And alſo whether he be not one of thoſe which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, in <hi>Rom. 2. 21. Thou that teacheſt another, teacheſt thou not thy ſelf?</hi> Thou that preacheſt a man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal? And thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacriledge? for thou haſt Blaſphemed againſt the worthy name of God, the Light. <hi>Rom. 2. 2. Jam.</hi> 1. 7. And ſo now thou art proved ſuch a Blaſphemer that I am forced to compare thee to the beaſt ſpoken of in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> I am ſure thou art one that worſhips him, and gives thy power to him, for
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:108232:49"/>
thou haſt ſpoken great things and Blaſphemies againſt the Lord and his anoynted, the Light Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 6.</p>
               <p>And haſt opened thy mouth againſt God, to Blaſpheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. And ſo now thou art perfectly proved a Blaſphemer againſt God, and now thou mayſt ſee if thou can clear thy ſelfe of theſe things, or any that takes thy part againſt Chriſt the Light, who inlightens every man that comes into the world, which <hi>John</hi> bore witneſſe of, and thou haſt given thy power to the beaſt to make warre with the Saints.</p>
               <p>So now I am to prove thee to be a miniſter of darkneſſe, who hath affirmed, <hi>That the light in every man is not a ſaving light,</hi> which I have proved already is Chriſt Jeſus, which <hi>John</hi> bore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the true light <hi>that enlightens every man that comes into the world, and which is the ſaviour of all mankind,</hi> Tit. 3. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thou haſt aſſerted, <hi>That God has not given a meaſure of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to every man,</hi> contrary to the Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4, 7. who ſaith, <hi>The manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man to profit withal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thou goeſt about to make the light of Chriſt Jeſus, with which he has enlightened every man, a Created light, and a dim light, and a natural light; and ſpirit of a natural man. And here I ſhall prove thee an Idolater, and a graver up of an Image in thy dark divining, where thou art one with all the miniſters of Antichriſt, who ſtudies an Image in your brains, and the dark imaginations of your hearts; for though thou ſeems to be a ſeparated Prieſt, yet it is but in the ſenſual, and carnal, and deviliſh, not in the ſpirit of God, for thou crucifies that in thy dark deceitful heart, while thou art making and ſetting up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirit and light which thou calls natural, and not the light of Chriſt. And here thou art worſe then Surplice-men, or Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-men, for they will confeſs that the light in them which ſhews them ſin, is the light of Chriſt; and yet thou ſeems to confeſs that the light in every man is the Law written in the heart, and if ſo, the new Covenant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> All this heap of confuſion which thou haſt heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, doth but manifeſt thy darkneſs, and thou miniſters out of it, and art an enemy to the light of Chriſt, and ſo thou muſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:108232:50"/>
needs be a miniſter of darkneſs. Though thou haſt been a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter long, I ask thee this queſtion, Didſt thou ever preach the light of Chriſt to people, or didſt thou ever turn peoples minds to the light of Chriſt in their Conſciences, or didſt thou ever turn any from the power of Satan to the power of God? If thou haſt, ſet us out ſome of thy flock that they may be tryed? but there are a great deal that will ceſtifie againſt thee, that has been of thy flock, that is turned from thy darkneſs, to the light of Chriſt, which thou art an enemy to, and with it they ſee thy deceit and darkneſs, wherein thou didſt deceive them, and can praiſe the Lord for ever, that they are turned from thy dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>But now for the proof of thy falſe Doctrine.</p>
               <p>And 1. Is not the light which is in every man, the light of Chriſt that convinceth a man or woman of ſin and evil? and is there another Saviour beſides Chriſt that takes away the ſin of the world? And what was that Image of God in which <hi>Adam</hi> was Created? wilt thou not have Chriſt to be God? And thou ſayes, there remained a part in <hi>Adam</hi> after he had tranſgreſſed, which made him hide himſelf, but thou calls this the ſpirit of a natural man, and a created light. Is the light that is in man a created light? and is the law which is written in mans heart, and the ſpirit which is put in the inward parts, created? and was that Image of God which was in <hi>Adam</hi> a created Image? How was the <hi>Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Revel. 13. 8. Rev. 5. 12.</p>
               <p>But in plain words, Did God create any light in the beginning but what he ſet in the Firmament of Heaven? Is an inviſible light created, which ſees God which is inviſible? Its pitty to put theſe things to thy groſs darkneſs; but that for the Seed's ſake it may be ſerviceable to others. And doſt thou ſay, <hi>The Law of God that he writes in the heart, and his ſpirit which he puts in the inward parts, is this a created light?</hi> Oh the groſs darkneſſe that is in thee! How dare thou take upon thee to teach? Is not God Light? and is the Image of God in man a created light? and is that created and natural? and is not Chriſt light, and his ſpirit light, and is not the Law light, and is not the Law ſpiritual? and did not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay to the children of Iſrael, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 11, 12, 13,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:108232:50"/>
14, &amp; 15. <hi>For this commandement that I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off, &amp;c. but the Word is very nigh thee, in thy mouth and heart, to hear it, and to do it: See, I have ſet before thee life and death?</hi> Was this, that would have led them into life, natural and created? and is not this Law righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſpiritual, and juſt, and good? as the Apoſtle witneſſed of it, <hi>Act. 7. 5. 3. Rom.</hi> 7. 12. who ſaid, <hi>They received the Law by the diſpoſition of Angels, &amp;c.</hi> And did not Chriſt Jeſus ſay, <hi>He came not to deſtroy the Law, but to fulfil it; and that one jot or title of the Law ſhould not paſſe till it was all fulfilled?</hi> and is not Chriſt the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe? and is this the ſpirit of a natural man that knows not the things of God, that Chriſt is the end of?</p>
               <p>Art thou not in this a miniſter of darkneſſe, and an Idolater? And doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Rom. 7. 4. That they were become dead to the Law by the body of Chriſt:</hi> wherefore he ſaith, <hi>the Law is holy, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>J. W.</hi> Proved a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of darkneſs, and an Idolater.</note> 
                  <hi>the commandment holy, juſt, and good,</hi> ver. 12. But this dark Doctrine of thine, makes thee clearly manifeſt that thou art in the fleſh, and the motions of ſin works in thy members, which brings forth fruit unto death, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew the life of the Law yet, nor the life of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but art alive without the Law, and ſo art alive unto ſin and wickedneſſe, and knows it not, not having the Law to be thy Schoolmaſter, to correct thee for thy wickedneſſe, which would revive and ſet thy ſins before thee, that thereby thou wicked might die. But thou has not been at this School yet, for all thy learning and divining it has been all in the darkneſſe, thou has never come to the Law yet which is light, which is the ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter unto Chriſt. This thou ſits judge upon, and ſayes its ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a natural man, and ſo living without the law, is dead in thy ſins and darkneſſe, and ſo never knew what it is with thy mind to ſerve the law of God, as the Apoſtle did, he delighted in the law of God according to the inward man; but this is too mean for thee, this thou calls Created and Natural, and ſo lies drowned in darkneſſe, and ſin and wickedneſſe, thy mind and all thy members committing ſin, and drinks up iniquity as the Ox drinks up water. How ſhould thou do other, being thou
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:108232:51"/>
art an enemy both of Chriſt, and his Law, and his Light, and his Spirit? and what? art thou not a miniſter of darkneſſe in all this? and the Apoſtle who was obedient unto the law of God in his heart, and the ſpirit of God in his inward parts, by this he ſaw the body of death, which made him to cry out, &amp;c. But he alſo ſaw his Redeemer Chriſt Jeſus, for he was a miniſter of the light, and turned people from the darkneſſe to the light in them, and ſo could confeſſe then, the Law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus had made him free from the law of ſin and death. So the Apoſtle doth not make ſuch a ſeparation bet wixt the Law and Chriſt as thou doſt, who ſaiſt, <hi>it is natural and created;</hi> but this is but the Judgment of thy dark ſpirit, for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That God ſent his only begotten Son in the likeneſſe of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſſe of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 7. 8. <hi>God ſent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,</hi> Gal. 4. 4.</p>
               <p>I deſire the Reader to take notice of this mans darkneſſe and ignorance of this Light, and Law, and Spirit of God, and alſo of his Idolatry, who has made and framed another Image which he calls a <hi>Created light, and a natural light, and a dim light, and the ſpirit of a natural man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whether this Law and Spirit of God, which was given unto the children of Iſrael into their hearts be natural, and alſo hath been the guide and teacher of his people in all ages; for Chriſt himſelf ſaith unto the Jews, <hi>It is written in the law, you ſhall all be taught of God,</hi> and the prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> ſaid, <hi>That all the children of the Lord ſhould be taught of the Lord.</hi> And how ſhould they be taught, and be eſtabliſhed in righteouſneſs, but by the Light of righteouſneſs, the righteous Law of God written in their hearts? and this is none of <hi>J.

And ſo here the reader may read by what is here proved by plaine ſcripture. <hi>J. W.</hi> firſt to be a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of darkneſs by his denying the Light of Chriſt to be the law of God, the pure new covenant which he hath lighted every man with, and his law which is written in every heart ſince the new co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and alſo he may read him an Idolater in that he has made a
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:108232:51"/>
molten and graven Image, which he calls created and natural, and the ſpirit of a Man, which is neither Light of Chriſt, nor Law of God, nor new Covenant; and now <hi>I. W.</hi> thou haſt raced thy ſelf out, both from the knowledge of the Law, and the Law-giver: So thou art proved, by the plain Scriptures of Truth, (1) A Blaſphemer. (2) A Miniſter of Darkneſs. (3) An Idolater.</p>
               <p>(4) I am now to prove thee an Antichriſt, which was to come in the laſt time, which denyes Chriſt come in the fleſh.</p>
               <p>And that is to ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">(1) Thou goes about to prove, and has laid it down in thy Book, as though Chriſt which lighteth every Man that comes into the World, were not God and the new Covenant, or Covenant of God which was before the Foundation of the World.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Thou laies down, that Chriſt is not that Word and Light which <hi>John Beares</hi> witneſſe of, but ſaith, it is the word Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. And,</p>
               <p n="3">(3) Thou makes a difference between the Father and the Son, and ſo ſets up two Lights, and two Words, and ſo two Gods, except thou denyes Chriſt to be God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> And firſt in anſwer to that thou doſt oppoſe, which is, that Chriſt the Light is not Gods Covenant, was not the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, did not the Apoſtle ſay the ſame, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16. Now to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed was this promiſe made, he ſaith not unto Seeds, as of many, but as of one, unto thy Seed which is Chriſt, and this I ſay, that the Covenant that was confirmed before of God in Chriſt, &amp;c. here the Apoſte doth not ſay as thou doſt, that Chriſt is not Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Light, and alſo the Apoſtle ſaith that Chriſt hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us from under the Curſe of the Law, that the bleſſing of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might come on the Gentiles, here Chriſt brings the Gentiles into Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> but this is a myſtery thou never ſaw; and is he not the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi> in his Everlaſting Covenant Chriſt Jeſus: And is not the Covenant of the Lord with <hi>David</hi> &amp; his Seed for ever in Chriſt Jeſus? And hath not the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid in the 42. and 6. I the Lord have called thee in Righteouſneſs, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the people, and for a Light to the Gentiles, to open blind

eyes, and to bring out the Priſoners out of Priſon, and them that ſit in darkneſs out of the Priſon-houſe; who is this that ſhould do this, if it be not Chriſt Jeſus, whom wilt thou have it to be; and again, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8. It is a light thing that thou ſhould be my ſervant to raiſe up the Tribes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to reſtore again the preſerved of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> I will alſo give thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou mayeſt be my ſalvation to the ends of the Earth, who is this thinkeſt thou? this torments thee, this that reaches unto all the ends of the Earth; Light ſhining in all, this torments thy dark ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, thou makes accompt in thy Book this is a created Light as thou ſaiſt in thy Book, where thou quotes 2 <hi>Rom. verſ.</hi> 14, 15, 16. who hath the Law written in their hearts, which accuſes or excuſes them in the day when God ſhall judg the ſecrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt, according to my Goſpel: Let the Reader judge whether this be a natural created Light, which judges the ſecrets of Mens hearts by Jeſus Chriſt; Is not this Gods new Covenant of Light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which he has written in their hearts: and doth not the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſay in <hi>Hebr.</hi> 8. 6. ſpeaking of the old Covenant and Prieſthood, but now hath he obtained a more excellent Miniſtery, and by how much alſo he is the Mediator of a better Covenant, which is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed upon better promiſes, is not this Chriſt? for the <hi>Jews</hi> broke their Covenant and their Law that was written in Tables of Stone, which gendered to bondage, and there was then a Law added be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Tranſgreſſion, until the Seed Chriſt came, <hi>Gallat.</hi> 24. 25. yet the promiſe and Covenant that was made to <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus ſtands ſtill, and is the ſame, and cannot be diſanul'd, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal. 3. 19, 16, 17. Hebr.</hi> 8. 10. The Law that was added 430. years after the promiſe was made, could not diſanul it, for the Apoſtle ſaith, if the firſt Covenant had been faultleſs, then there had been no place found for the ſecond, and ſo this is the Covenant of God, writing his Law in their hearts, and puting his ſpirit in their inward parts, for the <hi>Jewes</hi> had outward Laws writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in Tables of Stone, which Laws they broke, but now Chriſt Jeſus the everlaſting Covenant of God, which is Light made unto <hi>Abraham</hi> never can be broken, but is an everlaſting Light in the hearts of his people, and an everlaſting Law written in their hearts, and an everlaſting Covenant of life and peace, and ſo brings all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unity and fellowſhip, for there is neither <hi>Jewes</hi> nor <hi>Greeke,</hi>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:108232:52"/>
there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for they are all one in Chriſt Jeſus, and if they be Chriſts, then they are <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and Heires according to the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 28, 29. And ſo here thou art proved thus far an Antichriſt, and a denyer of Chriſt Jeſus (the Light) to be Gods Covenant, who according to the fleſh is the Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Son of <hi>David, Rom.</hi> 1. 2, 3, 4. and according to the ſpirit the Son of God, <hi>Paul</hi> was made a Miniſter of that Goſpel which was promiſed.</p>
               <p>But theſe things is a myſtery to thee, and thou knows nothing of them but what thou knowes naturally as a bruit Beaſt, for thou cannot believe the Apoſtles Teſtimony that he gives in the 13. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> when he is ſpeaking of <hi>Saul, verſ.</hi> 22. and when he had removed him, to wit <hi>Saul,</hi> he raiſed up <hi>David</hi> to be their King, to whom he gave Teſtimony, &amp;c. Of this Mans Seed hath God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe raiſed, <hi>verſ.</hi> 25, unto <hi>Iſrael</hi> a Saviour <hi>Jeſus,</hi> when <hi>John</hi> had preached before his coming; and as <hi>John</hi> fulfilled his courſe, he ſaid, whom think ye that I am, &amp;c. Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and whoſoever among you that feareth God, to you is the word of this Salvation ſent, <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. So let the Reader read this portion of Scripture, and ſee whether Chriſt Jeſus be not Gods Covenant of Light, and Promiſe unto <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and unto <hi>David,</hi> and alſo whether this be not that which <hi>John</hi> bore Teſtimony of, and ſo now thou art ſufficiently proved thus far, not only a breaker of Gods Covenant and Promiſe unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed for ever, in whom the Apoſtle ſaith, all the promiſes of God are yea and in him <hi>Amen, 1 Cor.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>The next is, wherein thou has denyed Chriſt to be that word which <hi>John</hi> beares witneſs to, which was in the begining with God ſaying, the neglect of this diſtinction of the word Creator, and the word made fleſh, is the ground of the great miſtake of many, thou ſaiſt, <hi>who not conſidering what is teſtified of the Word as Creator, do confound that Light which is ſet up by him in every man, with that Light which he gives, as he is the word made fleſh, and ſo calls that Light ſaving, which is but natural, ſpringing up with him in his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, yea hence they call that Light Chriſt, which is but the Law written in the heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deſire the Reader to read over the 1ſt. of <hi>John,</hi> and ſeriouſly conſider what diſtinctions he findes made there from the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:108232:53"/>
word that was in the begining, and the word that's made fleſh, and the light that lightens every Man that's come into the World, and whether all theſe be not Chriſt, which <hi>John</hi> beares witneſſe of, and whether <hi>John</hi> and the Spirit of God, there have ſeparated them as the blackneſſe and darkneſſe in <hi>J. W.</hi> hath done; and let the Reader judge whether this Man be not poſſeſt with an Inchanting Spirit of Sorcery, and Witch-craft, and even as it were given up to work wickedneſſe to his own deſtruction, being filled with envy and malice againſt the Truth, which has overthrown his rotten and ſandy foundation, and cauſes him ſo to rage, that he even blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes againſt the God of Heaven, that he even dares to ſeparate the God-head, and would not have Chriſt Jeſus to be the true Light and Word of God, which was in the begining, in whom the fulneſſe of the God-head dwells, and that bodily, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 9. And ſo as thou haſt denyed Chriſt to be the Covenant of God, thou has alſo denyed him to be the Word of God, and alſo has denyed him to be the Light that lighteth every man that comes into the world, and ſo has denyed his God-head as he is a Saviour, by which all the Fathers were ſaved, and dyed in the faith of him, and the Patriarchs, and the Prophets that had his word in their hearts, and thou has denyed him to be the Light of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thou has denyed him to be the firſt fruits of them that ſleep, and the firſt begotten from the dead, and the firſt born of every Creature, thou has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his very life and ſubſtance, and the laying of his life down thou has denyed, for thou ſaid, <hi>he denyed faith to ſome,</hi> and one of thy Brethren ſaid, <hi>that his blood was not ſhed for all;</hi> and thus you ſpake deſpight againſt the ſpirit of Grace, and counts the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and ſo Chriſt is of little value to you, and you are not worthy of him, but for the Seeds ſake, and that people may not be blinded with thy wickedneſs and blindneſs, and darkneſs, and that people may come to an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Truth.</p>
               <p>I deſire the Reader ſeriouſly to conſider theſe following Proofes, that is to ſay, firſt of <hi>John, That Word which was in the beginning with God,</hi> by which all things was made and Created, which was before man was made or Created, and was glorified with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before the World began, whether this be not the word Chriſt the Saviour of mankind according to the Apoſtles words in the 1.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:108232:53"/>
of <hi>Heb. 2. ver. and ſo on, hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed heir of all things; by whom alſo he made the World, &amp;c.</hi> And whether this Son of God by which all things was made and Created, is not the Saviour and the Word in the beginning, and the Redeemer of all Mankind, and whether the Word which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke of to the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Deut.</hi> 30. 14. when he ſaid, <hi>The Word is very nigh thee, in thy heart &amp; mouth, that thou may do it;</hi> and ſaid then, <hi>he had ſet Life and Death before them;</hi> which the Apoſtle in the 10. of <hi>Hebrews</hi> bears teſtimony to, who ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believes:</hi> And when he rehearſes <hi>Moſes</hi> Words he ſaith, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, that is to bring Chriſt down from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep, that is to bring Chriſt up again from the Dead: But what ſaith it, the Word is nigh thee in thy mouth, and in thy heart; this is the word of Faith which we preach, that if thou ſhall confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe in thy heart that God has raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, that this Lord Jeſus is the Word, this is the Doctrine the Apoſtle preached the ſame Word in the heart, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; But, <hi>I. W.</hi> denies this Doctrine, and this Word, and this Jeſus, that is very nigh in the heart, that preaches Righteouſneſs, he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth him afar off, it vexeth him to hear of him nigh in his heart, for his heart is filled with hypocriſie and darkneſs, and Gods Word and Witneſs lyes ſlain in him; and ſo all his Preaching is of Chriſt without him crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but he knows him not, nor where he is, and ſo all his ſeparation is but in the darkneſs, talking of a Chriſt without him, and denying Gods Covenant of Light within, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8. and denying Chriſt the Word in the heart, which was that which the Apoſtle preached; and likewiſe the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, Acts. 10. 36. The Word which God ſent unto the Children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, preaching peace by Jeſus Chriſt, the Word I ſay you know, which was publiſhed throughout all Judea after the preaching of the Baptiſme of</hi> John, <hi>and hew God anointed Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c. verſ. 43. to him all the Prophets gave witneſs, and while</hi> Peter <hi>ſpoke theſe Words, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the Word.</hi> And what Word was this they heard when the Holy Ghoſt fell on them, was it not the word the Apoſtle preached Chriſt? Oh, thou enemy of God, how ſhould Chriſt be preached, if that word which the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:108232:54"/>
Apoſtles preached was not Chriſt, and were not they the Miniſters of the Goſpel and of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 18. But as God is true our word towards you was not yea, and nay, for the Son of God Jeſus Chriſt who was preached amongſt you by us, even by me, and</hi> Silvanus <hi>and Timotheus was not yea, and nay, but in him was yea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Apoſtle clearly manifeſts that the word which they Preached was the Son of God Chriſt Jeſus; and was not the word of Reconciliation which the Apoſtle preached, was not this Chriſt; doth he not ſay, <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given unto us the Miniſtry of Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them; and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation, and we are Embaſſadours for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead be ye reconciled unto God, for he hath made him to be ſin for us that knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This meſſage is a torment to <hi>J. W.</hi> he is none of thoſe Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, he carrieth no ſuch meſſage as this, this is contrary to his Doctrine, for he will not have God and Chriſt to be one, nor he will not have the World reconciled, for he ſaith, <hi>The Light that lightens them is not ſaving;</hi> and how can they be reconciled unto God, if they be not ſaved from their ſin? he makes account that Chriſts Blood is not ſhed for all; and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He is the Propitiation for the ſins of the whole World;</hi> But <hi>J. W.</hi> ſaith, that this Word is not Chriſt, and the Apoſtle did commend thoſe that he preached to, and committed them to the word of his Grace, which is able to build them up, and to give them an Inheritance among all them that are Sanctified.</p>
               <p>But for the Readers ſatisfaction, we ſhall prove ſomething out of the Old Teſtament; Did not <hi>Abraham ſee Chriſts day, and was glad, and believed, and it was counted to him for Righteouſneſs;</hi> was not this by Chriſt the <hi>Word,</hi> which was in the beginning with God, who ſaid, <hi>before Abraham was I am;</hi> did not <hi>Moſes</hi> write of him, as Chriſt ſaith, and ſaith, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things.</hi> Did not <hi>Moſes</hi> ſee this by the word that was in his heart, which he preached to them; and did not <hi>David</hi> Propheſie and ſaw Chriſt ſet up a King upon the Holy Hill of Zion,

and ſaid, <hi>he would declare the Decree of the Lord, the Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee, aske of me and I will give thee the Heathen for thy inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the Earth for thy poſſeſſion, Pſal.</hi> 2. But <hi>J.

               <p>And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when he ſpoke to the people, he told them their eares ſhould hear a word behind them, when they tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the right hand, or to the left, and their eyes ſhould ſee their Teacher, and he ſhould never more be removed into a corner, and who is this that is given for a Leader, and a Guider, and Teacher, is not this Chriſt that the Prophet calls to, when he ſaith, <hi>Ho, every one that thriſteth come and buy, &amp;c.</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>Incline thine ear and thy Soul ſhall live, and I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with thee, even the ſure mercies of David:</hi> Is not this in Chriſt, and is not this Call to every one that will come and incline their ear to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:108232:55"/>
the Light of Chriſt in their hearts and conſciences, and hearken to the word in their hearts, which is given for a leader and a teacher of all people; But, ſuch Miniſters of darkneſs as <hi>J. W.</hi> never di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to this teacher and ſo keeping them in darkneſs, keeps them in ſin, in wickedneſs, but the Lord is coming, and is come already, bleſſed be his name, to redeem, and has redeemed many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands out of their mouthes, and from under the tyranny of the oppreſſor which they have long kept poor people in, and <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 16. where <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thy word is myjoy, and the rejoycing of my heart.</hi> Was not this word Light in his heart, which is ſown for the Righteous, and joy for the upright in heart? And again, <hi>Ier. 20. 9. But his Word was in my heart as a burning fire, ſhut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not ſtay.</hi> And again, <hi>Ier. Is not my Word like a Fire, ſaith the Lord, and like a hammer that breaks the Rocks in pieces, Chap.</hi> 23. 29. Did not all theſe Prophets and Holy men of God ſpeak and propheſie with many more, which the Scripture makes mention of, from the Word of God in their hearts that was in the beginning; has thou not here denyed the <hi>Emanuel, God with us,</hi> that the Prophet <hi>Iſay</hi> teſtified of; and ſo has denyed Chriſt come in the Fleſh, whereby thou has clearly manifeſted thy ſelf to be an Antichriſt indeed, for thou haſt ſet thy ſelf to oppoſe Chriſt; for, Chriſt Jeſus himſelf when he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to the multitude, he ſaid, <hi>Mat. 13. 3. &amp;c. A Sower went out to ſow, and the Seed</hi> that he ſow'd <hi>was the Word of God,</hi> and the field that he ſow'd in <hi>was the World,</hi> and the ground that brought forth fruit to God <hi>was the honeſt and good heart.</hi> And he ſaith again, <hi>Ye are clean thorow the Word, &amp;c.

Who being the brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his perſon, and upholding all things by the word of his Power, when he had by himſelf purged our ſins, ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high, was not this Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, it may be, if he be of the Majeſty on high, he is not in the hearts of people then.</p>
               <p>Thy blindneſs, darkneſs, and ignorance of God looks ſo; But, the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> his Exhortation was, <hi>That as new born babes, they ſhould deſire the ſincere milk of the Word, that they might grow thereby.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> exhorted them, <hi>To receive with meekneſs
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:108232:55"/>
the ingrafted word which is able to ſave the Soules, Chap.</hi> 1. 21. And again, in <hi>Peter 1 epiſt. 2. 6. Behold I lay in Zion a chief Corner-ſtone, elect, &amp; pretious, and he that believeth on him ſhall not be confounded, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you therefore which believe, he is pretious, but unto them which be diſobedient, the Stone which the Builders diſallowed the ſame is made the head of the corner, and a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence, even to them that ſtumble at the word, being, diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were appointed, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>I. W.</hi> thou art this man, for thou has ſtumbled at the word, and art fallen, and ſhall never riſe again, this ſtone ſhall grind thee to powder; this is our Corner-ſtone, which thou ſayes, <hi>thou will confound;</hi> but, the Apoſtle ſayes, <hi>he that believeth in him</hi> (and we believe in him therefore) <hi>ſhall never be confounded;</hi> and ſo here thou will be found a lyer: And thou ſaith in thy Book, <hi>thou will remove our foundation, which is the light in every man;</hi> which is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved, that it is Chriſt Jeſus the foundation of all the Prophets and Apoſtles; and here thou ſtrives with that which is too ſtrong for thee, the weighty ſtone muſt needs fall upon thee. And in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. where <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted them <hi>to take heed to the more ſure word of propheſie, and to the light that ſhined in a dark place, and to the day-ſtar that would ariſe in their hearts;</hi> but thy dark preaching is contrary to that; and 1 <hi>Joh. 1. 1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have ſeen without eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, &amp;c.</hi> Let the ſerious Reader but read this Chapter, and ſee if by it he may not in his own underſtanding judge of the wickedneſs of this man, and alſo in the 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> where the Apoſtie ſaies, <hi>He writes no new Commandement unto you, but an old Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement which ye had from the beginning, the old Commandement is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>a new Commandement I write unto you, which thing is true in him, and in you, becauſe the darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth.</hi> Here the Apoſtle manifeſteth the word and the light to be one, in that he writes unto them in the word, and in the Light that now ſhines, glory be to the Lord for evermore, which the whole power of darkneſs hath long muſtered up and ſtood againſt; but <hi>he that is upon the white Horſe, who is called faithful and true, in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs he doth judge and make war, his eyes are as a flame of fire,

and upon his head many Crownes, he was cloathed in a veſture dipt in blood, and his name is called the Word of God, Rev.</hi> 20. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Now I have done with thee as concerning this head, and thou will find that this word will judge thee in the laſt day, who hath punctually denyed Chriſt Jeſus to be the Word of God, which is his name, ſo he ſtands upon thee thy condemner for ever, and ſo thereby thou art manifeſt to be the Antichriſt.</p>
               <p>So the next head that I am to manifeſt to the Reader, is, that thou makes a diſtinction of God and Chriſt, and through thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of Chriſt to be the Light that comes into the World, and thereby denies Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh, and thereby art the <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> for thou ſaith, <hi>that Chriſt is not the word and Light which John bears witneſs of,</hi> but ſaiſt, <hi>it is the word Creator;</hi> and ſo makes a difference betwixt the Father and the Son, and ſo art juſt in the <hi>Arrians</hi> Principle in dividing the Father and the Son, which brought in Hereſies of old into the Churches; and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto the <hi>Angels</hi> teſtimony unto <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>She ſhould bring forth a Son, and ſhall call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins;</hi> that it might be fulfilled which was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Prophet, ſaying, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall be with Child and bring forth a Son, they ſhall call his name Emanuel, which being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, is, God with us.</hi> And ſo contrary to this, thou would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Chriſt and God.</p>
               <p>So here thou haſt denyed Chriſt of his propriety in the Father, and haſt blaſphemed againſt the God-head, contrary to Chriſt his own words, who ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one;</hi> and ſo here thou has joyn'd with the <hi>Jewes</hi> in taking up ſtones to ſtone him with. And alſo, in the 8. of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the 16. ver. <hi>And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and my Father that ſent me.</hi> And again, in the 14. of <hi>Iohn</hi> and the 10. ver. <hi>Believes thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me the words that I ſpeak, I ſpeak not of my ſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me, doth the works; believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> And in the 2. verſ. before, <hi>Philip</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us, Ieſus ſaith unto him, haſt thou not known me</hi> Philip? <hi>he that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, <hi>Ioh. 17. 11. Keep them thorow thy own name, that they may be one as we are:</hi> And again verſe 21. <hi>That they may be all one
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:108232:56"/>
as thou O Father art in me, and I in thee, I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> And ſo thou that haſt divided the Son from his Father, and the Saints from them both; thou haſt committed Sacriledge indeed, who has denyed the great work of Salvation and Redemption of Mankind, which the Apoſtle ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired at, <hi>that God ſhould ſend his only begotten Son into the World, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> But this Chriſt thou has gain-ſaid, and reſiſted, and denyed, and ſo is never like to have benefit by him, but he will be thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for ever.</p>
               <p>And here thou haſt fulfilled old <hi>Simeons</hi> propheſie in the 2d. of <hi>Luke, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto whom it was revealed by the Holy Ghoſt that he ſhould not ſee death before be had ſeen the Lords Chriſt, who took him in his Armes and bleſſed God; and ſaid, Lord, now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace according to thy word, for mine eyes have ſeen thy Salvation which thou haſt prepared before the face of all people, a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and the Glory of thy people Iſrael; and behold, this Child is ſet for the fall and riſing of many in Iſrael, for a ſigne which ſhall be ſpoken againſt.</hi> And here thou art the man that has ſet thy ſelf againſt him, and is fallen, and ſo has denyed Chriſts coming in the fleſh, and alſo has denyed <hi>God being in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto himſelf;</hi> which the Apoſtle ſaid, 1 Tim. 3. 16. <hi>Was a great myſtery, God manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> And ſo thou that denies the Light of Chriſt, and his Spirit, which opens and reveales the myſtery, thou art not like but to be ignorant who has denyed Chriſt in his God-head, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5. 7. for the Apoſtleſaith, <hi>There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one;</hi> and this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord thou has denyed, for firſt thou has denyed Chriſt to be the Word; and ſecondly, thou has denyed Chriſt to be one with the Father; and ſo thou has denyed Chriſt to be God, except thou will have two Gods, for thou has created already two Lights, and two Words; thou will neither have <hi>Chriſt to be the Light of the World,</hi> nor thou will not have him <hi>to be the Word which was in the beginning with the Father;</hi> nor thou will not have him <hi>to be Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Light with Abraham and his Seed;</hi> and alſo, <hi>the promiſe of God unto Adam,</hi> where the Lord ſaid, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall bruiſe the Serpents head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:108232:57"/>
And now let the Reader judge whether thou be not a perfect <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> who hath denyed Chriſt come in the fleſh, both in his Light, wherewith he lightens all people that comes into the World. Secondly, he denies him <hi>to be the Word which was in the beginning, by which all things was made and created,</hi> which is the Word the Apoſtle directed people to <hi>in their hearts, Rom.</hi> 10. 45. Thirdly, He denies him <hi>to be come in the Covenant of God, which is light, by which he reconciles all things to himſelf, both of things in Heaven, and of things in Earth, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 10. And fourthly, thou has denyed him to <hi>be one with his Father;</hi> and ſo I believe here the Reader will confeſs that <hi>J. W.</hi> is perfectly proved an <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Joh. 4. 3. Every Spirit that confeſſeth not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh is not of God, and this is the ſpirit of Anti-chriſt, whereof you have heard ſhould come, and now is in the World.</hi> And again in the 2 Ep. of John and the 1. <hi>Many Deceivers are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the World, who confeſs not that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, this is a deceiver and an Antichriſt.</hi> And ſo as for <hi>I. VV.</hi> he doth not only not confeſs Chriſt, but hath denyed Chriſt to be come in the fleſh, as hath been manifeſtly proved, and ſo is he of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>VVhoſoever tranſgreſſeth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Chriſt hath not God, but he that abideth in the Doctrine of Chriſt hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> Here the Apoſtle joynes them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and puts them not aſunder, as <hi>I. VV.</hi> doth; And therefore, <hi>we are not to receive him into our Houſes, neither bid him God ſpeed,</hi> but deny him as he hath denyed Chriſt, and has proved himſelf an <hi>Antichriſt</hi> compleat.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou ſpeakes in thy Book, <hi>That multitudes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnared for want of dividing, or making diſtinctions between God and Chriſt, and brings the 2 of Peter 2. 2. many ſhall follow their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious wayes.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Let the Reader read the portion of Scripture; in his own judgment, and truth of his heart, let him judge whether this Scripture be not a true Character of thee, and thy Generation of Prieſts, or whether he can judge the <hi>Quakers</hi> to be ſuch a People as this Scripture holds forth, and by this he may judge the falſity of thy judgment, and thy envy and malice, which breaks forth in lying; The next words following are, <hi>Many ſhall follow their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious wayes, by reaſon of whom the way of truth is evil ſpoken of,</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:108232:57"/>
and through <hi>covetouſneſs ſhall they with feigned words make merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of you;</hi> who is this the <hi>Quakers,</hi> or it is <hi>I.

               </p>
               <p>Here thou art perfectly ſet forth, for I believe never any deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him more wickedly then thou haſt done, as is manifeſtly proved, and ſo art that falſe Prophet there ſpoken on. But again, verſe 15. <hi>They were ſuch as followed the way of</hi> Balaam, <hi>for the wages of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs,</hi> Art not thou one of theſe? Again there were ſuch <hi>as walked after the fleſh in the luſt of uncleanneſs,</hi> muſt not thou needs be he who denyes the Light that manifeſts ſin and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thorough the obedience of which they may be preſerved out of it; <hi>but they were to receive the reward of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and ſo wilt thou, <hi>who art reſerved unto the day of judgment to be puniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now thou being thus manifeſted and proved to be what is before mentioned, that the words in my Letters will fall of nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity upon thee, though thou have endeavoured to cover thy ſelf by thy ſetting my words in thy own frame, and thereby to make them ſeem as if they were railing Speeches, and ſpoken without ground.</p>
               <p>And 1.

               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Thou ſaiſt I ſaid, <hi>Thou art without God in the World,</hi> my words are thus, <hi>The Light in every one as it is obeyed, makes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from the World,</hi> which Light thou denyes, and ſo art <hi>without God in the VVorld, who is Light, and in him is no darkneſſe at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3ly.</hi> Thou ſaiſt I ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt manifeſted thy ſelf to be out of the firſt ſtep that leads to Chriſtianity, and art a Prieſt of Darkneſſe,</hi> Theſe words are true upon thee, <hi>for the Light Chriſt Jeſus, the VVord</hi> (which thou hath denyed) <hi>is the entrance into life, and Chriſt is the VVay, the Light, and the Truth, and the Dore,</hi> which thou haſt denyed, and ſo by Chriſts own words, <hi>thou art a Thief that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

               <p>And in my ſecond Letter thou ſaith 1. <hi>I ſaid thou begins with a lye, and ends with the Devil, and ſets</hi> J.

               <p>

               <p>

Thou art aſhamed of thy own words, and conceales them for theſe forementioned termes.</p>
               <p>Thou writ to me in thy Letter, when thou was drunk with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and takes mine in peeces, and perverts them, and belyes them, if thou had had any dram of honeſty, thou might have ſet ſome of thy own foule words down which thou writ to me, or at leaſt have ſet mine down in order as they were writ to thee, but to wreſt, and pervert, and lye for thy own ends and advantage, has been the Trade thou has followed all thy life time with the Scriptures.</p>

Goſpel then the Apoſtles did,</hi> this thou haſt left out, <hi>Thou art accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and no other portion can thou have, and this is Scripture and Truth to thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my third Letter thou ſaiſt I ſaid, <hi>Thou can do ſomething in writing a Book of thy own Dreames, and thy Imaginations and brain ſtudies, and telling of lyes, which thou hatcheth out of darkneſs, but thou art a meer ſot and Ignoramus, thy evil and unclean heart, thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious, darke, envious ſpirit, thy weakneſs, inability and ignorance in the things of God,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But my third Letter began thus, J.

               </p>
               <p>And again thou ſaith, <hi>I having told her, that if ſhe called the Light that is in every man that comes into the VVorld Chriſt, ſhe ſet up an Idol, and if ſhe worſhiped that Light as Chriſt, ſhe was an Idolater;</hi> She anſwered thus, <hi>I never heard ſuch words but from an</hi> Infidel, <hi>and an Idolater, and a Blaſphemer againſt God and Chriſt: Thou art an Enemy of God, thou art worſe then the</hi> Jewes, <hi>thou art a fit man to joyne with the</hi> Turk <hi>to ſet up</hi> Mahomet, <hi>oh thou</hi> Infidel, <hi>oh thou child of darkneſs.</hi>

               <p>My Anſwer to his was thus, <hi>I did never hear ſuch words but from an Infidel and a Blaſphemer againſt God and Chriſt; and I do not know that ever I heard any that ever owned the Scriptures to be true, that ever denyed ſo much of the truth there written, as thou haſt done, never take Chriſt Ieſus into thy mouth, who hath ſaid Himſelf he is the Light,

Thou enemy of God, thou art worſe then the</hi> Jews <hi>that denies he is come, thou art a fit man to joyne with the</hi> Turk <hi>to ſet up</hi> Mahomet; <hi>doſt thou think that Chriſt hath many ſuch enemies as thou in</hi> England? <hi>Oh thou Infidel! who wilt thou have for thy Redeemer, wilt thou not have him that is come a Light, who hath ſaid, while you have the Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Light, that you may become the Children of the Light; Oh thou child of darkneſs, what doſt thou believe in? where will thou appear when the Righteouſneſs of God is revealed in flames of fire upon the head of the wicked? then thou will know Revelation, which thou doſt not yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again thou ſaith, ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>She ſaith I am a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him againſt all ſuch Antichriſts, and deceivers, and blaſphemes, as thou art, thou art a Miniſter of the night, and of the darkneſs in the Apoſtacy, thou art a night Bird, the curſe and the judgments that's written therein, (ſpeaking of the Scriptures) Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtles hath pronounced it upon thee, thou art the man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Anſwer was, and is thus, where thou ſaith in thy Letter to me, <hi>If ever I was of good ſavour, I have loſt it by the abuſe of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt in thy Letter to me, <hi>I wreſt the Scriptures.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Anſwer was, and is, my Paper where it ſtands will teſtifie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee to be a lyer, where the plain Scripture is ſet down without any wreſting, and the curſe and judgment that is therein written, Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtle hath pronounced it upon thee, and thou art the man which is guilty of the ſame, which

they are pronounced againſt, and thou cannot hide thy ſelf from them, thou wilt be ſure to find them true upon thee one day, when thou cannot cover thy ſelf, as thou haſt endeavoured to cover thy nonſence with my name.</p>
               <p>And again thou ſaiſt, becauſe I asked this queſtion, thou asked me, <hi>what Pariſh Prieſt in</hi> England <hi>had got more money with his Tongue then</hi> George Fox <hi>had done ſince he was Journey-man Shoomaker in Mancheſter;</hi> and where thou ſaiſt, my Anſwer was, <hi>Thou art a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, proud, diſdainful ſpirit, a heatheniſh ſpirit which torments thee and many more ſuch night Owles as thou art.</hi>

               <p>Let the Reader judge whether thou be not a wicked lyer in theſe words thou haſt ſet down, and whether my Anſwer in my Letter was as thou haſt ſet them down, for in thy Letter to me, thy words ſtands thus, <hi>I think thou would not take it wel that thy friend</hi> G.

               <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>this is William Houldings Paper;</hi> thou ſpeaks falſly, for it was mine <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> and as for mine <hi>William Houldings</hi> Paper thou haſt not put it in thy Book, which ſpeaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>George Foxes</hi> Leather-Breeches, which thou having loſt Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, God and Chriſt, haſt made ſuch work about his Leather-Breeches, but <hi>G. F.</hi> likes them better then thy cloak of Hypocricy; and ſo its like thou was aſhamed to put my Letter in thy Book, or thy own Letter either, in which thou made ſuch work about them, now this is <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s Reply: I put thee in mind firſt, that <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> and I <hi>Henry Wood</hi> did write ſome Queries to thee, expecting to have them Anſwered by thee, which were the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Diſpute, as the record of the Diſpute will make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, and whereof there was no end made of the aſſertion which was put forth, has cauſed many Papers to paſs and repaſs, and according to my freedom I paſſed thy Paper upon this account, becauſe I had been an eye witneſs, and an ear witneſs of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings there, and of thy joyning with <hi>William Barret</hi> a <hi>Cheſhire</hi> man, and this was about nine years ago at <hi>Mancheſter</hi> at <hi>John Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docks</hi> Houſe in a Diſpute with our Friends; another time there was a Diſpute held at the ſame Houſe between thee and <hi>Richard Huberthorn,</hi> at that time thou made thy ſelf manifeſt, for thou broke into paſſion, and ſaid he was a publick perſon, ſo that thou was reproved by one of thy own Auditors <hi>Edward Gaythorn</hi> by name, but not withſtanding, thou roſe up and went away, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe words, That if thou had known that ſo many would
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:108232:65"/>
have been preſent, thou would not have been there that time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thou had ſaid before that thou was a publick perſon; I knowing theſe proceedings gave forth this Paper that the Reader may know the ground wherefore I thus write; becauſe, I had known thee thus long to oppoſe Chriſt the Light, therefore thoſe Queries ſent by old <hi>Henry Wood</hi> and <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> were as Pills to thee ſent for this end, that they might work out that old leaven of bitterneſs which I have known lying ſo long within thee, as I have made mention of before, and this I may ſay, truly was done in love to thy Soul; now this not being ſo taken, it cauſed thee to ſpew out theſe words, and to be ſo large in writing againſt Friends and the truth, and for the reaſon of calling them dogs the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are very plain, for they were called <hi>greedy dumb dogs who ſought for gain from their quarter;</hi> and yet there was many to lick up their vomit; likewiſe, they were called <hi>Dogs which were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> as thou may read in the <hi>Revelations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for thy Challenge to us we were willing to meet thee, but thou was not willing to meet us, although thon before challenged to meet <hi>G. F.</hi> or any of his friends; what is the cauſe, doſt thou not condeſcend to men of low degree, for if I meet thee it is not with hoaſting my ſelf in other mens lines made ready to my hand, but in the name and power of the Lord, in the Light of his Son Chriſt; for this I ſay unto thee, if thou had not uſed deceit thou would have written down my whole Paper, but I ſhall cauſe it to be written down my ſelf that all may ſee it; and do not charge <hi>George Fox</hi> with it; and ſince thou haſt given a ſecond Challenge, but haſt not anſwered the firſt, which we did call on thee to do, and to make good thy aſſertions, but thou ſhuffles off from it, and names <hi>G. Fox,</hi> and flees from us, and will make it good to neither, the Paper is as follows, we deſire thee with patience to read it over.</p>
               <p>Oh friend <hi>John Wiggan</hi> it ſeems old <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s and <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi>'s Pills which they gave thee to work out that old Leaven that hath layn ſo long within thee, but this hath wrought of the contrary part, and hath cauſed thee to vomit and ſpew out upon a piece of Paper, and ſent forth for the Dogs to lick up, and they being eager doth take ſo much of this thy filthy ſpewing that it cauſeth them to vomit as thou doſt; therefore it was high time
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:108232:65"/>
to call for it that no more be made ſick with it; thou haſt uſed ſo many friends names in it, that by the reaſon that it was taken away ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly that they cannot reply unto it; thou ſaith, thou haſt anſwered <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s Queries, but it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that they remain unanſwered; and likewiſe thou put down 24. Queries of <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi>'s unanſwered, therefore <hi>Henry Wood</hi> and <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> will meet thee to anſwer thy Challenge which thou hath put forth, and ſaith, thou would be anſwered before the <hi>High Sheriffe,</hi> for we are not careful to anſwer thee in this matter, although thou uſeth the name of Chriſt, thou doth not depart from iniquity as it doth appear by thy ſmiting at the Corner-ſtone, which is the Light; thou art far behind the woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> for ſhe ſaid, <hi>is not this the Chriſt that hath ſhewed me all that ever I did?</hi> it appears to me that thou eſteems this at a low value, which ſhewes thee all things that ever thou did, and calls it Natural, although it teſtifie againſt thoſe things that are natural and carnal, where thou art worſhipping the God of the World, which blinds the eye of the children of diſobedience, the vaile of darkneſs is ſo thick that thou cannot ſee thorow it, nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Light, that giveth the <hi>Light of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> which ſhineth in the heart: And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>thy aſſertion is made good;</hi> it appears to all that are wiſe that it is not made good at all; for thou hath challenged another Meeting, ſo appoint the place and time, and <hi>Thomas Curwen,</hi> and <hi>Henry Wood,</hi> and <hi>William Houlding,</hi> or any of them will meet thee, and hear what thou can ſay againſt Chriſt the ſaving Light.</p>
               <p>Now whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>not a word in all thoſe Papers diſcovers the unſoundneſs of thy Aſſertion.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou ſhould have publiſhed the Papers to the Readers, and then they might have judged of it, whether thou haſt ſpoken truth or no, but thou art afraid to publiſh that which makes againſt thee, but takes here a word, and there a word, thinking thereby to villifie friends, but they are made manifeſt in the hearts of people, and all thy ſlanders nor any thing thou canſt do will hurt any of us, for was there a worſe word ſpoken to thee, which was ſpoken in the truth, then thou thy ſelf did ſpeak to me and other friends faiſly and unjuſtly, and why didſt thou not publiſh in thy Book thoſe four ſheets of Paper that the Reader might have ſeen them,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:108232:66"/>
and our expreſſions in our Letters; had they been light, vain, and frivilous, thou would have made advantage upon them and not have hid them, but have publiſhed them in thy Book, as thou haſt done ſome few lines of them, but they are true unto thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and will ſtand on thy head, and it doth become Saints to bear teſtimony againſt deceit, and there is much in thy Papers that contradicts thy Aſſertion, and my Paper was true and overthrew it which thou publiſht a few lines of; and then tells the Reader of four ſheets, and never a word to diſcover thy aſſertion, and thus thou loves thy deeds of darkneſs and hates the Light, and thus <hi>thy folly is made manifeſt to all men, 2 Tim.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>thou haſt not publiſhed this abroad, but we have done it firſt;</hi> which is falſe, for we did publiſh nothing in the Town, for the Letter which I gave to the Jaylor thou hadſt, but I did not ſend it into the Town, but gave it to <hi>Thomas Hardy,</hi> but thou ſent thine into the Town, and abroad, and was not ſo honeſt as to give us a Coppy of it; and thy aſſertion was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by plain Scripture, but was never proved by plain Scripture; but is thy chaffie imaginations, and wreſting the Scriptures, which is nothing but ſpewing from a child of darkneſs, <hi>which hates the Light, Joh. 3. Rev.</hi> and hath not God ſpewed thee and thy Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Worſhip out of his mouth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18. 28.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou ſpeaks, <hi>how we curſed thee with the plagues of God;</hi> the Scripture ſaith, the plagues of God is to thee who adds to the Scripture, as thou haſt done; and it was thou that ſaid, the plagues of God was upon me, but thy curſes are cauſleſs; ſo what we have writ and ſpoken to thee it was from the Spirit of God, and the Lord hath judged between thee and us in this matter, and his judgment is clear, and thy <hi>hidden things of darkneſs is come to Light, 1 Cor.</hi> 4. and there is no <hi>Communion between Light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. and <hi>the miſt of darkneſs is over thee, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath blinded thy eyes, <hi>Joh. 2.

               <p>Whereas thou ſaiſt, <hi>Had it not been a more eaſie and commendable work in one ſheet plainly to have diſcovered and refuted error, (if any ſuch be in my Writings) then to have filled 3. or 4. ſheets with ſuch ſtuffe as this, ſurely a right ſpirit would have lead them this way.</hi>
               </p>

Letters ſent to thee by many perſons, ſo as I ſaid before thou ſhouldſt have publiſhed the whole Letters, not part of them, and let them have ſpoken themſelves to the Reader, and thy errors are ſufficiently manifeſt in thy Book, and thou would have a ſheet of Paper written to thy Book five ſheets, in a few dayes time, which concerns ſeveral friends 60. miles diſtance one from another, this was <hi>Jahn Wiggan</hi>'s policy and his peoples, to get the Book again, and to boaſt that it could not be anſwered.</p>
               <p>And thy next words, concerning <hi>Antichriſts fair ſpeeches and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements, while there is hope to make merchandize of them;</hi> is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thy own condition, for now thou being ſtirred up and oppoſed, rages, who did appear to ignorant people like a Lamb, but thou was known to us before, for now thou art loud and clamorous, and falſly accuſing when thou canſt not get thy will about, like to the Whore in <hi>Proverbs</hi> 7. and <hi>Joſephs</hi> Miſtreſs, <hi>Geneſis</hi> 39. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>And whereas, thou ſpeaks of <hi>owning Preachers not ſent, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes the Lord that bought them, and preaches not the ſame Jeſus, and Goſpel as Paul did, ſuch thou ſaiſt thou ownes not, but denies.</hi>

ſpirit of God within them to thy own way, but God hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown, and is overthrowing thy pernitious wayes, and many who have been followers of thee, now comes to follow the Lord; and that makes thee thus to rage, <hi>Mathew 24. 5. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. and our way is Chriſt, and he is our guift of God.</p>
               <p>And after this thou ſends 12. Queries abroad, and thou thy ſelf couldſt not anſwer my Queries, nor <hi>Henry Wood</hi>'s; is this the part of a man of Wiſdom, or Reaſon?

               <p>1 Query. <hi>Whether it can be found in all the Scriptures that any of the true Prophets, or Chriſt, or his Apoſtles ever uſed ſuch language as is before mentioned in any perſon profeſſing Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; or whether it be not clearly the ſpirit of an Antichriſtian ſpirit, as hath been hinted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thou that has denyed Chriſt Jeſus to be the Light of the World, and calls him an <hi>Idol,</hi> and hath denyed Chriſt the Light to be ſaving, contrary to the Scriptures, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 38. thou haſt deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, for thou haſt denyed that which thou ſhould believe in; and therefore thy words bears the mark of Antichriſt, 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 18, 22. Joh. 4. 3. Joh.</hi> 2. 7. And what we ſpeak of thee is true upon thee, and the Apoſtle uſed ſuch language to ſuch like, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 10. where the Apoſtle called <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas an enemy of all Righteouſneſs, a child of the Devil,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the <hi>Deputy</hi> from the right way of God, as thou doſt people: And read <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and there ſee what words the Apoſtle gives to <hi>evil beaſts and ſlow bellies, Titus</hi> 2. 1.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Query. Whether there can be any other gain in the aforeſaid cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, then to caſt an odioum upon, and to cauſe a diſeſteem of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons oppoſing them, and whether this was not the practice of the falſe Prophets and falſe Apoſtles, thereby to gain more credit to their own cauſe.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is thy own condition, for what gain is it, by all thy former ſlanderous words which thou caſt both upon Chriſt and us, that Chriſt ſhould not be believed in, and that we ſhould be of diſeſteem among people, that holds truth forth to all people that they might believe in him who enlightens them; and this was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:108232:67"/>
the work of the falſe Prophets and falſe Apoſtles, to diſeſteem of Chriſt and the Apoſtles, that people ſhould not believe in him, nor receive their Doctrine; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 12, 13. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and did they not ſay, Chriſt deceived the people, read <hi>Mathew;</hi> and did they not ſay, <hi>Jeremy</hi> deceived the people; but the falſe Prophets and falſe Apoſtles could get the true Chriſts, Prophets and Apoſtles words, but was out of the life, and not being in the ſpirit, the true Apoſtles alwayes judged them, as thou art now, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. and <hi>Jude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi>Query. Whether it be not a manifeſt abuſe of the Scriptures, and a preſumptuous introduction into the office of Chriſt, poſitively to affirme that the ſins of any man ſhall never be forgiven in this World, nor in that which is to come, meerly becauſe he denyed the Light that is in every man that comes into the World to be ſaving, in as much as the Scripture no where ſaith thus, that the Light is ſaving.</hi>

And ſo none that feares God can bid thee God ſpeed in thy evil work, therefore thou art offended, and we ſhall not be partakers with thee of thy evil deeds, for no other Chriſt do we own but he <hi>who dyed at Jeruſalem,</hi> above ſixteen hundred years ſince, who ſits at the right hand of God, and is revealed in us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promiſe, who ſaith <hi>I will come and dwell in you,</hi> as in <hi>Joh.</hi> and the <hi>Cor. 1.

               <p>And as for giving ſatisfaction thou art not likely, who denyes <hi>the Light Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and any who reads thy confuſed Book may ſee there is no ſatisfaction given in it, though thou haſt perverted many Scriptures; and as for thy further debate, upon thy aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we tould thee we were ready, and tell thee ſo now again, who haſt challenged us twice in this thy Book to meet us before the <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,</hi> which thou might have ſpared this Challenge in thy <hi>Appendix;</hi> for we had given thee an Anſwer before; we would meet thee; to wit, <hi>Thomas Curwen</hi> Husbandman, <hi>William Houlding</hi> Blackſmith, <hi>William Wilſon</hi> Taylor, and <hi>Henry VVood</hi> a dayly Labourer; See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art the Man who hath challenged us, we ſhall in the ſtrength of the Lord meet thee when thou wilt, and appoint a time and place, for we were the Men whom thou hadſt firſt to deale withall in this place; and what doſt thou ſcoffingly put Shoo-maker in, which was not in, which is a word of thy own forging, as though thou was not able to Anſwer us, or durſt not ſtand to thy own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions; but ſhuffles from them: And one would have thought <hi>John.

                  <p n="7">7. That Chriſt doth not give his ſpirit to every man that comes into the World.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That they in <hi>Iude</hi> ſpoken of, as <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Cora,</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> had not the ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. And this Light with which every man is enlightened is Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and its groſs to ſay, that the Light which enlightens every man is Chriſt.</p>

man is Chriſt, is a deceiver and an Antichriſt, and <hi>Iohn Wiggan</hi> will prove them ſo.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And it is the ſubtle deceiver, and adverſary Satan, that ſaith, the Light which doth enlighten every man that comes into the World, is the Lamb, and the Lord, and the object of faith.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And the Light that doth enlighten every man is the Word, and before he ſaid it was the Natural man's ſpirit, and an Idol, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. That the Light, the word God, which enlightens every man is natural, and man by it knows nothing of Chriſt, though he confeſs by it, he knows the Eternal power and God-head, the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereof dwells in Chriſt bodily.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And the word God, the true Light, which doth enlighten every man that comes into the World; he ſaith, is darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And the word God doth enlighten every man that comes into the World, by ſetting up a Light and ſpirit in man, which is called the Candle of the Lord, and writing a Law in his heart, and the Light which doth enlighten every man, is not the word which was in the beginning.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And Chriſt came a Light into the World not to enlighten every man that comes into the world, and this light is able to ſeek and feel after God his <hi>Creator,</hi> and by it man may know his <hi>Creator,</hi> and the <hi>Eternal power</hi> and <hi>Godhead,</hi> it is a created Light, a great Light, it is but a Candle Light, but it diſcovers man's tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and this Light ſpringeth up with mans ſpirit, and this Light is the Spirit of a Natural man, (which doth not know the things of God) and this Light diſcovered <hi>Adam's</hi> ſin, and this Light is Natural and not Spiritual.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But this Light knows nothing of the Goſpel myſtery hid in God, nor Redemption by Chriſt, nor of Gods good purpoſe, and Grace, nor of the Law of faith.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. This Candle-light, to wit that Light wherewith every man that comes into the World is enlightened, is not able to diſcern the myſtery of God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And ſo make good theſe things by Scripture, or ſtop thy mouth for ever, for thou Challenged us firſt, or give over Challenging; for we would have diſcourſed with thee privately in a Chriſtian way in thy Chamber, but thou in great rage denyed it; And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

            </p>
            <p>So here thou may ſee they that erred from the faith, and erred from the ſpirit, and hated the Light, had it.—contrary to <hi>John VViggan</hi>'s Doctrine aforemention'd.—<hi>Did not I make one? yet had he the reſidue of my ſpirit, that he

might ſeek a godly Seed, therefore take heed unto the ſpirit. The Goſpel which yee have heard, which was preached to every Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture under Heaven.—Warning every Man, that they might</hi>

Wiggan</hi>'s Aſſertions that proves wicked Men had the light, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and Chriſt dyed for all Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John VViggan,</hi> In ſtead of Anſwering to the Aſſertions, thou tels us of a natural and created Light, ſpringing up with Man's nature, and natural Man's ſpirit, which is an Idol worſe then <hi>Jeroboams</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> nevertheleſs thou ſaiſt this light will let them know much of God, and of the eternal Power and God-head.</p>
            <p>Now that this Light which is an Idol will ſhew the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power and God-head, and yet ſhew nothing of Chriſt <hi>in whom the fulneſs of the God-head dwells.—</hi>How ſtands this together <hi>John—</hi>And can a natural Light, an Idol know the Eternal Power and God-head, know much of God, and ſeek and feel after God—<hi>Idols are dumb, Haba.</hi> 2. and hath eyes and ſees not, as the Scriptures faith, and was this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light an Idol, which reproved them for their ſins; Doth not the Scripture ſay <hi>Adam</hi> was made in the Image of God, in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, and was this an Idol he was made in, which reproved him for ſin: And <hi>Judas</hi> who was made <hi>Partaker of the Miniſtry,</hi> and the Light which <hi>John</hi> was ſent to bear witneſs of, was a created Light, and an Idol, worſe then <hi>Jeroboams,</hi> which <hi>as many as received him</hi> (that thou calls an Idol which cannot hear nor ſee) <hi>he gave them Power to become the Sons of God;</hi> by this natural Light and Idol the World was made, by thy account; and this which thou calls a natural Light and Idol, was in the World, and the World knew him not, and this Light which thou thus calls, ſhines in the darkneſs, and the darkneſs comprehends it not. This is <hi>John Wiggan</hi>'s Aſſertion, but my Queries I ſent unto thee, which thou ſhufles of, and doſt not Anſwer
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:108232:77"/>
them, ſince thou talks ſo much of Bread and Wine; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Chriſt or no? ſeeing ſome of thy fellow Baptiſts Teachers are turned Papiſts, who were wrangling againſt the Light, and now ſay the Bread is Chriſt, after they have bleſt it, and therefore we ſuſpect thee, ſeeing thou art poſting on the ſame Rode againſt the Light, ſo faſt.</p>
            <p>And inſtead of Anſwering, thou haſt taken upon thee to be a Judge of Chriſt, a Judge of the World, and a Judge of the Saints conditions; and confuſedly patches all together, and thou divides God and Chriſt, and calls Chriſt the Light a natural and a created Light, and an Idol worſe then <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boams,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> which all ſober people may ſee what a pack of confuſion thou haſt heaped together in thy Book, for a natural light and Idol cannot bring people to ſeek and feel after God, nor know the Eternal Power and God-head, neither was it a natural Light and Idol that ſhewed <hi>Judas</hi> his ſin when he had betrayed Chriſt, neither was the Image of God which <hi>Adam</hi> was made in; and God the word that enlightens every Man that comes into the World, a natural light and an Idol.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Wiggan,</hi> thy eye is blinded, it is time for thee to give over thy Trade, with thy erroneous principles and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. And Chriſt when he bid them <hi>Believe in the Light,</hi> Joh. 12. It was not an Idol he bid them believe in, but it was in Chriſt the Light, <hi>and in Chriſt was life, and the life was the light of Mon,</hi> and this was not an Idol, and this is the ſame principle and doctrine which we ſuffer for, there was a Man ſent from God whoſe name was <hi>John,</hi> he came for a Witneſs, to bear witneſs to the true Light, and that was the true Light which enlightens every man that comes into the World, that all through him might believe, and as many as received him (to wit) the light wherewith all be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he gave them power to become the Sons of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. to the 12. verſ. And ſo this Light which doth enlighten every Man that comes into the World, ſhines in the darkneſs, but <hi>John VViggan</hi>'s darkneſs cannot comprehend it, and thus he judgeth the things of God with his darkneſs, in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light of Chriſt, and alſo that which convinc'd <hi>Adam,</hi>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:108232:78"/>
&amp;c. a natural and created Light, and an Idol, and the ſpirit of a natural Man which knows not the things of God, and alſo he compares the Light in every Man to the ſtate of the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> natural Man there ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. calling Light dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to the natural and ſenſual ſtate in <hi>Jude,</hi> for nature being ſubjected, is in it ſelf not ſenſual, but being gone out of its courſe, becomes ſenſual; but this is like to the reſt of his meanings he hath given to other things in his Book, but we do intend to put him to make them good by plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, without adding or diminiſhing; for our foundation for ever ſtands ſure, for we ſpeak not of the natural Mans ſpirit, but of <hi>Chriſt the Light,</hi> the <hi>ſecond Adam, the Lord from Heaven,</hi> nor do we ſpeak of the Law of works, nor the firſt Covenant, but we ſpeak of the new Covenant in the heart Chriſt the light our Foundation, whom all the Prophets fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of, who is come to teach his people himſelf, who <hi>Joh. VViggan</hi> pretends to remove, and ſo hath run himſelf into further confuſion.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Ioh. VViggan</hi> ſaith, that the Light which doth enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, &amp;c. is the word Creator, and yet he ſaith it is natural and created, and an Idol worſe then <hi>Ieroboams:</hi> And thus all may ſee he confeſſeth that the Light is the word Creator, and and yet he ſaith it is an Idol: <hi>Joh. Wiggan</hi> ſaith, <hi>God the Word enlightens every Man that comes into the World, and a more excellent light and life comes in by the Son, which none receives but who receives the Son, and are born again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> They which receives this Light which thou call the word Creator, (in thy own aſſertion) becomes the Sons of God; for <hi>John</hi> ſaid this was the true Light which lighteneth every Man that comes into the World, and as many as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him to them, he gives power to become the Sons of God, and this word is Chriſt, as it is plainly proved; And God was in Chriſt, but thou goes about to divide God and Chriſt: <hi>By the word of God was the Heavens of old,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 5. <hi>We underſtand that the Worlds were framed by the Word of God, Heb.</hi> 11. 3. And that by this Word they became the Sons of God, according to the Scriptures, before laid down, what difference then doſt thou make betwixt this word Creator,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:108232:78"/>
and that which comes in by the Son, as thou ſpeaks of, what can the Son do more then make them Sons: So herein thou haſt quite overthrown thy ſelf; what further excellency, or what more Redemption can be had by Chriſt, then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God.</p>
            <p>And whereas thou ſaiſt that we are Adulterers, but we ſee that thou art adulterated from the ſpirit, which cauſes thee to vent forth ſuch language as thou doſt and thy hearers; for whereas thou ſcornfully told <hi>William Houlden,</hi> that he was an unfit Man to meet thee before the <hi>Sheriffe:</hi> Thy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions are ſo groſs and ſo erroneous that I do not queſtion but in the ſtrength of God, I, or any other that were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to thee, to meet thee before either the Sheriff, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Authority in <hi>England,</hi> that thou may make them good by Scripture without either adding or diminiſhing, which thou canſt not doe but over-throw thy own aſſertions:</p>
            <p>And whereas <hi>Tho. Ruſhton</hi> one of thy Hearers ſaid, I was a ſilly Man, and was not fit to Reply to what thou had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt me, but I having had perfect knowledge of thee this nine yeares, and how thou haſt ſtood in oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Truth, Chriſt the Light; that in his ſtrength I ſtand to Reply to thee, or to appear before the <hi>Sheriff</hi> or any other in Anſwer to thee.</p>
            <p>I fear the Lord, and am not afraid of your great boaſting and ſcornful reproachful words.</p>
