         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The chiefe Officer was a Provoſt, but <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth gave them liberty to chooſe a Major, and two Bayliefes, after King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, changed the two Bayliefes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two Sheriffes.</p>

                  <hi>Eliſabet</hi> gathered by his experience.</p>
               <p>The people in generall have able bodies by nature, and have gotten by cuſtome ready uſe of armes, and by their late ſucceſſe, boldneſſe to fight with your Majeſtis forces.</p>
               <p>In their pride they value no man but themſelves, in their affections, they love nothing but idleneſſe and licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, in their Rebellion, they have no other end but to ſhake off the yoke of obedience, to root out all remembrance of the Engliſh Nation in that Kingdome. This is the generall quarrell of the Iriſh, and they who doe not profeſſe it, are either ſo few, or ſo falſe, that there is no account to be made of them.</p>
               <p>The Iriſh Nobility and Lords of Countries do not only in their hearts affect this quarrell, and are divided from us in Religion, but have an eſpeciall grudge againſt the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Government, becauſe it limiteth and tyeth them, who have and ſtill would be ſupream Lords, if not Tyrants. The Towns being inhabited by men of the ſame Religion and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64783:20"/>
birth with the reſt, are ſo carried away with the love of gaine, and for that cauſe ſupply the Rebels with what they want: therefore they muſt be ſtrictly looked unto.</p>
               <p>The Laws of the Iriſh was that of fiſh and birds, the great devoure the leſſe, the ſtrong the weak, having but one Free-holder in a County, and he Lord both of eſtate and lives of the reſt.</p>
               <p>For their ſucceſſion to inheritances, it was by the law or cuſtome called <hi>Taniſtry,</hi> mentioned by that excellent Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh:</hi> which is this, that a man is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to a boy: the Uncle before the Nephew, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the moſt active, not the next heire is choſen, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inroad and oppreſſion of the next adjoyning Lord, between whom there was alwayes contention, which did ſo waſt and conſume them, or elſe being idle, the Land would not have ſuſtained them.</p>
               <p>Concerning the apparell of the Iriſh it is after a ſlovenly manner, and the very Engliſh, there are much infected with this naſty filthineſſe, eſpecially lowzie beds, and foule lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, except where the chiefe Engliſh live, as in Dublin, Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teford, and Kinſale, which in ſome meaſure retaine the Engliſh neatneſſe; but for the meere wilde Iriſh it may be ſaid of them as of the Germans, that they wander ſlovenly and naked, and lodge in the ſame room with their cattle.</p>
               <p>Among them the better ſort uſed to weare cloſe bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ſtockings of the ſame, of red or ſome light co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſo ſtraight that the unſeemly parts of the body were expoſed unto view.</p>
               <p>They uſed likewiſe a looſe Coat and a three covered Mantle of coarſe cloth, with a cap of Thrums.</p>
               <p>Their linnen is coarſe and ſlovenly, they ſeldome caſt off a ſhirt untill it be rotten, and are coloured with Saffron to avoid Lice which are incident to thoſe people, and they are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:64783:21"/>
very nimble in taking Lice in a Sunny day, or a green bank.</p>
               <p>But in the more Northern parts before the ſtrict civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing of them in King <hi>James</hi> his time, both men and women went naked in the very Winter, having only their ſecret parts covered with a rag and a looſe Mantle caſt over them.</p>
               <p>Thus naked they walke with their ſword tyed unto them with a wyth inſtead of a belt.</p>
               <p>And at night men and women lye in a Ring together, round about the fire, in the middle of the roome with their feet towards it, folding their head and upper parts in their woollen Mantle firſt ſteeped in water to keep them warm, for they ſay, woollen wetted, and warmed by the heat of their bodies, doth preſerve heat.</p>
               <p>The Church Diſcipline hath beene formerly and now is after the ſame manner with that in England, by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, whereof there are foure, Biſhops 29, many more formerly.</p>
               <p>It has beene anciently a great Nurſery of Religion and Pietie: even from (if not before) Saint <hi>Patricks</hi> time, and Saint <hi>Bridget</hi> his Diſciple, who did advance Religion and Piety much in that Kingdome, as alſo in ſundry other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>The Biſhops were formerly conſecrated by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury, untill the yeere 1142: at what time Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, ſent Cardinall <hi>Paperio,</hi> who to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Biſhop of Liſmore, Legat of all Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, held a Councell at Mell, and with the conſent of the Biſhops, Abbots, Kings, and Dukes of Ireland, eſtabliſhed foure Archbiſhops, <hi>videlicet</hi> Armagh, Dublin, Caſſile, and Toam. But the eſtate of the Clergy has been very meane there, ſo that by reaſon of devouring impropriations in the whole County of Connought. The Incumbents ſtipend is not above forty ſhillings, and at ſome places but fifteene

ſhillings <hi>per annum,</hi> that the people muſt needs be better fed then taught.</p>
               <p>Their allowance being anſwerable to the Iriſh Biſhops in former time, who had but three milch Kine allowed them, and when one was dry, the Pariſh did change her for another.</p>
               <p>Which makes the Goſpell to languiſh where it finds ſo poore entertainment; that the Meſſengers thereof through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> want and neceſſity ſhould live ſo mean and contemptibly: and it gives great advantage to the Prieſts and Jeſuits both to abound and ſeduces who have mayntenance from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.</p>

                  <p>Thus did hee receive the homage of divers Iriſh petty Kings, willing to obtain them by gentle means.</p>
                  <p>And keeping his Chriſtmaſſe there in great ſtate, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Government of the Church, hee is unexpectedly called into England, leaving <hi>Hugh Lacy</hi> at Dublin.</p>
                  <p>Who in enſuing time rebelled, and were brought under by King <hi>John,</hi> who was the firſt that planted Engliſh Laws and Officers in Ireland, and both annexed that Kingdome and faſtned Wales to the Crown of England: and was the firſt who enlarged the Royall ſtyle with Lord of Ireland.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere 1339, there was a generall warre betweene the Engliſh and Iriſh, wherein many of the Iriſh periſhed, after which time matters were quiet untill the eighteenth yeere of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, being 1400.</p>
                  <p>Who went over then with a great Army, but having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Rebels ſubmiſſion he returned into England: during whoſe time and till the civill warres in England all matters were ſetled and compoſed without any charge or aſſiſtance out of this Kingdome.</p>
                  <p>But in the time of the wars between York and Lancaſter, wherein many Noble Families were quite extinguiſhed in England, many Engliſh came out of Ireland either to take part of poſſeſsion of ſome inheritances, which fell unto them by the death of their friends.</p>

                  <p>Now <hi>Hugh</hi> ſon of the baſe ſon <hi>Matthew</hi> lived ſomtime in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but much in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Baron of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> who had ſerved with a troop of horſe under the Queen againſt the Lord of <hi>Deſmond,</hi> and behaved himſelfe ſo valiantly, that hee had given him a yeerly penſion off a hundred marks.</p>
                  <p>He was a man of mean ſtature, but of a ſtrange body, able to endure labours, watching, hunger and cold, being indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious and active, valiant, affable, and apt to manage great affaires, and of a hgh diſſembling, ſubtile, and profound wit.</p>
                  <p>He put up a Petition to the Parliament in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that he might enjoy the inheritance of his Grandfather <hi>Con,</hi> and his father, granted to be Earles of <hi>Tirone,</hi> which by the help of Sir <hi>John Perrot,</hi> Lord Deputy, was procured of the Queen.</p>
                  <p>And ſo hee handled the matter (as well knowing the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the Court of <hi>England</hi>) that through the Queenes mediation he got <hi>Turlogh, Linnogh,</hi> to ſurrender his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon ſome conditions.</p>
                  <p>After whoſe death he uſurped the title of <hi>O Neale,</hi> which was capitall, yet coloured it over with a pretence, that it was only to hinder others.</p>
                  <p>In the yeer 1588, when that great Armado of <hi>Spaine</hi> was ſcattered by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and many of the ſhips caſt away on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> coaſt: it is thought that this <hi>Hugh</hi> lodging and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining many of them, was by them ſeduced and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>And going into <hi>England,</hi> he was there detained priſoner,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:64783:26"/>
for that he came without the licence of the Lord Deputie, Sir <hi>William Fitz Williams:</hi> but on ſubmiſsion, and certaine Articles propoſed to him by the Lords, and he willingly accepting promiſing to confirme them before the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the yeere 1590, it hapned that <hi>Con</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Shan O Neale,</hi> accuſed <hi>Hugh</hi> of treaſonable practices before the Lords in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>All which <hi>Hugh</hi> vehemently denied; but after getting his accuſer in his power, he hanged him.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the ſame yeere <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> (for ſo hereafter we muſt call him, did promiſe under his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord Deputy: and counſell of <hi>Ireland</hi> to performe thoſe Articles agreed upon in <hi>England,</hi> but uſed many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to put off the execution of them.</p>
                  <p>And about this time <hi>Hugh Ror Mac Mahone</hi> was put to death by the Lord Deputy <hi>Williams</hi> very unjuſtly (as ſome ſay) to the great ſcandall of the Lord Deputy; and it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great complaints and out-cryes among the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> who preſently preferred their grievances againſt that Deputy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he driven to anſwer them.</p>
                  <p>And upon this fact the government of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the North became odious, and they did ſtrive what they could to ſhake it oft, by expelling the Sheriffs from among them, fearing the like uſage as <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Whereupon the Deputy got into his hands <hi>Eniskillen Mac Guirs</hi> caſtle, and proclaimed him a Traytor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe gave out ſome hard ſpeeches concerning <hi>Tyrone,</hi> which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64783:26"/>
did much exaſperate him, and cauſed him to combine with the Lords of the North, to defend their Honours, Laws, and Liberties: and uſed two notable plots to aſsiſt him to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>1 To make his men skilfull, hee profered to ſerve the Queen with 500 men of his own.</p>
                  <p>And for that end procured expert Captains to exerciſe them; and ſo often changing theſe his men, got moſt of his followers to be able Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee pretended to build a faire houſe at <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gannon,</hi> and ſo got much lead to make Battlements, which after he caſt into bullets.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time Sir <hi>Henry Bagnal</hi> Marſhall of <hi>Ireland,</hi> whoſe Siſter <hi>Tyrone</hi> had married, did preferre many Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt him, unto which hee anſwered ſo cunningly, ſaying, that the Marſhall did it out of ſpleen of purpoſe to detain his ſiſters portion, and ſeemingly quitted himſelfe; but afterward he grew jealous of his owne ſafety.</p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Gauranus</hi> a Prieſt whom the Pope had made Primate of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſeduced certaine Iriſh Lords, among which <hi>Mac Guir</hi> was chief, and was overthrowne by Sir <hi>Richard Bingham,</hi> and the Prieſt ſlaine: in which ſervice <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> was againſt <hi>Mac Guir</hi> with the Queens forces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly prepared for his Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>Then the ſonnes of <hi>Shan O Neale,</hi> were priſoners in <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi> Caſtle, which had they been kept, had been a bridle in <hi>Tyrones</hi> mouth; but by connivance of Sir <hi>William Fitz Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> the Deputy, were ſuffered to eſcape, and ſo <hi>Tyrone</hi> got them into his cuſtody, nor would he releaſe them although thereunto required.</p>
                  <p>But covering his Rebellion, with feeming feares of his conceived enemies, made daily complaints of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals envy; and what wrong he had done him.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere 1594, the Rebellion burſt out; Sir <hi>William
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64783:27"/>
Ruſſel</hi> came in the place of <hi>Fitz Williams,</hi> at which time <hi>Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> men openly diſtreſſed her Majeſties forces; and <hi>Tyrone</hi> was ſuppoſed to countenance them.</p>
                  <p>Yet he appeared in perſon at <hi>Dublin,</hi> before the new Lord Deputy, deſiring her Majeſties favour, out of which hee had falne, rather by the calumny of them, then any cauſe of his own.</p>
                  <p>But the Marſhall charged him with great matters, ready to prove them; ſo that the Deputy thought fit to ſtay him, but the Councell of <hi>Ireland</hi> were of the contrary opinion, ſo he was let goe, but the Queene was much diſpleaſed for it, and ſharply reproved the Deputy, but he laid the fault on the Councell of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And preſently tooke the field with his Army to relieve <hi>Eniskillen</hi> in <hi>Ferminaght,</hi> and in the Winter following, there was little done becauſe there was ſome Treaties of peace, but the Rebels grew ſo peremptory in their demands, that it was not liked by the Lords in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore ſent over two thouſand old ſouldiers that had ſerved in <hi>Britany,</hi> and a thouſand more taken up in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which news <hi>Tyrone</hi> hearing, and that the Caſtle of <hi>Baliſhannan,</hi> and <hi>Relike,</hi> were to be planted with Engliſh Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons. Drew his forces together, and tooke the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> razed it: and broke down the bridge there, and now the Northerne Rebels appeare, but <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſhewed a ſeeming deſire of pardon.</p>
                  <p>This Lord Deputy fearing this ſtorme might fall upon him, deſired the Counſel of <hi>England</hi> to ſend him an aſſiſtant of ſome experienced Souldiers; which hee meant ſhould be under his command; but the Lords miſtaking his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſent over Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> a great Commander and well experienced, that would ſcarce give way to any; who was ſtyled Lord Generall, and to command in chief, in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord Deputy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:64783:27"/>But the emulation that grew between theſe two hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the buſineſſe; yet both of them went into the field, with the Army towards <hi>Armagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyrone</hi> makes ſuit again by Letters for pardon, but being intercepted, came not unto the Deputies hands, untill hee had proclaymed him Traytor.</p>
                  <p>But upon <hi>Tyrones</hi> inſtance, Commiſsioners were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Queen to treat with the Rebels.</p>
                  <p>At which time <hi>Tyrone</hi> complained of the Marſhall of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injuries.</p>
                  <p>And his demands were, that hee might have his Wives portion of the Marſhall, and the free exerciſe of his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and many other.</p>
                  <p>But when Articles were propounded on the Queenes part, they ſet ſo light of them, and made ſuch ſcorne, that the Conference brake off: though the Queen for ſparing of bloud, had reſolved to give them any reaſonable Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>This parley ended, the Lord Deputy, and the Lord Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall comming to <hi>Armagh,</hi> did ſo much terrifie the Rebels that <hi>Tyrone</hi> left the Fort of <hi>Blackwater,</hi> burnt the Town of <hi>Dungannon,</hi> and pull'd down his houſe there, and betooke himſelfe to the Woods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> the third, <hi>Hugh</hi> Earle of <hi>Tyrone, Hugh O Donel; Brian O Rourk, Hugh Mack Guir, Brian Mac Mahone,</hi> Sir <hi>Arthur O Neale, Cormac Mach Baron Tyrones</hi> brother, <hi>Con O Neale Tyrones</hi> baſe ſonne, <hi>Henry Oge O Neale, Turlogh Mac Henry O Neale, Brian Art Mac Bryan,</hi> and one <hi>Francis Mountford</hi> were (though abſent) indicted, and condemned of high Treaſon.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Lemſter</hi> Rebels being revolted grew ſtrong, and forraged even to the gates of <hi>Dublin,</hi> to the County of <hi>Wexford.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:64783:28"/>This Winter paſſed without any matter of moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe indeed, Generall <hi>Norris</hi> not yet acquainted with <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones</hi> ſubtilties, ſeemed to harken to peace, thereby to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayme him by faire means.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere 1596, the Queen granted another Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Treaty of Peace, and offered very largely, and at <hi>Dundalke Tyrone</hi> upon his knees made an humble ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Queen before theſe Commiſſioners, and made many requeſts, promiſing reformation, and many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Ceremonies then paſſed. But theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences followed, theſe delayes being no better then delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that the <hi>Vlſter</hi> Rebels had reſt this Summer, and <hi>O Neale</hi> in the midſt of this Negotiation, required aid from <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Richard Bingham</hi> a valiant wiſe man, on ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> was ſent for over into <hi>England,</hi> and Sir <hi>Coniers Clifford</hi> ſent in his place: but afterwards Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was againe employed in great command in that ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Again, an other Treaty of Peace with <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who layd the cauſe of his diſloyalty, on the wrongs that were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; and ſo with many diſſembling words, oaths, and proteſtations, making anſwer to ſome queſtions concerning <hi>Spaine,</hi> he departed.</p>
                  <p>This Lord Deputy being recalled into <hi>England,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bourgh</hi> or <hi>Borough</hi> was ſent over in his place, with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute authority: ſo that Sir <hi>John Norris</hi> was much diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereby: and was thought of purpoſe for that end ſent over by the Earle of <hi>Eſsex,</hi> whom Generall <hi>Norris</hi> had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed by undertaking an action with leſſe force then the ſaid Earle required.</p>
                  <p>At this Dep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> arriving Generall <hi>Norris</hi> was commanded to his charge, which was Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> and not to ſtirre thence without leave, which thing did preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64783:28"/>
break his heart, ſo that he died there in the armes of his brother Sir <hi>Thomas Norris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſubmitted or ſweld as he ſaw occaſion.</p>
                  <p>So that the Lord Deputy perceiving it preſently, made his way towards <hi>Tyrone,</hi> thinking it beſt to ſtrike at the head; who encountred the <hi>Iriſh</hi> in a narrow path, and made them give way: hee tooke the Fort at <hi>Blackwater,</hi> and left Souldiers in it, which being not long, after aſſailed by the Rebels, was againe relieved by the Lord Deputy, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fell ſick, as hee was paſſing to <hi>Tyrones</hi> houſe at <hi>Dungannon;</hi> and not long after departed this world, to the great joy of the Rebels, who found his ſeverity diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to them.</p>
                  <p>Then Sir <hi>Thomas Norris,</hi> Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter,</hi> under the great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> was made Lord Juſtice of <hi>Ireland,</hi> who repaired to Dublin; but being very ill through the great grief he conceived for the loſſe of his brother in a moneths ſpace, he made ſuit to be releaſed.</p>
                  <p>So that <hi>Adam Loftus</hi> Lord Chancelour, the Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Robert Gardiner</hi> chiefe Juſtice of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by Patent from <hi>England,</hi> were made Lord Juſtices for the Civill Government.</p>
                  <p>And the Earle of <hi>Ormond,</hi> was made Lord Lievtenant and chief Generall of all Martiall affaires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyrone</hi> again ſues for pardon, and proffers ſubmiſsion, ſaying, that it was offered injuries that compelled him thus to revolt: So there was another meeting appointed at <hi>Dundalke Decemb.</hi> 22. where on his knees hee ſhewed great ſorrow; and made humble ſubmiſsion, deſiring a ceſſation from Armes eight weeks, now this ſubmiſsion being ſent into <hi>England,</hi> the Lord Lievtenant received authority from the Queen to make a finall concluſion; ſo that another mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was appointed, <hi>March</hi> 15 at <hi>Dundalke;</hi> where many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64783:29"/>
were propounded to the Rebels, which they ſlightly regarded; but for better deliberation, <hi>Tyrone</hi> deſired the tenth of <hi>April,</hi> for another meeting.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Tyrone</hi> with pretences did fruſtrate all theſe parleys, and though hee had his generall pardon granted, yet conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he in his diſloyall courſes; ſo that on the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment 1595, he is after out-lawed in 1600.</p>
                  <p>But he being prepared and his men expert, by trayning and often skirmiſhing, whereas at the firſt two or three of them were employed in the diſcharge of a Musket, hee left off to diſſemble and ſubmitted no more, but gives incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, and that with good ſucceſſe unto his Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſends ayde to the <hi>Lemſter</hi> Rebels to annoy the Engliſh, and aſſaulted the Fort of <hi>Blackwater;</hi> as being a hinderance in his paſsing too and fro.</p>
                  <p>But Captaine <hi>Williams</hi> valiantly defended it with great loſſe to <hi>Tyrone,</hi> who went and lay further off, but this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and his Company continued their defence bravely untill <hi>Auguſt,</hi> though much pinched with want of victuals: when Sir <hi>Henry Bagnal</hi> Marſhall of <hi>Ireland</hi> with foot and horſe of the Engliſh endeavoured to relieve it, and paſsing along the narrow paſſages through the thicke Woods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Armagh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the Rebell with all his force aſſayled him, and bearing a deadly hatred and malice againſt the Marſhall, againſt whom he bent his whole ſtrength, and commanded his Souldiers ſo to doe, that he had the fortune to kill him; yet like a valiant Gentleman he ſold his life at a deare rate, to many of the Rebels. But his fall cauſed our mens hearts to fayle; whereupon the Rebell had the greateſt advantage againſt the Engliſh: the like never hapning againe, called The Defeat at <hi>Blackwater.</hi>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:64783:29"/>
wherein we loſt thirteen valiant Captains, and fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred old Souldiers: whereupon likewiſe the ſurrender of the Fort enſued.</p>
                  <p>It was thought this misfortune to happen from an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of the Marſhall, who made the Van of the army too ſuddenly to retreat; and too ſudden faces about, puts feare in the Reare; and makes them ſuppoſe it may be a running away.</p>
                  <p>For as Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in his fifth book &amp; firſt part of the Hiſtory of the World, that as well in the Wars of theſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ages as in former times it hath been found ever extreame dangerous to make a Retreat in the head of an enemies army: as he renders the reaſon, but I cannot digreſſe any further.</p>
                  <p>This overthrow much increaſed the inſolencie of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels, the Rebells having gotten courage and armes thereby, and <hi>Tyrone</hi> termed the Deliverer of his Countrey, and the authour of their liberty.</p>
                  <p>All <hi>Vlſter</hi> in Rebellion, <hi>Connagh</hi> revolted, and the Rebels in <hi>Lemſter</hi> a continuall terrour and vexation to the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>And now <hi>Tyrone</hi> ſent forces into <hi>Munſter,</hi> where after the departure of Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> moſt of the County revolted, and now brake out like Lightning, making havock, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying in a barbarous manner. And for the better counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing of the matter, a new pretended Earle of <hi>Deſmond</hi> is ſet up, on condition to be Vaſſall to <hi>O Neale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this time a ſupply came out of <hi>England,</hi> of a thouſand and fifty old Souldiers from out the Low Countreys, and nine hundred and fifty joyned to them of new, raiſed in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> ſent under the command of Sir <hi>Samuel Bagnal</hi> Colonel, and nine other Captains to ſtrengthen the Queenes forces i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>In the midſt of theſe broyls, the impudent Rebell is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

aſhamed to intreat for pardon, and ſue for peace.</p>
                  <p>Although, as appeared in his Letters ſent to the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> he magnified his victories, and vowed perſeverance: but his conditions were inſolent and ſo not regarded.</p>
                  <p>And now the wound is growne ſo great, and the caſe ſo deſperate that it admits of no cure, but by the hand of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant expert ſouldier.</p>
                  <p>And none found like <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> whom favour with the Queen, and fortune of warre had made popular.</p>
                  <p>And his own active inclination, and the policie of his powerfull enemies in Court, wrought it for his underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; and by his abſence they plotted his enſuing over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.</p>
                  <p>But before his going two Regiments of old Souldiers out of the Low Countries were ſent into <hi>Ireland,</hi> and diſperſed at his comming through the whole army, for the exerciſe of the reſt.</p>

                  <p>And in the concluſion bewayles his owne misfortune, that his enemies (whom he names) had gotten ſo neere her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties elbow.</p>
                  <p>In the end of <hi>July</hi> his Lordſhip brought backe his forces into <hi>Lemſter,</hi> himſelfe going to <hi>Dublin,</hi> having done little, but admitted ſome few to protection, which afterward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted againe.</p>

                  <p>So that Sir <hi>Con. Clifford</hi> with one Troop of horſe, and 1400. foot came to the Curlew Mountaines, where he left his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages under the guard of his Horſe, untill he had tryed the paſſage forward,</p>

                  <p>She wrote him a tart Letter, much blaming his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and queſtioning his diſcretion.</p>

                  <p>The Queen hearing this and more, that the Rebels daily increaſed, and the Engliſh Iriſh diſcontented that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was wholly out of their hands, by ſending Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Deputies over.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Tyrone</hi> grew proud, bearing truſt on the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> who had ſent him ſomewhat, but promiſed more; and the Pope not wanting in his fatherly cate towards him, ſent him a crowne of Phenix feathers, in imitation no doubt of <hi>Vrban</hi> the third, who ſent King <hi>John</hi> Lord of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a crowne of Peacocks feathers.</p>
                  <p>Upon this Sir <hi>Charles Blunt,</hi> Lord <hi>Montjoy,</hi> is thought fit to be ſent, and was thought on by the Qu. before <hi>Eſſex</hi> came over, who was forward to take the charge upon him, and ſo turned the Queenes intentions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:64783:38"/>This Lord was a tall comely man, wiſe, valiant, and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, cloſe in his counſels, reſolute in his determinations.</p>
                  <p>His courſes were much contrary to other Deputies, and ſo effected what they could not doe.</p>
                  <p>1. He led our men warily on any ſervice, not willing to diſ-hearten our men, or incourage the enemie; and himſelfe ever at hand, either to hearten or helpe, hee ventured his own perſon often, although it be a great queſtion in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary diſcipline, whether it be wiſedome or no.</p>
                  <p>2. His planting of Garriſon in the Rebels countreys compaſsing <hi>Tyrone</hi> on every ſide, ſo that they could not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily aſsiſt on the other.</p>
                  <p>Other Deputies made two or three journeys in the yeare, and that with the whole Army; which was diſcovered by the Rebels, that they fled into the woods and bogges, nor could the Army abide the field long for want of victuals, being ſo many at one place; where as the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> planting good Garriſons in many places, taking the field with 1000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> foot, and 200. horſe onely, was able openly to affront <hi>Tyrone,</hi> ſeeing he was compelled to leave many of his forces behind to guard his Countrey from thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, which elſe would have forraged his Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Thus he did not only in Summer as others had done, but in Winter alſo, himſelfe being five or ſixe dayes in a weeke, on horſe-backe, which courſe did ſo vexe the Rebels, who were driven to lye in the woods without ſhelter for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or cowes, which allowing them not milk, they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted preſent proviſion, nor could they ſave their corne for the future.</p>
                  <p>4. Againe, he had a ſpeciall care to cut the paſſages open and plaine, that our forces might the more ſecure meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
                  <p>5. Further, he was not eaſie to grant Pardons and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64783:38"/>
but to ſuch who had drawne blood on their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and ſo loſt the hope of reconciliation to the Rebels, and forbad all parlyes with them.</p>
                  <p>But as the Rebels were many at the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſo now much more increaſed. In the County of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin</hi> increaſed one hundred.</p>
                  <p>And in many other Countreys, beſides five Caſtles late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken by the Iriſh.</p>
                  <p>In the Province of <hi>Lemſter</hi> increaſed 1280. Rebels. In the Province of <hi>Connagh</hi> increaſed 300. Rebels, beſides the doubt of <hi>Tibot ne Longe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who had one hundred Iriſh men in the Queenes pay.</p>
                  <p>So that now the Enemie ſtrongeſt, the Engliſh weakeſt, and many other diſaſters made the buſineſſe very difficult.</p>
                  <p>In this caſe the Lord <hi>Montjoy</hi> undertooke the buſineſſe about <hi>Ian.</hi> 1599.</p>
                  <p>A little before whoſe comming <hi>Tyrone</hi> marcheth out of the North in a vaunting manner unto <hi>Munſter,</hi> to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and countenance the Rebels, but under a religious pretence to viſite a peece of the Croſſe at a Monaſtery in <hi>Tipperary</hi> County, and ſo accompanied with the <hi>Lemſter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels went on his devotion.</p>
                  <p>Now the army of Engliſh reduced to 12000. foot, &amp; 1200. horſe, for whoſe payment order is given to the Treaſurer and Chamberlaine of the Exchequer of <hi>England,</hi> to pay the Treaſurer of the Warres of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the rate of the former eſtabliſhment, and other extraordinaries.</p>
                  <p>So there was ſigned an eſtabliſhment by the Queene, <hi>Ian.</hi> 1. 1599. for the pay of Commanders, and Souldiers.</p>
                  <p>And the Lord Deputy haſting away for <hi>Ireland, Ian.</hi> 10. 1599. in his way wrote backe to maſter Secretary, that he might have more Forces in regard the Rebels were ſo ſtrong.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> 26. the Lord Deputy landed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when Sir <hi>George Carew</hi> was made Lord Preſident of <hi>Munſter, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi> did not expect ſuch a ſudden arrivall, ſo that hee was ſtill in Weſt <hi>Munſter,</hi> where he might be ſurpriſed as the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> thought, if things hapned well.</p>
                  <p>And that he could not thence eſcape without engaging himſelfe, if the paſſages were watched.</p>
                  <p>So that daily newes came that <hi>Tyrone</hi> now, or never was to be ruinated: and how many Lords and others of the Iriſh which were for the Queene had layed waite for him, and would ſtop his paſſage back, but all this vaniſhed into Iriſh oſtentation of ſervice, which ſeldome uſe to take effect, and many times are not truly intended as this buſineſſe did ſhew.</p>
                  <p>And that his Lordſhip ſhould not expect any helpe from divers of the Nobilitie, and Gentry of the <hi>Pale,</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred a Petition to him, that they were not able by reaſon of the ſpoyles the ſouldiers had made upon them, but a meere excuſe (as <hi>Eſsex</hi> ſhewed before.)</p>
                  <p>Then his Lordſhip wrote to Secretary <hi>Cecill,</hi> to excuſe himſelfe, for not reducing the 14000 which hee found in the Army unto 12000, and the cauſe thereof as he had done before.</p>
                  <p>And upon that receives an anſwer from the Queen, that ſhe doth accept of his reaſons for the preſent, but would have him effect it by degrees.</p>

                  <p>And at his being there, he ſent out a Mandate, by which hee ſummoned the Subjects of <hi>Munſter</hi> to appeare before him in this forme.</p>

                  <p>And the Rebels of Lemſter made ſuit to be received to mercy: only the Towns where the Rebels had to do were very inſolent.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Tyrone,</hi> by the arrivall of two ſhips, (wherein were many Prieſts) did incourage his friends. Laſtly, the Deputy complained to the Secretary, that all places were beſtowed in <hi>England,</hi> ſo that he could gratifie no deſerving man.</p>

                  <p>The Counteſſe of <hi>Ormond</hi> having one only daughter, was much perplexed and diſtreſſed, but the Lord Deputy ſent her a Guard for her Houſe.</p>

                  <p>It might have miſcarried, for the ſaid Commander choſe out ſome weake companies for this ſervice to be led by the other; but the Deputy being advertiſed thereof, profered them to him that had made the choiſe of them, but hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to goe with them.</p>
                  <p>And Sir <hi>Oliver Lambert</hi> with 14 companyes did with much valour and courage effect the buſineſſe, though ſtrongly oppoſed.</p>

                  <p>His Lordſhip now out of <hi>England</hi> required to doe ſome thing againſt the <hi>Lemſter</hi> rebels; in his way thither, tooke two hundred Cowes, ſeven hundred Garrais, and five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſheep, burning and waſting the corne all the way, as he went to a moſt dangerous paſſage, where Sir <hi>Oliver Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> was appointed to meet him, both being conſtrained to
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64783:43"/>
fight all the way with the rebels untill they met, having done much harme unto the rebels.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>May</hi> the ſeventeenth, they both marched towards a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe, where the Rebels had ſtored much proviſion of all ſorts, at whoſe entry there was a Foard compaſſed with Bogs, over which our horſes paſſed quietly: but his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the head of the foot was aſſayled with fury.</p>
                  <p>The Traitour <hi>Terrill</hi> having appointed a hundred ſhot to ply the Deputies perſon, and given them marks to know him.</p>
                  <p>But the Engliſh defeated and ſlue 35 rebels, among which was <hi>Owmy Mac Rory,</hi> a vile rebell, who before had taken the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> priſoner, a bloudy bold young man; by whoſe death that party never was able to appear in field.</p>
                  <p>And now the Captaine, and by their example the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers cut down the corn with their ſwords, that the rebels were driven to want for the future.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip returned one day with the foot alone, and ſent about the Horſe, and yet the rebels which lay there about durſt not fight with him.</p>
                  <p>Eight heads of chief rebels were brought unto his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip that night, and one arch-rebell alive, who was preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hanged.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>Oliver Lambert</hi> foraging abroad, tooke a thouſand Cowes, five hundred Garrais, and a multitude of ſheep and killed twenty rebels; and much ſpoile daily was done then by the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>At his Lordſhips going out of <hi>Leaz,</hi> ſome were received protection.</p>
                  <p>At this time his Lordſhip had letters of approbation from her Majeſty, with a promiſe of ſupply both of horſe and foot, and with advice to make the company leſſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> the twentieth, his Lordſhip returned to <hi>Dublin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> where hee heard of the complaints that were made againſt him by thoſe of the Pale to the Lords in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer whereunto he writes to Maſter Secretary, onely deſiring his good wil in candid interpretation of his actions</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>September</hi> the fourteenth, his Lordſhip takes his journey towards the North, and encampeth three miles beyond <hi>Dundalke,</hi> and lay there untill the eighth of <hi>October,</hi> it being moſt tempeſtuous foule weather, his Lordſhips Tent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been often blown over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tyrone,</hi> in the mean time, before his Lordſhip came, had poſſeſſed the <hi>Newry,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſſe as any the Rebels had, but his Lordſhip was reſolved to cut his way through them if they made reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Many skirmiſhes fell out well on our part, and in ſmall time he came to <hi>Armagh,</hi> where not farre off his Lordſhip built a Fort in a very convenient place; having a River by it all environed with Bogs, &amp; a hill like a Promontory which his Lordſhip called Mount <hi>Norris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So hee ſent ſome companies of ours to fetch corne and timber over the Bogs, where <hi>Tyrone</hi> met with them; and skirmiſhing with them was put to the worſt, and next day <hi>Neale O Quin,</hi> was taken priſoner, <hi>Tyrones</hi> great Favourite.</p>
                  <p>And the rebels intending to hinder the building of the Fort were ſoundly beaten, and that finiſhed and left in it foure hundred men under Captain <hi>Blany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip returning by <hi>Carlingford</hi> found the paſſage very difficult for his horſe, that they were ſent a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; and now they had certaine intelligence that <hi>Tyrone</hi> was come downe unto a place, by which we were to paſſe.</p>
                  <p>Which was a very great Wood at the foot of a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, reaching ſo neer the Sea, that it had no more ſpace, then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64783:44"/>
that ſix or ſeven might walke abreaſt, with ſome leſſe, and at full Sea none in ſome places.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip diſpoſing his forces for the fight, ſending out a forlorne hope to march afore, and a forlorne Reare.</p>
                  <p>The enemy ſought to make good a ſmall piece of ground like a ſemicircle, where the Sea made a Diameter, and a thick Wood the Circumference; and at the corner next to our Army, there ran a River out off the Wood at the ſide of which they made ſtrong trenches, and at the further cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a Barricado which reached far into the wood, and down to the Sea.</p>
                  <p>The enemy appeared horſe and foot on this plain, but at our mens going over the River, their horſe drew into the Woods, and their foot into the Trenches, whence they poured out Vollies of ſhot.</p>
                  <p>But the ſtout courage of the Engliſh was ſuch that in little ſpace they beat them out of their Trenches and from their works, and made them retire into the woods, but ſallied out againe upon our Reare; to their further loſſe.</p>
                  <p>And in all this not much hurt to us, only two Gentlemen of quality killed; not twenty loſt, about ſixty hurt, of the enemy eighty killed, and the loſſe was (as wee had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence two hundred.</p>
                  <p>Our Marſhall and Serjeant Major were always ready to aſſiſt the weak, and bring ſuccour to the diſtreſſed, and the Army went on cheerfully.</p>
                  <p>And by this <hi>Tyrones</hi> reputation got a crack.</p>
                  <p>His Lordſhip returned to <hi>Dundalke,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Dublin,</hi> with his followers and Voluntiers, having diſpoſed the horſe and foot into Garriſons, Forts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Provinces under their Commanders.</p>
                  <p>The horſe were 1198. The foot 14150.</p>

                  <p>Howſoever the Deputy being privy to ſo much as hee was, he ſaid he would not put his necke under the Queenes Attourneys tongue; and reſolved with himſelfe that had he been ſent for into <hi>England,</hi> not to have undergone the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a triall: but his Lordſhips former ſervice, and future employment blew over this ſtorm without any ſhatter fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on him.</p>

                  <p>So we placing the two ſmall pieces, charging them with Musket ſhot, drove the Rebels out of the Trenches, which they had made beyond the River, ſo that the 300 men paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed over the River and poſſeſſed them, and an adjoyning old Fort, with a plain, not altogether Musket ſhot from the Wood, where the Rebell was fled, and his Lordſhip ſeeing the Trenches did admire that they wold take ſo much pains to make that which they had ſo little care to keepe, ſo his Lordſhip went to view a Place in <hi>Tyrones</hi> Wood, who ſtood looking on us; who only made a few ſhot at our men in their retreat.</p>

                  <p>Among the Spaniards at their ſhipping many of them were found to have Spells, Characters, and hallowed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls, as preſervatives againſt death.</p>

                  <p>And a warre of force will be great, coſtly, and large (as the Earle of <hi>Eſsex</hi> ſaid) and that will make the burden more deſervedly to be complained of, then that of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who did grieve and groane (as ſhee ſayd) with her ſubjects, under ſo great a weight as the maintaining of 1400. foot, and 1500 horſe, in a climate full of contagion, in a Kingdome utterly waſted.</p>
                  <p>Which forces ours muſt farre exceed, for although the Rebels have not ſuch woods and fortreſſes as then, yet now are they equall in number, and farre more ready then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, and better exerciſed in feats of armes, and no doubt will make the beſt advantage of the hils and boggs, for the Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was wont to ſay that the warre in <hi>Ereland,</hi> was as aſwell to be made with woods and bogges as men; It's not like the courſing of a Hare, but as the digging after an earthed Foxe from one angle to another.</p>
                  <p>It was then thought the ſavingſt way to breake them by factions rayſed among themſelves, they being coveteous and mercenary; and will be hired to any thing, eſpecially if the Ieſuites and preaching Prieſts be but rooted out, which doe ſolder them ſo faſt and cloſe together, that were they quite baniſhed; they would moulder aſunder in ſhort time of themſelves.</p>

                  <p>This made Lord <hi>Mountjoy,</hi> ſo labour to ingratiate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with Secretary <hi>Cecil,</hi> a man powerful with the Queen, by which meanes all neceſſaries are timely ſent unto him, himſelfe incouraged to diligence, and had in honour and reputation in the eyes of his Souldiers. It was the only o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow of victorious <hi>Haniball,</hi> to bee ſecretly maligned, by the crafty wiles of <hi>Hanno</hi> working upon ſome thrifty humours of the Senators of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ready to urge all his proceeding to his diſadvantage.</p>

                  <p>It was then thought fit for the further countenancing of the Generall, for to leave the diſpoſing of many places, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Companies of the ſupplies ſent unto him, for ſo Gentlemen were kept in <hi>Ireland</hi> from being troubleſome in importuning authority for Companies in <hi>England,</hi> &amp; men did more indeavour to deſerve well being in the eye of him of whom they have, or elſe expect advancement, and by that meanes will he bee able to curbe the inſolencies and miſdemeanours, of many bad Captaines, who ſue and preſſe hard for command to make a living, rather then out of any love to the cauſe or Countrey, or any affection to their Companies, as may appeare by keeping of them imperfect, and ſo lay the greater burden of ſervice on the reſt, or elſe

                  <p>Theſe crimes in the Queenes wiſdome were thought ſo heynous, as that the offenders were made examples by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheering, degrading, and other notes of infamy.</p>
                  <p>And Captaines refuſing to ſhew their Companies, when they were required by the Commiſſaries of the Muſtors ſhould be checked two moneths pay, which will prove no ill preſident to be now obſerued.</p>
                  <p>Another inconvenience then happened in that there were not large Magazins of proviſion layd in the ſafe Townes lying on the Sea or great Rivers, for an Army has a large body, and much of it (like a frogs belly) and without that ſatisfaction the hands and knees are feeble.</p>
                  <p>And through the default of the Victualers there happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as great a miſchiefe, that ſeeing the ſtate of <hi>England</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all other Princes in their large allowance both by Sea and Land.

                  <p>But through the coozenage and deceit of the victualers, it is both cut ſhort in quantity, and unſavoury, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome in the quality breeding diſeaſes and infection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the poor ſouldiers. This is no news to any that have been in the late actions of the Engliſh, and will never be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe untill ſome ſevere courſe be taken with theſe cruell Harpies that ruine both King and people by uttering any muſty proviſion.</p>
