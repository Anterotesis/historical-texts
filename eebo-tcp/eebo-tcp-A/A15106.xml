         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <p>2. DEerely beloued: Now are we the sons
of God, but yet it doth not appeare
what wee shall bee. And wee knowe that
when hee shall appeare, wee shall be like
him, for wee shall see him as hee is:</p>
                  <p>3. And euery man that hath this hope pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
himselfe, euen as hee is pure.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His scripture (right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable)
doth naturally
diuide it selfe into three
principall partes. The
first is an Euangelicall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
proposition of the Apostle
<hi>Deerely beloued: Nowe
are wee the sonnes of
God.</hi> The second is an Anticipation or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
of an obiection. <hi>But yet it doth not
<pb facs="tcp:1996:4"/>
appeare what wee shalbe.</hi>] The third is an
exhortation vpon the premises. <hi>Hee that
hath this hope in him purgeth himselfe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as hee is pure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proposition, or assertion, is worthy
to be considered and thought vpon: nay, to
bee wondred and maruayled at, which at
this daie is admirable to the Aungells, and
Spirituall powers them selues, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12.
excepte wee shalbe found vngratefull vnto
God, and that that should bee respected of
Angels, and not of men, which pertayneth
to men, and not to Angels, Namely to bee
the sonnes of God. By nature there is but
one onely sonne of God, Iesus Christ, by
creation many, euen all the Myllions of
Angels, good and bad, <hi>Iob.</hi> 1. And by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
not a fewe, but an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of men, euen the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> as
many as are elected, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. And for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
péece or spice of the glory and maiesty
of God, shyning in the gouernment of the
world, the kinges and magistrates of the
earth are called gods, as sonnes of God:
<hi>Psalm.</hi> 82. So that albeit in creation <hi>Adam</hi>
be inferior vnto Angels, yet in the vnspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
worke of our redemption, he is superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or:
<pb facs="tcp:1996:4"/>
for the sonne of God did take our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not theirs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. and made
men the sonnes of God, and not Angels: he
often appeared in their forme, but neuer
tooke their substance, so that they all lie
vnder the iudgement as many as fell, and
are reserued in chaynes, vnto the darknes
of death, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 42. And of many rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
spirites not one shalbe saued: but of all
the race of Adam not one was despised of
him that died for all, though not all, but
many doe become the sonnes of God: as
more at large it might be cleared by the scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures.</p>
            <p>The proposition is indefinite, equiualent
to an vniuersall, you are the sonnes of God,
for you are all the sonnes of God, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
else where, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 26. For there is
neither Jewe nor Gretian, bonde nor free,
male nor female, there is no respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
in Christ: and all the children of <hi>Adam</hi>
are the sonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi> if they beleeue,
younge or olde, riche or poore, wise or sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The which although the Lord him
selfe doe say and that very oft in scriptures,
nay albeit for our faith sake hée sometimes
doe sweare that by two immutable things
<pb facs="tcp:1996:5"/>
wherin it is impossible that God should lie,
wée might receaue strong consolation, <hi>Heb.</hi>
6. 18. Yet notwithstanding it is, and hath
bene alwaies a Paradox vnto vs, vntill the
spirit doe bring his testimony to it, in our
hearts crying <hi>Abba father,</hi> as it is <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.
It is no maruaile therefore if one, a most
learned Rabby of the Jewes, a ruler, <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chodemus,</hi>
so long as he remained naturall
in him selfe, did not onely wonder and doubt
of this principle of religion, but plainely
doate, when hée sayd, <hi>How can a man bee
borne againe which is olde? can hee enter
into his mothers wombe againe, and be
borne? Iohn.</hi> 3. 4.<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> For thus the braine of
man might reason. Whatsoeuer is borne of
flesh is flesh: and to repeate the birth is
impossible in nature, and further then the
naturall course of thinges the heart of man
can neither reach, nor conceaue, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as ouercome in this care, hée standeth
still: <hi>howe can it bee?</hi> nay, he is armed on
the contrary side with many reasons and
respectes. Sprange wée not all of Adam?
came not hée out of the earth? went hée not
into the earth againe? and is not this the
way of all flesh? how say you then, wée are
<pb facs="tcp:1996:5"/>
the sonnes of God?<note place="margin">Solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> I answere that this
Generation is not after fleshe and bloude,
nor of the will of man, but of God, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.
That there came an Adam after Adam,
which was before Adam, who came from
God, and God was with him, and hée was
God, euen our Emanuell, God with vs,
who himselfe was made man, and the son
of man, that wée might be made the sonnes
of God. For as many as receaued him, that
is, that belieued on his name, he gaue them
power to bee the sonnes of God, <hi>Iohn. 12.
Wherefore call no man father vppon the
earth, saith Christ, for one is your father in
heauen, Mat.</hi> 23. A father, not for sunne,
and raine and no further, but wée are heires
and ioynt heires with Christ of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. In déede with the wicked
God dealeth as <hi>Abraham</hi> did with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonnes<note place="margin">Gen. 25. 6.</note>
of his Contubins, hée geueth them certaine
giftes, and sendeth them away. But he that
shall inherite is <hi>Isaak,</hi> the Childe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
with whom wée are heires annexed of
the same blessing: and the excellency of
this thing passeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore measure of mans
capacitie, whether you respect the cause,
(Gods merries:) or the effect thereof, (mans
<pb facs="tcp:1996:6"/>
saluation) especially if you fall into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of the greatnes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> price, which
can no more bee valued than God him selfe,
for he gaue himselfe which is God: &amp; albeit
<hi>Iudas</hi> plaid the traitor kindly to sell him for
30. siluerlinges, yet <hi>Peter</hi> maketh him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable
&amp; therefore doth reiect both siluer
&amp; golde as base and corrupt Mettal. <hi>You are
redeemed</hi> (saith hée) <hi>not with siluer or gold
but with the precious bloude of Christ, as
of a lambe vndefiled, and without spotte,
1. pet.</hi> 1. All the worlde is not worthy to
serue for one counter in this reckoning: for
all the treasures thereof are but meere cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
And men &amp; Angels must geue place
to the sonne of God, and let him alone with
this matter for euer who hath opened all
the Treasures of his goodnes, euen the
fountaines of his loue, and hath powred
out the bowels of his mercy. Wherefore,
if either the great price a man payeth doe
cause great loue of the thinges so bought,
or the grieuous paine a woman suffreth in
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Throes and pangues of her Trauaile
doe procure a perpetuall minde and memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of her Issue and will not possibly admit
forgetfulnes of the same for euer, <hi>Isay.</hi> 49.
<pb facs="tcp:1996:6"/>
Then there is no cause at all of any doubt
in Christ whose loue cannot goe backe, him
selfe being risen from the dead and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
into heauen who stucke fast vnto vs in
all the agonies and anguish of his death, &amp;
though hée turned his head, yet hée chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
not his heart: but drancke the draught
of death and damnation for the time. Just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
therefore might <hi>Iohn</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> apostle terme the
christians here (deerely beloued) at which
loue him selfe séemeth to stande astonied in
the first verse of this chapter, and therefore
by way of admiration hée laboureth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it. (Beholde what loue the father
hath shewed on vs, that wée shoulde bée cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the sonnes of God.) Wherefore séeing
God him selfe hath sayd it, and shewed vs
all his secret counsell in it, (for otherwise
Christ so borne and buried, so rising and
raigning shoulde haue bene but happy for
him selfe, and not at all for vs) except God
had so ordained him to bee a mediator for
vs and set him out to bee a propitiation for
our sinnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Nay, séeing the Lorde
hath sworne it as you haue heard, let vs
geue glory vnto God and belieue and liue,
let vs belieue not hystorically, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
<pb facs="tcp:1996:7"/>
but after the spirit. For as an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
knowledge of earthly thinges by the
meanes of faith doth help a man to heauen,
so an earthly knowledge of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things
bée it neuer so excellent, yet through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flesh
it doth but send a man to hell: And because
the Apostle doth so vrge the instance of the
present time, directly pressing this worde:
<hi>(Now) now are wee the sonnes of God,</hi> Let
vs not dreame that wee were his sonnes
before wée did belieue, as if it were of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:
or that wée shall become his sonnes
after wée haue belieued, as if it were not of
grace: but let vs firmely hold with the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
that wée are nowe the sonnes of God,
euen when we doe belieue. You were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
but you are now light in the Lorde,
<hi>Ephe.</hi> 5. 8. Prooue your selues therefore
whether you bee in the faith, sayth the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. You shall easely finde
whether you haue faith or noe, except you
will deceaue your selues. And it fareth not
with faith as with the eies of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body, which
the further off it seeth, the brighter and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is; but true faith, except it be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
name, or shrine of faith, the greater it
is, the neerer it findeth and beholdeth the

               </p>
               <p>It is most sure that God doth know who
be his, albeit men may easely deceaue them
selues with an opinion of faith. For super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition
séemeth to bee true Religion, and
Hypocrisie is very like to christian professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and there is a faith which is maruelous
forwarde and feruent for the time, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
but temporary in the ende. Wherefore
it standeth vs vpon to cast off all Hypocrisie
and double dealing with God, and to looke
soundly to our selues, for Cocle cannot bée
discerned from Corne in the blade, &amp; Chaffe

<pb facs="tcp:1996:8"/>
in Religion which roabe themselues with
the out side thereof for the time, but robbe
God of his honour, which professe the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
but in peace doe plague and persecute
the sainctes, which are afrayd of nothinge
more than of an extraordinary measure of
the light, they are nowe Gods sonnes: for
so they wilbe called: but yet it doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peere
what they shalbe when hee commeth
which hath his phanne in his hande: who
can seuer the shéepe from the goates: who
called as déepe dessemblers as them selues,
Hypocrites and painted Sepulchers, let the

               <p>But these wordes goe another way and

it is a concession or a graunting to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary
so much: that whatsoeuer appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
in this life, or can appeare, it is but
poore and miserable, &amp; too vile and base for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

all and euery one there is but one and the

the riche and poore you can finde no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
nay wise and foolishe are all one in

There is no oddes betwene a man and a

you may not iudge by sight, but by faith,
not after the externall thinges which are

                  <hi>Isay</hi> doth properly play the Harold when
he maketh corruption the coate of all men:
<hi>All fleshe is grasse,] Esay</hi> 40. And least hée
should seeme to doe iniury vnto great men,
hee doth geue it with a difference, <hi>And all

To whom <hi>Solomon</hi> the kinge consenteth
<pb facs="tcp:1996:9"/>
who termeth the totall summe of all things
vanity of vanities. All thinges vnder the
Moone (say the Philosophers) are mutable,
but the prophet telleth vs that euery thing
vnder the Sunne is corruptible and vaine.
I will not now speake of the infinite neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities
of the poore, with the which hee being
daily pinched and pressed, cannot choose but
he weary of his life: (for it is most euident)
neither can I conueniently discourse of the
godly, whose condition is not better, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
worse than the rest. For how so euer it
goeth they are certayne of bitternesse in
this life, if they hée euill, God wilbe vpon
them, if they bee good the euill will both
hate, and hunt, and persecute them: they
are sure to bée exposed to the tyrants of the
time, the proude persons of the worlde, and
to all the sonnes of the Deuill. If any spéede
well in this life, by all likelyhoode it is the
Rich, for they are the men of this worlde,
the day and time is theirs, they rule and
strike the stroke, they liue and take their
pleasure as they list, and therefore is the
world set in their heartes, for where the
treasure is there the heart will bee.<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 21.</note> But
yet notwithstanding, if a man shall duely
<pb facs="tcp:1996:9"/>
waigh the continuall vexations of spirit,
the sodaine reciprocations and chaungings
as often as of the Moone, the ircksomnes of
pleasures themselues, together with the
vncertainty and shortnes of their breath,
which is as it were a hooke of God set in
the nostrells of all the sonnes of men to
restraine them with all, he will soone gene
his consent, that the states and starres of
this worlde are miserable for all their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
if not the more miserable, which is
most certaine. For the greatest part of riche
men, they are miserable, because whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
they enioy, it is but as a dreame, &amp; but
as a shadowe whatsoeuer they followe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it is all vncertayne &amp; vnconstant: yea,
as the Ship doth swiftly trace the Seas, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Birde with quicke winge doth fly in the
Skies, or as an Arrowe shot strongly at a
marke, so hasteth and passeth pleasure fast
away, and riches with Eagles winges doe
often take the morning flight. Wée see that
great rentes, and reuenewes doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
keepe vs company in our life, and in
death they are sure to depart: they are but
as the Aples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> which if you touch
them they turne to dust, or as the Goord of
<pb facs="tcp:1996:10"/>
                  <hi>Ionas</hi> which withered in a moment: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doe they redéeme the life from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> graue.<note place="margin">Psal. 49.</note>
They cannot, wisedome is not able to do it,
because time as a tiraunt casteth all downe
and laieth all a longe, yea being the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
line and measure of euery thing, it wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
out the very heauens as a garment,
and being swift in all other thinges it is
both swift &amp; short in the life of man. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the prophet saith our life is but a span
long, 49. <hi>Psalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You haue heard the difference that <hi>Isay</hi>
gaue betweene the grasse &amp; the flower. The
flower is more orient, but not more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent:
yea, sooner fadeth the flower than the
grasse, and though in corruption there be no
difference, yet to corruption there is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
spéede in the one than in the other: as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Sunne, the eye of the worlde can testifie.
And as soone, as soddayne, as often, and as
miserably dieth the Riche and honourable
person as the poore and naked soule, which
thing this prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t spectacle can demonstrate.
The reason is, because all the grace and
glory of the fleshe, it is but as the grasse or
flower of the field, <hi>I haue said you are Gods
but you shall die like men, Psalm.</hi> 82. 6.
<pb facs="tcp:1996:10"/>
Wherefore if a man coulde possibly bee as
glorious as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne: yea, though he were y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
crowned king, or second to the king his son,
or as one of the Princes fellowes, so that
for his excellency and beauty he might well
bee compared to that glittering Image in
the Prophet <hi>Dan.</hi> 2, 31. whose head was of
golde, his breast and armes of siluer, his
belly and thyghes of brasse, and legges of
Iron: yet his féete are alwaies parted with
brickle clay. This is the foote of all fleshe:
claye, and this is their only way into the
earth, in the which way wée are all caried
with continuall motion. And as all the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
doe runne into the Sea from whence
they sprange, so by a decree hasteth <hi>Adam</hi>
into the earth from whence hee came, and
stayeth no where, from the byrth vnto the
graue. For as we all increase wée doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
and in vaine doth a man expect his
death to come, a great part whereof is past
to him that hath liued many or any yeares.
Singular therefore is the Metaphor of the
flower to florish out the nature of the great
ones of the earth, who in scripture are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
these termes otherwise commended to
them selues, as by vapoures, shaddowes
<pb facs="tcp:1996:11"/>
blastes of winde, bladders of water, &amp; not
onely vanitye, but vanitie of vanities, so
quickly in the turninge of a hande, nay in
the twinckling of an eye commeth man to
naught. And as the great worlde in the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
vp and conclusion of nature, shall at
once euen in a moment receaue a chaunge,
so in an instant <hi>Adam</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle worlde falleth
and commeth to his end, for too day a man, &amp;
too morrow none: nay, now a king, and now
a piece of clay. Wherefore, if the dayes of
man vppon earth were as the dayes of an
Duke, if his height were as one of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars
of Lybanus, so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> his excellency might
mount vp to the heauens, &amp; his heade reach
vnto the cloudes, if hée were alwaies as
gréene and fresh as the Lawrell, or fat as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
Olyue: if all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of his yeares were eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>The poore man laboureth for his liuinge,

and the riche man for his life, and whose co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

is better iudge you: for both are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued
quickly into ashes, and doe loose their
bones, euen the pillers of their bodies in the
dust. Nowe, if the greatest parte of our life
past may iustly séeme vnto man to bee but
yesterday (so soone it is spent and gone) why
shall not the least parte remaining appeare
but as too morowe, especially séeing it may
be consumed this very day or houre. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the shortnes of our spirites, the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainety
is woonderfull, when there are a
thousand waies and meanes to geue a man
his ende, and to cutte the corde or thred,
the very line of life. But men are for the
most part carelesse and secure in life, and too
too timorous &amp; fearefull in their death, and
so <hi>Adam</hi> is alwaies in extremes, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
after the prouerbe many had rather
choose to bee lyuing dogges than to be dead
Lyons.<note place="margin">Eccle. 9.</note> I doe not speake this as if it were

               <p>As I trust I may both freely and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
speake vnto you of this late right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable
person, to the laying vp of whose bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
in the treasury of the earth, you are
this day assembled, who doe yet liue and
florish in the worlde in great wisedome, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and dignity. That hee was a stemme
of a noble house, which himselfe hath hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with many and principall vertues, but
especially with faithfull seruice alwaies to
his king, vnto whom both younge, and olde,
hee was euer in great trust, either in warre
a valiant Captaine, or in Peace a worthy
Counsellor, besides many honourable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassages.
As in the time of king Edwarde
that swéete and fragrant flower (who was
cut downe in his springe, and died in his
armes) hee was sent into Fraunce &amp; since
her Maiesties most excellent raigne, both
into Fraunce and Scotland diuers times,
being of the most noble order of the Garter,
and of her Highnes right honourable priuy
Counsell, foure times Lord Justice, &amp; three
times Lord Deputy in the Irish parts, and
also Lord chiefe President of the Countrey
<pb facs="tcp:1996:12"/>
of Wales, in which place he gouerned with
great honor 26. yeres, &amp; being visited of God
in a good age of 57. yeres he deceased in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi>
What should I stand to play the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
or the painter in this place, I know it
is not looked for at my handes, but yet to tel
the trueth it shall geue glory vnto God. And
séeing hée hath sowed the fruite of his wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in peace, it shall yéelde vnto himselfe a
worthy Fame, and to his Seede a certaine
print or marke of their fathers steps, who
was a treasure of the common wealth and
a common good of his countrey. And surely
the land hath lost a mightie man, and as it
were a starre is fallen which sometimes
shined in his place, but nowe beholde he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the dust: and so doeth the righteous
person, and no man regardeth the euils that
are to come, <hi>Isay</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>If the wisedome of a man do make his
face to shine, and if without light the sonne
be nothing worth, surely his name deserues
with vs a pillar of gold which had and held
so many offices &amp; so great: nay which bare
them so long, and weilded them so wel, who
truely as a candle consumed himselfe in yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
light to other men: Besides his speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb facs="tcp:1996:13"/>
gift of affabilitie to poore and simple men
the very grace of all his greatnes. It is no
hard matter for a man to be humble in low
estate, but to be lowly in greatnes is not a
common gift: and if pride her selfe be often
forced to dissemble humilitie, because low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
maketh a simple man to be highly
commended, how much more doeth it excell,
when it shall in deede appeare in persons of
value &amp; renoune? Wherfore if any man wil
builde his house high, let him lay his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
very lowe, forenuie shootes at high
marks and pride goeth before a fal. But the
greatest praise that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue, or he receiue,
either in this world, or in the world to come,
is of his constant perseuerance in that faith
which he had long professed, and of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and ioy in his last end. Of al which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
credibly certified, I doubt not in Gods
behalfe to pronounce him moste happy. And
here I intended to haue spoken in fewe
wordes to his noble issue, but it shal nowe
suffice that I pray for him, that hee which
must succeed him in his family, may if it be
possible excéede him in his vertues, or at the
least imitate them, that God may gyrd him
with his fathers gyrdle, &amp; fasten the naile
<pb facs="tcp:1996:13"/>
of his tent in a sure place, that he may be
the glorie of his fathers house, and a father
to many inhabitants of <hi>Iuda,</hi> which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord
promised to <hi>Eliachim</hi> his seruant whom he
made steward vnto king <hi>Ezekias,</hi> because he
loued well the faithfull, <hi>Isay</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>And because there can not be a readier
way to cut the throte of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth,
than by exalting of the wicked and vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
the Lord blesse our Magistrates, and
rulers with true religion, wisedome, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and humilitie, and all wayes free our
countrey from tyrantes and proud persons,
who as <hi>Nymrods</hi> doe but wound by oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
the poore people, and neuer heale them
by counsel. And as this day especially requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
let vs beséech the Lorde to maintaine
our peace at home and his warres abroade,
together with the excellent and honorable
persons imployed that wayes, that all the
enemy Papists may knowe that there is a
God of Israel which is able to giue the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
to his own name, when they are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
and confounded. But I haue dwelt
too long on these things, I wil returne and
make maruelous haste in the rest.</p>
               <p>In the meane time the Question remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth

strong all the honour in the worlde,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
notwithstanding, how mortall men inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with a thousand euils, closed vp and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with so many kinds of miseries, may
be saide to be the sonnes of God: especially
considering howe they are sodenly taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by death, as if they had not béene, or
as if they should neuer be againe.</p>
               <p>The Apostle answereth effectually,<note place="margin">Solutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
not what we shal be. For we might
as well except against Christe with the
Jewes, waying his birth in a maunger, his
life loaden with miseries of all sortes, his
death most accursed, that he was not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne
of God: but in his resurrection hée begun to
appeare, and more clearely hee shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
in his ascension but in his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
it shalbe most manifest vnto all the
world.<note place="margin">Phil. 3. Colos. 5. 3</note> And when he which is our glorie
shal appeare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shal also appeare with
him in glorie. A thing that is hid cannot
be seene, our life is hid with Christ in God,
and therfore he saith it doth not appeare, &amp;c.
Foure thinges I must needes obserue vnto
you by the occasion of the words following,
the first is, how that all the excellencie of
the sonnes of God lieth in these words (<hi>We
<pb facs="tcp:1996:14"/>
shalbe like vnto him,</hi>) which in truth excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all declaration, and therefore after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
similitudes of a crown and kingdome,
wherby the Scriptures do speake vnto our
capacitie, they conclude the glorie to be
such, as no eye hath seene, no eare hath
heard, and no heart can conceaue, 1. <hi>Cor. 2.
9.</hi> For we must not thinke that onely vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and common persons, but the kings and
princes of the earth shal feele in themselues
an admirable brightnesse when they shall
taste of this glorie in such sort that they shal
confesse that they were nothing before. For
if <hi>Salomon</hi> the most glorious king that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was, yet in all his Royaltie was not
like a lillie of the fielde, what shal we iudge
of them that shall be like vnto the Sonne
of God.</p>
               <p>And when he saith (<hi>like:</hi>) he maketh vs
not equall and fellowelike, for in all things
Christ the head of Angelles must haue the
preheminence, because he is the Sonne: and
if the Saintes shal differ from themselues
in glorie, which séemeth by the similitude
of the starres vsed in the same cause, 1. <hi>Cor.
15.</hi> howe much more shall the naturall
sonne of God excell in glorie, because he is
<pb facs="tcp:1996:15"/>
the head? And if the beautie of the militant
Church restored, is said to be such, as if the
Moone should shine as the Sunne, and the
Sunne should excéede himself seuen times,
<hi>Isay</hi> 30. 26. how much more shall it be in
the Church Triumphant in the heauenly
Jerusalem, where Christ himselfe is the
light and glorie of all the saints? The forme
of which citie, and the riches excéeding all
golde or precious stone is yet by such things
described as it could, <hi>Reue.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>And here the resurrection is moste eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
affirmed and assured, albeit that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
aske the head before the other parts, and
we know that Christes is first and past: So
surely shall they that are Christes be next
at his comming, and then commeth the
iudgement: it shalbe sodaine in a moment
but in a wonderful order. If any doubt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
because it is to come, as a foole he is
reproued by the naturall euidence of a séede
dying and quickening againe, whereby the
resurrection is more than shadowed out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our faith, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. It shalbe with the
same bodie, and the same skin, and with the
same eyes and no other shall I sée my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>déemer
faith the moste patient <hi>Iob.</hi> 19. 27.
<pb facs="tcp:1996:15"/>
that is, the substance of the body remaining
the same, the qualitie shalbe cleane altered,
which is no monstrous paradox, as that of
Poperie:<note place="margin">The Papists grosse error of transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation.</note> (the accidents remaining the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
being taken away) which in reason
is absurd, &amp; most monstrous against nature
her selfe. The glorious chaunge is noted, 1.
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15. for mortalitie immortalitie, for
corruption incorruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and glorie &amp;c. There
is nothing that can more comfort vs in or
against death, than the resurrection from
the dead by the hope whereof our bones doe
liue in the graue, and our flesh doth rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he shal not leaue our soules in hell nor
suffer his holy ones to see corruption, <hi>Psal.
16.</hi> In the olde time this matter was plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signified by the translation of <hi>Henoch</hi>
and <hi>Elias,</hi> but nowe it is more fully sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
and assured by the resurrection of Jesus
Christ, whose resurrection and ascension is
ours in as much as he is ours appointed to
be our head, and we his body.</p>
               <p>The second is that though the time when
all this shalbe, be not here nor else where
particularly assigned in the Scriptures, yet
it is most certaine <hi>When hee shall appeare.</hi>
The day is dated and most certainly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb facs="tcp:1996:16"/>
with God, but otherwise vnknowen
to men and Angelles, nay hidden from the
eyes of the Sonne of man him selfe in as
much as he is man. They are therefore the
more bolde or blinde coniecturers, who doe
thrust them selues most fearefully into the
secretes of God, &amp; dare appoint a day which
he hath kept alone vnto himself.<note place="margin">Demer. Act. 1.</note> Faith tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
hope doth expect the very instant, but
yet knoweth not the day, and therefore
thorough patience doth quiet her selfe, and
resteth within vs no lesse vntil the time,
than the Coarse doeth tarrie in the graue.
Christ did rise the third day, perhaps to day
or to morowe the dead shal arise, but when
soeuer it shalbe, it shalbe as to morowe to
all that are a sléepe in the earth, albeit they
haue lyen in the dust fiue thousande yéeres
before, because there is no time to them,
and both the bodies of the good and bad fare
all alike in the graue, but yet there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of their soules now, and shall be of
their bodies then, when the voyce of God
shall rayse them out of the pitte, neither
shall it be necessarie for the soules that are
separated from the bodies to spend time in
returning from heauen, or hell againe,
<pb facs="tcp:1996:16"/>
when as the Scriptures do teach vs, that in
the twinckling of an eie and in the least and
last moment, not without wonderfull and
fearefull miracle, both the resurrection and
the iudgement by the power of God shal be
begun and finished.</p>
               <p>The third thing is,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.</note> the certaintie of our
saluation, and as it were the anker holde in
this that he saith, <hi>We know we shalbe like
vnto him,</hi> which maketh mightely against
the Papistes, who do holde that for a chiefe
point of their faith, which we knowe to be
a great infirmitie of our fleshe, that is, to
doubt or to distrust, and they call it presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
to say <hi>we knowe,</hi> which yet is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of God that cannot presume.</p>
               <p>The certaintie of faith is greater than of
any sense, because of the promise, from the
which faith may no more be parted than
the house may be separated from his foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
and stand. And the reason that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
all the faithful to be so bold? is because
that that which might alter the case, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fall in the nature of God, with whome
is no chaunge,<note place="margin">Iames. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> nor shadow of chaunge, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in will, nor power, both which are as
firme and constant as himselfe: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:1996:17"/>
he that will distrust the Lorde, let him
beléeue nothing. In this pickle they stand,
or rather in this puddle they sinke, who
wickedly trust vnto their workes, and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishly
beléeue that there are thrée sortes of
places for resorte of soules after death:
namely, Heauen, Hell, and Purgatorie,
and to which of these the soule doeth passe,
Poperie cannot tel, which is a warme com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to a soule departing. As if a man were
cast into the Sea and comming to the land
were returned backe againe, perhaps he
might sinke and perhaps he might swimme.
But we thanke the Lorde and his Christe
we are better dealt with all than so. We
know we shall liue if we beléeue, because he
hath said it, and we know that they that do
not beléeue are so sure of death as that they
are iudged already, <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3. 18. Wherfore in
the meane season, hope serueth to nourishe
our faith and patience to possesse our soules
which were but séely and simple meanes to
relieue the heart, if that faith were not
out of al doubt in the promise of the word.
Last of all is the reason to confirme vs in
the expectation of our glorie, <hi>For we shal see
him as he is,</hi> which words do send vs vnto
<pb facs="tcp:1996:17"/>
Christ as he now sitteth at the right hande
of God his father, and as he shall most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
appeare in the cloudes, with all his
Angelles, armed with fire and power for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge.
He is now ascended from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the earth, vnto the very heigth of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.
We must not therefore basely thinke
of Christ, as apish Papistes dreame, because
he is full glorified in himselfe. He was born
in a manger, he did liue poorely vpon earth,
hee died miserably on the crosse, hee was
crowned, but with thornes, mocked, and
scorned in all the anxietie of his soule, and
in the anguish of his death he was forced to
yéelde forth strong cries in the dayes of his
flesh, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
mee.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 46.</note> It was so because it became
Christ so to suffer, but nowe it is nothing so
but otherwise, and, <hi>we shall see him as he is,</hi>
and not as he was. We shal sée him, but not
as <hi>Peter</hi> and the rest, when he appeared
glorified on the mount <hi>Tabor</hi> but partly,
and after a sort, <hi>Matt.</hi> 19. whose brightnesse
yet the Apostles could not beare, though
it were not long, nor fully reuealed vnto
them: but we shal beholde him, as the onely
Emperour sitting in the throne of heauen,
<pb facs="tcp:1996:18"/>
with all his hoste of Saintes, and spiritual
powers, not by faith as nowe, but truely by
sight: not in the mirror of his worde, but
in the presence of himselfe.</p>
               <p>So the wicked shall see him when he
commeth,<note place="margin">Obiec.</note> for al flesh shal beholde him, <hi>Mat.</hi>
29. 30. It is true. But this thing shalbe
their death a thousand times,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> that they
shal sée him, in whome they haue not belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
nay him whom they haue pearced <hi>Ioh.
19. Zach.</hi> 12. They shall sée him as <hi>Adam</hi>
heard the voyce of God in Paradize, and
ran away <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. If no mortall wight can
beare or abide the glorie of an Angell, but
he must tremble and feare, melt and fall in
sunder for the brightnesse: how much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
horror and confusion shalbe to the sinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
creature, when the Creator is in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and ready to enter his indgement?
But mercie shall worke in that day toward
all beléeuers, according to the couenant, and
we shall be chaunged into his glorie after
an image, when we shall behold him as he
is, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. These things ought to kéepe
our faith and hope aliue in the promise, and
against all temptations to make vs moste
patient: for if we be afflicted, we are more
<pb facs="tcp:1996:18"/>
sutable vnto Christe. We must kéepe the
possession of our selues, and of our soules by
patience, not by insensibilitie, but by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fring
after Christ, &amp; by <hi>Hope</hi> we must cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
and cut off all preposterous humors
and affections of the fleshe, which doe but
wound our faith, and cast a man into many
perplexities remedilesse, if he promis to him
selfe any other thing, or do looke for it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
or sooner, or later than God hath ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in his word. It is lawfull for a man to
burne in desire, and for this cause speaketh
the Apostle to stirre vs vp: and celeritie in
desire séemeth alwaies to be delaie, but the
qualitie of faith through hope, is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with the opportunitie of God, called
the Lordes leasure, knowing for a suretie
that she shall once sée him as he is.</p>

most fréely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himself, yet there are alwais
certaine couenantes &amp; conditions required,
as faithfulnesse and obedience to the word.
So <hi>Abraham</hi> our Father with whome the
contract was first made, and as it were left
in his hand for vs, is commaunded to walke
vprightly before the Lorde, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1.</p>
               <p>And so albeit we are saued fréely, yet it is
by faith, and not by euery starting faith,
but if we doe continue to the end, <hi>Matt.</hi> 10.
And because there is no other way to make
our calling sure, than by adding vertue to
our faith, therefore true faith is alwayes
fruitefull, neuer idle nor wearie of good
workes: for albeit they be no cause, yet
they are the way to heauen, for by these
meanes an entring into the euerlasting

vnto vs, 2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> reasoneth
thus, <hi>No workes and no faith,</hi> and Saint
<hi>Iohn</hi> in this place thus, <hi>No purging of our
selues, and no hope,</hi> all one in conclusion. He
that mindeth not sanctification shall neuer
sée the Lorde, <hi>Hebr. 12. 14. but the pure in

whole matter being firmely past by worde,
and othe from God: nay, beeing fully done
and finished by the life and death of Christe.
Wherefore if <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradize, and the
Angels in heauen, euen in their creation
did stand vpon their obedience, which when
they forsooke they fell: howe much more
should man in his redemption content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
with the couenants of God, especially
séeing they are such as doe not hinder, but
further him in the faith &amp; life of Christ?</p>
               <p>And albeit such perfection is required,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> as
séemeth &amp; is impossible vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>To be pure

he dealeth not with vs as by the rigor of the
law, (though he might iustly iudge vs for all
our transgressions and wants therin) but he
setteth vp himselfe as a marke of perfection
to aime &amp; contend vnto, as <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 14. And
because we can neuer come néere vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in this life, and yet we ought to presse
<pb facs="tcp:1996:20"/>
hard, and to followe after it, what else doth
the Apostle meane by these words, but that
there should be in vs a continuall indeuour
to procéede from vertue to vertue, and neuer
to desist, vntill we come into the brightnesse
of his presence?</p>
               <p>And as this place giueth no allowance to
mens workes after the Romish rate, who
may aswel think to clense durt with dung,
as to purge sinne with their desert: (for if

it answereth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as Calumnious enimies,
