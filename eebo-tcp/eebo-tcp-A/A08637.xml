            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>CLear was the ſhadow of the circling yeare</l>
            <l>In th' embleme of an hooped ſnake: As clear</l>
            <l>Was th' ancient Myſtick's ring to repreſent</l>
            <l>Heav'ns endleſſe motion and time's ſweet conſent:</l>
            <l>This was that reverend ring did conjugate</l>
            <l>Dame <hi>Veſta</hi> to her ſtarre-enamell'd mate.</l>
            <l>For fear time 's harmony through pauſe ſhould fail,</l>
            <l>The yearly ſnake in 's teeth doth bite his tail.</l>
            <l>This was that ſnake which <hi>Naſo's</hi> Muſe did ſtrive</l>
            <l>By her enchanting numbers to revive.</l>
            <l>Event o'recame her wiſh; Her ring complete</l>
            <l>She deck'd with native pearls of rich conceit.</l>
            <l>Curs'd be that <hi>Ibis,</hi> whoſe devouring maw</l>
            <l>Half of this ſnake ingorg'd, e're that it ſaw</l>

            <l>Perhaps this choler's raſh: the Glutton Time</l>

            <l>The cormorant forgot ('t is like) what meat</l>

            <l>Th' Years perfect ring; to him the coyeſt Dame</l>

His birth was gentile, his father being in the order of Knighthood; and ſo afterwards was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Come to years of diſcretion, he with his elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther employed his ſtudies under the moſt famous Grammarians and Rhetoricians in <hi>Rome</hi>: but ſpecially himſelf was inſtructed by <hi>Plotius Grippo</hi>; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became in favour with <hi>M. Varro</hi> and <hi>Corn. Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus.</hi> He bent his ſtudies to the Law; yet more to pleaſe his father then his own fanſie: where he defended cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall cauſes; and gave ſentence among the <hi>Centum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viri.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:25106:7"/>
His oratory was exquiſite and excellent: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not without good cauſe <hi>Seneca</hi> ranketh him among the beſt Oratours. At length, his father dying, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his affected Muſes, and became entirely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Poets of thoſe times, <hi>Macer Veronen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> who writ of Herbs, Birds, and Serpents; <hi>Ponticus,</hi> who penned <hi>Thebais; Propertius</hi> the Elegiack, <hi>Battus</hi> the Iambick, and <hi>Horace</hi> the Lyrick Poet. At laſt he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the warres under <hi>M. Varro,</hi> and with him travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into <hi>Aſia</hi>; and before his return to <hi>Rome</hi> he had got no ſmall acquaintance with the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried three wives; but enjoyed not the two firſt very long: The laſt lived with him lovingly and conſtantly; to whom he expreſſeth much true affection in his <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stium</hi> and <hi>De Ponto,</hi> with many praiſes of her for her love, conſtancie, &amp;c. By her he had one daughter named <hi>Perilla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At length, in the fiftieth yeare of his age, he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> into <hi>Tomos</hi> among the barbarous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Scythia:</hi> Where, as ſome affirm, he continued till the ninth yeare, and then died: But his own writings make mention but of the ſeventh yeare: of which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the firſt three years he wrote his <hi>Triſtium,</hi> in the reſt his <hi>De Ponto.</hi> For <hi>Triſt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Eleg.</hi> 12. thus he ſayeth, <q>

And in this yeare was the triumph of <hi>Tiberius</hi> upon the <hi>Dalmatians</hi> and <hi>Illyrians,</hi> which he mentioneth in the firſt and ſecond Elegies of the ſecond Book. After this, <hi>Book</hi> 4. <hi>Eleg</hi> 6. he goeth on, <q>

The like <hi>Eleg.</hi> 13. of the ſame book. Nor doth he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any longer time, except it be thus: In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſeventh yeare of his exile, in a congratulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <note place="margin">

yeare, though ſeven in relegation: For the firſt yeare he ſpent in his voyage. Beſide, ſeeing that there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by him of the acts of <hi>Germanicus</hi> performed in theſe his laſt years againſt the <hi>Catti</hi> and <hi>Cheruſci,</hi> (which he would never have omitted had life allowed him the fame of them, eſpecially becauſe he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically forementioned his Triumph yet future,<note place="margin">

            <p>
               <note place="margin">The cauſe of his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</note>For the cauſe of his baniſhment there may be many opinions. Some from the authority of <hi>Sidonius</hi> affirm that he had amorous dealings with <hi>Livia</hi> or <hi>Julia,</hi> daughter to <hi>Augustus,</hi> whom he masketh under the name of <hi>Corinna</hi>; and for this cauſe was puniſhed. But if we well ponder the words of <hi>Sidonius</hi> concerning <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> we ſhall find it otherwiſe; <q>
                  <l>Et te carmina per libidinoſa</l>

                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan>
                     </hi> miſſum,</l>
                  <l>Quondam <hi>Caeſareae</hi> nimis puellae</l>
                  <l>Falſo nomine ſubditum <hi>Corinnae.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And thee too, wanton <hi>Naſo,</hi> ſo renown'd</l>
                  <l>For amorous verſes, and to <hi>Tomos</hi> bound,</l>
                  <l>Too much in love with that <hi>Caeſarean</hi> Maid</l>
                  <l>With whom in falſe <hi>Corinna's</hi> name thou plaid.</l>
               </q>
Upon theſe laſt words, <hi>Caeſareae puellae,</hi> they build their argument, opinionating that it was <hi>Caeſars</hi> daughter. But it is well known that <hi>Puella</hi> doth not ſo well ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Filia,</hi> a Daughter, or <hi>Neptis</hi> a Niece, as <hi>Ancilla</hi> a Maid: as <hi>Puer</hi> is uſed both by Poets and Oratours as well for a Servant as for a Sonne, or Young man; yea, rather more frequently: Which alſo <hi>Paulus Juriſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultus</hi> ſheweth in his <hi>De Verborum ſignificatione.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:25106:8"/>
therefore I rather conclude that he loved ſome (as I may ſo give the term) <hi>Lady of Honour</hi> in <hi>Caeſars</hi> Court; and her he calleth <hi>Corinna.</hi> Beſides, in his books <hi>Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> of which <hi>Corinna</hi> is the chief ſubject, there is no paſſage mentioned ſuitable to a Princeſſe. They go to the ſame ſupper: It is not likely that he ſhould go with the Princeſſe. He wiſheth many imprecations upon her husband: How ſhould he dare to do it to <hi>Caeſar</hi>! She cometh to him: This a Princeſſe would have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to have done; and many more of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which plainly prove it could not be the Princeſſe. Moreover, in all his writings, either in his <hi>Triſtium</hi> or <hi>De Ponto,</hi> he maketh no complaint of <hi>Love,</hi> but of his <hi>Ars Amandi,</hi> nor uttereth any thing againſt his <hi>Love</hi>: and that which was the cauſe of his puniſhment he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth an <hi>errour</hi> onely; no <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>diſhoneſty:</hi> as if he would have ſaid, that by an errour he happened to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover anothers crime: Which, as ſome ſay, was his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Julia</hi> in her nakedneſſe; or rather he took <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> in the very act of ſome ignoble crime: And this we collect from that place, <hi>Trist. lib.</hi> 2. <q>
                  <l>Cur aliquid vidi? cur noxia lumina feci?</l>
                  <l>Cur imprudenti cognita culpa mihi?</l>
                  <l>Inſcius <hi>Actaeon</hi> vidit ſine veſte <hi>Dianam;</hi>

                  <l>Praeda ſuis canibus non minùs ille fuit.</l>
                  <l>Why did I ſtain mine eyes? why did I ſee?</l>
                  <l>Alas, that e'r the crime was known to me!</l>
                  <l>Thus poore <hi>Actaeon</hi> unawares once ſpy'd</l>

                     <hi>Diana</hi> naked; yet a prey he dy'd.</l>
               </q>
Here he ſheweth that his errour was the ſpying of ſome ſecret crime committed by another: and thereupon he adjoyneth the example of <hi>Actaeon</hi> and <hi>Diana</hi>; That as <hi>Actaeon</hi> unawares ſpy'd that which was not fit for him to ſee, and ſo incurred <hi>Diana's</hi> diſpleaſure and his own deſtruction; ſo he happened upon ſome diſaſtrous fight, thereby incurring his Princes anger and his own ruine.

But above all, his own works teſtifie of him to this day, and clearly demonſtrate, that what reſpect the world, and what approof and commendations Authours have given him, was not affected but well deſerved: For he hath left many fair monuments of his wit, both in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick and Elegiack verſe, which are no mean ornaments of the <hi>Latine</hi> tongue. He penned divers Heroicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles; III. Books <hi>De Arte Amandi</hi>; II. Books <hi>De Remedio Amoris</hi>; II. Books <hi>De Amore</hi>; Of <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> XV. Books.

               <hi>Quintilianus</hi> and <hi>Corn. Tacitus,</hi> and not without deſert; for in it he hath ſhewn the very vigour and quinteſſence of wit.

He penned an Epiſtle to <hi>Livia</hi> in conſolation for the death of <hi>Druſus.</hi> He began a book of the <hi>Actian</hi> warre. He wrote II.

Divers ſuppoſe he began this work at <hi>Rome,</hi> and not unlikely: but he ended it in <hi>Pontus,</hi> as may be collected from his Preface, and many other places of his book, but ſpecially from a Diſtich in the fourth Book; <q>

                  </q>
There having corrected the firſt ſix books, he dedicated them to <hi>Germanicus,</hi> purpoſing to proceed with the reſt: but death cutting off his dayes, he left them neither corrected nor publiſhed: and ſo through the careleſneſſe of the times, or ignorance of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> among whom they were left, they are periſhed: Yet it was once report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they were all found: which I would I could find not a report but a truth.</p>
               <p>Some deny that this work was dedicated to young <hi>Germanicus,</hi> but would have it to <hi>Tiberius Caeſar:</hi> which they prove chiefly from that verſe in the Preface, <q>Tu quo<expan>

This <hi>Druſus</hi> (ſay they) was brother to <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and was he that dyed in his <hi>Germane</hi> warres: But this title <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi> was never known to be given to <hi>Tiberius</hi>: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth <hi>Tranquillus</hi> mention it in the rehearſall of all his titles. If any ſay that it hath been read in old mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys and monuments, I anſwer, that thoſe inſcriptions belonged not to <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> but to this <hi>Tiberius Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manicus</hi> our Poets patrone, the ſonne of <hi>Druſus,</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herited his fathers title which he had gained in his <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> deſignes. Beſide, it is plain that this <hi>Germanicus</hi> whom our Poet meaneth was grandchild to <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by adoption, and not his ſonne: as <hi>lib.</hi> 1.</p>
               <q>Et tuus <hi>Auguſto</hi> nomine dictus avus.</q>
               <p>Then firſt <hi>Augustus</hi> was thy Grandſire's name.
<pb facs="tcp:25106:16"/>
So that this <hi>Germanicus</hi> was the ſonne of <hi>Druſus Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his brother, and that <hi>Druſus</hi> whom he calleth <hi>Frater Germanici</hi> was <hi>Tiberius</hi> his ſonne and <hi>Germanicus</hi> his firſt couſin; our Poet taking liberty (which is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with Authours both prophane and divine) to uſe one title of conſanguinity for another. To <hi>Auguſtus</hi> Grandchild therefore not to his Sonne was this Poeme dedicated. Which <hi>Ovid</hi> might very well do, becauſe this <hi>Germanicus</hi> was exceedingly well beloved of all his ſouldiers and all the citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> for his many rare performances in the warres, and beſide was a man of ſingular learning and an excellent Poet. From this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that this Prince mainteined among all men our Poet had hopes that he might one day come to the crown, and then might favour him ſo far as to call him home; or at leaſt in the mean time might purchaſe his releaſe.</p>
               <p>Divers Poets before <hi>Ovid</hi> aſſayed this work <hi>Faſti,</hi> as <hi>Ennius, Livius, Andronicus,</hi> and others. But <hi>Ovid</hi> a long time after diligently turning over all the ancient Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dars and Monuments of the Pontifies, and other old An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals which perteined to religious rites and ceremonies, and reducing the <hi>Romane</hi> yeare into a more exact order, with an exquiſite obſervation of the Coſmical, Heliacal, and Acronicall riſing &amp; ſetting of all the fixed Conſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, compoſed this memorable Poeme with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and ſtudy.</p>
               <p>Thus have I from the teſtimony of ſureſt Authours related the principall parts and paſſages of this worthy Poets life, as alſo partly from his own hand-writing. If any deſireth to be further informed of him, let him reade this following relation of his life, penned by no other hand then his own: which, as perfectly as my faculty permitted, I have preſented in our native tongue.</p>
