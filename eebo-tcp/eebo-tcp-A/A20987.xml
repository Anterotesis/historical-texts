            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

having no neede of ſuch facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, being he hath beene created of <hi>Reaſon it ſelfe,</hi> if he would vouchſafe to uſe it; by the meanes of which hee may bee a neighbour even to <hi>Divinity,</hi> which is farre from <hi>brutality.</hi> Now the uſe of <hi>Reaſon</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares principally in the ſearch and knowledge of cauſes, the which makes us to equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh of thoſe which are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and of the beaſts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For the ignorant and the beaſts know well the being of things, but not the cauſes of them; they ſee well that it is Day, that it is Night, they heare well enough the murmure

and grumbling of the <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> they marke the progreſſe, the perfection, the decline, and the alteration of things which are in Nature, but the cauſes of all theſe things are onely in the learned, which know, and that with ſingular contentment of ſpirit the cauſes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe as thoſe which are ſhut up within a darke dull priſon, cannot extend their aſpects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ſides, but onely a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe by the grates, and little openings of the ſame: ſo our <hi>Soule,</hi> a priſoner within the groſse carkaſſe of this materiall body, having no other way of knowledge (for the moſt part)
<pb facs="tcp:11486:4"/>
of thoſe things, then by the meanes of the Sences, which are as the windows of his priſon, cannot commodiouſly ſpeculate and conſider, nor by conſequent know; but as the Hydropickes augment their thirſt in drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo the deſire that they have to learne, increaſeth in them even in their learning: And yet further in admiring the divers obiects that preſent themſelves ordinarily as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veils to his ignorance, ſo that hee may have a ſolace in his knowing, without being ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet may draw ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection, not perfection; the which hath therefore beene ſo
<pb facs="tcp:11486:5"/>
wiſely ordayned by the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar providence of the ſoveraigne authour of Nature, to the end that being ſtayed in the ſearch of the Cauſes in theſe low things, and being not able, but to admire the effects in many ſubiects, our <hi>Soule</hi> lifts it ſelfe up to the knowledge of the firſt cauſe, which is <hi>God,</hi> wholly wiſe, wholly good, and Almighty: This is therefore that I ought not to be blamed of curious ſpirits, if in this curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſearch of cauſes in naturall things, I have not digg'd ſo profoundly into all the ſecrets of Nature as they would deſire: for it is a thing above more then
<pb facs="tcp:11486:5"/>
humane power; and although I have not fed them with vaine imaginations, or imagined va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities as ſome, who with an ambitious arrogancy have pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed reſolutions of the moſt abſtruce things, which the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients,</hi> more able then they, have held either for inexcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or for uncertaine: Alſo it is eaſie to iudge, that they did but trifle themſelves herein, and that ſilence would have better becommed them then their too much pratling, for in the end they could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themſelves from thoſe barres where their ſubtill ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were ſo inwrapped, that
<pb facs="tcp:11486:6"/>
they were conſtrained to have often recourſe to the firſt cauſes, or to the univerſall. For if one asked them the reaſon, why the <hi>Adamant</hi> drawes the <hi>Iron,</hi> or the <hi>Ieate</hi> or <hi>Amber</hi> the <hi>ſtraw,</hi> they anſwere, that it is by <hi>Sympathy, Analogy,</hi> and reſemblance of qualities that there are in theſe two bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but aske them what are thoſe qualities, they are ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped there, ſo as they are leſse reſolved after ſuch their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, then they were before; for if I ſhould grant them, that if the reſemblances of ſome qualities are the cauſe of ſuch attractions, then wherfore is
<pb facs="tcp:11486:6"/>
it, <hi>That wood doth not draw or attract wood, ſtones ſtones, and ſo of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, which not onely ſympathize in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but are alſo of the ſame eſſence:</hi> Who is he that can yeeld a certaine reaſon, why the little <hi>Chickens</hi> feare the <hi>Kite,</hi> although they have never ſeene him, and that hee is ſo farre from them, as almoſt in the clouds; and yet they feare not the <hi>Dogge,</hi> the <hi>Cat,</hi> the <hi>Horſe,</hi> nor any other Animals which paſſe hard by them: The ſame one may ſay of the feare which naturally the <hi>Hare</hi> hath of the <hi>Dogge,</hi> the <hi>Rat</hi> of the
<pb facs="tcp:11486:7"/>
               <hi>Cat,</hi> and other the like; but theſe ſubtill ſpirits will anſwer, that it is a certaine <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy:</hi> In truth, on the contrary, it is uncertaine, ſince wee can neither deſigne it, nor particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize it; for what other thing can we ſay, but to runne to the generall cauſe, and ſay, <hi>that nature hath given them as by inſtinct this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of their enemy, for the ſafegard and conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their kinde.</hi> Who can reſolve me of the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loas invention of our <hi>Fathers,</hi> touching the needle in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners Compaſſe, which turnes alwayes towards the <hi>Pole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:11486:7"/>
or <hi>North-ſtarre,</hi> ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Navigation, the point of the ſame being onely touched by the <hi>Adamant:</hi> There are ſay they, Mountaines of <hi>Iron</hi> under this <hi>Pole,</hi> or neare it; the which for the ſympathy that is betwixt the <hi>Iron</hi> and the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damant,</hi> wherewith this Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle is touched, and is the cauſe that this point is alwayes tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned towards that coaſt there: neither will I deny, that theſe Mountaines are ſo, becauſe I have never beene vpon them; but yet I am not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it ſo, although I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre this to the authority of thoſe which have written here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb facs="tcp:11486:8"/>
Therefore I will not very willingly perſwade my ſelfe, that the attractive faculty of theſe Mountaines of <hi>Iron</hi> are ſo powerfull, that they can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſo long a diſtance, as they ordinarily prove it in the vaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Seas.</p>
            <p>Who is he amongſt the <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,</hi> that can give mee a cleare and true Reaſon of the comming and going of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue,</hi> be it <hi>quartan, quotidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> or <hi>tertian,</hi> and why at his comming it firſt ſhakes him with a cold fit, and after ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth him with a hot, and how ſucceſſively the ſick have their <hi>houres</hi> certaine and infallible:
<pb facs="tcp:11486:8"/>
nor otherwiſe can they reſolve me, <hi>wherefore children of the ſeventh moneth live, and thoſe of the eight, not; if it be not as they ſay in</hi> Egypt, <hi>becauſe of the ſerenity of the Ayre which is in that Region:</hi> Briefly, there is an infinite number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther effects, of whom the <hi>neighbour cauſe</hi> is hidden from us, to the end, that wee ſhall acknowledge our weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and that wee ſhould not grow proud upon our ſufficiency, ſo ſhort in many things, but that we ſhould praiſe <hi>God,</hi> and that otherwiſe marking the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite deſire to learne, which is
<pb facs="tcp:11486:9"/>
innated in our Soules, the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of Divinity,</hi> and which cannot be ſatisfied in this life, drawing from us a certaine proofe of its <hi>Immortality,</hi> and that it is in another place where ſhee ought to be made all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing and all accompliſhed, by the enioying of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne good in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Creatour, the moſt cleare Mirrour, repreſenting and teaching all things which ſhall bee to her eternally in view.</p>
