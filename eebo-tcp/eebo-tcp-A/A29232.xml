            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

young; his name <hi>Philantos</hi> (he loved himself, and cared for no body else) a great <hi>Gallant</hi> he was, and newly come of age, and of a fair Estate; but a wilfull and heady young man he was, and must not be contradicted nor counselled neither: He would never hearken to the advice of his Wife <hi>Experience</hi> till all was gone; He was many times hasty and unkind to his Wife besides, when any thing had crossed him, and this was a <hi>great cut</hi> to her. But at last she, by her wisdom and fair carriage, wrought a great change in him; so that people would often say, See by <hi>Experience,</hi> what may not a wise Woman bring a bad Husband to in time? <hi>The Good Gill may mend the Bad Jack.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She had by him many Children, three Sons, and as many more Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: The three Sons first, whose names were, <hi>Philedonos, Misoponos,</hi> and <hi>Asotos,</hi> all three too like the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

he was, and his Father had spoiled him, by making a very Wanton of him, and he must be a Gentleman because the eldest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Misoponos</hi> was put to a Trade, but a deadly lazy Boy he was, very dull at learning, and hardly brought to settle to any thing, or stay with any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Asotos</hi> was worst of all, a prodigal vain he had in spending whatever he could wrap and rend, and good at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Earth but stroying.</p>
            <p>When many saw these young Lads, and beheld their carriage, they said, it was not for nothing that that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb was raised, <hi>Experientia Mater Stultorum,</hi> that is, <hi>Experience</hi> is the Mother of Fools. But all three at last having well smarted for their folly, and being well taught by their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Dear Experience</hi> (she took a world of pains with them first) they were much reclaimed.</p>
            <p>But her Daughters proved all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly good. The first was <hi>Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> she had endured much, and

            <p>These three she had pretty <hi>thick</hi> one after the other in her younger dayes, and stay'd a fair while ere she had any more; in so much that many thought she would have had no more Children: An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

a few short Amorous Embraces, she was wont to throw her Guests head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, with the help of her Sisters, after they had first stript them of all they had about them, and they were never heard of more: Few, or none, that ever I heard of, that came once into Madam <hi>Porne's</hi> Clutches, ever came back again, or were seen alive, but sometimes a naked <hi>Corps</hi> was seen floating on the top of the Ditch: Only one escaped once, as <hi>Lot</hi> out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> to make the relation of their Entertainment; and he said, it was almost as great a miracle as his was; for he was fain to steal out at a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door, which he found locked, but putting forth all his strength, he burst it open, and then came down a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row pair of Stairs, very steep and dark, which few were able to find, and so got away, resolving never to come more there; for said he, had I stayed longer, or attempted to go back the same way I came, I had certainly been <hi>snapt:</hi> He would ever after call them, <hi>the six fatal Sisters,</hi> and would warn

            <p>To return therefore to <hi>Moderation;</hi> the wayes both of the one and other <hi>Litter</hi> she could not chuse but detest; and for the latter breed, she never had so much as her <hi>name</hi> called in question to <hi>favour</hi> any of them; but when any of the former Race broke out into <hi>Rebellion,</hi> she could not help it; but watchful and jealous <hi>Extremity</hi> would have some hard thoughts of her, as if she had been an Abettor, whereas she was never so much as <hi>privy</hi> to any of their <hi>Designs,</hi> and whensoever she came to hear of them, was as forward as any to <hi>declare</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the wonderful change wrought in <hi>Extremity,</hi> and the occasion and means of it.</head>
            <p>BEfore I make an end, I shall tell you what became of <hi>Extremity</hi> and <hi>Disobedience: Extremity</hi> made a happy end, repented, reformed, and dyed comfortably; <hi>Disobedience</hi> lived obstinately and dyed miserably, and who could look for other?</p>

               </gap>deed she insulted at her death.</p>

               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:47237:53"/>But this E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>mity lasted not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes; for, as God would have it, within a few years after <hi>Moderation's</hi> death, <hi>Extremity</hi> fell into a fit of Sickness, and a happy Sickness it was to her, (her <hi>Extremity</hi> was Graces <hi>Opportunity</hi>) she was sore handled: An ordinary Disease it was not, but she was in great extremity and pain.</p>
            <p>The Physitians, who were sent for, were at their Wits end, when they saw her: They perceived her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lay deeper, and concluded, by all Conjectures they could make, it was some inward trouble or grief oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed her: And being much pressed by them, to declare whether it were so or no, she confessed at last it was so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and that she was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in her <hi>Mind,</hi> and could get no rest.</p>
            <p>It was about her former course of life, and her many sins; especially she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

above all others, which they were long ere they could get out of her; yet she was observed by them that watched with her, sometimes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween sleeping and waking, to mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to her self, and they could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear her now and then, and her talk was of <hi>Moderation;</hi> and many times she would start of a sudden, and look agast, and bid the <hi>By-stand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Once she lay, as in a <hi>Trance,</hi> and seemed to them to pray and call upon God for mercy: At another time she would cry out of her self, and her former miscarriages, saying, Ah! vile <hi>Extremity!</hi> Ah! sin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>This did much run in her mind, and she would often say, O! that <hi>Moderation</hi> were alive again! All the World should see, I did not so much hate h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
