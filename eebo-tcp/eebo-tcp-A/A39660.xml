         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE following Discourse comes to
thy hand in that Native plainness
wherein it was Preached. I was
conscienciously unwilling to alter
it, because I found by experience,
the Lord had blessed and prosper'd it in that
dress, far beyond any other composures on which
I had bestowed more pains. Let it not be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
as vanity or ostentation, that I here ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the goodness of God in leading me
to, and blessing my poor Labours upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
Who, and what am I, that I should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued,
<pb facs="tcp:109022:3"/>
and again employed in the Lords Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
and that with success and encouragment;
when so many of my Brethren, with their much
richer Furnitures of Gifts and Graces, have,
in my time, been called out of the Vineyard,
and are now silent in the Grave! 'Tis true,
they enjoy what I do not; and 'tis as true, I
am capable of doing some Services for God
which they are not. In Preaching these Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
I had many occasions to reflect upon the
mystical sense of that Scripture, <hi>Amos 9. 13.
The Plow-man shall overtake the Reaper,
and the Treader of Grapes, him that sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Seed.</hi> Sowing and Reaping time trod so
close upon one another, that (in all humility I
speak it to the praise of God) it was the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siest
and blessedst time I ever saw, since I first
Preached the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> hath now a day of special Mercy:
There is a wide door of opportunity opened to
it; O that it might prove an effectual door!
'Tis transporting and astonishing, that after all
the high and horrid provocations, the Atheism,
Prophaness, and bitter enmity against Light
and Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormation; this sweet Voice is still
heard in <hi>England, Behold, I stand at the
door and knock.</hi> The Mercies and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this day are a new Tryal obtained for us
by our potent Advocate in the Heavens: If we
bring forth fruit, well, if not, the Ax lieth at
<pb facs="tcp:109022:3"/>
the root of the Tree. Let us not be secure. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
was the City of the great King: The
seat of his Worship and Symbols of his presence
were fixed there. It was the joy of the whole
Earth; the House of Prayer for all Nations;
thither the Tribes went up to Worship; the
Tribes of the Lord, unto the Testimony of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
For there were set Thrones of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Thrones of the House of <hi>David,
Psal.</hi> 122. 4, 5. These priviledges she enjoyed
through the succession of many Ages, and had
ramained the glory of all Nations to this day,
had she known, and improved, in that day
the things that belonged to her peace; but
they neglected their season, rejected their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
and miserably perished in their sins:
for there ever was, and will be found, an inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
connection betwixt the final rejection of
Christ, and the destruction of the Rejecters,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 5, 6, 7. The contemplation whereof
drew those compassionate Tears from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemers
eyes, when he beheld it in his des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
from the Mount of Olives, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.
41, 42.</p>
            <p>Let all that are wise in Heart henceforth
depose their animosities; sadly reflect on their
past follies, encourage and assist the Labours of
their Brethren in the Lords Harvest; and
rejoyce that God hath set them at liberty by
<pb facs="tcp:109022:4"/>
Law, whose assistance, in so great an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity,
is so necessary and desirable: It is
against the Laws of Wisdom and Charity, to
envy the Liberty, and much more the Success,
of our Brethren, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. If the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
contend and scuffle in a catching Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,
who but the <hi>owner</hi> suffers damage by
it? If after so miraculous, recent, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
a Salvation as this, we still retain our old
prejudices and bitter envyings; if we smite
with the Pen and Tongue when we cannot with
the Hand; and study to blast the Reputations
and Labours of our Brethren; and still <hi>hate</hi>
those we cannot <hi>hurt.</hi> In a word, if we still
bite and devour one another, we shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
one of another: let us not lay the fault
upon others, we our selves have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
and Instruments of our own ruin; and
this must be the inscription upon our Toomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,
<hi>O</hi> England, <hi>thou hast Destroyed thy
Self.</hi> I am more afraid of the rooted enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and fixed prejudices, that are to be found
in many against holiness, and the serious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it; and inflexible obstinacy and
dead formality in many others, (the tokens
of a tremendous infatuation) than I am of
all the whispered fears from other Hands, or
common Enemies upon our borders.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:109022:4"/>To prevent these mischiefs, and promote
zeal and unanimity among the Ministers of
the Gospel, I have presumed to address to
them in the following <hi>Epistle.</hi> I judged it
necessary on several reasons to write it in <hi>Latin,</hi>
as what allowed me a greater freedom of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
than might seem convenient in the
common Language. I am conscious of my own
unworthiness to be their <hi>Monitor,</hi> and of the
defects their Iudicious Eyes will easily discern,
in the style wherein it is written; and yet can
promise my self a becoming reception of what
is so faithfully, seasonably, and honestly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for their good. I am satisfied that
no candid and ingenuous Person will put
Words upon the Rack, quarrel a Similitude,
or expose a Trifle, when he finds the design
Honest, and the matter Good and Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>As to the Treatise it self, thou wilt find
it a <hi>Persuasive</hi> to open thy Heart to Christ.
Thy Soul, Reader, is a magnificent Structure
built by Christ; such stately Rooms as thy
Vnderstanding, Will, Conscience, and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
are too good for any other to Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.
If thou be in thy Vnregenerate state,
then he solemnly demands, in this Text, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
into the Soul he made, by the consent
of the Will: which if thou refuse to give
<pb facs="tcp:109022:5"/>
him, then Witness is taken that Christ once
more demanded entrance into thy Soul which
he made, and was denied it. If thou hast
opened thy Heart to him, thou wilt, I hope,
meet somewhat in this Treatise that will clear
thy Evidences, and chear thy Heart; Pray,
Read, Ponder, and Apply.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>THE worthy Author of the
Discourse emitted herewith,
is one whose praise is in the Gospel
throughout all the Churches. His
other Books have made his Name
precious and famous <hi>in both Englands.</hi>
Nor can my Testimony add any thing
to one every way greater than my
self. Nevertheless, a singular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
having cast my Lot to be at
present in this great City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could
not withstand the importunity of
them, who desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed a few <hi>Prefatory</hi>
Lines to manifest the Respect I owe
to this Renowned and Learned
Man.</p>
            <p>It was a wife Reproof which a
grave Divine administred to a young
Preacher, who entertained his Auditory
with an elaborate Discourse: After
<pb facs="tcp:109022:19"/>
he had commended his parts and pains,
there was (said he) one thing want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Sermon; I <hi>could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Spirit of God was in it.</hi>
And though <hi>Morality</hi> is good and
necessary to be taught and practised,
yet it is much to be lamented, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Preachers in these days have
hardly any other Discourses in their
Pulpits than what we may find in
<hi>Seneca, Epictetus, Plutarch,</hi> or some such
Heathen <hi>Moralist.</hi> Christ, the Holy
Spirit, and (in a word) <hi>the Gospel</hi>
is not in their Sermons. But bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be God, that there are some
(and great is their Company in this
Land of Light) who preach the
Truth as it is in Jesus: And he who
has taken the Book out of the Right
Hand of him that sits on the Throne,
and is worthy to open the Seals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
has been pleased in wonderful
ways to set open and keep <hi>open a
door of Liberty</hi> to the Gospel, that
they, unto whom he has given an
<pb facs="tcp:109022:19"/>
Heart to Preach Christ, may do it.
This is the Lords doings; This is a
<hi>Spirit of Life from God.</hi> When <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
proclaimed Liberty for the free
Exercise of Religion, the Lords
Servants, who for some years had <hi>lain
dead,</hi> were <hi>brought out of their Graves,</hi>
Ezek. 37. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>This Treatise is a word in season:
God has made the Author to be a
<hi>wise Master-builder</hi> in his House, and
acccording to the Wisdom given
him of God, he has inlarged on a
Gospel subject very proper to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
on at such a day as this. I am
inform'd by unquestionable hands that
there was a remarkable pouring out
of the Spirit when these Sermons
were <hi>viva voce</hi> delivered, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Souls having been brought
home to Christ thereby. The Lord
grant that the second preaching of
them to far greater Multitudes by this
way of the Press, may by the same
Spirit be made abundantly successful
<pb facs="tcp:109022:20"/>
for the Conversion and Salvation of
Gods Elect. The Fruit brought forth
by the Holy Apostles in respect of the
Writings of some, (as well as the
Doctrin preach'd by all) of them,
does still remain. The fruitful La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors
of this faithful Servant of Christ
will promote the Glory of God, and
the good of Souls, when he himself
shall cease from his Labors and his
Works shall follow him. Let the
Lords people be thankful to him for
that he has sent such a Labourer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Harvest, and pray, that he may
be continued long therein, and that
many such (for there are but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew such)
may be raised up, and be made emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
successful in their holy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
to the inlargement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

               <q>
                  <bibl>Revel. 3. 20.</bibl> [Behold] I stand at the door, and knock: if
any man hear my voice, and open the door,

            <p>THis day hath our compassionate
Redeemer opened unto us a door
of liberty, liberty to us to
preach, and liberty for you to
hear the glad tydings of the
Gospel. This is a day few looked for; how
often have I said in the years that are past, God
hath no more work for me to do, and I shall have
no more strength and opportunities to work for
God? And how often have you said in your
hearts, we have sinned our Ministers out of their
<hi>Pulpits,</hi> and our eyes shall no more behold those
our Teachers? But lo, beyond the thoughts of
most hearts, a wide (and I hope) an effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al
door is now opened in the midst of us. Oh!
that it might be to us as the Valley of <hi>Achor</hi> was
to <hi>Israel, for a door of hope:</hi> Hosea 2. 15. (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
not only making the troubles they met with in
that Valley an Inlet to their mercies, as ours have
been to us; but giving them that Valley <hi>pignoris
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109022:23"/>
nomine,</hi> as a pledge of greater mercies intended
for them. Upon the first appearance of this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
my next thoughts were how to make the
most fruitful improvement of it amongst you,
lest we should twice stumble at the same stone,
and sin our selves back again into our old bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>In the contemplation of this matter, the Lord
directed me to this Scripture, wherein the same
hand that opened to you the door of liberty,
knocks importunately at the doors of your hearts
for entrance into them, for union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with them. It will be sad indeed if he
that hath let you in to all these mercies, should
himself be shut out of your hearts: But if the
Lord should help you to open your hearts now to
Christ, I doubt not but this door of liberty will
be kept open to you, how many soever the
Adversaries be that envy it, and will do their
uttermost to shut it up, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 39. 29. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
you enjoy this day, are the fruits of Christs
intercession with the Father, for one tryal more;
if we bring forth fruit, well, if not, <hi>the Ax lyeth
at the Root of the Tree.</hi> Under this consideration
I desire to Preach, and even so the Lord help you
to hear what shall be spoken from this precious
Scripture, <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These words are a branch of that excellent
Epistle dictated by Christ, and sent by his servant
<hi>John</hi> to the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the most formal,
hypocritical and degenerate of all the seven
Churches; yet the great <hi>Phisitian</hi> will try his skill
upon them, both by the rebukes of the rod, <hi>ver.</hi>
19. and by the perswasive power of the word;
<hi>ver. 20. Behold, I stand at the door and knock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

This Text is Christs wooing voice, full of
Heavenly Rhetorick to win and gain the hearts
of Sinners to himself; wherein we have these
two general parts.

have (<hi>1st</hi>) the solemn Preface, ushering it in, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold.
(2dly)</hi> the suit it self. The Preface is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
solemn, for beside the common use of
this word <hi>behold,</hi> in other places to excite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or exaggerate and put weight into an affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;<note place="margin">Durham in loc.</note>
it stands here as a Judicious Expositor
notes, as a term of <hi>notification,</hi> or <hi>publick record,</hi>
wherein Christ takes witness of the most gracious
offer he was now about to make to their souls,
and will have it stand <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam,</hi>
as a testimony for or against their souls to all
Eternity, to cut off all excuses and pretences for
time to come.</p>
            <p>2. The suit it self, wherein we have
<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Suitor,</hi> Jesus Christ.</item>
                  <item>2. His posture and action; <hi>I stand at the door

of the Present Tense, it is fitly translated, <hi>I

have stood and do still stand with unwearied pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
I once stood personally and bodily among
you in the days of my flesh, and I still stand spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually
and representatively in my <hi>Ambassadors
at the door, (i. e.)</hi> the mind and conscience, the
faculties and powers which are introductive into
the whole soul.</p>
            <p>The word <hi>Door</hi> is here improperly put to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
those introductive faculties of the soul which
are of a like use to it, as the Door is to the House.
This is the <hi>Redeemer</hi>'s posture, his action is <hi>knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
(i. e.)</hi> his powerful essays, and gracious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts

            <p>3. The design and end of the Suit, it is for
<hi>opening (i. e.)</hi> consenting, receiving, embracing
and hearty accepting of him by faith. <hi>Acts 16. 14.
The Lord opened the heart of</hi> Lydia, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
her soul to believe; implying, that the
heart by nature is strongly barr'd and lock'd up

used by Christ to obtain his Suit, and get
a grant from the Sinners heart, and they are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109022:24"/>
drawn from two inestimable benefits accrewing
to the opening or believing soul. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>

               <item>1. Union.</item>

            </list>
            <p>1. <hi>Vnion, I will come in to him,</hi> that is, I will
unite my self with the opening believing soul,
he shall be mystically one with me, and I with
him.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Communion, I will sup with him, and he with
me;</hi> that is, I will feast the believing soul with
the delicates of Heaven. Such comforts, such
joys, such pleasures as none in the World but Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
are capable of.</p>
            <p>And to set home all, these special benefits are
proposed by Christ to all sorts of Sinners great
and small, old and young, <hi>if any man hear my
voice and open the door,</hi> that so no soul might be
discouraged from believing, by the greatness or
multitude of his sins, but the vilest of Sinners may
see free grace triumphing over all their unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness,
upon their consent to take Christ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the gracious offers of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>The words thus opened, afford many great and
useful points of Doctrine, comprehending in

                  <item>2. What are the object matters they wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to?</item>
                  <item>3. Why God records every offer of Christ,
and takes witness thereof?</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> First, Who are Gods Witnesses to all the
tenders and offers made of Christ by the Gospel,
and they will be found to be more than a strict
legal number; for</p>
               <p>1. His Ministers by whom he makes them are
all <hi>Witnesses</hi> as well as <hi>Officers</hi> of Christ to the
People, <hi>Acts 26. 16. I have appeared unto thee
for this purpose, to make thee a Minister and a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi>
Here you see Ministers have a double office
to propose and offer Christ, and then to bear
witness for or against those to whom he is thus
offered: They are expresly called Gods Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 6, 7. Their labours witness, their
sufferings witness, their solemn appeals to God
witness, yea, the very dust of their feet shaken
off against the refusers of Christ, turns to a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
against them; <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 11. Every groan
and sigh, every drop of sweat, much more of
blood, are placed in Gods Book as Marginal
Notes by all their Sermons and Prayers, and
will be produced and read in the great day against
all the refusers and despisers of Christ.</p>
               <p>2. The Gospel it self which is preached to
you is a Testimony or Witness for God, for or
against every one that hears it, <hi>Iohn 12. 48. He
that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:109022:25"/>
one that judgeth him; the word that I have spoken,
the same shall judge him in the last day.</hi> And this is
the sense of Christs words, <hi>Matth. 24. 14. And
this Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all
the World, for a Witness to all Nations, and then
shall the end come.</hi> Ah Lord, what a solemn record
is here! Every Sermon you hear, yea, every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
perswasion and conviction is a Witness for
God to cast and condemn every Soul in Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that complies not obediently with the
calls of the Gospel: So many Sermons, so many
Witnesses.</p>
               <p>3. Every mans own conscience is a Witness for
God, that he hath a fair offer once made him;
the very consciences of the Heathens that never
saw a Bible, that had no other Preachers but the
Sun, Moon and Stars, and other works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
yet of them the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom. 2. 15.
That they shew the work of the Law written in their
hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their
thoughts the mean while accusing or excusing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
Certainly if such vigour and activity was
put into the consciences of <hi>Heathens,</hi> who could
only read the will of God by the dim Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of natural reason; how much more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and active will conscience be in its accusing
office against all that live under the bright beams
of Gospel light? Their consciences will be swift
Witnesses, and will ring sad Peals in their ears
another day. <hi>You shall know that there hath been a
Prophet among you, Ezek. 2. 5.</hi> This single Witness
is instead of a thousand Witnesses for God.</p>
               <p>4. The examples of all those that do believe
and obey the Gospel, are so many Witnesses for
God against the despisers and neglecters of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109022:26"/>
great Salvation. Every mourning trembling Soul
among you is a Witness against all the dead
hearted, unbelieving, disobedient ones, that sit
with them under the same ordinances. Hence it
is said, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 7. Know ye not that the Saints shall
judge the World?</hi> They shall be <hi>Assessors</hi> with Christ
in the great day, and condemn the world by their
examples, as <hi>Noah</hi> did the old world; and thus
<hi>Matth. 21. 32.</hi> John <hi>came unto you in the way of
righteousness, and ye believed him not, but the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
and Harlots believed him, and ye when ye had
seen it, repented not afterward that ye might believe
him.</hi> q. d. What shift did you make to quiet your
consciences, and stifle your convictions, when
you saw <hi>Publicans</hi> the worst of men, and <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi>
the worst of women, repenting, believing and
hungering after Christ! Their examples shall be
your Judges. These are Gods Witnesses.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, Next let us consider what are the
<hi>object matters</hi> unto which they give their testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and that will be found two-fold, according
to the two-fold event the Gospel hath upon them
that hear it: of both which, the Apostle gives
us this account, <hi>2 Cor. 2. 16. Vnto some we are the
savour of life unto life, and unto others the savour
of death unto death.</hi> Accordingly a double Record
is made,</p>
               <p>1. Of the obedience and faith of some, which
Record will be produced to their joy and comfort
in the day of the Lord, <hi>when he shall come to be
glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them
that believe, because our testimony among you was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
in that day.</hi> Ministers are Instruments of
espousing Souls to Christ, and Witnesses to those
espousals and contracts made betwixt him and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109022:26"/>
them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 2. Both these offices are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grateful, and pleasant to every faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister.</p>
               <p>2. A Record is made, and Witness taken of
all the refusals, disobedience, and slightings of
Christ by others. Thus <hi>Moses</hi> will be the accuser
of the Jews, <hi>John 5. 45. Do not think I will accuse
you to the Father, there is one that accuseth you, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Moses in whom you trust.</hi> This is the saddest
part of a Ministers-work; the fore-thoughts of
it are more afflictive than all our Labours and
Sufferings. There is a three-fold Record made
in this case, (<hi>1st.</hi>) Of the time men have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the means of Salvation; how many
years they have sat barren and dead hearted, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the labours of Gods faithful Ministers, <hi>Luke
13. 7. Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on
this Fig-tree and find none.</hi> Behold the same term
of Notification with that in the Text, applyed
to the time of Gods patience towards them: And
again, <hi>Ier. 25. 3. From the thirteenth year of</hi> Josiah
<hi>even unto this day (that is, the three and twentieth
year) the word of the Lord hath come unto me, and I
have spoken unto you rising early, and speaking, but
ye have not hearkened.</hi> Oh consider all the years
and days you have spent under the Gospel, are
upon your Dooms-day-book. (<hi>2dly,</hi>) Records
are also made of all the instruments that ever
God employed for the Conversion and Salvation
of your Souls. So many Ministers, whether fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or transient, as have spent their labours upon
you, are upon the Book of your account. <hi>Ier. 25.
4. The Lord hath sent unto you all his servants the
Prophets, rising early and sending them, but ye have
not hearkened, nor enclined your ear to hear.</hi> They
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109022:27"/>
have wasted their Lungs, dropt their compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
tears, and burnt down one after another as
Candles to direct you to Christ and Salvation,
but all in vain. (<hi>3dly,</hi>) Every call, perswasion
and argument used by them to espouse you to
Christ, is likewise upon the Book of account,
<hi>Prov. 1. 24. 25. Because I have called and
you refused, I have stretched my hand, and no man
regarded, but you have set at nought all my counsels,
and would none of my reproofs.</hi> These calls and
counsels are of too great value with God,
(though of none with you) to be lost and left
out of your account.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> Thirdly, we shall in the last place inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the grounds and reasons of these Judicial
procedures of God, why he will have every
mans obedience and disobedience Registred and
Witnessed for or against him under Gospel ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministrations;
and there are two weighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
thereof.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Reason.</note> that wherever the end of the Gospel
is attained in the Conversion of any soul, that
soul, and all that were instrumentally employ'd
about the salvation of it, may have their proper
reward and comfort in the great day, <hi>2 Cor. 1.
14. As also you have acknowledged us in part, that
we are your rejoycing, even as ye also are ours in the
day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> This will be matter of joy
unspeakable, both to you that shall receive, and
to them that shall give such a comfortable testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
for you. Oh the joyful congratulations
that will be in that day between Laborious
Faithful Ministers, and their Believing Obedient
Hearers! Lord, this was the blessed instrument
of my happy Illumination and Conversion; though
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109022:27"/>
I might have ten thousand Instructers in Christ,
yet not many Fathers; for by the blessing of thy
Spirit upon this mans Ministry, my Soul was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
to Christ. And on the other side, Lord,
these are the Souls for whom I travelled as
in birth until Christ was formed in them. 'Tis
a glorious thing to say as the Prophet, <hi>Here am
I, and the children God hath given me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, those that were but collaterally useful to
help on the work of God begun by others, must
not lose their reward in that day, <hi>Iohn 4. 36.
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth
fruit unto life eternal, that both he that soweth and
he that reapeth may rejoyce together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> Records are now made, and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
taken, that thereby the Judicial Sentence
of Jesus Christ in the last day may be made clear
and perspicuous to all the world; that every
mouth may be stopt, and no Plea or Apology
left in the mouth of any condemned Sinner.
For Christ in that day cometh <hi>to convince all that
are ungodly, Iude ver. 15.</hi> to convince by demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
that all that are Christless now, may be
found speechless then, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. 12. Here it is
said, <hi>Psal. 1. 5. That the wicked shall not stand, or
rise up in the Iudgment.</hi> And no wonder when so
many full testimonies and unexceptionable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
shall come point blank against them, the
Minister that preach'd, the word they preached,
their own consciences, and the examples of all
Believers will be produced against them.</p>

               <p>First, <hi>The undoubted certainty of a day of Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is hence evinced.</hi> To what purpose else are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:109022:28"/>
Records made, and Witnesses taken, but with
respect to an Audit day; this is a truth sealed
upon the consciences of the very Heathens, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 15. <hi>their consciences bear witness.</hi> But in vain are
all these Records made, unless there be a day to
produce and plead them, and of that day the
Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> speaks, <hi>Dan. 7. 10. The Iudgment

20. 12. <hi>And I saw the Dead small and great stand
before God, and the Books were opened, and another

               </p>
               <p>Believe it Friends, these are no devised Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
but most awful and infallible truths; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the saving effects the Gospel now
hath, it will be a time of refreshing to our Souls,
<hi>Acts</hi> 3. 19. to all others a day of terrour, wrath
and amazement, 2 <hi>Thes. 1. 7, 8. The day in which
the Lord Iesus shall be revealed from Heaven with

                  <hi>What a spur is here to Ministerial diligence and
faithfulness?</hi> 'Tis an awful work that is under our

will be the savour of life or Death to them that
hear us. If the Lord prosper it in our hands, we
shall be witnesses for you, it will be an addition to
our glory in Heaven, <hi>Dan. 12. 3. They that turn

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:109022:28"/>
But if we be Ignorant, Lazy, Men-pleasers, our
people will come in as swift Witnesses against us,
and their blood will be required at our hands;
it will be an intollerable aggravation to our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery

thus upbraiding us! <hi>O cruel man! thou sawest
my soul in danger, and never dealt faithfully and
plainly with me; the same time and breath which was
spent in idle and worldly discourse, might have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumental
to have sav'd me from this place of torment.</hi>
Let Ministers consider themselves as Witnesses for
God, and their People as Witnesses for or against
them; and under that consideration, so study,
preach and pray, that they may with <hi>Paul</hi> take
God to record, that they are free from the blood
of all men; no sort of men upon earth have more
spurs to diligence and faithfulness than we have.</p>

                  <hi>What a Pill is this to purge formality out of all
that hear us?</hi> every Sabbath, every Sermon is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
in Heaven for or against your souls; at
what rate soever you attend to the word, all that
you hear is set down in the book of your account;
think not you shall return as you came, the word
will have its effect and end, it shall not return in
vain, but shall accomplish the end for which it
is sent, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 55. 11. The decrees of Heaven are
executed by the Gospel, some souls shall be
quickened, and others shall be slain by the words
of Gods mouth, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 9, 10. The Gospel is
a River of the waters of Life, which quickens
and refreshes every thing that lives; but the
myre and marish places shall not be healed. How
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:109022:29"/>
weighty therefore is that caution of our blessed
Lord, <hi>Luke 8. 18. Take heed how you hear?</hi> When
you come under an ordinance, you are sowing
seed for Eternity, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 7, 8. Which will spring
up in the world to come. Preaching and hearing
may be considered two ways, <hi>Physically</hi> or <hi>Morally,</hi>
in the former respect, these acts are quickly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and pass away: I shall by and by have done
preaching, and you hearing, this Sermon will be
ended in a little time, but the consequences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
will abide for ever. Therefore for the Lords
sake, away with formality, no more drowsie
eyes or wandering thoughts. Oh when you come
to attend upon the Ministry of the Gospel, that
such thoughts as these might prepare your minds!
The word I am going to hear will quicken or
kill, save or damn my soul; if I sit dead under
it, and return barren from it, I shall with one

                  <hi>What a dreadful condition are all those in that are
real and professed Enemies to the Gospel and them that
preach it!</hi> That instead of embracing and obeying
the message of the Gospel, reject and despise it;
instead of opening their hearts to receive it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
their blasphemous mouths against it to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride
it, and hiss it (if it were possible) out of the
world. Ah, what a book of remembrance is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for such men? I fear there never was an age
since Christianity blessed this Nation, that was
more deeply drench'd in the guilt of this sin than
the present age. How are the Messengers of the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109022:29"/>
Gospel slighted and rejected? What have we
done to deserve it? Is not our case this day much
like that of the Prophet? <hi>Ier. 18. 20. Shall
evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a
Pit for my Soul; remember that I stood before thee
to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath
from them.</hi> What bruitish madness hath possest
the souls of these men? but alas, it is not so much
they, as Satan acting in them; he is a jealous
Prince, the Gospel allarms him, his Subjects are
in danger of revolting from him: No wonder
therefore he makes an out-cry at the liberty of
the Gospel, as is used to be made when an Enemy
invades a Kingdom. In this case Christ directs
his Ministers to shake off the dust of their feet
for a testimony against them, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 11. The
signification and meaning whereof is this, that
look as you shake off the dust of your feet, even
so Jesus Christ will shake off those men that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise
the Gospel and abuse its Messengers.</p>

               <p>Hence it likewise follows, <hi>that the case of the

under the Gospel of Christ.</hi> There are more
Witnesses prepared, and Records filed against
the day of your account, than can possibly be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
them; they have abused but one talent,
the light of nature; but we thousands, even as
many thousands as we have had opportunities
and calls under the Gospel. Upon this account
Christ saith, <hi>Matth. 10. 14, 15. Whosoever shall
not receive you, nor hear your words, shake off the dust
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109022:30"/>

               <p>Ah, what a fearful Aggravation doth it put

made, shall then be opened and read, all the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses
for or against every man examined and
heard; judge then what a vast space of time will

it may last as long as the World hath
lasted, but this is sure, things will not be hudled

               <p>Consider the multitudes, multitudes without

such gracious offers of Peace and Mercy are made.</hi>
Thy sins have set thee at as great a distance, from
the hopes and expectations of pardon, as any sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in the World. Consider Man, what thou
hast been, what thou hast done, and what vast
heaps of guilt thou hast contracted by a life of
sin, and yet that unto thee Pardon and Peace
should be offered in Christ, after such a life of
Rebellion, how astonishing is the mercy! The
Lord is contented to pass by all thy former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
thy deep died Transgressions, and to

                     <hi>Consider how many offers of mercy you have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
refused, and that every refusal is recorded
against you.</hi> How long you have tried and even
tired the patience of God already, and that this
may be the last overture of Grace that ever God
will make to your Souls. Certainly there is an
offer that will be the last offer, a striving of the
Spirit which will be his last striving; and after
that no more offers without you, no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or strivings within you for evermore. The
Treaty is then ended, and your last neglect or
rejection of Christ recorded against the day of
your account; and what if this should prove to

Hand to receive his Pardon? Your Repentance
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109022:32"/>
and Faith are much of the same nature. Here is
no legal satisfaction required at your Hands, no

            </epigraph>
            <p>Having in the former Sermon pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
Christs solemn Preface to
his earnest Suit; the next thing
that comes under our considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
is <hi>the Person soliciting,</hi> and
pleading for admission into the Heart of sinners,
which is Christ himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behold I stand.</hi> The only difficulty here is
rightly to apprehend the manner of Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
in Gospel administrations; for it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
the person of Christ was at this time in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
his Bodily presence was removed from this
lower World above Sixty years before this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle
was Written to the <hi>Laodiceans. Iohn</hi>'s
banishment into <hi>Patmos,</hi> is by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> out of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi>
and <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> placed in the
Fourteenth Year of the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> and
under his Second Persecution, which was about
the Ninety seventh Year from the Birth of Christ.</p>
            <p>Yet here, he saith, <hi>behold I stand,</hi> not my Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
and Ministers only, but <hi>I</hi> by my Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
presence among you, I your Sovereign Lord
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109022:34"/>
and Owner, who have all Right and Authority
by Creation and Redemption, to possess and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of your Souls; 'tis I that stand at the Door
and knock, I by my Spirit, solliciting and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
by the Ministry of Men. You see none but
Men; but believe it, I am really and truly,
though Spiritually and Invisibly present in all
those administrations, all those knocks, motions
and solicitations are truly mine, they are my
acts, and I own them, and so I would have you
conceive and apprehend them. Hence the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
<hi>Note</hi> is this,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCT.</head>
               <p>That Iesus Christ is truly present with men in his
Ordinances, and hath to do with them, and they with
him; though he be not visible to their carnal Eyes.</p>
               <p>Thus runs the promise, <hi>Matth. 18. 20. Where
two or three are gathered together in my Name, there
am I in the midst of them.</hi> The midle place
was the Seat of the <hi>President</hi> in the Jewish as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
where he might equally hear and be
heard of all. So will I be in the midst of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of the Faithful, met together in my
Name and Authority, to bless, guide and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
them. Hence the Church is called the place
of his Feet, <hi>Isa.</hi> 16. 13. a manifest allusion to the
<hi>Ark,</hi> called Gods Footstool, <hi>Psal.</hi> 99. 5. and
agreeably hereunto, Christ is said to walk among
the Seven golden Candlesticks, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 1. There
are the Spiritual walks of Christ, there his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
and communion with Men: And this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Christ was not the peculiar privileges
of the first Churches, but is common to all the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109022:35"/>
Churches of the Saints to the end of the World,
as appears by that glorious promise comfortably
so extended with the Church from first to last;
<hi>Matth. 28. ult. Lo, I am with you always to the end
of the World.</hi> This promise is the ground and
reason of all our Faith, and expectations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from Ordinances; and the Subjects of it
are not here considered <hi>Personally,</hi> but <hi>Officially,</hi> to
you and all that succeed you, in the same Work
and Office; not to you only as <hi>Extraordinary,</hi>
but to all the succeeding <hi>Ordinary</hi> standing Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
in my Church. As for the Apostles, neither
their Persons, nor extraordinary Office was to
continue long, but this Promise was to continue
to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Promise made absolutely, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally;
the connection of the Promise, with
the Command, enforces this qualified sense; as
<hi>2 Chron. 15. 2. The Lord is with you, whilst you
are with him.</hi> Ignorant, idle, unqualified per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
cannot claim the benefit of this gracious
grant.</p>
               <p>Once more, this Promise is made ot every
hour and minute of time. I am with you, <hi>all
the days,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Greek Text;</hi> in dark and
dangerous, as well as peaceable and incouraging
days; and it is closed up with a solemn <hi>Amen,
So be it,</hi> or, So it shall be.</p>
               <p>To open this Point distinctly, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
that there is a threefold presence of Christ,
<list>
                     <item>1. Corporeal.</item>
                     <item>2. Represented.</item>
                     <item>3. Spiritual.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109022:35"/>
First, There is a Corporeal Presence of Christ,
which the Church once enjoyed on Earth, when
he went in and out amongst his People, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.
21. When their Eyes saw him, and their Hands
handled him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. This presence was a
singular consolation to the Disciples, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they were greatly dejected when it was to
be removed from them. But after Redemption-Work
was finished on Earth, this Bodily Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
was no longer necessary to be continued in
this World, but more expedient to be removed
to Heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 7. as indeed it was, and
must there abide until the time of the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 21. And in this respect
he tells the Disciples, <hi>Iohn 16. 28. leave the
World and go to my Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a Represented Presence of
Christ in Ordinances. As the Person of a King
is represented in another Country by his <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,</hi>
so is Christ in this World by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
2 cor. 5. 26. <hi>We then are Ambassadors for
God, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray
you in Christs stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> Christ
is about other work for us in Heaven, but we
stand in his stead on Earth. And this speaks the
great Dignity of the Ministerial Office; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
abuses or contempts are cast on them, they
reflect upon Christ, <hi>Luke 10. 16. He that despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
you despiseth me.</hi> It also teacheth us whence
the validity of Gospel administrations is; Christ
ratifies and confirms them with his own Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
It also instructs us how Wise, Spiritual,
and Holy, Ministers should be, who represent
Christ to the Word. A Drunkard, a Persecutor,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109022:36"/>
a sensual Worldling, is but an ill representative
of the blessed and holy Jesus.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beside and above the two former,
there is a Spiritual Presence of Christ in the
Churches, and Ordinances; and this Presence of
Christ by his Spirit, who is his <hi>Vicegerent,</hi> is to
be considered as that from which all Gospel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances derive,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Their Beauty and Glory.</item>
                  <item>2. Their Power and Efficacy.</item>
                  <item>3. Their awful Solemnity.</item>
                  <item>4. Their Continuance and Stability.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, From the presence of Christ by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
the Ordinances and Churches derive their
beauty and glory, <hi>Psal. 27. 4. To see thy power
and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the Sanctuary.</hi>
Look as the beauty of the Body is a result from
the Soul that animates it; and when the Soul is
gone, the beauty of the Body is gone also; so
the beauty and glory of all Ordinances comes
and goes with the Spirit of Christ which is the
very Soul of them. The Churches are indeed
golden Candlesticks, but the Candlestick hath no
light but what the Candle gives it; hence that
magnificent description of the new Temple is
closed up in this expression, <hi>Ezek. 48. ult. The
name of that City shall be, The Lord is there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, From this Spiritual Presence of
Christ, all Gospel Ordinances derive all that
Power and Efficacy which is by them exerted
upon the Souls of Men; either in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
or Edification. This power is not inherent
in them, nor do they act as natural, necessary
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109022:36"/>
agents, but as instituted means, which are suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful
or unsuccessful, according as Christ by his
Spirit co-operates with them, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 7. He that
plants is nothing, neither he that watereth, but God
that giveth the increase;</hi> that is, they are nothing
to the purpose, nothing to the accomplishment of
Mens Salvation without the concurrence of the
Spirit of Christ. For when the Apostle makes
himself and <hi>Apollos,</hi> with all other Ministers,
nothing, we must understand him speaking not
absolutely, but comparatively, and relatively;
they are necessary in their places, and sufficient
in their kind, for what they are appointed to,
else it would be a reflection upon the Wisdom of
God that instituted them; but singly in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and disjunctively considered, they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
as a Trumpet or wind Instrument is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
as to its end and use, except breath be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired
into it, and that breath modulated by the
art and skill of the inspirer; like <hi>Ezekiets</hi> Wheels
that move not but as the Spirit that was in them
moved and directed their motions. If Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
wrought upon Souls naturally, and necessarily
as the fire burneth, then they could not fail of
success upon all that come under them: But it is
with them as with the Waters of the Pool of
<hi>Bethesda,</hi> whose healing vertue was only found
at that season when the Angel descended and
troubled them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This Spiritual Presence of Christ,
gives the Ordinances of the Gospel that awful
solemnity which is due upon that account to them.
The Presence of Christ in them commands reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
from all that are about him. <hi>God is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be feared in the Assemblies of his Saints, and to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109022:37"/>
be had in reverence of all that are round about him.</hi>
Hence is that solemn caution or threatning,
<hi>Levit. 26. 23, 24. If you walk contrary unto me,
then will I also walk contrary unto you;</hi> the Hebrew
word in that Text signifies to walk rashly or at
an adventure with God, <hi>sine personae discrimine,</hi>
without considering with whom we have to do,
and what an awful Majesty we stand before. And
the punishment is suitable to the sin; I also will
walk at an adventure with you, making no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination
in my Judgments betwixt your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
and the persons of the worst of Men. Oh
that this were duly considered by all that have to
do with God in Gospel institutions!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, 'Tis the Spiritual Presence of Christ
in his Churches and Ordinances that gives them
their Continuance and Stability; when ever the
Spirit of Christ departs from them it will not be
long before they depart from us; or if they
should not, their continuance will be little to
our advantage. When the Glory of the Lord
once dismounted from betwixt the Cherubims,
when that sad voice was heard in the Temple,
<hi>migremus hinc,</hi> let us go hence, how soon was
both City and Temple made a desolation! And
truly Christ's Presence is not so fixed to any Place,
or any Ordinances, but the sins of the people
may banish it away, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 5. Who will tarry
in any place longer than he is welcom, if he have
any where else to go?</p>
               <p>But more particularly, let us here discuss
these two points,</p>
               <p>I. How it appears Christ is thus Spiritually
Present with his Churches and Ordinances?</p>
               <p>II. Why it is necessary he should be so?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:109022:37"/>
First, By what evidences doth it manifestly
appear that there is such a presence of Christ
with his Churches and Ordinances? And this
will appear by two undeniable evidences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By their wonderful Preservations.</item>
                  <item>2. From their supernatural Effects.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, From their wonderful Preservations,
for it is wholly unaccountable, and unconceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
how the Churches, Ministers and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
should be supported and preserved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it, amidst such Hosts of potent and enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Enemies. If Christ were not among them
they had certainly been swallowed up long ago.
'Tis he that holds the Stars in his right hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1. His walks among the seven golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks
is their best security. The burning bush,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 3. is a rare emblem to open this Mystery;
the bush burned with fire, but was not consumed.
The <hi>bush</hi> was a resemblance of the Church of
God in <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>flames</hi> upon it was their terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Persecution; the <hi>wonder</hi> that no ashes appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as the effects of those terrible flames, the
<hi>reason</hi> thereof was, God was in the bush; Jesus
Christ was in the midst of his people.</p>
               <p>By vertue of this Presence we are here this
day, in the enjoyment of Gospel Liberties; no
Society of Men in the World have such securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as the Church hath upon this account. The
mightiest Monarchies have been over-turned, no
Policies nor humane Power could preserve them;
but the Church and Ordinances are still preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and shall ever be by vertue of that gracious
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:109022:38"/>
Promise, <hi>Ier. 30. 11. For I am with thee, saith the
Lord, to save thee: though I make a full end of all
Nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not
make a full end of thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Babilonian, Persian, Grecian, Monarchies
have destroyed and ruined one another,
<q>
                     <l>—Sic Medus ademit</l>

                     </l>
                  </q>
but still the Church of Christ lifts up its Head,
and beholds their ruins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Presence of Christ in and with
his Ordinances is undeniably evinced, from their
Supernatural effects upon the Souls of Men;
<hi>2 Cor. 10. 4. The weapons of our warfare are not
carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of
strong holds.</hi> 'Tis the Spirit of Christ that gives
them their success and efficacy: The Sword of
the Gospel hath its point and edge, but it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
the Heart of a stupid hardned sinner
should ever be prickt or wounded by it, if the
Spirit of Christ did not manage it. When sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
fall down convinced under the authority of
the Word, they feel, and readily acknowledge,
that God is in it of a truth, I <hi>Cor. 14. 25. Ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finus</hi>
reports, that at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, of no great learning, was the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of converting a learned Philosopher, whom
the <hi>Bishops</hi> with all their Arguments could not
perswade; of which the <hi>Philosopher</hi> himself
gave this remarkable account, <hi>Whilst you reasoned
with me, said he, against words, I opposed words, and
what was spoken, I overthrew by the art of speaking;
but when, in stead of words, power came out of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109022:38"/>
mouth of the speaker, words could no longer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
truth, nor Man resist the power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this indeed is the true and just account of
all those marvellous and gracious changes made
upon the Souls of Men by the Preaching of the
Gospel: Can the vanishing breath of a dying
Man, think you, inspire Spiritual and Eternal
Life into the Souls of other Men? Can he search
the Conscience, break the Heart, and bow the
Will at this rate? No, no, this is the Power and
Operation of Christ;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Anth. Burgesse <hi>on</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</note> and of that Presence we
must say, saith a Reverend Author, as <hi>Martha</hi>
did to her Saviour, concerning the Death of her
Brother <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11. 21. <hi>Lord if thou hadst
been here my Brother had not dyed.</hi> So, say I, if
that Presence and Power of Christ were felt by
all, which hath been certainly experienced and
felt by many, they had not remained in the state
of Spiritual Death as they do. But though there
be thousands under Ordinances that never felt
this Power of Christ upon them, yet blessed be
God there are also multitudes of Witnesses and
Evidences of this Truth, that there is a Real,
Spiritual, Energetical Presence of Christ in his
own appointments; which was the first thing to
be evinced.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The second thing requiring Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
is the Uses and Ends which makes such a
Presence of Christ necessary. And they are</p>
               <p>1. To Preserve and Support his Ministers and
Churches amidst such Hosts of potent and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
Enemies: This Presence of Christ is as a
wall of Fire round about them. It was the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Presence with <hi>Ieremiah</hi> that was as a Life-Guard
to him, against the rage of the Princes
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:109022:39"/>
and Nobles of <hi>Israel,</hi> Jer. 15. 20, 21. <hi>I will make thee
unto this People a fenced brazen Wall, and they shall
fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against
thee, for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver
thee, saith the Lord: And I will deliver thee out of
the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of
the hand of the terrible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was easier for the <hi>Roman Army</hi> to scale the
Walls, and batter down the Towers of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
than for all the Enemies in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
this Prophet of God thus immur'd by the
Divine Presence. <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> had the
Power of the Empire ingaged against them, yet
the Presence of Christ was their security. The
Witnesses could not be slain till they had finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their Testimony, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. To this Presence
alone the faithful Witnesses of Christ owe their
marvellous preservation at this day; had not
Christ said, <hi>Lo, I am with you,</hi> you had not said
at this day, <hi>behold our Ministers are still with us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Presence of Christ is necessary
to assist and enable his Ministers in their Work,
for it is a Work quite above their own strength;
it is well we are Workers-together with God,
else we should soon faint under our Labours.
When <hi>Moses</hi> objected, <hi>I am not eloquent,</hi> the Lord
told him, <hi>I will be with thy Mouth, Exod.</hi> 4. 10.
When God guides the Tongue how powerful
and persuasive must the Language be! When the
<hi>Apostles,</hi> illiterate men, were sent out to convert
the World, Christ promised to give them <hi>a
Mouth and Wisdom, Luke</hi> 21. 15. a Mouth to
speak, and Wisdom to guide that Mouth; and
then their words were demonstrations, all
their adversaries could not resist that Spirit and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:109022:39"/>
Power by which they spake. Empires and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
full of Enemies, received the Gospel; but
the reason of this wonderful success is given us,
in <hi>Mark 16. 20. They went out and Preached every
where, the Lord working with them.</hi> 'Tis sweet
and prosperous working in fellowship with
Christ: The Spirit of Christ gives a manifold as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
to his Ministers in their Work; 'tis he
that guides and directs their minds in the choice
of those Subjects wherein they labour with such
success to their Hearers. He dictates the Matter,
influences their Affections, guides their Lips, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
home their Doctrine with success; and this
is a special Use and End of Christs Presence with
his Ministers and Ordinances.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Spiritual Presence of Christ is
necessary for the preparation and opening of the
peoples Hearts to receive and embrace the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
to Salvation; not an Heart will open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ till the Spirit of Christ unlock them.
<hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> were extraordinarily called to
Preach the Gospel at <hi>Macedonia,</hi> there <hi>Lydia</hi> was
converted; but how? Not by their Skill or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence,
but the Spirits influence, <hi>Acts 16. 14.
The Lord opened the Heart of Lydia.</hi> The Church
could not be propagated without Conversion;
Conversion could never be wrought without
Christs Influence and Spiritual Presence. So that
this Presence is of absolute necessity; the Church
cannot subsist, nor the great ends of Ordinances
attained without it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Is Christ really Present in all Gospel Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

People did receive the Word we Preach, as the
<hi>Thessalonians</hi> did, not as the Word of Man, but
as the Word of God, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. then it would
Work effectually in us as it did in them. But
alas! We have loose and low apprehensions of
the Word; we come to Judge the Gifts of the
Speaker, not to have our Minds informed, our
Consciences searched, our Lusts mortified, and
our Lives regulated. But oh, that Men would
realize the Presence of Christ in Ordinances,
and seriously consider that Word of his, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.
23. <hi>All the Churches shall know that I am he which
searcheth the Reins and Hearts, and I will give to
every one of you according to your Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How would it compose vain and wandering
Hearts unto holy seriousness! Oh, if Men would
but consider that they are before the Lord Jesus
Christ, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his Family did, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.
33. <hi>We are all here present before God, to hear all
things that are commanded thee of God.</hi> If they
would consider the Word as the executioner of
Gods eternal Decrees which returns not in vain,
but accomplishes that whereunto God sends it,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 11. and eventually proves the savour of
Life or Death eternal to them that sit under it,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 16. In a word, were it but considered as
the Rule by which its hearers shall be judged in
the great Day, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. 48. then how would Men

would it have upon their Hearts? How would it
run and be glorified? But alas, as <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, <hi>Iob</hi>
9. 11. <hi>He goeth by me, and I see him not; he passeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:109022:40"/>

Spiritual Presence of Christ in Ordinances.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="inference">
               <head>Second Inference.</head>
               <p>If Christ be really present with his Churches
and Ordinances, <hi>how vain are all the attempts of
Enemies to subvert and destroy them?</hi> That pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
<hi>Matth. 28. ult.</hi> supposes the continuance of
a Gospel Church and Ministry to the end of the
World, else there would be a Promise without a
Subject; as <hi>de Iure,</hi> there ought to be a Church,
so <hi>de facto,</hi> there shall be a Church with Ministers
and Ordinances, let Satan and Antichrist do
their worst. I do not say this Promise secures
this or that particular Church or Nation, for
the presence of Christ is moveable from one
place to another, but still the Church is safe.
And there are three things that secure it against
all hazards.</p>
               <p>First, The invaluable Treasures God hath
lodged in the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Truths,</hi> his <hi>Worship,</hi>
and his <hi>Elect;</hi> such a precious Cargo secures the
Vessel that carries it, what ever Storms or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests
may befal it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Covenant and Promise of God,
with the Church, is its abundant security, <hi>Matth.</hi>
16. 18. <hi>Vpon this Rock will I build my Church, and
the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi> The
faithfulness of God is pawned for his Peoples se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity.
If the Church fail God's faithfulness
must fail with it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, But above all, the Presence of Christ,
in the midst of it, puts it out of all danger of
miscarrying. In that Promise, <hi>Lo, I am with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109022:41"/>
you alway,</hi> are found all munitions and fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whatsoever: Here we have his Eye of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
his Hand of Power, and whatsoever else
is needful to support and secure it. God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
his Presence our safety, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 10. The
Enemies of God and his People account it so too,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 14. 25. and shall it not be so in our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?
Provoke not the Lord Jesus to withdraw
his Presence, and fear not the consultations and
oppositions of Hell or Earth.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="inference">
               <head>Third Inference.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>From this Spiritual Presence of Christ all his
faithful Ministers should draw incouragement amidst
the manifold difficulties and discouragements, they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encounter, in his Work and Service.</hi> Christ is
with them, they Work in Fellowship with him,
let them not be dismaid.</p>
               <p>The difficulties and discouragements the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of Christ meet with are great and many;
and the more faithful and successful any of them
are in their Masters Work, the fiercer oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they must expect: Besides all the discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
rising out of their own Hearts, which are
not a few, they must encounter.</p>
               <p>First, The opposition of Enemies from abroad.
Secondly, The obstinacy and stubornness of the
Hearts they work upon; Satan is a jealous
Prince, and will raise all manner of outcries
and oppositions against those heavenly <hi>Heraulds,</hi>
that come to Proclaim a new Prince in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions,
and withdraw his miserable Subjects
from their cursed Allegiance to him. What is it
to Preach the Gospel (said <hi>Luther</hi>) but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:109022:41"/>
the fury of the World upon the Head of that
Preacher? But this would be easily supportable,
did our Work but prosper upon the hearts of
our hearers; but this alas, is the killing conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of all; we know the worth of Souls, and
how great a service it is to save them from death,
<hi>Iames</hi> 5. 20. We also know the terrors of the
Lord, which excite our utmost endeavours to
perswade men, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 11. We feel the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of Christ stirring in our own bowels, which
makes us long after their Salvation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 8.
We preach, we pray, yea, we travail again as it
were in birth until Christ be formed in them,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 19. And when we have done all, we find
their Hearts as Iron and Brass, <hi>Ier.</hi> 6. 28. We
mourn in secret when we cannot prevail, and
oft times our Hands hang down with discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and we are ready to say with the <hi>Prophet,
We will speak no more in his name,</hi> Jer. 20. 9. But
here is our relief, under all discouragements from
abroad and at home; the Work is Christs, the
Power is his, he is with us, and we are Workers
together with him. There was a time when
Three thousand Souls were born to Christ at one
Sermon, it may be now Three thousand Sermons
may be preacht and not a Soul Converted: Yet
let us not be discouraged, a time of eminent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
is Promised, and to be expected in these
latter days, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 47. 9. when the living waters
of the Gospel shall make every thing to live
whither they come. And when the Fishers (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
the Ministers of Christ shall not fish with Angles
as now they do, taking now one, then another
single Convert, but shall spread forth their Nets,
but inclose multitudes at a draught; <hi>When they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:109022:42"/>
Shall flee as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</hi>
God now opens a door of opportunity
beyond expectation; Oh that the Hearts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
and People were suitably enlarged, and
the People made willing in the day of his Power.</p>
            </div>

               <head>Fourth Inference.</head>
               <p>Hence we also infer the great dignity of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
Office, and the suitable respect and honour due
to all Christs faithful Ministers.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jesus himself is represented by them,
they stand in his stead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20. his authority
is clothed upon them; the honours and disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
given them, redounds to the person of
Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16. The <hi>Galathians</hi> received
<hi>Paul</hi> as an Angel of Gold, even as Christ Jesus,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>Yet how have their Persons and Office been
vilified and despised in this degenerate age!
How many Learned, Pious, Laborious, Peaceful
Ministers of Christ have in this age, been hunted
up and down the World as wild Beasts, been
made the filth and off-scouring of all things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this day, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. The Word signifies that
dirt and filth which <hi>Scavengers</hi> rake together in
the Streets, to be carried to the Dunghil. No
doubt but <hi>Satan</hi> drives a great design in this to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate
their Ministry, discourage their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and break their Hearts: but Jesus Christ
will support us under all these abuses, wipe off
the dirt thrown at us, for his Name sake, and
reserve some of us for better days.</p>

<hi>Luke</hi> 12. 1. Ah, shall Men be so earnest for a Cure
for their Bodies, and so indifferent for their

by any necessity to act always with the World;
he acts as an arbitrary Agent, <hi>Iohn 13. 8. The
Wind bloweth where it listeth:</hi> but it is engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enough to wait continually upon his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
that he sometimes graciously and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually

at his Gates, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 34. Oh therefore neglect

                  <hi>What an unspeakable loss is the loss of the Gospel,
seeing the Presence of Christ comes and goes with it?</hi>
When the Gospel departs, the Spirit of Christ
departs with it from among Men; no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,
in Gods ordinary way, are then to be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:109022:43"/>
expected: well therefore might the Lord say,
in <hi>Hosea 9. 12. Wo to them when I depart from them.</hi>
The Spirit may in some sense depart whilst the
Ordinances are left standing for a time among
the People, but then expect no such blessings or
benefits from them. But when God takes away
Ordinances and Spirit too, wo indeed to that
People; and are there not Sins amongst us pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saging
such a Judgment? Oh <hi>England</hi> reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

answerable to such precious means? The Gospel
is a golden Lamp, the graces of the Spirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

               <p>And no less ominous and portentous- is that
bitter enmity to the Gospel and the serious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors
of it, which (I cannot speak without
horror) is every where found among us; this
great hatred brings on the days of visitation,

and draw them home to Christ, when the Spirit
of Christ animates and blesseth it. Well might
the Apostle therefore say, that the Gospel
preached with the Holy Ghost, sent down from
Heaven, is an object worthy for Angels to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

Satan have strongly fortified their Souls against

            <p>HAving finished Christs solemn Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,

his Presence in his Churches and
Ordinances: I now come to a
third Observation, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
implied in these words, <hi>Behold I stand at

implied is this,</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRIN.</head>
               <p>That the Hearts of Men are naturally lockt up and
fast barr'd against Iesus Christ their only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>If it were not so, what need were there of all
that pains and patience, used and exercised by
Christ, in waiting patiently, and knocking im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunately,
for entrance into the Hearts of
Men? To keep a clear method in this point,
three things must be stated in the Doctrinal
part,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:109022:45"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. How it appears the Hearts of Men are
thus shut up.</item>
                     <item>2. What are those Locks and Bars that shut
them up.</item>
                     <item>3. That no Power of Man can remove these
Bars.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, That all Hearts are naturally shut and
made fast against Christ, is a sad but certain
truth; we read, <hi>Iohn 1. 11, 12. He came unto his
own, and his own received him not,</hi> &amp;c. He came
unto his own People from whose stock he sprang
up; a People to whom he had been prefigured,
in all the Sacrifices and Types of the Law; and
in whom they might all clearly discern the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment
of them all. His Doctrines and
his Miracles plainly told them who he was, and
whence he came; yet few discerned or received
him as the Son of God. Christ found the Doors
of Mens Hearts generally shut against him, save
only a few whose Hearts were opened by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power of God, in the way of Faith, <hi>vers.</hi>
12. these indeed received him, but all the rest
excluded and denied entrance to the Son of God.
So again, in <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. from 33. to 40. Christ rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
with them, and gives undeniable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,
that he was the <hi>Messiah</hi> come to save
them; proves it from the testimony of <hi>Iohn
vers. 33. Ye sent unto</hi> John, <hi>and he bare witness un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Truth;</hi> Tells them the design of his coming
among them was their Salvation, <hi>vers.</hi> 34. shews
them the great Seal of Heaven, his uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Miracles, <hi>vess. 36. The Works that I do, bear
witness of me, that the Father hath sent me:</hi> And
if that were not enough, he reminds them of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:109022:45"/>
immediate testimony given of him from Heaven,
<hi>vers. 37. The Father himself which hath sent me,
bath born witness of me.</hi> He did so at his <hi>Baptism,
Matth. 3. 17. And lo a voice from Heaven, saying,
This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
And so again, at his transfiguration upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Mount, <hi>Math. 17. 5. While be yet spake, behold
a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold a
voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Son in whom I am well pleased, hear ye him.</hi>
He bids them search the Scriptures, and critical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
examine his perfect correspondence to them,
<hi>vers.</hi> 39. Enough one would think to open the
door of every Mans understanding and Heart
to receive him with fullest satisfaction: and yet
after all behold the unreasonable obstinacy and
resistance of their Hearts against him, <hi>vers. 40.
Ye will not come unto me that you might have life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not a Soul will open, with all the reasons
and demonstrations in the World, till the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power of God be pur forth to that end.
If another come in his own name (saith he, <hi>vers.</hi>
43.) <hi>Him will ye receive;</hi> Any body rather than
the Son of God: Every cheat can impose upon
you easily, 'tis to me only your Hearts have such
strong aversations. Now there is a twosold shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up of the Heart against Jesus Christ.</p>

               </list>
               <p>First, <hi>Natural,</hi> every Soul comes into this
World shut up and fast closed against the Lord
Jesus. The very Will of Man which is the freest
and most arbitrary faculty, come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> into the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:109022:46"/>
World barr'd and bolted against Christ, <hi>Rom. 8. 7.
The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not
subject unto the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
Phil. 2. 13. <hi>'Tis God that worketh in you both to will
and to do of his own good pleasure.</hi> This is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
effect of the fall, who feels not strong aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations,
violent rebellions, and obstinate resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
in his own Heart when moving towards
Christ in the first weak and trembling acts of
Faith?</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a <hi>Iudicial</hi> shutting up of
the Heart against Christ. This is a sore and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous
stroke of God, punishing former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions,
<hi>Psal. 81. 11, 12. Israel would have none of
me, so I gave them up to their own hearts lusts.</hi> This
looks like a prelude of Damnation, a very near
preparation to ruine. <hi>Israel would have none of
me,</hi> there's the <hi>natural</hi> shutting up of the Heart,
<hi>So I gave them up,</hi> there's the <hi>judicial</hi> shutting up
of the Heart; they would not hear, they shall
not hear. Oh fearful Judgment! Thus the
Lord gave up the Heathens, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 26. they
had abused their natural light, and now their
minds are <hi>judicially</hi> darkned; given up to a sottish
and injudicious mind, not able to distinguish
Duty from sin, Safety from danger; a mind that
should elect the worst things, and reprobate the
best. This was the reprobate mind unto which
God gave them up; What sadder word can the
Lord speak than this, unless it be <hi>take him Devil?</hi>
'Tis true, those that God shuts up he can open,
and those whom Justice shuts up, Mercy can set
free; but it is beyond all the power of Angels
and Men to do it, <hi>Iob 12. 14. He shutteth up a
Man and there can be no opening.</hi> These two clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:109022:46"/>
of the Heart, are not always found together,
in the same subject, and blessed be God they are
not. Christ meets with many a repulse, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures
with much patience the gainsayings of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
before he pronounce that dreadful sentence
upon them, <hi>Isa. 6. 9, 10. Go and tell this people,
hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but perceive not: Make the heart of this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
fat,</hi> &amp;C.</p>
               <p>But when it comes to this once, dreadful is
the case of such Souls; and none are in greater
danger of this Spiritual Judicial stroak of God,
than those that have sat long under the light, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling
against it. That's the first thing, The
Hearts of Men by nature are lockt and shut up
against Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, Let us examine
what those Locks and Bars are which oppose and
forbid Christs entrance into the Hearts of poor
sinners. And they will be found to be
<list>
                     <item>1. Ignorance.</item>

                  <p>The first Bar making fast the Soul of Man

it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst

a Christ he is that is offered to your Souls in the
Gospel, did you see his beauty, fulness, and suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablness,
and feel your own necessities of him,
all the World could not keep you from him:
You would break through all reproaches, all
sufferings, all self-denials, to come into the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment

It obstructed his miraculous Works when he
was on Earth, and it obstructs his gracious
Works now he is in Heaven. A Saviour is come
into the World, but poor Unbeliever, thy Soul
can neither have Union nor Communion with
him till this Bar of thy unbelief be removed.
The Gospel is come among us with mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to convince, and powerful Motives to
perswade, but little saving effect follows; its
main design is to many frustrated, and all this
through unbelief shutting up and hardning Mens

profit them because of their unbelief, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 2.
Ah cursed Bar! Which shuts up thy Heart, shuts
out thy Saviour, and will effectually shut thee out

break it asunder: <hi>They could not enter in because of

the hearts of sinners is <hi>Pride,</hi> and stoutness of
Spirit. The natural Heart is a proud Heart;
it lives upon its own stock, it cannot stoop to a
sincere and universal renunciation of its own
righteousness, <hi>Rom. 10. 3. Being ignorant of the
righteousness of God, and going about to establish their
own righteousness <gap reason="foreign">

their own emptiness, discover their own
shame, and live wholly upon the righteousness of
another. Proud nature had as live be damned as
deny it self in such appoint as this is; this makes
Faith so exceeding difficult, because it involves
such deep points of self-denial in it; to give up
all to Christ, to draw all from Christ, and to
be willing to part with all for Christ, what Will
can be brought to a deliberate consent to such
things as these, unless an omnipotent Power bow
it? 'Tis natural to Men rather to eat a brown
crust, or wear a course ragged garment which
they can call their own, than to feed upon the
richest dainties, or wear the costliest garments
which they must receive as an alms or gift from
another. Oh, how hard is it to subdue this pride
of the Heart, even after light and conviction is
come into the Soul, to convince Men of their
undone condition, and the absolute necessity of
an other and higher righteousness than their own?
When Souls are in a treaty with Christ, and
the match is almost made; this is the sin that
makes the last opposition. Feign would they
come to Christ, ten thousand Worlds for a
Christ; but yet they think they must not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
him without some qualifications which
are yet wanting. But Soul, if ever Christ and

Self even in this, the most refined form and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of it, and come as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, naked
and empty handed to him that justifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.

by long continuance in the Soul, the Soul is so

and perswasions to change our way are
swept away by the power of custom, as straws
and feathers are by the rapid course of a mighty
torrent, <hi>Ier. 13. 23. Can the Aethiopian change his

good that are accustomed to do evil.</hi> Soap and Nitre
may as soon make a <hi>Blackmoor</hi> white, or fetch
the spots out of the <hi>Leopards</hi> skin (which are
not accidental, but connate) as the reasonings of
Men can prevail to remove the mighty power of
customary sin. Physitians find it a hard thing to

this way or that from our childhood;
every repeated act of sin confirms and strenghtens
the habit; and hence it is that we see so few Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions

this is the sin that parts Christ and thousands of
Souls in the World; presuming, they hope, and
hoping, they perish; when Men presume their
condition is safe already, their Souls never make
out after a Saviour. This was the ruine of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi>
Rev. 3. 17. <hi>Because thou sayest, I am rich,
and increased with goods, and have need of nothing,
and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable,
and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> This damning
presumption is discovered in three things,
(1) Many think they have that grace which they
have not, mistaking the <hi>Similar</hi> for the <hi>saving</hi>
Works of the Spirit; a fatal mistake never
rectified with many thousands till it be too late.
(2) They presume to find that mercy in God,
which they will never find; for all the saving
mercies of God are dispensed to Men through
Christ in the way of Regeneration and Faith,
<hi>Iude</hi> vers. 21. (3) They presume upon that
time for Repentance and Faith hereafter, which
their Eyes shall never see. And thus presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
locks up the Heart against Christ, and leaves
sinners perishing in the presence of a Saviour.

to it. Satan hath drest it up in their fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
in such an odious form and representation
that makes them loath both name and thing.
These prejudices are drawn from various things;
sometimes from the necessary duties of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,
which are laid as crimes upon the people
of God, <hi>Psal. 69. 10. When I wept and chastned
my Soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the groundless and malicious slanders and
inventions of the enemies of Christianity, are
the occasions of real prejudices to the World,
<hi>Ier. 18. 18. Come let us devise devices against</hi> Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,
<hi>and let us smite him with the Tongue.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the innocent and serious Professors of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
are censured and condemned for hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
professors sakes, who never heartily espoused
Religion. And lastly, the ways of holiness suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for the slips and infirmities of weak Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
who commonly give too many occasions to
disgust the World against the ways of God.</p>
                  <p>By these things multitudes are kept off from
attendance upon the means of Grace, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
more have their Hearts shut up from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
any saving benefit under them.</p>
                  <p>These are the common Bars and Locks by
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:109022:50"/>
which the strong Man armed secures his possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Souls of sinners; and these Bars are
too strong for any power beneath the Almighty
power and Arm of God to remove or break;
tis said, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 27. That the Lord opened a
door of Faith to the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> The Arm of the
Lord must be revealed or none will open to
Christ by Faith, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1.</p>
                  <p>1. The iron Bar of the Law, that thundering
terrible Law, cannot force open the Heart of an
unbeliever; all the dreadful curses flying out of
its fiery mouth, make no more impression than a
Tennis ball against a wall of Marble, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19.
You read of them that hear the words of this
Curse, yet bless themselves in their Heart, saying,
they shall have peace though they walk in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
of their Hearts, to add Drunkenness to
Thirst.</p>
                  <p>They play with Hell and Eternal Torments,
rush into iniquity as the Horse rusheth into the
Battle, act as men in love with their own Death, as
those that are at an agreement with Hell. Oh the
besotting, hardning, infatuating power of sin.</p>
                  <p>2. The Golden Key of free Grace cannot in it
self remove these Bars, and open mens Hearts to
Christ, <hi>Matth. 11. 17. We have piped unto you, but
ye have not danced.</hi> The melodious and delicious
Airs of Grace, Mercy, Peace and Pardon, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
not the dead Hearts of unbelievers: Like
deaf Adders they stop their Ears at the voice of
the Charmer, charm he never so wisely. These
Gospel melodies only dispose them to a more
quiet sleep in sin.</p>
                  <p>3. No works of Providence are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
sufficient to open the Hearts of Men to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:109022:51"/>
Christ. 1. The Judgments of God cannot do
it; thousands have been made sick with smite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that yet cannot be made sick for sin. <hi>I have
consumed them, but they refused to receive correction;
they have made their Faces harder then a Rock, they
have refused to return,</hi> Jer. 5. 3. Messengers of
Judgment are abroad, smiting some in their
Estates, scattering in one day the labour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
years; and therein giving a warning blow at
the Conscience to make sure of Christ, and the
World to come, since their comfort and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is scattered in this World. Some are smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in their dearest relations, Death knocks at
their doors and carries out the delight of their
Eyes, and with the same admonisheth their Souls
to place their happiness in more durable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts:
Some are smitten in their Bodies with
Diseases, giving warning of the near approach
of their latter end, and bidding them prepare for
another habitation; but all in vain. 2ly, No
mercies of God are in themselves sufficient to
open the obstinate Hearts of sinners to Christ.
God hath heapt up mercies by multitudes upon
many of you, all these mercies of God lead you
to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. They take you in a
friendly way by the Hand, and thus talk with
you, Ah, sinner! how canst thou grieve! and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
that God that thus feedeth, clotheth and
comforteth thee on every side? Do you thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
the Lord, O foolish people and unwise?
Yet all will not do, neither Judgments nor Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
can affright or allure the carnal Heart to
Jesus Christ. Tis his Spirit, his Almighty power
alone that opens these everlasting Gates, and
makes these strong Bars give way and fly at his
voice.</p>

Poor wretch, canst thou start at a supposed visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 3. Look as the holy Spirit of God

the Souls of the Saints; so Satan dwells
in unregenerate Hearts, actuating their lusts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:109022:52"/>
them with his temptations, using their
faculties and members as instruments of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
And then</p>
               <p>2ly, He will be their <hi>Tormenter</hi> in the World

<hi>Matth. 25. 41. Depart from me ye cursed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi>
Flee therefore and escape for your lives, sleep

               <p>What a glorious and admirable effect of Sovereign
omnipotent grace is the effectual conversion of a sinner
unto God!</p>
               <p>If every Heart by nature be secured for Satan
under so many Locks and Bars, then the opening
of any Heart to Christ is deservedly marvellous
in our Eyes: You all acknowledge that the
opening of the Graves at the Resurrection will
be a glorious display of Almighty power, and
so it will; it will be a wonderful thing to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the Graves opened and the dead raised
at the voice of the <hi>Arch-angel</hi> and the trump of
God; but yet give me leave to say, That the
opening of thy Heart, poor sinner, to receive
Christ, is a more glorious work than that of
raising the dead: It is therefore deservedly put
into the first rank of the great mysteries of
godliness, that Christ is believed on in the
World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. He that well views and
considers Christ, may justly wonder that all the
Hearts in the enlightned World do not stand
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109022:52"/>
wide open to embrace him; and he that shall
consider the frame and temper of the natural
Heart, and how strongly Satan hath intrenched
and fortified himself in it, may justly wonder
to hear of a work of Conversion in an age. Oh
Brethren consider the marvels of Conversion, the
wonderful works of God upon the Soul that
opens unto Christ by Faith.</p>
               <p>1. There's a new Eye created in the mind,
<hi>The Son of God is come and hath given us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that we may know him that is true,</hi> 1 John
5. 20. Oh that Eye! That precious Eye of Faith
which shews the Soul as it were a new World, a
World of new and ravishing objects, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 8.
All the Angels in Heaven, Ministers, and <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
upon Earth, cannot create such an Eye, give
such an Illumination; tis only he that <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the light to shine out of the darkness, that thus
shineth into our Hearts to give the light of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the glory of God in the face of Iesus Christ,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>2ly, And what a glorious supernatural Work
is the conviction of the Conscience by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
stroak of the saving beams of light upon it?
Now the Conscience, that lay in a dead sleep, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to startle and look about it with fear and
horror. Life and sense is got into it, and now
it cries, ah, sick, sick, sick at the Heart for sin,
sick for a Saviour.</p>
               <p>3ly, And no less marvelous an effect of the
Almighty power is the bowing of the stuborn
Will so efficaciously, so congruously, and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminately
and fixedly to the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>The Will is efficaciously determined so as no
power of Hell or Nature can resist or frustrate,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:109022:53"/>
that Mighty power which worketh effectually in
all them that believe, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 13. Yet it works
not by way of compulsion, but in a way congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and agreeable to the nature of the Will,
<hi>Hosea 11. 4. I drew them with the cords of a Man,
with the bands of love.</hi> Satan bids for the Soul,
Christ infinitely outbids all his offers; Eternal,
Spiritual, and unsearchable Riches, instead of
sensitive, perishing enjoyments, which determin
the choice of the Will in its own natural method,
by the sight of the excelling glory of Spiritual
things. And thus the mighty supernatural power
of God opens that Heart which Satan had secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
so many ways against Christ.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hence it also follows, that Man hath no free will
of his own to supernatural good.</hi> The Will cannot
by its own power open it self to receive Christ
by faith. When it doth open to him, it is not
<hi>virtute innata, sed illata,</hi> not by its natural power,
but by the power of God upon it. The admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers

<hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, you must be born again,

the face of God in peace. <hi>It is Christ in you that
is the hope of glory, Col.</hi> 1. 27. Till thy Heart be
opened, Christ with all the hopes of glory stand
without thee. And if hopes from the death of
Christ without us, without the application of
his person, be enough to save Men, then why
are any damned? Consult 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30. Adams</hi>
sin damns none but only such as are in him, and
Christs righteousness saves none but those only
that are by faith in him; the eternal purposes of
the Father, the meritorious death of the Son,
puts no Man into the state of Salvation and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
till both be brought home by the Spirits

Tis good news, good indeed, that Christ
died for sinners; tis good news that Christ is
brought to our very doors in the tenders of the
Gospel, and that the Spirit knocks at the door of
our Hearts by many convictions and perswasions
to open to him and enjoy the unspeakable benefits
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:109022:54"/>
of his death: these things bring us nigh to Christ,
the next door to Salvation, and yet all this may
be eventually but a dreadful aggravation of our

whose Hearts are but almost opened to Christ.</p>

               <p>Divers things may be done by poor sinners
with their own Hearts, which are not done; and
though in themselves they are insufficient, yet
being the way and method in and by which the
Spirit of God usually works, we are bound to
do them. As for Example, (1.) Though it be
not in your power to open your Hearts to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
yet it is in your power to forbear the external
acts of sin, which fasten your Hearts the more
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:109022:55"/>
against Christ: Who forceth thine Hands to
steal, thy Tongue to swear or lye, who forces
the cup of excess down thy Throat? (2ly.)
Though you cannot open your Hearts under the
Word, yet it is in your power to wait and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon the external Duties and Ordinances of
the Gospel: Why cannot those Feet carry thee
to the Assemblies of the Saints, as well as to an
Ale-house? (3ly.) And though you cannot let
the Word effectually into your Hearts, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
you can apply your minds with more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and consideration to it than you do: Who
forces thine Eyes to wander, or closes them with
sleep, when the awful matters of eternal Life
and Death, are founding in thine Ears? (4ly.)
Though you cannot open your Hearts to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
Christ, yet certainly you can reflect upon
your selves when the obvious characters of a
Christless state are plainly held forth before your
Eyes; God hath given you a self-reflecting pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
<hi>The spirit of a Man knoweth the things of a
Man, 1 Cor.</hi> 2. 11. When you hear of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of sin, compunctions of Heart for sin, deep
concernments of the Soul about its eternal state,
hungerings and thirstings after Christ, restless
and anxious Days and Nights about Salvation,
others have felt; you can certainly turn in upon
your selves, and examine whether ever it were
so with you; and if not, methinks it were not
hard to aggravate your own misery to take your
poor Souls aside, and bemoan them, saying, Ah
my poor Soul, canst thou endure everlasting
burnings? What will become of thee if Christ
pass thee by, and his Spirit strive no more with
thee? Why can't you throw your selves at the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:109022:55"/>
Feet of God, and cry for mercy? Prayer is a
part of natural Worship, distress usually puts
Men upon it that yet have no Grace, <hi>Ionah</hi> 1. 5.
Do but this towards the opening and saving of
your own Souls, which though it be not in it self
sufficient, nor puts God under any meritorious
obligation or necessity, to add the rest; yet it
puts you into the way of the Spirit: And is not
thy Soul sinner worth as much as this comes too?
Have you not taken a great deal more pains than
this for the trifles of this World? And will it
not be a dreadful aggravation of sin and misery
to all eternity that you perished so easily? Dont
you see many striving round about you for
Christ and Salvation, whilst you sit still with
folded Arms as if you had nothing to do for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World? <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
violence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> Matth.
11. 12.</p>
               <p>Why should other Mens Souls be dearer to
them than yours unto you? What discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have you, which other Men have not? Or
what encouragements have they, which you have
not? Say not,<note place="margin">Object,</note> we have no assurance our pains
shall prosper, or our strivings be made effectual

we may be Christ-less, and hope-less when all is

and necessity; then sure your Hearts were never
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:109022:56"/>
yet effectually opened by the Gospel. I confess
Mens Eyes may be opened to see sin, and yet
their Hearts at the same time shut up by unbelief
against Christ; but no Mans Heart can be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Christ whilst his Eyes are shut, <hi>Iohn 6. 40.
This is the will of him that sent me, that every one
which seeth the Son, and believeth on him may have
everlasting life.</hi> The work of Faith is always
wrought in the light of Conviction; the cure of
the Heart begins at the Eye of the Mind, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.
18. <hi>To open their Eyes and turn them from darkness
to light, and from the power of Satan to God.</hi> God
opens Mens Hearts by shining into them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
4. 6. If therefore any Mans Eyes be still blinded
with Ignorance, Prejudice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
not his own guilt and misery, nor sees the
worth and necessity of a Saviour; that Mans
Heart is still under Satans Lock and Bar, sin is
shut in and Christ is shut out of that Mans
Soul.</p>

                  <p>No Heart opens to Christ by Faith till it be
first prickt and wounded by Compunction and
Humiliation; this Heart-wounding work is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
antecedent to the work of Faith. I doubt
not but your thoughts fore-run my Discourse to
that famous Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. where <hi>Peter</hi>
preaching to those that had crucified Christ, and
bringing up his Discourse close to their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,
in the application of that Sermon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
them not only what an horrid and atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
crime the crucifying the Son of God was in
it self; but also charging it home upon them,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109022:57"/>
                     <hi>Whom you have taken, and with wicked Hands have
crucified and slain: When they heard this, they were
pricked at the Heart; and cried out, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
what shall we do?</hi> Upon this outcry three
thousand Souls opened in one hour to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Now consider whether your Hearts have been
thus prickt and wounded? Hath sorrow for sin
pierced thy Soul? Vain sinner, that frothy Heart
of thine must be made to bleed, under Compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
for sin, or there will be no room for
Christ in it. Come Souls, tis in vain to flatter your
selves in your own Eyes; reflect upon the frames
of your Hearts, call back the days that are past,
and say, When was the <hi>Time,</hi> and where was
the <hi>Place</hi> when thou layest at the Foot of God
sobbing and mourning upon the account of thy
Sins? Did ever God hear such a cry as this
from thy Soul? <hi>Ah, Lord my Soul is distressed, I
rowle hither and thither for ease and comfort, but find
none: O the insupportable weight of guilt! Oh the
bitterness of sin! My Soul fails under it, Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
for me.</hi> I do not say, The degrees of
Compunction and Humiliation are equal in all
Converts, neither their sins nor abilities to bear
sorrows for them are equal; but this I say, Thy
Heart must ake for sin, or it will never open to
Christ; he binds up none but broken Hearts,

                  <p>If Christ be come into thy Heart, then the
love and delight of every sin is gone out of thy
Heart. Christ and the love of sin cannot dwell
together; what Christ said to the Soldiers that
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:109022:57"/>
apprehended him, in the Garden, the like he
saith to every Soul that comes to apprehend him
by Faith, <hi>If you seek me, let these go their way;</hi>
away with the sin thou most delightest in, Christ
cannot come in till these be gone, <hi>Isa. 55. 6, 7, 8.
Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon
him while he is near; let the wicked forsake his way
and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, and let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him,
and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Here
be the terms of your Acceptation and Salvation
plainly laid down, forsake thy ways and thoughts;
the <hi>way</hi> notes the external acts of sin, and the
<hi>thoughts</hi> the internal acts; both of contrivance,
and delight in sin, both these must be forsaken;
and that's not all, for this makes up but a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
holyness, <hi>Let him return to the Lord and he will
have mercy.</hi> It is in vain for Men to make the
door of Salvation wider than God hath made it;
we cannot bring down Christs terms lower than
he hath set them; if we will not come up to them,
Christ and we must part. And this makes the
great struggle, the sharp debate, in the Souls of
Converts. Oh, tis hard to give up pleasant and
profitable lusts; but away they must go, a Bill of
Divorce must be signed for them, or you cannot
be espoused to the Lord Jesus. This will be
found to be a harder tug than to part with all
externals for Christ sake.</p>

                  <p>Every Heart that opens sincerely, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lically
to Christ, opens to him in deep humility
and sense of its emptiness and unworthiness; all
self-righteousness is given up as dung and dross;
thus <hi>Abraham</hi> came unto him, as to one that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth
the ungodly, <hi>Rom. 4. 5. Now unto him that
worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the
ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness.</hi>
Yea, here's the true way of Justification indeed;
where the imputed righteousness of Christ comes,
all self-righteousness vanishes before it. By him
that worketh not, understand not an idle, lazy
believer, that takes no care of the duties of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
no, no, an idle Faith can never be a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith; but the meaning is, he worketh not
in a Law sense, to the ends and intentions of
the first Covenant; to make up a righteousness
to himself by his own working, to cover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self-with
a robe of righteousness of his own
spinning, and weaving; a home-made Cloth;
no, not a rag of that. Thou must receive Christ
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:109022:58"/>
into an empty, naked, unworthy Soul, or not
receive him at all. Blessed <hi>Paul</hi> heartily rejected
all his own righteousness, cast down that <hi>House-Idol</hi>
to the ground, that he might be found in the
imputed righteousness of Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 8. cast
that Idol out of door, it stands in the way of a
better righteousness. There be diverse ways
wherein sinners maintain their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
to their own ruin; there is a gross
and more refined self-righteousness; the one
more palpable and easily liable to convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the other much harder to be discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and cured. Ask some Men upon what
their hopes of Salvation are grounded? And
they will tell you, they are just in their dealings
with Men, and constant in their prayers to
God, that's all, and therefore they doubt not of
their Salvation: Thus they substitute a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of their own in the room of Christ's
blood, and are their own <hi>destroyers</hi> by seeking
this way to be their own <hi>Saviours:</hi> But then
there is a more refined way of self-righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
drest up with such pretences of humility,
that Men are hardly to be convinced of it. I pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
many poor Souls upon this account, who stand
off from Christ, dare not believe, because they
want such and such qualifications to fit them for
Christ. O saith one, could I find so much bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness
of Heart for sin, so much reformation
and power over corruptions, then I could come
to Christ; the meaning of which is this, if I
could bring a price in my Hand to purchase him,
then I should be in couraged to go unto him. Here
now lyes horrible pride covered over with a vail
of great humility: Poor sinner either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Lastly, Whatever Soul opens savingly to
Christ, it opens finally and everlastingly to him;
the Heart once opened to Christ, must stand open
for ever to him, never to shut out Christ any
more: And here is a very observable difference
betwixt a Man that comes to Christ in a suddain
fright of Conscience, and parts with him again
when that fright is over; and a Man that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
Christ not to sojourn, but to dwell in his
Heart by Faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17. when Christ comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Heart, he saith, Here will I dwell for ever;
and Lord, saith the Soul, So I receive thee; this
is the day of union, O let me never know a day
of separation; let it never be in the power of
Life or Death, Angels, Principalities, or Powers,
things present or to come, to make a separation
between thee and me. Soul, saith Christ, thou
shalt be mine whilst I am in Heaven; and Lord,
saith the Soul, I will be thine whilst I am on
Earth. I will never leave thee nor forsake thee
saith Christ; Oh my Lord, saith the Soul, hold
me fast in thy Hand, that I may never leave nor
forsake thee; my Estate, Liberty, and Life, may
and must go; but it is in the fixed purpose of my
Heart never, never, to let thee go. The espou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals
betwixt Christ and the Soul are for ever,
<hi>Hos. 2. 19. I will betroth thee unto me for ever, yea
for ever;</hi> and here lyes another great difference
betwixt the Hipocrite that takes Christ with a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:109022:59"/>
politick reserve, that will venture with Christ
at Sea no farther than he can see the shore; and
the upright Heart that imbarks it self with
Christ without reserves, come what will; that
saith to him, as <hi>Ittai</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> when perswaded
to go back in a time of danger; nay, saith he,
where my Lord Jesus Christ is, whether it be in
Liberty or in Prison, in Life or in Death, there
also will I be. Flesh may perswade to a retreat,
nay saith the Soul, I cannot retreat; but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the truths of Christ, the interest and glory
of Christ are, there also must I be; for upon
these terms I first received him, and opened the
door of my Heart to him. These things are no
surprises to me, Christ and I have debated them
long ago; he delt fairly with me, and I must
deal faithfully with him.</p>
                  <p>Now Brethren, view over these six Tryals; Have
your Eyes been opened to see sin in its vileness,
Christ in his beauty and necessity? Have your
Hearts been prick'd and wounded with compun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and sorrow for sin? Are the loves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of sin gone out of your Souls? Have you
no exceptions either to the cross or yoke of
Christ? Have you given up all your own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
whether gross or refined, for dung and
dross, and received Christ for ever? Then thy
Heart is savingly opened to him.</p>

I do not say that every Man whose Heart
is opened by Faith, is thereupon immediately as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
and satisfied that God hath chosen him to
Salvation; but whether he apprehend it or no,
the thing in it self is certain and real, consult
<hi>1. Thes. 1. 4, 5. Knowing brethren, beloved, your election
of God, for our Gospel came not to you in word only,
but also in power and in the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. Their
election of God was the thing to be proved; but
alas, might they say, who can know that but God
alone? It is among the Divine secrets; yes saith
the Apostle, we know it, and by this we know it,
for our Gospel came not unto you in an empty
sound, but in mighty efficacy, effectually opening
your Hearts to believe. A more clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
evidence of your Election cannot be given in
this World; look again into <hi>Rom. 8. 30. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
whom he did predestinate, them he also called;
and whom he called, them he also justified; and
whom he justified, them he also glorified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are two great and ravishing Truths
cleared in this Scripture; the one is this, That
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:109022:60"/>
the whole number of the called upon Earth is
taken out of such as were predestinated to Life
before the World was. The other is this, That
as the whole number of the glorified Saints in
Heaven, is made up of Souls called and justified
upon Earth: so the called Soul, that is, the Soul
that savingly opens to Christ by Faith, may
from that work of the Spirit upon him, solidly
reason backward to Gods electing love, before all
time; and forward, to his glorification with
God, when time shall be no more.</p>
                  <p>Oh, how strong is the Consolation flowing out
of this glorious work of the Spirit upon our

our ignorant, dead, unbelieving Hearts might
be opened unto Christ, in acts of Repentance

rejoyceth, the Conduits run with Wine, all
demonstrations of joy and thankfulness in every
City and Town; 'tis much more so in Heaven,
when a Soul is born to Christ under the Gospel;
'tis a satisfaction to the Heart of the Lord Jesus
who now beholds more of the travel of his Soul,
and to all the Angels and Saints that another
Soul is espoused to him.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, when the Gospel is effectually brought
home by the Spirit to the Heart of a sinner, and
wounds him for sin, sends him home crying, oh
sick, sick; sick for sin, and sick for Christ; the
news thereof is presently in Heaven, and sets the
whole City of God a rejoycing. Christ never
rejoyced over thee before, thou hast wounded
him and grieved him a thosand times, but he

never rejoyced in thee till now; and that which
gives joy to Christ may well be matter of Joy to
thee; that's the Sixth Consolation.</p>

and this the Lord doth not once or twice, but all
the day long, <hi>Isa. 65. 2.</hi> shewing forth all long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering,
as the Apostle speaks, <hi>1 Tim. 1. 16.</hi> In
the opening of this Point I will shew you,
<list>
                     <item>1. What Divine Patience is.</item>
                     <item>2. Wherein it is evidenced.</item>
                     <item>3. Why it is exercised to wards sinners.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, Of the nature of Divine Patience, it
is an ability in God not only to delay the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of his wrath for a time, towards some,
but to delay it in order to the eternal Salvation of
others. Let me speak to the parts of this descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Divine Patience.</p>
               <p>1. It is an ability or power in God, not the
effect of Impotence, or want of opportunity:
All sinners are continually within the reach of the
Arm of his Justice, and he can strike when and
where he will. <hi>Esan</hi> had a revengeful mind
against <hi>Iacob,</hi> but wanted opportunity, and
therefore was forc't to delay the execution of
his conceived wrath, until the days for mourning
for his Father were come; and then faith he, <hi>I
will slay my Brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>Gen. 27. 41.</hi> But in
God it is a glorious effect of power, <hi>Nahum 1. 3.
The Lord is slow to anger, and great in power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The greatness of his patience flows from the
greatness of his power: so the Apostle speaks,
<hi>Rom. 9. 22. What if God willing to shew his wrath
and to make his power known, endured with much
long-suffering the vessels of wrath fitted</hi> or made up
<hi>to destruction.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Moses</hi> prays
for the exercise of Divine Patience towards the
provoking <hi>Israelites,</hi> he doth it in this form,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:109022:65"/>
                  <hi>Numb. 14. 17, 18. And now I beseech thee let the
power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast
spoken, saying, The Lord is long-suffering,</hi> &amp;c. He
could exercise this Almighty power upon thee,
and crush thee by it as a Moth is crushed; but
behold he exercises it upon himself in stopping
the propensions of his own Justice, which daily
solicit him to cut thee off; tis the power of
God over his wrath, bridling, and restraining it
from day to day.</p>
               <p>2. This Patience is exercised towards such as
perish, in a temporary delay of their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and though this be but a meer suspension of
his wrath for a <hi>time,</hi> yet it is a glorious act of
Patience in him; as that forecited Text, <hi>Rom. 9.</hi>
22. shews; is it nothing for a sinner condemned,
as soon as born, to be reprieved so many years
out of Hell? Thou hast been provoking him
dayly and hourly, to cut thee off and send thee
to thy own place; and yet to be on this side the
ever lasting burnings, this is wholly owing to the
riches of his forbearance. Ah, how is God to
be admired in this his glorious power over his
own wrath! When we look abroad into the
World, and see every where sinners ripe for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
daring the God of Heaven to his face,
yet forborn, how admirable is this Power of
God!</p>
               <p>3. God doth not only exercise this Power in a
temporary suspension of his wrath against some,
who alas, must feel it at last;<note place="margin">Isa. 48. 8, 9.</note> but he delays the
execution of his wrath in a design of mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, that they may never feel it. Thus
he bears with his own Elect, all the years of their
lives wherein they lay in the state of Nature, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:109022:66"/>
went on in a course of rebellion against God;
and this long-suffering of God towards them
proves their Salvation, as you have it in <hi>2 Pet. 3.
15. And account that the long-suffering of our Lord is
Salvation.</hi> Whats the meaning of that? Ah!
Christian, thou maist easily know the meaning
of it, without turning over many <hi>Commentaries,</hi>
thou art now in Christ, safely escaped out of the
danger of wrath to come; but thou owest this
thy Salvation to the patience and long-suffering
of God towards thee. For what if he had cut
thee off in the days of thy ignorance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
against him (and thou knowest thou
didst give him Millions of provocations so to do,)
Where hadst thou now been? Thou hadst never
seen Christ, nor the least dawning hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
by him. Remember, how oft you lay in
those days upon beds of sickness, upon the brink
of the grave; what was it that saved thee from
eternal wrath but this admirable Patience of
Christ? Well therefore may the Apostle say,
<hi>Account the long-suffering of God to be Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Patience of God seems to be a branch
springing out of his mercy and goodness; only
it differs from mercy in this, that Man as <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi>
is the object of Mercy; but Man as <hi>criminal</hi>
is the object of Patience. Thus briefly of the
Nature of Divine Patience, a power of God over
his own wrath, not only to suspend it for a time
towards them that perish; but to delay the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of it, in a design of Salvation towards
others.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next we come to shew the various
evidences of this Divine Patience, or wherein it
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:109022:66"/>
appears in its glorious manifestations towards
provoking sinners; and there are seven full evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
and discoveries of it, which should make
the Hearts of sinners melt within them whilst
they are sounding in their Ears. Ah, methinks
such things as these should melt down your hard
Hearts before the Lord.</p>
               <div n="1" type="evidence">
                  <head>I. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>And the first Evidence of the riches of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
shall be taken from the multitude of sins
that Men and Women are guilty of before him,
the least of which is a burden too heavy for any
creature to bear; the <hi>Psalmist</hi> faith, <hi>Psal. 40. 12.
Innumerable evils have compassed me about.</hi> It was
true, as applied to the person of <hi>David;</hi> and
though it be there applied to the person of
Christ, yet not one of them were his own sins,
but ours; called his, by Gods reckoning or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
them to him. Men can number vast Sums,
Millions of Millions, but no Man can number
his own sins, they pass all account. There is not
a member of the Body though never so small but
hath been the instrument of innumerable evils.
For instance, the <hi>Tongue,</hi> the Apostle tells us, is
<hi>a World of iniquity, Iames 3. 6.</hi> and if there be <hi>a
World</hi> of sin in one member, what then are the
sins of all? How many idle, frothy, vain words
hath thy Tongue uttered? And yet for them
Christ saith, <hi>Men shall give an account in the day of
Iudgment, Matth. 12. 36.</hi> And what have the sins
of thy thoughts been, <hi>The thought of foolishness is
sin,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Prov. 24. 9.</hi> O who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his errors? Yet the Patience of God hath
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:109022:67"/>
not crackt and broken under such innumerable
evils. O glorious Patience! Well may it be usher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in in the Text with a term of admiration,
<hi>Behold, I stand.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>

                  <head>II. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>The second Evidence of the Divine Patience,
shall be taken from the heynous nature of some
sins above others, whereby sinners fly, as it were, in
the very Face of God; and yet he bears with much
long-suffering, lets not loose his Hand to cut
them off. All sins are not of one size, some have
a slighter tincture, and some a deeper, called
upon that account, Scarlet and Crimson sins, <hi>Isa.
1. 18.</hi> double dyed abominations, sins in Grain;
such are sins against knowledge, sins committed
after Convictions and Covenants, and rebukes
of Providence. I do not only speak of outward
gross acts of sin, for as the School-men well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
though outwards sins are sins of greater
infamy, yet inward sins may be sins of greater
guilt: Even those sins that never took air to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame
thee in the World; but whatever they be
(Reader) whether outward or inward, thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is privy to them, and thy Soul may stand
amazed at the Patience of God in forbearing
thee all this while under such Provocations, and
horrid Rebellions against him; especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how many there be this day in Hell that
never provoked God by sinning with such a high
Hand as thou hast done.</p>

                  <head>III. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is yet a greater Evidence of the
Patience of God in bearing with, and forbearing
us, under the guilt of that special sin, <hi>viz.</hi> The
slighting and neglecting of Jesus Christ: Here's
a sin that goes to the very Heart of Jesus Christ,
he can bear any other sin rather than that; and
yet this hath Christ born from every Soul of you,
You are the Men and Women that have sputned
at the yearning bowels of his Mercies, slighted
his Grace, trampled his precious Blood under
Foot, and yet hath he forborn you unto this day;
read <hi>Matth. 22. 5</hi> and let thy Conscience answer,
whether thou art not equally deep in the guilt of
making light of Christ with those wretches upon
whom it is there charged? Christ hath suffered
the wrath of God in thy room, brought home
Salvation in Gospel offers to thy door; and then
to be slighted! no Patience but his own could
bear it. Every Sermon and Prayer you have fat
under, with a dead Heart; every motion of his
Spirit which you have quencht, what is this but
the making light of Christ, and the great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Here the deepest project of infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the richest gift of free-grace, wherein
God commends his love to Men, are vilely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalued
as small things; and thus have you
done days without number; and yet his Hand is
not stretched out, to cut thee off in thy Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>Who is a God like unto thee!</hi> What Patience

                  <p>Fourthly, The length of time, the Patience of
Christ hath endured thee, speaks the perfection
and riches of his Patience towards thee.</p>
                  <p>Consider sinner, what Age thou art of, how
many Years thou canst Number, and that all
this hath been a time of Patience, for thou wast
a transgressor from the Womb, <hi>Isa. 48. 8, 9.</hi> yet
for his Name sake hath he deferr'd his anger, and
hath not cut thee off. How soon did the wrath
of God break forth upon the Angels when they
had sinned in Heaven? And how long hath it
born with thee, whilst thou hast been provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
him on Earth? Was there ever Patience
like the Patience of God! Many thousands have
been sent away to Hell fince thy day, but thou
art yet spared; Oh that the long-suffering of
God might be Salvation to thee!</p>

               <div n="5" type="evidence">
                  <head>V. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, Tis a great Evidence of the power
of Divine Patience that may be drawn from the
grievousness of our sins to God, during the
whole <hi>time</hi> of his forbearance: Tis true there is
no proper passion in the Divine Nature; no real
perturbation, his anger is a mild and holy flame,
yet the contrariety of sin to the holyness of his
Nature is what makes his patience miraculous in
the Eyes of Men: The Scripture speaking in a
condescending Language to the understanding
of the creature, represents God as wounded to
the Heart by the sins of Men; so in <hi>Ezek. 6. 9. I
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:109022:68"/>
am broken with their whorish Heart which hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
from me; and Amos 2. 13. Behold I am pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
under you, as a cart is pressed that is full of
sheaves,</hi> when the Axel-tree is ready to crack un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the load; and 2 <hi>Chron. 36. 16 'tis said, The
wrath of the Lord arose against his people till there
was no remedy;</hi> his Patience would bear no longer,
and therefore when he executes his wrath upon
provoking sinners, that execution is represented
in the nature of an ease or relief to his burdened
Patience and Justice, <hi>Isa. I. 24. Ah, saith he, I
will ease me of my enemies, and avenge me of my
adversaries.</hi> Yet observe, it comes in with an
<hi>(ah)</hi> with a kind of regret and reluctancy; so in
<hi>Isa. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 25. Yet a very little while and the indignation
shall cease, and my anger in their destruction.</hi> God
could have given ease and rest this way, to his
anger long ago, but he chuses rather still to
bear with thee, than on these terms to ease him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of thee.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="evidence">
                  <head>VI. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>Sixthly, The vast expences of his riches and
bounty upon us, during the whole time of his
for bearance and patience towards us, speaks him
unconceivable and infinite in his long-suffering
towards us, <hi>Rom. 2. 4, 5. Despisest thou the riches
of his goodness, and forbearance and long-suffering,
not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to
repentance? q. d.</hi> Vile sinner, canst thou compute
the treasures of bounty and goodness, thou hast
been riotously spending and wasting all this
while? Dost thou know what vast sums Christ
hath spent upon thee to preserve thee so long
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:109022:69"/>
out of Hell? There be two Treasures spending
upon sinners all the time of Gods forbearance of
them; there's the precious Treasure of thy
Time wasted, and the invaluable streams of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
Grace running all this while at the waste
Spout; thy Time is precious, the Whole of thy
Time, which is betwixt thee and Eternity, is but
little, and the most thereof has been wasted in
sin, and cast away upon vanity; but that's not
all, the Treasures of Gospel Grace have been
wasting all this while upon thee: In <hi>Zach. 4. 12.</hi>
it is compared to Golden Oyl, maintaining the
Lamps of Ordinances; so it is set forth to us in
that stately Emblem, Who would maintain a
Lamp with Golden Oyl for wanton Children to
play by? yet this hath God done while thy soul
hath dallied and trifled with him. The Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
or Ministers of Christ, in <hi>Rev. 11. 3, 4.</hi> are
compared to those Olive-Trees that drop their
precious Oyl, their Gifts, Graces, yea and their
natural Spirits with them, into this Lamp to keep
it burning; all this while the Blood of Christ
hath been running in vain, the Ministers of Christ
preaching and beseeching in vain, the Spirit of
Christ striving with you in vain. You burn away
Golden Oyl, and yet your Lamp is not gone out.
Oh, Marvelous Patience! Oh the riches of Gods
Forbearance!</p>

                  <head>VII. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>Lastly, The riches of Divine Patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
you, are greatly heightned and aggravated
by the quick dispatch the Lord hath made of
other sinners, whilst he hath spared and pash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:109022:69"/>
you. This comparative consideration calls
upon you in the Apostles language, <hi>Rom. 11. 22.
Behold the goodness and severity of God, on them
which felt severity, but towards thee, goodness; if
thou continue in his goodness, otherwise thou also shalt
be cut off.</hi> Some sinners have been cut off in the
beginning of their days, many in the very acts
of sin, and those not greater than thy sins; they
are gone to their own place, and thou still left for
a Monument of the Patience and Forbearance of
God. The sin of <hi>Achan</hi> was not a greater sin,
than thy Coveteousness, and the Earthliness of
thy Heart is: The sin of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> in
offering up strange fire, than thy superstition,
and offering up uncommanded Services to God;
yet the Hand of God fell upon them, and smote
them dead in the place; in the day and place
wherein they sinned they perisht; they were
taken away in their iniquities, but thou reserved.
Oh, that it might be for an instance and example
of the riches of Divine Patience, which may at
last lead thee to repentance.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you seven Evidences of the
wonderful Patience of Christ, who hath stood,
and still doth stand at the door and knock. Next
we will enquire into the grounds and reasons of
this marvelous Patience of Christ, this astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long-suffering of God towards sinners;
and there are divers obvious reasons of the
long-suffering of God towards Men.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Reas.</note> The exercise of his Patience is a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
testimony of his reconcilable and merciful
nature towards sinful Man. This he shewed
forth in his Patience toward <hi>Paul;</hi> a great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of his merciful Nature for a pattern to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:109022:70"/>
them that should hereafter believe on him, 1 <hi>Tim.
1. 16.</hi> The long-suffering of God is a special
part of his manifestative glory; and therefore
when <hi>Moses</hi> desired a sight of his glory, <hi>Exod.
34. 6.</hi> he proclaims his Name, <hi>The Lord, the
Lord God merciful and gracious, long-suffering and
abundant in goodness and truth.</hi> He would have
poor sinners look towards him as an atoneable
Deity, a God willing to be reconciled, a God
that retaineth not his anger for ever; but if
poor sinners will take hold of his strength,<note place="margin">Isa. 27. 4.</note> and
make peace with him, they may have peace.
This long-suffering is an attribute very expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
of the Divine Nature; he is willing sinners
should know whatever their provocations have
been, there is room for pardon and peace, if
they will yet come in to accept the terms. This
patience is a <hi>Diadem</hi> belonging to the <hi>Imperial
Crown</hi> of Heaven; the Lord glories in it as what
is peculiar to himself, <hi>Hos. 11. 9. I will not execute
the fierceness of my anger, for I am God, and not
Man. q. d.</hi> Had I been as Man, the holyest,
meekest, and mortifiedst man upon Earth, I had
consumed them long ago; but I am god, and
not Man, my Patience is above all created Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience;
no Husband can bear with his Wife, no
Parent with his Child, as God hath born with
you; that's one reason of Christs waiting upon
trifling sinners, to give proof of his gracious,
merciful, and reconcilable nature towards the
wrost of sinners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reas.</note> The Lord exercises this admirable
Patience towards sinners with design thereby to
lead them to repentance; that's the direct aim
and intention of it. The Lord desires and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:109022:70"/>
to see ingenuous relentings and broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart for sin, and there is nothing like
his Forbearance and Patience promotes such an
Evangelical Repentance. All the terrors of the
Law will not break the Heart of a sinner, as the
Patience and Long-suffering of God will do;
therefore it is said, <hi>Rom. 2. 4. That the Goodness,
Forbearance and Long-suffering of God leads Men
to Repentance;</hi> these are fitted to work upon all
these principles of humanity, which incline Men
to Repentance; Reason, Conscience, Gratitude,
feel the influences of the goodness of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
and melt under it; <hi>Sauls</hi> Heart relented in
this case, <hi>1 Sam. 24. 17. Is this thy voice my Son</hi>
David? <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>lift up his voice and wept: And he
said to</hi> David, <hi>Thou art more righteous than I, for
thou hast rewarded me good, where as I have reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thee evil.</hi> Thus the Goodness and Forbearance
of God, doth as it were take sinner by the
Hand, leads him into a corner, and saith, Come,
let thou and I talk together; thus and thus Vile
hast thou been, and thus and thus Long-suffering
and Merciful have I been to thee; thy Heart
hath been full of sin, the Heart of thy God hath
been gull of pity and mercy. This puts the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
into Tears, breaks his Heart in pieces; if
any thing in the World will melt a hard Heart,
this will do it. Oh, how good hath God been
to me! How have I tryed his Patience to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termost,
and still he waiteth to be gracious,
and is exalted that he may have compassion; the
Sobs and Tears, the ingenuous Thaws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentings
of a sinners Heart under the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of the sparing Mercy and Goodness of God
is the Musick of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:109022:71"/>
Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reas.</note> The Lord excercises this long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards sinners to clear his Justice in the
damnation of all the obstinate refusers of Chirst and
Marcy. Christ waits at our doors now, that
he may be clear in his sentence against us hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
This Patience of Christ takes away all
Apologies and Pleas out of the Mouths of impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent
sinners; the more Christ's Patience hath
been, the less defence or plea they will have for
themselves.</p>
                  <p>Think with thy self sinner, what wilt thou
answer in the great day, when Christ shall say,
Did not I stand at thy door from day to day,
from Sabbath to Sabbath, from year to year, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
woing, perswading thee to be reconciled,
and accept Pardon and Mercy in the proper sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of them, and thou wouldst not? <hi>Rev. 2. 21.
I gave her space to repent, and she repented not.</hi>
Well, the Lord gives you time now, a space of
repentance, such a space as millions of Souls
gone out of Time into a miserable Eternity never
had, With whomsoever Christ hath been quick
and severe, to be sure he hath not been so with
you. This time of Christ's Patience will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to clear Christ and condemn you:
Men and Angels shall applaud the sentence as
dreadful as it is, and say, Righteous art thou, O
Lord, in Judging thus.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reas.</note> The Lord draws forth and exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
his admirable Patience towards sinners for
the continuation and propagation of the Church.
The Church must be continued and propagated
from Age to Age, and if God should be quick in
cutting off sinners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as soon as ever they provoke
him, whence shoul the elect of God rise in this
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:109022:71"/>
World? There are thousands of God's Elect in
the Loins of God's Enemies. Many that will
heartily embrace Christ must rise from such as
reject him.</p>
                  <p>Now if God should cut off these in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of their provocations, how should the
Church be continued? Where had good <hi>Abijah</hi>
and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> been, if wicked <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haz</hi>
had been cut off in their first transgressions?
The Lord suffers many a wicked Parent to stand
for a time under his Patience, because Children
are to spring from them who will obey and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
brace that Christ whom their wicked Parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected:
Yea, the Wicked do not only propagate
the Church, but are useful to preserve and defend
it; as the useless chass is a defence to the Wheat,
<hi>Rev. 12. 16. The Earth shall help the Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Reas.</note> To Conclude, the Lord excerciseth
this long-suffering towards sinners in a gracious
condescension to the Prayers of his People. <hi>Were
it not that the Lord had left a small remnant, we had
been as</hi> Sodom, <hi>we had been like unto</hi> Gomorah,
Isa. 1. 9.</p>
                  <p>The Prayers and Intercessions of the Saints are
a skreen betwixt wicked Men and the wrath of
God for a time, <hi>Iob 22. 30.</hi> The innocent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Island. The World stands by the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the Saints; what multitudes of rebellious,
Christ-despising sinners swarm this day in every
part of this Nation? Such as declare by their
open practice they will not have Christ to reign
over them: Who contemn his offers, despise his
Messengers; but blessed be God, yea and let them
bless him too, that there are others mourning to
the Lord for them, beseeching his forbearance
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:109022:72"/>
towards them. Little do the wicked know how
much they are beholding to the Prayers of the
Saints. These and such like Reasons prevail
with the Lord Jesus to stand in waiting, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
posture, at the doors of sinners. Ah. how
loath is he to give them up! We now proceed
to the Uses of this Point, by way of

                  <head>I. Inference.</head>
                  <p>If the Lord Jesus do exercise such admirable
Patience towards sinners, <hi>Then hou much better is
it for poor sinners to be in the Hands of Christ, than
in the Hand of the best and holiest Man in the
World?</hi> O sinner, tis better for thee to fall into
the Hands of the Meek and Merciful Jesus, than
into the Hand of the dearest Friend thou hast
upon Earth; no Creature can bear what Christ
hears; no Patience like the Patience of Christ;
tis said of <hi>Moses, Numb. 11. 12 Now the Man</hi>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:109022:72"/>
Moses <hi>was meek above all the Men upon the face of
the Earth.</hi> There was never such a Man born
into the World, for Patience, Meekness, and
Long-suffering, as <hi>Moses</hi> was; and yet for all
that, this mirror of Meekness could not bear the
Provocations of <hi>Israel;</hi> You Rebels, saith he,
must I draw Water for you out of the Rock?
Thus was his Spirit russled with the provocations
of <hi>Israel,</hi> and this lost him the Land of <hi>Canaan.
Ionah</hi> was a good Man, a Prophet of the Lord,
yet because the Lord would not be so quick and
severe with <hi>Niniveh, as Ionah</hi> would have had
him, In what uncomly Language doth his angry
Soul return upon his God? <hi>Ionah 4. 2. O Lord,</hi>
saith he, <hi>was not this my saying when I was yet in
my Country? Therefore I sled before unto</hi> Tarshish,
<hi>for I knew thou wert a gracious God and merciful,
slow to anger and of great kindness, and repentest
thee of the evil; therefore now, O Lord, take I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech
thee my life from me, for it is better for me to
dye than to live. q. d.</hi> Ah, Lord, I knew it
would come to this, I knew thy gracious nature,
how inclinable thou art to mercy, and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first appearance of their repentance, thou
wouldst repent of the evil, and so free-grace
would make me as a lyer among them.</p>
                  <p>Nay, give me leave to speak a higher word
than all this, and let it not seem strange that
the Patience of the glorified Saints in Heaven is
nothing to the Patience of Christ towards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
sinners upon Earth. Those glorified Souls
that be above, though they have Patience, among
other Graces, perfected in its kind, yet still it is
but Created, finite Patience, and it cannot bear
what Christ's Patience bears; take an instance
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:109022:73"/>
of it out of <hi>Rev. 6. 9, 10, 11. I saw under the
Altar the Souls of those that were slain for the Word
of God, and for the testimony which the held; and
they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O
Lord, holy and true, Dost thou not judge and avenge
our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth? And it
was said unto them, That they Should rest for a little
season.</hi> Here you see glorified Souls less able to
bear the slow pace of Justice towards their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
than Christ was. 'Tis true, here was no
sinful impatience, but yet a patience short of
Christs infinite Patience. Ah, if you were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Patience of any creature in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
or Earth, you had worn it out long ago. I
will not execute the fierceness of my anger, for
I am God and not Man. Ah, 'tis well we have
to do with a God; if a Man find his enemy will
he let him go well away? 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 19. No, no,
he will reckon before he part with him. Sinner,
the Lord finds thee dayly in thy sins, and yet lets
thee go; yet beware thou try not his Patience
too far, lest vengeance overtake thee at last,
and pay the justice of God with all the arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages
due to his Patience.</p>

               <div n="2" type="inference">
                  <head>II. Inference.</head>
                  <p>Hence it follows, that convinced and broken heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sinners need not be discouraged in going to Iesus
Christ for mircy, seeing he exercises such wonderful
Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce towards obstinate and refusing sinners.</p>
                  <p>This inference breaths pure Gospel; it is a
Cordial to chear the Heart that is moving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Christ, with fear and trembling. 'Tis a
great artifice of the Devil to daunt and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:109022:73"/>
courage poor convinced sinners, by telling them
there is no hope of mercy for them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they
shall find the Arms of Mercy closed, the Bowels
of Compassion shut up; that the Time of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is now past, they come too late. O how bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
is Satan with such suggestions as these in many
of your Souls? But I am come to tell you this
day that these are but the artifices of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
you are going to the Fountain of Mercy,
Patience, Goodness and Long-suffering; go on,
and you shall find abundantly more than you
expect. He will not cast off a Soul that comes
Mourning and Panting towards him, and is willing
to subscribe the Gospel articles of Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
No, he will not shut out such a Soul whatever
its rebellions and provocations have been. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
thou art going to the meek and merciful Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
<hi>Matth. 11. 28. Come unto me all ye that labour and
are heavy-laden and I will give you rest; take my yoke
upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly.</hi>
You are going to Meekness and Mercy it self;
he is the Lamb of God, that is his name; go
on then poor trembling sinner, dont stand any
longer at shall I? Shall I? with Christ; but
make a bold but necessary adventure of Faith;
try him once, and then report what you find
im to be: Certainly if he exercises such Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
towards the Vessels of wrath, whilst they
are sitting to destruction; as he doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 22
he will not want Patience for a Yessel of Mercy,
preparing by Humiliation and Faith for Christ
and Glory. Doth he forbear those that stand
out in defiance, and will he fall upon those that
are mourning to him upon the Knee of submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion?
Shall a damnede wretch, that is preparing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:109022:74"/>
for Hell find so much forbearance, and a poor
broken hearted sinner none? It cannot be. If
Jesus Christ forbare thee when thy Heart was as
hard as a Rock and could not yield one Tear,
one Sigh for sin, will he execute his Wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, will he shew thee no Mercy, when thy
Heart is broken all to pieces with sorrow, and
filled with loathing and detestation against sin
and thy self for sin? Did he forbear thee when
sin was thy delight? And will he destroy thee
now it is thy burden? It cannot be.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, if the Lord Jesus had not a mind
to shew Mercy to thy poor Soul: Now, now,
that thine Eyes are opened and thy heart touched
to the quick, why hath he forborn the execution
of his wrath so long? He might have taken his
own time to cut you off when he would, he might
have made any day the execution day: But sure
among all the days of thy life, the day of thy
Humiliation, the day of thy Faith, is not like
to prove that day.</p>
                  <p>Again, as great and vile sinners as thy self
have adventured upon the Grace of Christ, and
sound it infinitly beyond their expectation. These
the Lord Jesus hath set forth as incouraging ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
to all the broken hearted sinners that are
coming after; that they seeing how it hath fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with their forerunners to Christ, might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to come on with the more confidence,
<hi>1 Tim, 1. 16. But I obtained mercy, that in me first
Christ might shew forth all long-suffering for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
for them that should hereafter believe on him to
life everlasting.</hi> Well then, shut your Ears against
all the whispers of Satan, entertain no evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
of Christ; the Devil loves to draw a false
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:109022:74"/>
picture of Christ, and represent him in the most
discouraging form to poor trembling sinners, but
you will not find him so. What can Christ say
more to convince and satisfie Souls than he hath
done? He hath left the bosom of the Father, he
hath taken union with thy Nature, he hath
poured out his Soul unto Death; he hath told us,
<hi>Those that come unto him, he will in no wise cast out.</hi>
Thousands are gone before us in the paths of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and Faith, and found it according to
his Word; you have been spared all your Life,

Servant, that hears me this day, is of greater
value in Christ's Eye than the whole World;
and he hath given three great evidences of it,
(1.) That he thought it worth his Heart Blood
to redeem and save it, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 19. You were not
redeemed with Silver and Gold, but with the precious
Blood of the Son of God.</hi> Had they not been preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in his Eyes he would never have shed his most
precious Blood to ransom them. (2.) Were they
not highly valuable in his Eyes he would never
wait with such unwearied Patience to save them
as he doth. He hath born Thousands of repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and unreasonable denials from you: Sinner,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:109022:76"/>
Christ hath knockt at thy door in many a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
in many a Prayer, in many a sickness, in
all which thou hast put him off, denyed him or
delayed him; yet still he continues knocking and
waiting. Thou couldst not have made the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Beggar in the World wait at thy door, so
long as thy Redeemer hath been made to wait,
and yet he is not gone. At this day his voice
sounds in thine ears, <hi>Behold I stand at the door
and knock.</hi> Here's clear demonstration of the
preciousness of thy Soul in the Redeemer's Eyes.
And then Lastly, When Christ ends the Treaty,
and gives up the Souls of Men for lost, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswadable,
with what regret and sorrow doth
he part with them! Never did one Friend part
from another with such demonstrations of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
as Christ parteth with the Souls of sinners.
The Bowels of his compassion roul together;
for the knows what is coming upon them, and
what that eternal misery is into which their wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
rejection of him will cast them: In <hi>Luke</hi> 19.
22. you find the Redeemers tears wept over ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
<hi>Ierusalend, And when he came nigh to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he wept over it, and said, O</hi> Jerusalem, Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,
<hi>that thou hadst known at least in this thy day
the things that belong to thy peace; but now they are
did from thine Eyes.</hi> Like unto this is that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<hi>Isa. 1. 24. Ah, I will ease me of mine enemies,
&amp;c.</hi> Though it be an ease to his Justice, yet he
cannot give them up without an <hi>ah,</hi> an interjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sorrow; so in <hi>Hosea 11. 8. How shall I give
thee up</hi> Ephraim? <hi>How shall I deliver thee</hi> Judah?
I must do it, but how shall I go about it? All
these expressions shew the great value God hath
for your Souls; and did you know it also, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:109022:76"/>
you would not make Christ wait one hour
longer.</p>

Let me speak freely to you that hear me this
day, Jesus Christ hath spent more of the riches
of his Patience upon you in one year, yea, in this
very day, than he hath spent upon the heathen
World in all the days of their lives; they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of Christ, and the great Salvation;
they have had no calls to Faith and Repentance,
as you have had; dont think God hath dealt at
this rate with other Nations. You have his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths,
Ministers, Calls, he hath not dealt so with
other Nations; and as for these things they have
not known them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19. God hath dealt in a
peculiar way with us, and these special favours
will make dreadful accounts: He told the <hi>Iews</hi>
among whom he had preacht and wrought his
Miracles, <hi>It would be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom
<hi>and</hi> Gomorah, <hi>in the day of Iudgment, than for
them;</hi> and in his Name I will tell you this day,
that Barbarous <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>Americans</hi> will have
a milder Hell than you; <hi>Mitius ardent,</hi> and as
the Lord told <hi>Ezechiel</hi> chap. 3. 5, 6. <hi>Thou art not
sent to a People of a strange Speech, and of an hard
Language, whose words thou canst not understand;
surely had I sent thee to them, they would have hark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
unto thee; but the house of</hi> Israel <hi>will not harken
unto thee, for they will not harken unto me: For all the
house of</hi> Israel <hi>are impudent and hard hearted.</hi>

Ah, Brethren 'tis a sad Truth that the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of Christ have found more fruit of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
among the <hi>Salvage Americans,</hi> than in
<hi>England,</hi> a People born and bred up under the
Gospel. Had heathenish People your Sabbaths,
your Ministers and Bibles, they would not deal
by Christ as you have done: But look you to it,
for certainly the severity of his Justice will at
last recompence the expence of his Patience:
There are two Glasses turned up this day, and
both almost run down; the Glass of the Gospel
running down on Earth, and the Glass of Christ's
Patience running down in Heaven. Be sure of it,
that for every sand of Mercy, every drop of
Love that runs down in vain in this World, a
drop of wrath runs into the vial of wrath which
is fitting in Heaven.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>If Christ have exercised such admirable Patience,
and Long-suffering towards you, before he could gain
entrance into your Hearts; then you have all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the World to exercise your Patience for Christ,
and account all long-suffering to be your unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
duty.</hi> Christ was not weary in waiting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, be not you weary in waiting upon him
or for him. Now there are three things wherein
the People of God will have much occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
their Patience with respect to Christ,
(1.) You will need a great deal of Patience to
wait for the returns and answers of your Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
you knock and wait, at the door of Mercy,
and no answer comes; hereupon discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and weariness seizeth your Spirits. Possibly
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:109022:77"/>
some of you have Prayers many years agone upon
the file in Heaven, some upon Spiritual accounts,
and some upon Temporal; and because the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
is not dispatcht, your Eyes are ready to fail
with waiting, for the Lord may bear long with
his own Elect, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 7. The seed of Prayer
lyes under the clods, and will at last spring up,
<hi>for he never said to the seed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Seek me in
vain;</hi> none seek God in vain but those that seek
him vainly. Now you should not be too quick
and short breathed in waithing upon God, for the
returns of Prayer, considering how long you
made Christ wait upon you.</p>
                  <p>(2.) You will have occasion to exercise your
Patience in bearing the burden of reproaches,
and sufferings for Christ; <hi>For to you it is given in
the behalf of Christ, not only to believe, but also to
suffer for his sake,</hi> Phil. 1. 29. Sufferings you see
are the Gifts of Christ, the Comforts of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
is his Gift, and so are the abilities to suffer-also;
and that which will encrease your suffering-ability,
will be the confideration of Christ's
long-suffering towards you, and the hard things
he endured for you and from you.</p>
                  <p>(3.) You will have occasion to exercise your
Patience for the day of your compleat Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Salvation. If you love Christ fervently,
the time of your separation from him will be
born difficultly; vehement love needs the allay
of Patience, <hi>2 Thes. 3. 5. The Lord direct your
Hearts into the love of God, and into the patient
waiting for Christ.</hi> Others need much Patience to
dye, but such will need as much Patience to live;
but whatever the exercises of your Patience shall
be, whether in waiting for the returns of your
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:109022:78"/>
Prayers, in bearing the cross and sufferings of
Christ, or in waiting for the day of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
Redemption and enjoyment of Christ:
This single consideration, that Christ stood and
waited so long upon you, is enough to fortisie
your Patience against all the difficulties it shall
encounter</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="inference">
                  <head>VII. Inference.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> If Christ thus patiently wait upon trifling
and obstinate sinners, then let no godly person be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
because their unregenerate Relations have not
yet made their first step towards Christ in the way of
Repentance and saving Faith.</p>
                  <p>It may be you have layed up a great stock of
Prayers for them, the believing Husband hath
prayed for his unbelieving Wife, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Wife for her unbelieving Husband; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Parents for their ungodly Children, and the
gracious Child for his ungodly Parents; and yet
no returns of Prayer appear. Many cries are
gone up to Heaven like that of <hi>Abraham, Gen.
17. 18. O that</hi> Ishmael <hi>might live before thee.</hi> Well,
be not discouraged, Christ is contented to wait,
and therefore well may you. Those cries of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
Lord my poor Child is in the state of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
look in mercy upon him, open his Eyes,
break his Heart for sin, draw his Will to Christ;
these cries may not be lost, though the fruit of
them yet appear not; consider how long Christ
waited upon you. There be three things that
encourage hope, (1.) That your Hearts and
theirs were of the same natural complection and
temper; and the same power which opened your
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:109022:78"/>
Hearts can open theirs; thy understanding was
once as dark, thy Heart as hard, and thy Will as
inflexible as thy carnal Relations now are. The
same Hand tha opened thy Heart, can open theirs.
Dont think Christ had an easier task to win thy
Heart, than he will have to win theirs. Almighty
Power wrought upon you, and the same Power
can work effectually upon them; the Lord's
Hand is not shortned. (2ly.) You have reason
to wait, for as much as it is probable you your
selves have put stumbling-blocks into the way of
their Souls to Christ, and hindred the returns
of your own Prayers for the conversion of your
carnal Relatives. Oh Christians, there is more
due to them than your Prayers, Prayers must be
backt with examples; had they not only heard
your cries to God for them, but seen your suitable
encouraging pattern set before them also; you
and yours might have rejoyced together long
ago. But (3ly.) consider that God many times
makes the fruit of such Prayers to spring up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
those that sowed them are dead and gone.
The Lord may give life to your Prayers when you
are dead: Certainly your Prayers dye not with
you. 'Tis the opinion of some that <hi>Paul</hi>'s con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
was the return of <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Prayer, <hi>Lord
lay not this sin to their charge. Stephen</hi> died, but his
Prayers lived, and were answered upon one that
stood by and consented to his death: But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, wait on; if your Prayers come not
into their bosoms, they will certainly return into
your own. Here's duty discharged, love to
Christ and their Souls manifested; which will be
your comfort howsoever God disposes the event.</p>

               <head>II. Vse.</head>
               <p>Secondly, The Doctrine of Christ's Patience
puts a great and serious Exhortation into my
Mouth this day, to press one of the greatest Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
upon you that ever I pressed in the whole
course of my Ministry among you: And could I
deliver this Exhortation to you upon my Knees,
with Tears of Blood mingled with my words,
might that prevail, I would surely do it. My
Exhortation is, to all that are in an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
state, that they presume not to try the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
of Christ any longer. If you have any
regard to your eternal Happiness, exercise not
his Patience beyond this hour. Oh that this hour
might put an end to Christ's waiting, and your
danger! Hitherto you have wearied Men, but
will you weary God also? Christ hath called, but
you have resused; he hath stretched out his
Hands but you have not regarded. Your thoughts
have been wandering after vanity, whilst the
voice of the Gospel hath been sounding in your
Ears; some of you have been sottish and unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to apprehend spiritual Truths; others of
you sensual, given up to the pleasures of the
World, and abandoning all serious thoughts
about the World to come. Some of you have
been buried alive in the cares of the World, and
others setled upon a dead formality in Religion;
and to this day Christ hath called upon you in
vain. Now that which I exhort you to, is that
you venture not to try the Patience of Christ
one day longer; if you have any regard to the
everlasting happiness of your Souls, come not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:109022:79"/>
under the guilt and danger of one denial or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
more; if you ask me why? Why may we
not venture a little longer? Christ hath born
all this while, and will he not bear a little long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
May we not take a little more pleasure in
sin? May we not hazard one Sermon, or Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
more, and yet not perish? I answer, No.
If your Souls be precious in your Eyes let there
be no more denials nor delays to Christ's suit.
For (1.) how patient and long-suffering soever
Christ hath been, yet there will be an end of
the day of his Patience; a time when he will
wait no longer, when his Spirit shall strive no
more with you. There is a knock of Christ at
the Heart, which will be the last knock that
ever he will give; and after that no more knocks.
A time when the Master of the house will rise up
and the door be shut. You have had to do with a
meek and patient Christ hitherto; but believe it
sinners, there is a day called, <hi>the day of the wrath
of the Lamb,</hi> and that day is dreadful, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. 16.
where you find sinners, crying <hi>to the Rocks and
Mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the
wrath of the Lamb.</hi> O if his wrath be once kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
though but a little, <hi>blessed are they that trust in
him,</hi> that have finished their agreement with him.
The day of Christ's Patience towards <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
was a long day, but it had an end, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37.
and it ended in their desolation; therefore try the
Patience of Christ no further; you know not the
limits of it, it may end with your next refusal,
and then where are you? (2ly.) The longer
Christ hath exercised his Patience already towards
you, the more terribly will he avenge the abuse
of it in Hell upon you. 'Tis past doubt with me
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:109022:80"/>
that there are different degrees of Torment in
Hell; the Scriptures are plainly and clearly for
it. Now among all the aggravations of the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Hell, none can be greater than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of damned Souls upon the abused Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Grace of Christ. Those that had the
best means, the loudest calls, and the longest day
under the Gospel, will certainly have the hottest
place in Hell, if the goodness and long-suffering
of Christ do not now lead them to Repentance;
the cries of such Souls will be heard above the
cries of all the other miserable wretches that are
cast away. <hi>'Twill be more tolerable for</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi>
Gomorrah, <hi>than for</hi> Capernaum, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 23.</p>
               <p>Oh, Friends, you little know the smart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
of Conscience in Hell, upon such hours
as you now enjoy; such wooing, charming voices
and allurements, to Christ as you now hear. There
are many thousands of Souls in Hell, that came
thither out of the dark heathenish parts of the
World, where they never heard of Christ; but
your misery will be far beyond theirs; your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
more sharp and bitter: Therefore delay
no longer, lest you perish with peculiar aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of misery. (3ly.) Try the Patience of
Christ no further, I beseech you, for as much as
you see every day the Patience of Christ ending
towards others. Patience coming down, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
ascending the Stage, to triumph over the
abusers of Mercy. You dont only read in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the finishing and ending of God's Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
with Men, but you may see it every day with
your own Eyes. If you look into Scripture, You
may find the Patience of God ended towards mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of Sinners, who possibly had the same
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:109022:80"/>
presumptions, and vain hopes for the continuance
of it that you now have: If you look into
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 19, 20. you shall there find that <hi>Christ
went and preached to the Spirits in prison, which some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
were disobedient; when once the long-suffering
of God waited in the days of</hi> Noah. The meaning
of it is this, that in the days before the Flood,
Christ by his Spirit strove with disobedient and
rebellious sinners, in the Ministry of <hi>Noah,</hi> who
then were living Men and Women, as now we
are, but now are Spirits in prison, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) damned
Souls in Hell, for their disobedience: And truly,
Brethren, you may frequently behold the glass
of Patience run down, the very last sand in it
spent upon others. Whenever you see a wicked
Christless Man or Woman dye, you see the end
of God's Patience with that Man or Woman,
and all this for a warning to you, that you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
not to trifle and dally with it as they
did. (4ly.) Lastly, Do not try God's Patience
any longer (if you love your Souls) for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
because when Men grow bold, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
themselves in sin, upon the account of
God's forbearance and long-suffering towards
them; there cannot be a more certain sign that
his Patience is very near its end towards that Soul.
'Tis time for God to put an end to his Patience
when it is made an encouragement to sin. God
cannot suffer so vile an abuse of his glorious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
nor endure to see it turned into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
This quickly brings up sin to its finishing
act and perfection, and then Patience is just upon
finishing also. That Patience is thus abused, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Eccles.</hi> 8. 11. and when it is so abused
look for a suddain change. O, therefore, beware
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:109022:81"/>
of provoking God, for now the day of Patience
is certainly near its end with such sinners, <hi>Prov.
1. 24, 25, 26. Because I have called<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and ye refused, I
have stre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ched out my Hand and no Man regarded:
But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would
none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and mock when your fear cometh. When your
fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh
as a whirlwind.</hi> Ah, when sinners scolt and mock
at the threatnings of God, and bear themselves
up, upon his Patience, as that which will never
crack under them; then look out for a whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,
a suddain Tempest of wrath which shall
hurry such Souls into Hell. Then misery comes
like a storm blowing furiously from all quarters.
Well, the Heavens are yet clear over you, but
a storm is nigh, and may be certainly presaged
from such vite abuses of the glorious Patience of
Christ towards you. That's the first Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
try not the Patience of Christ by any further
delays</p>
               <div n="2" type="exhortation">

                  <p>Secondly, Admire Christ's Patience and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of you until now, that he hath not cut
you off in your sin, but lengthned out his Patience
unto this day, and brought about your Salvation
by his long-suffering towards you. Here now I
must change my voice and turn it unto those
whose Hearts the Lord hath opened: Stand
amazed at the riches of his Grace towards you
and see that you account this long-suffering of
God to be your Salvation; for in plain Truth it
is so: your Salvation was bound up in Christ's
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:109022:81"/>
forbearance; if Christ had not born as he did,
you had not been where you are. I could hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish that all the time you can redeem from
the necessary employments you have in the
World, may now be spent in an humble, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
admiration of this admirable Grace and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ, and answerable duties to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
and ends thereof. To this end I shall
subjoyn divers weighty Considerations, which,
methinks, should melt every Heart wherein the
lest drachm of saving Grace is found.</p>
                  <p>Bethink your selves of the great and manifold
provocations you have given the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <note place="margin">1. Consid.</note> Lord to put an
end to all further Patience towards you; not only
in the days of your vanity and unregeneracy, but
enen since your reconciliation to him. Do you
not believe thousands of sinners are now in the
depths of Hell, who never provoked the Lord at
an higher rate than you have done? Were you
not herded once among the vilest of sinners,
<hi>1 Cor. 6. 11. And such were some of you;</hi> as vile as
the vilest among them; yet you are washed in the
Blood of Christ, and your companions roaring
in the lowest Hell; or if your lives were more
clean, sure your Hearts and Natures were as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
as theirs. And certainly your sins since the
time of Reconciliation have had special aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in them, enough to put an end to all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mercies towards you. Light and Love have
aggravated these sins, and yet the Lord will not
cast you off.</p>
                  <p>How often have you been upon the very brink
of Hell,<note place="margin">2. Consid.</note> in the days of your unregeneracy? Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sickness, and every danger of life which you escaped in those days, was a marvelous escape
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:109022:82"/>
from the everlasting wrath of God. Had thy
Disease prevailed one degree further, thou hadst
been past hope; and out of the reach of Mercies
Arm now. Doubtless some of you can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
when in such and such a Disease you were like
a Ship riding in a furious storm by one Cable,
and two or three of the strands of that Cable
were snapt asunder. So it hath been with you,
the thread of life how weak soever, hath held
till the bonds of union betwixt Christ and your
Souls are fastned, and the eternal hazard over.
This is admirable Grace.</p>
                  <p>How often hath Death come up into your
Windows, entred into your Houses,<note place="margin">3. Consid.</note> fetcht off
your nearest Relations; but had no commission
to carry you out with them; because the Lord
had a design of Mercy upon your Souls.</p>
                  <p>This cannot but affect a gracious Heart, that
God should smite so near, and yet spare you.</p>
                  <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">4. Consid.</note> This is affecting, yea very transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that God hath not only given you time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
others, but in that time the precious op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
and means of your Salvation, both
external and internal; there's the very marrow
and kernel of the Mercy; had God lengthned
out his Patience for a while, but given you no
means of Salvation; or afforded you the means,
but denied you the blessing and efficacy of them;
at the most it could have been but a reprieve
from Hell: but for the Lord to give you the
Gospel, and with the Gospel to send down his
Spirit, to perswade and open thy Heart to Christ;
here is the riches of his goodness as well as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance.</p>

                  <head>III. Exhortation.</head>
                  <p>This Doctrine of the Patience of Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts
all that have felt it, to exercise a Christ-like
Patience towards others; as you have found
the benefit of Divine Patience your selves, see
that you exercise the meekness and long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christians towards those that have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and injured you. Who should shew Patience
more than those that have found it? Dont be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere,
short and quick with others who have lived
your selves so many years upon the long-suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of God. We are poor short-spirited Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
quick to revenge injuries, but oh, had God
been so to us, miserable had our condition been.
Christ hath made this duty the very scope of that
excellent parable, <hi>Matth. 18.</hi> from the <hi>25 verse</hi>
onward, where the King takes an account of his
Servants, reckoning with them one by one, and
amongst them finds one which owed him Ten
thousand Talents, and having not to pay, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
him his Wife and Children, and all he had
to be sold, and payment to be made; but the
Servant falling down, and begging Patience, his
Lord was moved with compassion, and loosed
him, and not only forbore but forgave the debt;
one would think the Heart of this Man should
have been a fountain of compassion towards
others; but see the deep corruption of Nature,
the same Servant finding one of his fellow-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
which owed him but an Hundred pence,
laid Hands on him and took him by the Throat.
Alas, the wrongs done to us are but trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>les, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with our injuries done to God; where
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:109022:83"/>
others have wronged you once, you have wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
God a thousand times. Methinks the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Christ towards you should melt your
Hearts into an ingenuous easiness to forgive
others; especially considering that an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
Spirit is a dreadful sign of an unforgiven
person.</p>

                  <p>Burden not the Patience of Christ after your
admission of him, and reconciliation to him;
let it suffice that you tried his Patience long
enough before, give him no new exercises now
he is come to dwell in and with you for ever.
There be two ways wherein God's own People
do greatly provoke him after their Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<list>
                        <item>1. By slugishness to Duty.</item>
                        <item>2. By sinning against Light.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. By slugishness and deadness of Spirit in the
ways of Duty and Obedience; turning a deaf ear
to the calls and motions of Christ's Spirit exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them to the sweet and pleasant Duties of
Religion. We have a sad instance of this in the
Spouse, <hi>Cant. 5. 2, 3. It is the voice of my beloved
that knocketh, saying, Open to me my Sister, my Love,
my Dove, my Vndefiled; for my Head is filled with
dew, and my Locks with the drops of the night.</hi> One
would think that Christ might have opened the
Heart of his own Spouse with less solicitation,
and importunate Arguments than he here useth;
what Wife could shut the door upon her own
dear Husband, and bar him out of his own
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:109022:83"/>
house? And yet see the lazy excuse she makes,
<hi>vers. 3. I have put off my coat, how shall I put it
on? I have washed my Feet, how shall I defile
them?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh, the slugishness of Flesh, even in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
persons! Those that have opened the door
to Christ by Regeneration, even they do often
shut the door against Christ in the hours and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
of Communion with him. Strange, that
such a suiter as Christ should be put by, moving
and calling to such heavenly pleasant exercises
as Communion with him is; but flesh will be flesh
even in the most Spiritual Christians; little do
we know what a grief this is to Christ, and loss
to us.</p>
                  <p>2ly. Many grieve Christ's Spirit, and sorely
try his Patience, even after Reconciliation, by
sinning against Light and Love; that caution,
<hi>Ephes. 4. 30.</hi> is not without weighty cause, <hi>and
grieve not the holy Spirit of God, by which you are
sealed to the day of Redemption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Do we thus requite the Lord? is this the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
we will make him for all his admirable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and unparallel'd Love towards us? Certainly,
Christ can put up a thousand injuries from his
Enemies, easier than such affronts from his own
People; did you not promise him better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Did you not engage to more holiness and
watchfulness, in the day that you sued out your
pardon, and made up your peace with him? Are
all those Vows and Covenants forgotten? If you
have forgotten them God hath not.</p>

                  <p>Improve the time that remains in this World
with double diligence, because you made Christ
wait so long, and cast a way so great a part of
your life, before you opened your Hearts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receive
him. The morning of your life which was
certainly the freshest and freest part of it, was
no better than time lost with many of us; all
the days of your unregeneracy Christ was shut
out, and vanity shut into your Hearts: You ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
began to live till Christ gave you life, and
that was late in the day with many of you. How
should this provoke to extraordinary diligence
in those few remains of time we have yet to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy?
It was <hi>Austin</hi>'s lamentation, <hi>O Lord, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
me,</hi> saith he, <hi>that I loved thee so late.</hi> This
consideration excited <hi>Paul</hi> to extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
for Christ. It made him fly up and down
the World, as a <hi>Seraphim,</hi> in a flame of holy
zeal for Christ. Those that have much to write,
and are almost come to the end of their paper,
had need write close. Friends, you have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do for God upon Earth, which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do for him in Heaven, <hi>Isa. 38. 18, 19.</hi> You
that have carnal Relations have something to do
for them here, which you cannot do in Heaven.
You can now Counsel, Exhort, and Pray, in
order to their Conversion and Salvation; but
when you are gone down to the Grave, these op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
of service are cut off.</p>

baseness of our Hearts and Natures, which made
Christ wait at the door so long, before we open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him. O what wretched Hearts have we!
That were no more affected with the groans of
Christ's Heart, than with the groans of a Beast,
no nor so much neither, if that Beast were our
own. Oh, the vileness of Nature to make the
Prince of the King's of the Earth bringing Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
and Salvation with him, to stand so long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answered;
let who will cry up the goodness of
Nature, I am sure we have reason to look upon
the vileness of it with amazement and horror.
You could not have found in your Hearts to have
made the poorest beggar wait so long at your
door, as you have made Christ to wait upon
you.</p>

the Lord Jesus for the continuation of his
Patience, not to our selves only, but to that
whole sinful Nation in which we live. We thought
the Treaty of Peace had been ended with us;
many good Men looking upon the iniquities and
abominations of these times, considering the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and backsliding of Professors, the Heaven-daring
provocations of this Atheistical age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
in their own Hearts, that God would
make <hi>England</hi> another <hi>Shiloh.</hi> Many faithful
Ministers of Christ said within themselves
God hath no more Work for us to do,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:109022:85"/>
and we shall have no more opportunities to
work for God. When lo, beyond the thoughts
of all Hearts, the merciful and long-suffering
Redeemer makes one return more to these Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
renews the Treaty, and with compassions
rolled together, speaks to us this day, as to
<hi>Ephraim</hi> of old, How shall I deliver thee? Look
upon this day, this unexpected day of Mercy, as
the fruit and acquisition of the intercession of
your great Advocate in Heaven, answerable to
that <hi>Luke 13. 7, 8, 9.</hi> Well God hath put us upon

Once more, Christ knocks at our doors, the
voice of the Bridegroom is heard; those sweet
voices, <hi>Come unto me, Open to me;</hi> your opening
to Christ now, will be unto you as the Valley of

should be turned into wantonness and formality?
what if your obstinacy and infidelity should wear
out the remains of that little strength and time
left you, and that former Labours and Sorrows
have left your Ministers? Then <hi>actum est de nobis,</hi>
we are gone for ever; then farewel Gospel, Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
Reformation, and all, because we knew
not the time of our Visitation. What was the
dismal doom of God upon the fruitless Vineyard?
<hi>Isa. 5. 5. I will take away the hedge thereof and it
shall be eaten up; and break down the wall thereof,
and it shall be troden down; I will also command the
Clouds that they rain not upon it.</hi> The hedge, and
the wall are the Spiritual and Providential pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God; these are the defence and safety of
his People; the Clouds, and the Rain are the
sweet influences of Gospel Ordinances. If the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:109022:85"/>
hedge be broken down, God's pleasant Plants
will soon be eaten up; and if the Clouds rain not
upon them, their Root will be rottenness, and
their Blossom will go up as dust. Our Churches
will soon become as the Mountains of <hi>Gilboa;</hi>
therefore see that you know and improve the

                  <p>The Faith and Obedience of your Hearts
makes it evident, that the Lords waiting upon
you hitherto, hath been in pursuance of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Electing Love. What was the reason God
would not take you away by death, though you
passed so often upon the very brink of it, in the
days of your unregeneracy? And what think
you was the very reason of the revocation of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:109022:86"/>
your Gospel-liberties when they were quite out
of sight, and almost out of hope; why surely
this was the reason, that you, and such as you
are, might be brought to Christ at last. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
though the Lord let you run on so long in
sin, yet still he continued your Life, and the
means of your Salvation, because he had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign

                  <p>You now also see the Sovereignty and freeness

resisted all along the most powerful means, and
importunate calls of Christ; and would have
resisted still, had not Free and Sovereign Grace
over-poured them when the time of Love was
come. Ah, it was not the tractableness of thine
own Will, the easie temper of thy Heart to be
wrought upon, the Lord let thee stand long
enough in the state of Nature to discover that;
there was nothing in Nature but obstinacy and
enmity. Thou didst hear as many powerful
Sermons, melting Prayers; and didst see as many
awakning Providences before thy Heart was
opened to Christ, as thou hast since; yet thy
Heart never opened till now; and why did it
open now? Because now the Spirit of God joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself to the Word; victorious Grace went
forth in the Word to break the hardness and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
the rebellions of thy Heart. The Gospel
was now preached (as the Apostle speaks) <hi>1 Pet.

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:109022:86"/>
which things</hi> (saith he) <hi>the Angels desire to look
into.</hi> Ah, Friends, it is a glorious sight worthy of
Angelical observation and admiration to behold
the effects of the Gospel preacht, with the Holy
Ghost sent down from Heaven, to see when the
Spirit comes along with the Word, the blind Eyes
of sinners opened, and they brought into a new
World of ravishing objects; to behold Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Tears flowing for sin, out of Hearts late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as hard as the Rocks; to see all the Bars of
Ignorance, Prejudice, Custom, and Unbelief, fly
open at the voice of the Gospel; to see Rebels
against Christ laying down their Arms at his Feet,
come upon the Knee of submission, crying, <hi>Lord
I will rebel no more;</hi> to see the proud Heart cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
and wrapt up in its own righteousness, now
striping it self naked, loading it self with all
shame and reproach; and made willing that its
own shame should go to the Redeemer's glory.
These, I say, are sights which Angels desire to
look into.</p>
                  <p>Certainly your Hearts were more tender, and
your Wills more apt to yield and bend in the
days of your youth, than they were now when sin
had so hardned them, and long continued custom
riveted and fixed them; yet then they did not,
and now they do yield to the calls and invitations
of the Gospel. Ascribe all to Sovereign Grace,

Jealousies within your Hearts; the weakness of

The subtilty of Satan, who imploys all his poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

how far the spirituality of active obedience,

Communion with him. These, and such like
things as these, cause many a qualm to come over

Here I shall open to you the following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
<list>
                     <item>1. What are the doors of the Soul at which
Christ knocks?</item>
                     <item>2. What his knocking at these doors implies.</item>
                     <item>3. By what instruments he knocks at them.</item>
                     <item>4. In what manner he performs this action.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, What are the <hi>doors</hi> of the Soul at which
Christ knocks? You all know that the term
Christ here useth cannot be proper, but meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical;
'tis a Figurative speech, the <hi>door</hi> is that
part which is introductive into the House, and
whatsoever is introductive into the Soul, that is
the door of the Soul. Now in the Soul of Man
there are many powers and faculties that have
this use, and are of an introductive nature to let
things into the Soul of Man. Some are more out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as we may speak comparatively, and some
more inward, as the doors of our houses are.</p>
               <p>Christ knocks orderly at them all, one after
another, for the operations of the Spirit disturb
not the order of Nature.</p>
               <p>1. The first door that opens and lets into the
Soul is the <hi>Vnderstanding;</hi> nothing passes into the
Soul, but it must first come through this door of
the Understanding; nothing can touch the Heart
or move the affections, but what hath first toucht
the Understanding. Hence we read so often in
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109022:88"/>
Scripture of the opening of the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
that being as it were the fore-door of the
Soul.</p>
               <p>2ly. Within this is the Royal-gate of the Soul,
<hi>viz. The will of Man,</hi> that noble and imperial
Power; many things may pass into the Mind or
Understanding of a Man, and yet be able to get
no further, the door of the Will may be shut
against them. There were many precious Truths
of God let into the Understandings of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
by the light of Nature, but could never
get further, their Hearts and Wills were lockt
and shut up against them; as you may see, <hi>Rom.
1. 18. They held the Truths of God in Vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
that is, they bound and imprisoned those
common notices the Law of Nature imprest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Minds concerning the Being and Nature
of God, and the duties of both Tables. These
Truths could get no further into their Souls, and
which is of sad and dreadful consideration,
Christ himself stands betwixt these two doors in
the Souls of many persons; he is got into their
Understandings and Consciences, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of the possibility and necessity of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Jesus Christ, but still the door of their Will
is barr'd against him, which drew from him that
sad complaint, <hi>Iohn 5. 40. You will not come unto
me that you might have life.</hi> When this door of
the Will is once effectually opened, then all the
inner doors of the affections are quickly set open
to receive and welcom him. Desires, joy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and all the rest stand open to him. These
are the doors at which the Redeemer knocks.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next we must consider what is ment
by Christ's knocking at these doors, and what
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:109022:89"/>
that action implies. In the general, knocking is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else but an action significative, of the desires
of one that is without to come in; 'tis a sign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
to that end: And what is Christs knocking
but a signification to the Soul of his earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to come into it; a notice given to the Soul of
Christ's willingness to possess it for his own habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?
And it is as much as if Christ should say,
Soul, thou art the House that was built by my
Hand, purchased and redeemed by my Blood; I
have an unquestionable right to it, and now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
entrance. More particularly, there are
divers great things implied in this gracious
act of Christ's knocking at the door of the
Soul.</p>
               <p>1. It implies the special favour and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grace and goodness of Jesus Christ, that he
will stand and knock at our doors, when he
passes by so great a part of the World, never gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one such knock or call at other Mens doors; it
is certainly a most glorious and admirable conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scension
and favour of Heaven, and whereever
it is successful, it speaks a Man highly favoured of
God. Oh that when Christ passes by the Souls of
Thousands, and Millions, that would certainly
afford him as comfortable an habitation as our
Souls can do, and will not give one effectual
knock, or call at their doors all the days of
their life; that he will please to turn aside to thy
Soul, and wait, and knock there for entrance;
I say, here is one of the greatest acts of favour
that can be shewn to the Soul of a sinner. How
many Souls be there in the World equal in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Dignity to yours, and of sweeter natural
Tempers, whom yet the Lord Jesus lets alone in
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109022:89"/>
the quiet possession of Satan, <hi>Luke 11. 21.</hi> There
is a deep silence and stilness in their Consciences,
no stirrings nor disturbances by Convictions, but
through a dreadful Judgment of God are left in
a deep sleep; and if their Consciences at any
time begin to grumble, how soon are they husht
and quieted again by Satan? What the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the World was in former Ages, we may
see in <hi>Acts 14. 16. Who in times past suffered all
Nations to walk in their own ways.</hi> O 'tis the
greatest Mercy in the World for the sleepy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a sinner to be roused by Convictions,
because it is introductive to all other Spiritual
Mercies. I confess this act of Grace is little
apprehended by the Sons and Daughters of Men;
much rather would poor sinners be let alone than
be thus disturbed by troublesom convictions; and
when Christ disturbs their rest, how do they
startle at the knocks of his Word and Spirit?
How angry be they that they cannot be let alone
to enjoy their quiet sleep in sin till the flames of
Hell awaken them? Mr. <hi>Fenner,</hi> that great and
eminent Instrument of God in this Work, tells
us, in one of his Sermons, how it fared with a
certain Man that came to hear him Preach: It
seems the Word had got entrance into his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and gave it a terrible Allarum, and as he
was going home, some that followed him, heard
him thus blaming and bemoaning himself, <hi>O
what a fool, what a beast was I to come under this
Sermon to day? I shall never have peace and quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
any more.</hi> And what is the reason that
smooth and general Preaching is so much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
and affected in the World; And close
convincing Doctrin so much shunned and hated;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109022:90"/>
but this, that sinners are very loath to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
and have their Consciences throughly
awakned. Well, whatever your apprehensions
be, certainly it is an unspeakable Mercy for
Christ to knock and disquiet the Souls of sinners
by his calls. That's the first thing.</p>
               <p>2ly. The next thing implied in this action of
Christ is this, That the first motions towards
the recovery and Salvation of sinners begin not
in themselves, but in Christ. We never knock
at Heavens door by Prayer till Christ hath first
knockt at our doors by his Spirit: Did not
Christ move first, there would be no motions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him in our Hearts; we move towards him,
because he hath first moved upon our Souls.
Christ might sit long enough unsought and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired,
did he not make the first motion. All our
motions are secondary and consequential moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Isa. 65. 1. I am found of them that sought me
not.</hi> As we love him because he first loved us, so
we seek after him, because he first sought us.
Alas, poor sinners are as well satisfied as any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the World can be, to lye fast asleep in the
Devil's Arms. When the Spirit of God goes
forth with the Word of Conviction, he finds the
Souls of Men in the very same posture which the
Angels, that had surveyed the World, reported
the whole Earth to be in, <hi>Zach. 1. 11. Behold all
the Earth sitteth still, and is at rest.</hi> Every Man
setled and satisfied in his own way; what a
strange stilness, and midnight silence is there
amongst sinners? Not a sigh, not a cry to be
heard for sin: So the <hi>Psalmist, Psal. 14. 2.</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents
the case of sinners, <hi>The Lord looked down
from Heaven upon the Children of Men, to see if
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:109022:90"/>
there were any that did understand and seek God.
They are all gone aside,</hi> &amp;c. There is one thing
that is admirably strange in this case, that even
those Men and Women whose Rattles of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pleasures and delights, which brought them
into this sleep and security, are taken away from
them by the Hand of Providence, I mean their
Estates, Health, Children, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet they awake
not; there are no stirrings after God. O what
a dead sleep hath sin cast the Souls of sinners in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to!
You have a notable Scripture to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in <hi>Iob 35. 9. 10.</hi> they are the words of <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu,</hi>
concerning Men and Women under grievous
oppression; persons squeezed and ground by the
cruel Hands of wicked Men, <hi>by reason of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry;
they cry out by reason of the Arm of the Mighty, but
none saith, where is God my Maker who giveth songs
in the night?</hi> i. e. Succour, Comfort and Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the afflicted.</p>
               <p>Here are Men turned out of their Estates,
thrown into Prisons, cast upon all extremities
and miseries, and what do these poor creatures
do? Why (saith he) they cry by reason of their
oppression. O my Father, or my Mother, my
Wife, my Child, my Estate, my Liberty, but
none saith where is my God? O my sin, or my
misery by reason of sin; <hi>where is he that giveth
Songs in the night?</hi> The People of God when they
lye musing upon their beds under affliction, they
have their <hi>Songs in the Night,</hi> in the midst of the
multitude of their troubled thoughts within
them, the Comforts of God delight their Souls.
Those are their Songs in the Night, but no such
word or thought in carnal Men; how plain is it,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:109022:91"/>
that all the first motions of Salvation have their
first spring and rise in God, and not in us. That's
the Second thing implied in Christ's knocking.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ knocking at the door of the
Heart, implies the method of the Spirit in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version;
to be congruous and agreeable to the
nature of Man's Soul; mark Christ's expression
in the Text, he doth not say, <hi>Behold I come to the
door</hi> and break it open by violence; no, Christ
makes no forcible Entries whether sinners will
or no; he will come in by consent of the Will
or not at all. I stand and knock, if any Man
open the door, I will come in to him. There is a
great difference between a friendly admission by
consent, and a forcible entrance; in a forcible
entrance bars of Iron are brought to break open
the door; but in a friendly admission one knocks
and the other opens: Forcible actions are unsuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the nature of the Will, whose motions are
free and spontaneous; therefore it is said, <hi>Psal.
110. 3. The people shall be willing in the day of thy
power.</hi> 'Tis true, the Power of God is upon the
Will of Man in the day of his Conversion, or
else it would never open to Christ; but yet that
Power of God doth not act against the freedom
of Man's Will, by co-action and force; no, but
of unwilling he makes it willing; taking away
the obstinacy and reluctancy of the Will by the
efficacy of his Grace, which some Divines call
<hi>victrix delectatio,</hi> a sweet and pleasant victory;
and so the door of the Will still opens freely,
<hi>Hosea 11. 4. I drew them with the cords of a Man,
with the bands of Love. I drew them,</hi> there's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Power; but how did this Power draw
them? With the cords of a Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:109022:91"/>
arguments, convincing the Judgment.
Beasts are driven and forced, but Men are drawn
by reason, and will not move without it if they
act like themselves; it must be confessed, that
when the day of God's Power is come, for the
bringing home of a poor sinner to Christ, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
resist the Power of God's Spirit that draws
him effectually; <hi>Every one that hath heard and
learned of the Father, cometh unto me;</hi> yet still the
Soul comes freely by the consent of his Will;
for this is the method of Christ in drawing Souls
to him. There is in the day of a sinners Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
a <hi>kid,</hi> an <hi>offer</hi> made for the Will both by
Satan and Christ. Satan bids Riches, Honours,
and Pleasures, with ease and quietness to the flesh
in the enjoyment of them; abide where thou
art saith Satan, remain with me and thou shalt
escape all the Persecutions, losses and troubles of
the World, which Conscience entangles other
Men in; thou shalt draw thy life through peace
and pleasure to thy dying day. O saith the flesh
this is a good motion, what can be better for
me? But then saith Christ, dost thou not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that all these enjoyments will quickly be at
an end, and what shall become of thee then? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I offer thee the free, full, and final pardon
of thy sins; Peace and reconciliation with God,
treasures in Heaven, all these shall be thine, with
Troubles, Reproaches and Persecutions in this
World. The Understanding and Conscience of
a sinner being convinced of the vanity of earthly
things, and the indispensable necessity of pardon
and peace with God: I say, when a convinced
Judgment hath duly ballanced these things, and
laid them before the Will, and the Spirit of God
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:109022:92"/>
put forth his Power in the renovation of it; it
moves towards Christ freely, and yet cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to its natural order act otherwise than it
doth. And doubtless this is the true meaning of
that expression, so often mistaken and abused, in
<hi>Luke 14. 23. Compel them to come in.</hi> What! by
forcing Men against the light of their Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?
No, no, to the shame of many Protestants
let us hear the Gloss of <hi>Stella</hi> a Popish Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
upon the place. <hi>Christ</hi> (saith he) <hi>compels
Men to come in by shewing to their Will such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celling
good, as it cannot but embrace;</hi> for <hi>volunt as
natur aliter fertur in bonum.</hi> The Will is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
carried to the choice of the best good. And
thus the Spirit works upon the Soul harmonious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and agreeably to its own Nature. That's the
Third thing implied in Christ's knocking.</p>
               <p>Fouthly, Christ's knocking at the door of the
Soul, manifestly implies the immediate access of
the Spirit of God unto the Soul of Man; that
he can come to the very innermost door of the
Soul at his pleasure, and make what impressions
upon it he pleaseth. As for other instruments
used in this Work, they have no such privilege
or Power; Ministers can but knock at the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
door of the senses. Thine Eyes shall see thy
Teachers, we can see their persons and hear their
voices; we can reason with sinners and plead with
their Souls; but awaken them we cannot, open
their Hearts we cannot. We can only lodge our
message in their Ears, and leave it to the Spirit
of God to make it effectual. This is a Royalty
belonging unto the Spirit of God, incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to Angels or Men. If an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
were the Preacher, he could not give one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:109022:92"/>
stroak to the Conscience, much less can
Man; we have no dominion over your Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
The keys of the doors of your Souls hang
not at our girdles, but are in the Hands of Christ,
<hi>Revel. 3. 7. He hath the key of</hi> David, <hi>he openeth and
no Man shutteth; and he shutteth and no Man open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</hi>
The Consciences and all the faculties lye
naked and open to the stroak of God's Spirit; he
can wound them and heal them, and make what
impressions he pleaseth upon them. Learn hence
what need there is both for Ministers and People
before they enter upon the solemn Ordinances of
God, to lift up their Hearts by Prayer for the
blessing and Power of the Spirit upon them. Lord
send forth thy Spirit, pour it forth upon, and
with thy Word. Ah, how many Sermons have we
Preach'd and you heard, and yet there is no open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
These are the four things implied in Christ's
knocking at the door, <hi>viz.</hi> Condescending Grace;
All first motions begin in God; The motions of
his Spirit are congruous and agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Soul; And that his Spirit can have
immedate access to the innermost faculties and
Powers of the Soul at his pleasure. Now in the
next place let us consider,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By what Instruments Christ knocks
at the Doors, that is, the Judgment, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Will of a sinner. And these are two,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>By
<list>
                        <item>1. His Word.</item>
                        <item>2. His Providence.</item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Here my Work will be to shew you how the
Spirit of God makes use both of the Word and
Works of God, to rouse and open the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:109022:93"/>
and Hearts of Sinners. These are the two
Hammers or instruments of the Spirit by which
he knocks at the door of the Heart.</p>
               <p>1. The Word, written or preached, but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
preached; to this Christ gives the prefe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to all other instruments imployed about
this Work; and answerably the Word is called
God's Hammer, <hi>Ier. 23. 29. Is not my Word like
fire, and as the Hammer which breaketh the rocks in
pieces?</hi> By this Hammer Christ raps at the door of
a sinners Soul, to give warning that he is there.
The Spirit of God can open the Heart immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
if he pleaseth; but he will honour his
Word in this Work. And therefore, when <hi>Lydias</hi>
Heart was to be opened, <hi>Paul,</hi> the great Gospel
Preacher, must be invited even by an Angel to
come over to <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and assist in that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Work, <hi>Acts 16. 9. Lydia</hi> was to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
her Heart must be opened to Christ; the Angel
could not do it, but calls for the help of the
<hi>Apostle,</hi> Gods appointed Instrument to carry on
that Work. <hi>I have made thee</hi> (saith God to
<hi>Paul) a Minister and a witness to open their Eyes,
and turn them from darkness to light, and from the
power of Satan to God,</hi> Acts 26. 18. Now, there
be three ways in which the Spirit uses the Word
as his Hammer in knocking at the door of the
Soul.</p>
               <p>1. He knocks by the particular convictions of
of the Word upon the Conscience; this knock
by conviction rings and sounds through all the
rooms and chambers of the Soul; particular and
effectual conviction wounds to the very centre
of the Soul. Ah, when the Word shall come
whom by the Spirits particular application, like
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:109022:93"/>
that of <hi>Nathans</hi> to <hi>David, Thou art the Man;</hi>
then all the powers of the Soul are rouzed and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed;
now it pierces as a two-edged Sword,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12. divides the Soul and Spirit, the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
and inferiour Faculties of it: Cuts down by
the back-bone, lays open the secret guilt, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nermost
thoughts of a Man's Heart, before which
the sinner cannot stand. The secrets of his Heart
are made manifest and falling down on his Face,
he must acknowledg that God is in the Word, of
a Truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24. O these convictions of
the Word, are such a rap, such a knock at the
door of the Conscience as will never be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;
no not in Heaven, to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>2ly. Christ knocks in the Word by its terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
comminations and awful threatnings, mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
the Soul that opens not, with eternal ruine;
these are dreadful knocks; O sinner, saith Christ,
wilt thou not open? Shall all the tenders of my
Grace made to thee be in vain? Know then that
this thy obstinacy shall be thy damnation. Thus
the Word denounces ruine in the name of the
great and terrible God to all wilful impenitents
and obstinate unbelievers, <hi>Iohn 3. 36. He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath ef
God abideth on him.</hi> O dreadful sound, like unto
which is that, <hi>Iohn 8. 24. If ye believe not that I
am he, ye shall dye in your sins. q. d.</hi> Thy <hi>Mittimu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
for Hell shall be made and signed; will you not
come to me that you might have life? then I will
foretel what death you shall dye, you shall even
<hi>dye in your sins.</hi> Oh, it were better for thee to
dye like a Dog in a ditch, than to dye in thy
sins. These are loud knocks of the Word, ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
sounds, yet no more than needs to startle
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:109022:94"/>
the drousie Consciences of sinners. And then,</p>
               <p>3ly. The Spirit knocks by the gracious invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of the Word, the sweet allurements and
gracious insinuations of it; and without this no
Heart would ever open to Christ. It is not frost
and snow, storms and thunder, but the gentle
distilling dews, and cherishing Sun-beams, that
make the flowers open in the Spring. The ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of the Law may be preparative, but the
grace of the Gospel is that which effectually
opens the sinners Heart. The obdurate flint will
sooner fly when smitten upon the soft pillow, than
upon the anvil. Now the Gospel abounds with
alluring invitations to draw the Will and open
the Heart of a sinner; such is that, <hi>Matth. 11. 28.
Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and I will give you rest.</hi> O what a charming
voice is here! He that considers it may well
wonder what Heart in the World can resist it;
like unto this is that in <hi>Isa. 55. 1. Ho, every one
that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that
hath no money let him come; yea, let him come and
buy Wine and Milk without money and without price.
q. d.</hi> Come sinner, come; though thou have no
qualifications, no worthiness, nor righteousness
of thy own; though thou be but a heap of sin
and vileness, yet come; my grace is a <hi>gift,</hi> not a
<hi>sale;</hi> and such is that in <hi>Iohn 7. 37. In the last day,
the great day of the feast, Iesus stood up and cried,
If any Man thirst, let him come to me and drink.
q. d.</hi> My grace is no sealed Fountain, 'tis free
and open to the greatest of sinners, if they thirst,
they are invited to come and drink. This is that
Oyl of Gospel grace which makes the Key turn
so pleasantly and effectually amongst all the cross
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:109022:94"/>
wards of Man's Will. And thus you see how the
Word preached becomes an instrument in the
Spirit's Hand, to open the door of a sinners
Heart, at which it knocks by its mighty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions,
dreadful Threats, and gracious Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, We next come to the Second <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>
by which the Spirit knocks at the sinners
Heart, and that is the providential Works of
God. These in subserviency to the Word, are
of excellent use to awaken sinners, and make them
open their Hearts to Christ. God hath magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
his Word above all his Name; yet there are
some of the providential Works of God great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
serviceable in this case; the Word sanctifies
Providences, and Providences assist the Word,
and make it work. Now there are two sorts of
Providential Dispensations which the Lord Jesus
makes use of to gain entrance for him into the
Hearts of Men.</p>
               <list>
                  <head>Viz.</head>
                  <item>1. Judgments.</item>
                  <item>2. Mercies.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. Judgments and Afflictions, the Word of
God many times works not till some stroak of
God come to quicken and assist it; thus did the
Lord open the Heart of that Monster of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<hi>Manasseh,</hi> the Word would not work alone,
but a smart rod quickned its operation, <hi>2 Chron.
33. 10, 11, 12. And the Lord spake to</hi> Manasseh,
<hi>and to his people; but they would not hearken. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord brought upon them the Captains of the
host of the King of</hi> Assyria, <hi>which took</hi> Manasseh
<hi>among the thorns, and bound him with fetters, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:109022:95"/>
carried him to</hi> Babylon. <hi>And when he was in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
he besought the Lord his God, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himself greatly before the God of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Heart of this Man relented under
the Word assisted by the Rod. Ah, 'tis good that
God take such a course with some sinners, else the
Word would do them no good; and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
is that in <hi>Iob 36. 8, 9, 10. And if they be bound in
fetters, and holden in cords of affliction; then he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them their work and their transgression, that they
have exceeded; and openeth their Ears to discipline.</hi>
This is that rough course, the obstinacy of Men's
Hearts makes necessary for their recovery; and
therefore it is very observable that some words
of God have lain dead in some sinners Hearts for
years together, and at last have begun to work
under some smart and close Rod. Alas, while all
things are pleasant and prosperous about us, the
Word hath but little operation and effect, <hi>Ier.
22. 21, 22. I spake unto thee in thy prosperity, but
thou saidst I will not hear: this hath been thy manner
from thy youth, that thou obeyedst not my voice. The
wind shall eat up all thy pastures, and thy lovers shall
go into captivity; surely then shalt thou be ashamed
and confounded for all thy wickedness. q. d.</hi> Your
Eyes are so dazled with the beautiful Flowers,
and your Ears so charmed with the <hi>Syren</hi> Songs
and Lullabies of earthly delights, that my Word
can take no place upon you. Let an East-wind
blow, and wither up these Flowers; then the
Word shall work and Conscience rescent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
of Eternity; this course God is feign
to take with many of you; here you sit from
Sabbath to Sabbath under the Word, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:109022:95"/>
takes place upon your Hearts. Will you not
hear the voice of my VVord? go Death, saith
God, and smite that Man's Child dead, I will try
what that will do; go Poverty, and blast his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state,
and see what that will do; go Sickness,
and smite his Body, and shake him over the
Graves mouth, I will see what that will do.
Thus God sends to sinners, as <hi>Absolom</hi> sent to
<hi>Ioab,</hi> who refused to come near him, till he set
fire to his field of Corn, and then away comes
<hi>Ioab, 2 Sam.</hi> 14. 29, 30, 31. And thus the Lord
opened the Heart of the <hi>Iaylor,</hi> by putting him
into a fright, a panick fear of Death, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 27.
And thus doth the Lord devise means to bring
back his banished.</p>
               <p>II. As God makes use of the Hammer of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
so he makes use also of Mercies to make
way for Christ into the Hearts of Men. Every
Mercy is a call, a knock of God, and truly if
there be any ingenuity left unextinguished in the
Heart, one would think Mercy should prevail
more than all the Judgments in the World, <hi>Rom.
2. 4. Knowest thou not that the goodness of God lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
thee to repentance? q. d.</hi> Dost thou not see the
Hand of Mercy stretched out to lead thee into a
corner, there to mourn over thy sins committed
against so gracious and merciful a God? By every
Mercy you receive, Christ doth as it were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ee you
to open your Hearts to him; they are so many
gifts sent from Heaven to make way for Christ
into your Hearts. It would be an endless task to
enumerate all the Mercies bestowed to this end
upon the unregenerate; but surely this is the
errand of them all; and the Lord takes it very
ill when his end is not answered in them; hence
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:109022:96"/>
is that complaint, <hi>Ier. 5. 24. Neither say they in
their Heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God, that
giveth us rain, both the former and the latter in his
season.</hi> Some of you have been marvelously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
in times of common Contagion and
Death, when thousands have fallen at your right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
and left: then have you been preserved or
recovered, according to that, <hi>Exod. 15. 26. I
will put none of those Diseases upon thee, for I am
the Lord that healeth thee.</hi> I am <hi>Iehovah Rophe,</hi>
the Lord the Phisitian; many of you have been
at the Graves mouth, in many Diseases; others
upon the Deeps, yet the Hand of Mercy pulled
you back and suffered you not to drop into the
Grave and Hell in the same moment. O what a
knock was here given by the Hand of Mercy at
thy hard Heart! Certainly if Men would but
observe, they might see a strange, marvellous
working and moulding of things by the Hand of
providence, for the production of thousands of
Mercies for them; and if Mercy would do the
work, and win you over to Christ, many rods
had been spared, which your obstinacy hath
made necessary. O ungrateful sinners! Doth
your Redeemer thus woo and fee you by so many
gifts of Mercy, and yet will you shut him out?
<hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?</hi>
For which of all his benefits do your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Souls shut the door upon him?</p>
               <p>III. You see what Christ's knocking at the
Soul of a sinner implies, and by what instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
it is performed. In the last place, we will
consider the manner how this action is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in the Ten following Particulars, wherein
much of the mistery of Conversion will be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:109022:96"/>
the Lord grant your experience may answer
them. VVe cannot indeed exactly describe and
mark all the footsteps of the Spirit in this VVork
upon the Souls of Men; yet these things seem
eminently observable.</p>
               <p>1. The knocks of Christ at the sinners Heart
are <hi>silent</hi> and <hi>secret</hi> to all persons in the VVorld
except the Soul it self, at whose door he knocks;
here be many hundreds of you this day under
the VVord; if the Lord shall this day knock by
Conviction at any Man's Heart, none will hear
that knock, but that Man only; for it is a knock
without sound or noise to any but the particular
Soul concerned in it. It was fore-prophesied of
our Redeemer, and of this very act of his, <hi>Isa.
4. 2. 2. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice
to be heard in the Street.</hi> The Kingdom of God
cometh not into the Souls of Men with publick
observation; you read in 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. No Man
knoweth the things of a Man, saving the Spirit of
a Man that is in him.</hi> None knows what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
another Man's Conscience feels, until he
himself shall discover them; you hear the same
sound of the Gospel, but you hear not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
stroaks it gives to another Man's Conscience.
Christ's approaches to the Soul make no noise;
little do we know what the Spirit of Christ
whispers in the Ear of him that sits next us. 'Tis
said of the inward comforts of the Spirit, <hi>I will
give him the hidden Manna which no Man knows but
he that eateth of it.</hi> This is true also of inward
terrors and troubles. Christ's knocks by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
are but a secret whisper of his Spirit in
the Ear of a sinner, saying, Thou art the Man,
this is thy case. That is the first thing in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:109022:97"/>
manner of Christ's knocking, 'tis a silent knock
without publick sound.</p>
               <p>2ly, These silent inward knocks of the Spirit
of Christ, though they are heard by none but
the Soul it self, yet do they greatly differ as to
the terror, or mildness of them in different sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.
Some hear them with more terror and
astonishment, others in a mild and gentle man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when the Lord knockt at the <hi>Iaylors</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30. it was a terrible stroak;
he called for a light, and sprang in like a Man
distracted; and trembling and astonied fell down
at the Apostles feet, crying, <hi>Sirs, what must I do
to be saved?</hi> Here was a terrible knock indeed,
which almost affrighted his Soul out of his Body;
it is as if he had said, Tell me, for the Lord's
sake, and tell me quickly, whether there be any
way of Salvation, and where it lies, for I am a
lost Man, an undone Soul. But when the Lord
opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> there were no such
terrors, the Lord spake to her in a more mild
and gentle voice; as you see <hi>verse</hi> 14. the Spirit
of God varies his method according to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the Soul he worketh on. Knotty pieces need
greater wedges and harder blows to rive them
asunder; and as he directs his Ministers, <hi>Iude</hi> 22.
to make a difference, to deal tenderly and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionately
with some; but others, to save with fear;
so he himself observeth like different methods.</p>
               <p>3ly, Some knocks of Christ are <hi>succesful,</hi> and
obtain the desired effect. He knocks and the
Soul opens; but others are insuccessful, he knocks
once, and again by Convictions, which may cause
the Conscience for the present to startle a little,
but there is no opening to Christ by Faith. O
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:109022:97"/>
friends this is of dreadful consideration, <hi>Prov. 1.
24. I called, and you refused; I stretched out my
Hand, and no Man regarded.</hi> There's a call with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an answer, a knock, and no opening; and
these things are very common, especially among
the unconverted, that live under a lively Gospel
rouzing Ministry; of this Christ complains,
<hi>Matth. 11. 16, 17. Whereunto shall I liken this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration?
They are like unto Children sitting in the
market-place, and calling to their fellows, saying, We
have piped unto you, and you have not daunced: We
have mourned unto you, but you have not lamented.
q. d.</hi> Neither the delicious airs and melody of
Gospel grace, nor the mournful and dreadful
threats of damnation to unbelievers avail any
thing to open your Hearts to embrace me; no
voices from mount <hi>Gerezim,</hi> or mount <hi>Ebal</hi> will
prevail with you. Ah, how many sad witnesses
unto this truth have I now before mine Eyes!
But God forbid it should be thus all round. No,
no, there be some Souls who hear, and open;
even every one that hath heard and learned of
the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 45. When the Spirit of God
puts forth his Power with the Word, then, and
not till then it becomes successful.</p>
               <p>4ly, Sometimes Christ knocks with a thick suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of Convictions, a quick repetition of his
calls. Some men have had thousands of Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in a few years; for in this case the Lord
saith, as it is <hi>Exod. 4. 8. If they will not harken to
the voice of the first sign, yet they may believe the
voice of the latter sign.</hi> And yet sometimes nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the former nor the latter avail any thing.
<hi>How oft would I have gathered thy Children, and ye
woul not, Matth.</hi> 23. 37. How often? Intimating
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:109022:98"/>
the many calls Christ gave <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, yet all in vain. Obstinate sinners, Christ
hath been knocking and calling at some of your
Consciences from your very Child-hood; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands
of Convictions have been tryed upon some
of you, and yet to this day your Souls are shut
fast against him. The Lord hath waited from
year to year for your answer, by this signifying
how loath he is to part with you; such a time
thou wast upon a sick-bed nigh unto Death; at
such a time under such a Sermon, and then Christ
knockt at thy Soul; if all this be in vain, so
many Convictions as you have stifled, so many
fagots you carry with you to Hell to increase your
flames and torments; yet commonly those quick
repetitions and redoublings of the stroaks of
Convictions end well; and it is a good sign when
one Conviction revives another, and the Lord
keeps the Soul still waking. But O take heed,
and try not his Patience too long, lest the next
stroak be more dreadful than all the former; not
to open your Hearts, but smite dead your hopes
for Heaven.</p>
               <p>5ly, Sometimes Christ knocks <hi>intermittingly,</hi>
knocking and stopping, a call and silence, and
that at a considerable time and distance; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
this day, and it may be not another in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Months. There be some aged sinners that
have not had more than one or two remarkable
rouzings of Conscience in fifty or sixty years
time, and then no more. Dont think that the
Lord will make his Spirit always strive with Men,
<hi>Gen</hi> 6. 3. no, there is a time when God saith to
the Word, convict the Conscience of that Man
or Woman no more, not a stroak more by way
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:109022:98"/>
of Conviction, but henceforth be thou for Obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
not to open but to shut him up, <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. 10.
Reader, bethink thy self, how long was it since thy
Conscience was rouzed and awakened? O saith
one, seven or ten years ago I heard such a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
which tore my Conscience to pieces, I fell
under such a sad providence which rouzed and
awakened, all my fears, but since that time all
hath been still and quiet; the Lord give a second
awakning lest you awake with the flames of God's
wrath about you. I observe it is usual when God
works upon any very early, he knocks thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittingly;
now the Conscience is active and
full of trouble, then the vanities of Youth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish
these Convictions again; but the Lord
follows his design, and at last the Conviction set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles
and ends in Conversion.</p>
               <p>6ly, Christ sometimes knocks with both Hands
at once, with the Word and with the Rod toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the latter in subserviency to the former;
and if ever the Soul be like to open, it will open
then, when Ordinances and Afflictions work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:
The Word smites the Conscience with
Conviction, and at or about the same time, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
smites the outward-man with some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction,
to make the Word work effectually; or
under some smart affliction, a suitable word is
seasonably directed to the Conscience, and thus
<hi>Iuncta Iuvant,</hi> the one assisteth the other, and
both together produce the desired effect: Thus
the Lord wrought upon the <hi>Thessalonians, 1 Thes.
1. 6. And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord,
having received the Word in much affliction.</hi> A
Child dies, an Estate is lost, or a Sickness seizeth,
at the time when Conscience is prepared by a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:109022:99"/>
Conviction from the Word, or Afflictions have
prepared it for the Word. The Rod upon the
Back, helps the Word to work upon the Heart;
and if both these working in fellowship will not
do the work, there is little hope that any thing
will do it.</p>
               <p>7ly, Every knock of Christ disturbs the sinful
rest of the Soul; it rouzeth guilt in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and puts the inner-man into great distress
and trouble; before Christ comes and knocks at
the door of the Heart all is still and quiet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
the Soul is in a quiet sleep of sinful security,
no fears, or troubles molest its rest, <hi>Luke 11. 21.
When a strongman armed keepeth his Palace, his
goods are in peace: But when a stronger than he shall
come upon him, and overcome him, he taketh from him
all his armour wherein he trusted.</hi> The armour
which Satan puts into the Hands of sinners to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
themselves against the Convictive stroaks of
the Word, are the general Mercy of God, the
outward Duties of Religion, partial Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when Christ comes by effectual
Conviction, he disarms the sinner of all these
pleas, and then the Soul sees what broken Reeds
it leaned upon. <hi>When the Commandment came,</hi>
(saith <hi>Paul) sin revived, and I dyed,</hi> Rom. 7. 9.
<hi>i. e.</hi> all my vain hopes expired; no artifice of
Satan can any longer quiet the sinners Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
he apprehends himself in a miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
meditates an escape; farewel now to
sound and quiet sleep; no peace till out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>8ly, Every effectual knock of Christ gives an
allarm to Hell, and puts Satan to all his shifts
and arts to secure the possession of the convinced
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:109022:99"/>
sinner. The Devil is a jealous Spirit, and when
his interest is in danger, he bestirs himself to
purpose; the time of Conviction is an hour of
temptation. <hi>We wrestle not with flesh and blood,</hi>
(saith the Apostle) <hi>but against Principalities,
against Powers, against the Rulers of the darkness
of this World, against Spiritual wickedness</hi> (or
wicked Spirits)<hi>in high-places,</hi> or about heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. The strife betwixt Satan and the
Soul is now for no less than the prize of eternal
Life; 'tis now for all, or none; for life or death,
for Heaven or Hell; the powers of Hell are now
all in Arms to destroy Convictions, and secure
the possession of the Soul against Christ; as when
a <hi>Granado</hi> falls into a Garison, the first care of
the Defendants is, to stifle and choak it before it
break. Whilst Christ is speaking by his Spirit
in one Ear, the Devil is whispering in the other;
and the things he whispers to quench Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are usually such as these; It is time enough
yet, what need such hast? Enjoy thy pleasures a
little longer, thou maist come to Christ and be
saved at last; if that will not do, then he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his voice, to what purpose wilt thou go to
Christ? 'Tis now too late; the time of Grace is
over; hadst thou come to him in thy youth, and
obeyed his first call, it had been somewhat, but
now it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o no purpose: If this will not quiet the
Soul, then he saith, Thy sins are too great to be
pardoned, there's no hope for such a prodigious
sinner as thou art. If the Lord help the Soul to
overcome this, by discovering to it the riches of
mercy, pardoning the greatest of sinners; then
he represents the multitudes which are in the
same case with the convinced sinner; come, fear
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:109022:100"/>
not, if it go ill with thee, it will be as bad for
millions of Men and Women; if thou go to
Hell, thousands will go with thee; but if the Soul
be loath to be damned for company, then he bids
it look upon the train of troubles and afflictions
that come along with Christ, and will certainly
follow him, if the door be opened to let him in;
if Christ come in reproaches, losses and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
will certainly come in with him; troops of
miseries and calamities follow him; himself
hath told thee so, and art thou mad to ruine all
thy comforts in the World, and plunge thy self
into a Sea of trouble, for what thine Eyes never
saw? But if the Soul reply, These are more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
than damnation; better my flesh suffer for
a time than my Soul be cast away for ever; then
he represents the insuperable difficulties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
what a hard thing it is to be saved; how
many painful duties and acts of mortification
the Soul must pass through. Thus you see what
an allarm Conviction gives to the powers of
Hell.</p>
               <p>9ly, Every effectual knock of Christ is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on, and new Convictions revive old, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ones; and the Lord never leaves knocking
till the door be opened; if one Sermon will not
do, another shall; if one wound be plaistered,
and healed by the art of Satan, a fresh wound
shall be made; if a former Conviction vanish,
the next shall be sealed upon the Soul; and when
the Spirit of the Lord sealeth a Conviction upon
the Conscience, raze it out who can. And here's
the difference betwixt special and common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions;
common Convictions come and go,
they put the Soul in a fright for a day or a
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:109022:100"/>
month, and then trouble it no more for ever;
but special Convictions will be continued, one
thing backs another, for Christ is in pursuit of
the Soul, and will give it chase till at last he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
and come up with it.</p>
               <p>10ly, In the last place, All the knocks of
Christ cease and end when the sinners day of
grace is ended. This is of dreadful considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when the time of Mercy is over, no more
strivings of the Spirit with a Man after that.
Christ saith to the drousie sinner, as he spake to
the drousie Disciples in the Garden, <hi>Sleep on now,
and take your rest.</hi> So here, I called thee in such
a Sermon, but thou heardest not; by such a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
but thou obeyedst not; sleep on now,
and take thy rest: <hi>My people would not hearken to
my voice, and</hi> Israel <hi>would none of me; So I gave
them up to their own Hearts lust, to walk in their own
counsels,</hi> Psal. 81. 11, 12. <hi>q. d.</hi> I have done with
them, the treaty is ended, I will make no more
essays towards their Conversion and Salvation.
So <hi>I gave them up.</hi> Methinks it sounds as much as
this, Take him Sin, Take him Devil, I will have
no more to do with him. So <hi>Hosea</hi> 4. 17. Ephraim
<hi>is joyned to idols, let him alone.</hi> His Heart is glued
fast to sin, he is enamoured upon other Lovers,
let him a lone. O beloved, 'tis a dreadful thing
for God to say, let this Man alone in his forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and that Man in his carnal security: Let
not this be misapplied by poor trembling Souls
under Conviction. I know the fear of this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is upon their Hearts, nothing makes them
tremble more than lest the day of Grace be ended
with them. But there is no ground for this fear
whilst the Spirit continues Convincing, and the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:109022:101"/>
Soul trembling, lest his Convictions should prove
ineffectual. Thus much of the nature, instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and manner of Christ's knocking at the
door of a sinners Heart. Our way is now open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to a fruitful Application of this Point, which
will wind up in divers necessary Uses.</p>

                        <hi>Into how deep a sleep hath sin cast the Souls of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that Christ must stand so long, and give such
loud repeated knocks, before it will awake and open to
him?</hi> There is the Spirit of a deep sleep fallen
upon Men, like that into which God cast <hi>Adam.</hi>
God speaketh once, yea twice, but Man regards
it not; 'tis the hardest thing in the World to
rouze and awaken a Man out of his carnal secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Look over Satans Kingdom, and you shall
find a general stilness and quietness among his
Subjects. There's no trouble for Sin, no stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
after Salvation, no cryings out, <hi>What shall
we do to be saved?</hi> Go into the crouds of carnal
Men and Women, and you shall find them all
intent and busie about other matters. How long
shall you be in their company, before you hear
one groan for sin? Or see one tear slide from
their Eyes on that account? Oh, what a marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thing is here! Do not their Consciences
know the guilt that lyes upon them? Are they
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:109022:101"/>
not aware of a day of reckoning which approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth?
Yes, yes, these things are not hid from
their Consciences; What art then is used to keep
them so still and quiet? Why, there are divers
Rattles to still the Consciences of sinners, and
they do it effectually. There are five causes and
occasions of this wonderful stilness in the Souls of
sinners.</p>
                     <p>1. Ignorance of the nature of regenerating
Grace; taking that for regeneration which is
none of it; thus did the <hi>Iews, Ioh.</hi> 8. 55. confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm God to be their God, and yet they did
not know him. How many proor ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
think there is no need of any other Work
of regeneration, but what passed upon them in
Baptism? They were born and Baptized Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
and that's enough they think to save them,
<hi>Matth. 3. 9. We have</hi> Abraham <hi>to our Father;</hi> they
thought it sufficient that <hi>Abraham</hi>'s blood ran in
their Veins, though there were not a spark of
<hi>Abraham</hi>'s faith kindled in their Souls: the Lord
forgive the sin of those Men that lead poor Souls
into such fatal mistakes. O if Men were but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the necessity of a greater and further
Work to pass upon their Souls than their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
common powerless profession, or the <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
Works which appear upon formal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
Heaven and Earth would ring with their
cries. But ignorance of the nature and necessity
of special regenerating Grace, like a Dose of
<hi>Opium</hi> casts the Consciences of many into this
deep sleep.</p>
                     <p>2ly. Freedom from grosser sins and pollutions
of the World, stills and quiets the Consciences
of thousands; they have had a civil, sober and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:109022:102"/>
fair Education, and though there be no Grace,
and Regeneration; yet what Saints do they seem
to themselves being adorned with sobriety and
civility! This stilled the Conscience of the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,</hi>
Luke 18. 11. <hi>God I thank thee that I am not
as other Men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers,
or even as this Publican.</hi> Thus like delicate <hi>Agag</hi>
they spruce up themselves with moral homiliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
vertues, wherein many thousand Heathens
were more gay than themselves; but Justice will
hew them to pieces as <hi>Agag</hi> was, for all their
moral ornaments and endowments.</p>
                     <p>3ly, The strict performance of the external
duties of Religion quiets the Consciences of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
they question not but those that do so well
shall fare well, and that God will never damn Men
and Women that keep their Church and say their
Prayers as they do. Thus the carnal Jews delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
themselves, crying, <hi>The Temple of the Lord,
The Temple of the Lord;</hi> as malefactors in some of
our Neighbouring Kingdoms, fly to the Church
from the Hand of Justice, so do these; but God
will pluck them from the Horns of the <hi>Altar</hi> and
convince them that the empty name of Religion
is no security from damnation.</p>
                     <p>4ly, Many Consciences are still'd and quieted
in a natural sinful state, by misinterpreting the
voices of Providence; it may be God prospers
your Earthly affairs; succeeds and smiles upon
your undertakings; and this you conclude must
be a Token of his love and favour: But alas,
this is a great mistake, the Lord give you better
evidences of his love than these; for who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
more in the World than wicked Men? And
who are more crost than the people of God?
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:109022:102"/>
Read <hi>Iob</hi> 21. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. and compare both
with <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 1. and you will quickly find the
vanity of all hopes built upon such a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>However by such things as these are, the God
of this World blinds the Eyes of multitudes.</p>

                     <p>If every conviction be a knock of Christ., how
deeply are all Souls concerned in the success and issue

                     <p>Conviction is an <hi>Embrio</hi> of the new Creature;
if it go out its full time, and come to a perfect
new Birth, it brings forth Salvation to your
Souls; if it miscarry finally, you are finally lost. It
is of infinite concernment therefore to every Man
and Woman to be tender over those Convictions
their Consciences go big with all. 'Tis true,
Conviction and Conversion are two things; there
may be Conviction without Conversion, though
there can be no Conversion without Conviction.
The blossoms upon the Trees in the Spring of
the Year, cannot properly be called Fruit, they
are rather the rudiments of Fruit, or something
in order to Fruit: if they open kindly and knit
or set firmly, perfect Fruit follows them; but if
a blast, or a frosty Morning kill them, no Fruit
is to be expected. Thus it is here, great care
therefore ought to be taken about the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and success of Convictions, both by
<list>
                           <item>1. The Soul it self that is under them,</item>
                           <item>2. And by all others that are concerned
about them.</item>
                        </list>

1. What care should the Soul it self have upon
whom Convictions are wrought: Have a care,
Friends, how you quench them, divert or hinder
the operations of them; lest you hinder, as much
as in you lies, the very conception of Christ in
your Soul by them. I remember it is said, in
<hi>Exod. 21. 22. If M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>n strive and hurt a Woman
with Child, and mischief follow; life shall be given
for life.</hi> The life of your Souls is bound up in
the life of your Convictions. I know it is hard
for Men and Women to dwell with their own
Convictions; guilt and wrath are sad Subjects for
Men's thoughts to dwell upon; but yet 'tis far
better to dwell with the thoughts of sin and
wrath here, than to lye sweltering under them
in Hell for ever. You may be rid of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
and your Salvation together; be not too
eager after peace, a good Trouble is better than
a false Peace. And upon the other side, beware
that your Convictions and Troubles turn not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
discouragements to Faith; this will cross the
proper intention of them: They are Christ's
knocks for entrance, and were never intended to
be bars or stumbling blocks in your way to him;
not stops, but steps in your way to Christ.</p>
                     <p>2ly, Let all others that are concerned about
convinced Souls beware what Counsels they give,
and what rules they prescribe; lest they render
them abortive, and destroy all in the bud. There
are two errors, too commonly committed, one
<hi>in excess,</hi> perswading Souls under trouble of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
that there's no coming for them to Christ,
unless they be so and so prepared; humbled,
just at such a degree; this is dangerous counsel,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:109022:103"/>
it over-heats the troubles of Conscience, and
keeps the Soul from its proper present duty and
remedy. I am sure <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> took no such
course with the convinced Jaylor, nor <hi>Peter</hi> with
the three thousand wounded Consciences, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.
Nor do I find where God hath stated the time
and degree of Spiritual Troubles, so that there
must be no adresses to Christ in the way of Faith,
until they have suffered them so long, and to such
an height: If they have imbittered sin to the
Soul, and made it see the necessity of a Saviour; I
think they cannot move too soon after Christ in
the way of Faith. Let not Men set bounds where
God sets none.</p>
                     <p>There is another error committed <hi>in defect,</hi>
when Promises and Comforts are presently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
before the nature of Faith is known, or
one act of recumbency put forth towards Christ:
These hasty comforts come to nothing; they
will not, they cannot stand. 'Tis a dangerous
thing to apply Gospel cordials, and pour out
the precious ointment of the Promises upon
them that were never Heart-sick for sin; When
upon every sleight trouble, which is but as an
early dew, the peculiar consolations of penitent
and believing Souls are hand-over-head applied
to them: How many such unskilful <hi>Empericks</hi> are
there in every place? Such as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi>
complains of, <hi>They have healed the hurt of the
Daughter of my People slightly, crying, Peace, peace,
where there is no peace.</hi> Remember the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is now laying for Eternity, and that this is
the time of deep consideration; Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
must ponder the terms, and count the cost,
and deliberately accept and close with Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:109022:104"/>
the Consolations of the Promises can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
administred to them.</p>

                        <hi>What a singular blessing is a rouzing faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry

knocks powerfully; this is one of the greatest
blessings God can bestow upon a people, next to

them not for his, <hi>Lam. 2. 14. Thy Prophets</hi> (not

he stands at the door and knocks:</hi> And I am
here this day to demand your answer, and in

return to him that sent me? What sayst thou
sinner? Wilt thou open to Christ, or wilt thou
shut him out; And with him thy own Pardon,
Peace and Salvation? Once more let me try the

and refute your vain pleas to the contrary; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
no Heart should be able to resist such Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
and rational Perswasions as these following
will be found to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:109022:105"/>
First, You are in exream need of Christ;<note place="margin">1. Motive</note> you
want him more than Bread or Breath; many
things are convenient for your Bodies, but Christ
is the one thing necessary for your Souls, <hi>Luke
10. 9. One thing is necessary.</hi> Necessity is an Engine
that will open any thing in the World that can
be opened; necessity will make all fly before it.
Now there is a plain, present, absolute necessity
lying upon every one of you to open your Hearts
to Christ, and that without delay. Necessity
goes before the face of Christ to open the way
for him into the Heart; thou must have him, or
be lost for ever. Christ and Faith are not among
the <hi>may bees,</hi> but the <hi>must bees,</hi> to the happiness
of thy Soul. A Man may be poor, and happy;
reproached, and blessed; but he cannot be Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
and safe; nor Christless, and comfortable;
you must have Christ, or you cannot have life,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 36. You must have Christ or you can have
no hope, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 27. Christ and life, Christ and
hope go together; no Christ no life, no Christ
no hope; sinner, thou must have Christ, or thou
canst have no pardon; for Christ and pardon are
undivided, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7. In a word, you must have
Christ or you can have no Salvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12.
Well then, if thou canst have no life, nor hope;
no pardon, nor Salvation without Christ; then
a plain necessity goes before Christ to open his
way into thine Heart; methinks, thou shouldst
now say, Then will I open to Christ whatever
the terms be. Come sufferings, losses, reproaches,
yea death it self, all is one; Christ I must have,
and Christ I will have; necessity is layed upon
me, and my Heart is opened to Christ by it; wo
to me for ever if I miss of Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:109022:106"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Motive.</note> The Lord Jesus is this day come
nigh to every one of your Souls. I may say to
you as Christ did to them, <hi>Luke 10. 9. The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God is come nigh unto you.</hi> The Lord grant
he be not as nigh to some of you as ever he shall
be; for he must come nearer or else you are lost
for ever. It is not Christ among you in the
Means of Grace, but Christ within you by the
Work of Grace, which must be unto you the
hope of Glory, <hi>Colos. 1. 27.</hi> He is not only among
you in respect of external Means, but he is come
into your Understandings and Consciences. Yea,
some motions of his you may feel upon your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
there wants but a little more to make
you eternally Happy. O what would one effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
touch upon your Wills be worth now! The
Head-Work is done, but O that the Heart-Work
were done too. You are <hi>almost saved,</hi> but to be
almost saved, is to be wholly and eternally Lost,
if it go no further. 'Tis a sad thing for a Man
that hath one Foot in Heaven, to slide from
thence into Hell. 'Tis sad to be Shipwreckt at the
Harbours mouth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Motive.</note> Jesus Christ hath an unquestionable
right to enter into and possess every one of your
Souls. Satan is but an Usurper, Christ is your
lawful Owner and Proprietor; thy Soul, sinner,
hath not so full a Title to thy Body, as Christ
hath to thy Soul. Satan keeps Christ out of his
right. Christ knocks at the door of his own
House; he built it and therefore may well claim
admission into it; it is his own Creature, <hi>Col. 1. 16.
By him were all things made, whether they be visible or
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:109022:106"/>
invisible;</hi> Bodies or Souls. The invisible part,
thy Soul, is his Workmanship, a stately Structure
of his own raising. He hath also a right by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
Christ hath bought thy Soul and that
at the invaluable price of his own Blood. Who
then can dispute the right of Christ to enter in to
his own House? But alas! he cometh to his own,
but his own receive him not.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Motive.</note> Open the door to Christ, for a train
of blessings and mercies comes in with him; a
troop of privileges follow him: In the same
day and hour that Christ comes into thine Heart
by a full consent and deliberate choice, a pardon
comes with him of all the sins that ever thou
committedst in Thought, Word, or Action. Will
such a pardon be welcome to thy Soul? Then let
Christ be welcome;<note place="margin">Ephes. 1. 7.</note> for where Christ comes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
comes; if you open to Christ, you open to
peace; and who would shut the door of his Soul
against Peace? If peace be welcome, let Christ
be welcome; for peace follows faith in Christ,
<hi>Rom. 5. 1:</hi> Where Christ comes, liberty comes,
<hi>Iohn 8. 36. If the Son therefore shall make you free,
then are you free indeed.</hi> Are you in love with Bonds
and Fetters? Satans Laws are written in Blood:
Christs yoak is easie, and his commands not
grievous. If you love liberty, love Christ. In
a word, where Christ comes, Salvation comes;
<hi>for he is the Author of eternal Salvation to all them
that obey him.</hi> If therefore you love Pardon, Peace,
Liberty, and Salvation, shut not the door against
Christ; for all these follow him where-ever he
goes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:109022:107"/>
Fifthly,<note place="margin">5. Motive.</note> Christ this day solemnly demands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into thy Soul, he begs thee to open to
him, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 20.</hi> He commands thee to open to
him, <hi>1 Iohn 3. 23.</hi> He denounceth eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to those that refuse him entrance. Now
consider well, here is entrance demanded under
pain of the eternal Wrath of God; this demand
is filed and recorded in Heaven, at your own
peril be it if you shut the door against him; only
this I will say in my Redeemers behalf, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse,
bear witness Heaven and Earth this day, that
Christ solemnly demanded entrance into thy Soul
and was refused; bear witness, that the door was
shut against the only Redeemer, who intreated,
commanded and threatned eternal Damnation to
the rejecters of him. O methinks that Scripture,
<hi>Prov. 1. 24. 25.</hi> is able to strike terror into the very
center of that Soul that refuses the offers of
Christ.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly,<note place="margin">6. Motive.</note> And so I have done my Masters er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand;
if you now refuse the knock of Christ at
your Hearts, he may never knock more; and
where are you then? There is a knock which
will be the last knock, a call which will be his last
call; and after that no more knocks or calls, but
an eternal Silence as to any overture of Mercy or
Grace.</p>
                  <p>But if I do open to Christ he will never come into
such a filthy polluted sinful Soul as mine is?<note place="margin">1. Obj.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who saith so?<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Who dare affirm so impudent
a falshood in the very face of the Text? <hi>If any
Man open unto me, I will come in to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:109022:107"/>
If I open to Christ,<note place="margin">2. Obj.</note> I must bid farewel to ease
and rest in this World; reproaches, sufferings, losses
follow him.</p>
                  <p>If Christ,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Pardon, and Salvation, be not
worth the enduring and suffering these small
things, sure thou valuest Christ and thy Soul at
a low rate. Oh, who can sufficiently bewail
the ignorance and folly of Unbelievers, that will
fell their Souls and hopes of Heaven for such
trifles! And if Christ and thy Soul must part
upon these terms, then hear me sinner, and let
it sink into thy Heart; thy Damnation will be
both

                  </p>

hadst thy own choice, and deliberately prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redst
the insignificant trifles of this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ and Salvation. It was plainly told
thee what the issue of thy rejecting Christ
would be, and yet after sufficient warning, thou
adventuredst upon it; whatever other sinners will
plead I know not, but as for thee thou must be
speechless, <hi>Matth. 22. 12.</hi> If thou dye Christless
thou must appear at his Bar speechless; and the
day of Judgment will be the day of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of the righteous Judgment of God, <hi>Rom.
2. 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2ly, It will also be Unavoidable, for there is no
other way to Salvation but this, <hi>Acts 4. 12.</hi> No
Christ, no Heaven; no Faith, no Christ; <hi>How
shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?
Heb. 2. 3.</hi> Mercy it self cannot save thee out of

               <p>This Point lyes directly and fully in the very
Eye and intention of the Text. In the opening
of it two things must be spoken to in the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
part, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The demonstration of this Truth that he is
so.</item>
                     <item>2. The marvelous and admirable grace and
condescension of Christ that he should be so.</item>

               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:109022:110"/>
First, For <hi>Demonstration</hi> of this Truth, That
Christ is an earnest suiter for union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Souls of sinners. I shall draw down
the Demonstration of this Truth from a view
and consideration of the dispositions, carriages,
and actions of the Lord Jesus towards poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
from first to last: And when you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
them all together, and by them seen the
temper of his Heart, how great and clear a light
will shine upon this Point! That his Heart hath
still enclined towards union and communion with
sinful Man will evidently appear by considering
him in a fourfold state, and time.
<list>
                     <item>1. Before his Incarnation.</item>
                     <item>2. In the days of his Flesh.</item>
                     <item>3. At his Death. And</item>
                     <item>4. At, and since his Ascension into Heaven.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, Consider him before his Incarnation,<note place="margin">1. Demonst.</note> and
you will find too things in that state which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speak his desires after union with us.</p>
               <p>1. In the Covenant of Redemption he made
with God concerning us before this World had a
being; for such Covenants and Promises did
really pass betwixt him and the Father before all
time, or else I know not how to understand that
Scripture, <hi>Tit. 1. 2. In hope of eternal Life, which
God that cannot lye, promised before the World began.</hi>
To whom could that Promise be made, but unto
Christ, which bears date before the Creation?
what else can this mean but the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
made betwixt the Father and the Son;
the terms whereof are set down, in <hi>Isa. 53. 10, 11.</hi>
where you find what Christ was to do, <hi>Viz. To put
<pb facs="tcp:109022:111"/>
his Soul an offering for sin?</hi> And what should be his
reward for pouring out his Soul unto Death, <hi>viz.
To see his Seed, to see the travail of his Soul,</hi> even
a Church purchased with his own Blood? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not a great demonstration of the
propension and inclination of Christs Heart and
Desire towards union and communion with poor
sinners, let all Men judge. O what a value did
Christ set upon our Souls, that upon such costly
terms he would consent to redeem them? Unto
this agreement God the Father held him, <hi>Rom.
8. 32. God spared not his own Son.</hi> And this very
covenant Christ pleaded with the Father, <hi>Iohn
17. 6. I have manifested thy Name to the Men which
thou gavest me out of the World; thine they were,
and thou gavest them me.</hi> This plainly shews the
vehement desire of Christs Heart to be in union
with Men; according to that, <hi>Prov. 8. 31. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
in the habitable parts of his Earth, and my
delights were with the Sons of Men.</hi> Blessed Jesus!
nothing but the strength of thine own desire and
love could ever have drawn thee out of that
Bosom of delights to suffer so many things for
the sake of poor sinners.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Demonst.</note> Let us consider Christs temper and
disposition towards union and communion with
sinners, within time; and every thing done by
Christ carries and confirms this Conclusion:
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:109022:111"/>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. His Assumption of our Nature plainly
speaks it.</item>
                     <item>2. His whole Life upon Earth evidently
discovers it.</item>
                     <item>3. His Doctrin is a clear proof of it.</item>
                     <item>4. His Joy at the Conversion of Souls
proves it.</item>
                     <item>5. His Sorrows for Mens unbelief evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it.</item>
                     <item>6. His indefatigable Labours plainly shew
it.</item>
                     <item>7. His admirable Encouragements to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinners.</item>
                     <item>8. His dreadful Menaces to obstinate sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</item>
                     <item>9. His sending and encouraging Ministers
to draw and gather the World to himself.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>All these things which were transacted in the
Life of Christ, plainly demonstrate how greatly
and earnestly his Heart did propend and incline
towards this desirable union with the Sons of
Men.</p>
               <p>1. Christs Assumption of our Nature manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
his desire after union with us. Herein he
gave two incomparable proofs of his transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
love to us, and desire after us.
<list>
                     <item>1. In passing by a more excellent Nature.</item>
                     <item>2. In marying our Nature to himself.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. He passed by a superiour and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Nature, <hi>Heb. 2. 16. Verily he took not on him
the Nature of Angels.</hi> Angels were excellent
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:109022:112"/>
Creatures, but behold, vessels of Gold cast into
the fire, and Earthen potsherds fitted for glory.
'Tis true, the Angels that kept their integrity
are Members of Christs Kingdom; he is an Head
to them by way of Dominion, but unto us by
way of Vital union. Christ takes the believer
into a nearer union with himself than any An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
in Heaven; but for the multitudes of apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
Angels, he never designed their recovery,
but left them, as they were before, bound in
chains of darkness unto the Judgment of the
great Day, <hi>Iude</hi> vers. 6. This preterition of
Christ, heightens his love to poor Man.</p>
               <p>2ly, In marying our Nature to himself, and
that after sin had blasted its beauty, and let in so
many direful calamities upon it, <hi>Rom. 8. 3. He was
found in the likeness of sinful flesh. i. e.</hi> Flesh sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to weariness, pains and death, which though
there be no sin in them, yet are the effects and
consequences of sin: Such a Nature he assumed
into a Personal union with himself, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
any new pleasure in it, but to capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
himself to suffer and satisfie for us; and
therein to give a convincing proof of the
strength of his love and vehemency of his desire
to us. His personal union with our Nature shews
his desire after a mystical union with our Persons.
He would never have been the Son of Man, but
to make us the Sons and Daughters of the living
God; He came in our likeness that we by Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
might be made in his likeness: Behold
how near Christ comes to us by his Incarnation!
O what a stoop did he make therein to recover
us! Rather than lose us he was contented to
lose his manifestative glory for a time; for his
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:109022:112"/>
Incarnation made him of no reputation, <hi>Phil.</hi>
2. 7. Behold the desires of a Saviour after union
with sinners!</p>
               <p>II. The whole Life of Christ upon Earth, was
an evident proof and demonstration of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers
of his Heart to be in union and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with us, <hi>Iohn 17. 19. For their sakes I sanctifie
my self.</hi> The Life of Christ was wholly set apart
for us; therefore it is said, <hi>Isa. 9. 6. Vnto us a
Child is born, unto us a Son is given.</hi> What was
the errand and buisness upon which Christ came
into this World, but to seek and to save that
which was lost?</p>
               <p>All the Miracles he wrought on Earth were so
many works of Mercy; he could have wrought
his Miracles to have destroyed and ruined such
as received him not; but his Almighty Power
was imployed to heal and save the Bodies of Men
that thereby he might win their Souls unto him,
<hi>Acts 10. 38. God anointed Iesus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>with
the Holy Ghost and with Power; who went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
good, and healing all that were oppressed of the
Devil: for God was with him.</hi> When the Apostles
desired a Commission from him to fetch fire from
Heaven to destroy the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> he rebuked
them, saying, <hi>Ye know not what manner of Spirit ye
are of, for the Son of Man came not to destroy Mens
lives, but to save them,</hi> Luke 9. 54, 55, 56. The
whole Life of Christ in this World was nothing
else but a woing, drawing motive to the Hearts
of sinners; he rejected not the vilest of sinners,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. 39. He rejected none that came unto him;
he would not have little Children forbid to be
brought unto him, <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13. What his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
carriage should be, was long before predicted
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:109022:113"/>
by the Prophet, <hi>Isa. 42. 3. A bruised Reed shall he
not break, and smoaking Flax shall he not quench.
Lentulus,</hi> the Proconsul, in his Epistle, <hi>ad S. P. Q.
R.</hi> having Graphically described the Person of
Christ, gives this account of his carriage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment;
<hi>In his reproofs he was terrible, in his
admonitions fair and amiable, chearful without levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
he was never seen to laugh, but often to weep; his
words grave, few, and modest,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Christ was in the World as a load-stone draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Men to him; his deportment was every
way suitable to his Commission, which was <hi>to
preach good tydings to the Meek, to bind up the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Hearted; to proclaim liberty to the captives, and
the opening of the prison to them that are bound,</hi> Isa.
61. 1.</p>
               <p>III. As his Life so his <hi>Doctrin</hi> was a woing
and inviting <hi>Doctrin;</hi> a most pathetical invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
unto sinners, <hi>Never Man spake as he spake;</hi>
whenever he opened his Lips, Heaven opened;
the very Heart of God was opened in it to sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
the whole stream and current of his
Doctrin was one continued powerful perswasive
to draw sinners to him. This was his Language,
<hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and I will give you rest,</hi> Matth. 11. 28. <hi>In the last
day, the great day of the feast, Iesus stood up and
cryed, If any Man thirst, let him come to me and
drink,</hi> John 7. 37. Himself resembles it to the
clucking of a Hen to gather her Chickins under
her wings, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 34. O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
<hi>how often would I have gathered thy Children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as a Hen doth gather her brood under her
wings!</hi> Certainly, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e whole stream of the
Gospel is nothing else but the charming
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:109022:113"/>
voice of the Heavenly Bridegroom.</p>
               <p>IV. The Joy he always exprest for the success
of the Gospel, speaks him to be an earnest suiter
for the Hearts of Sinners. 'Tis very remarkable
that all the <hi>Evangelists</hi> who have recorded the life
of Christ, never mention one laugh or smile that
ever came from him. <hi>For he was a Man of sorrows,</hi>
yet once you read <hi>that he rejoiced in Spirit;</hi> and
you shall see the occasion of it, in <hi>Luke 10. 21.
In that hour Iesus rejoiced in Spirit.</hi> And what was
it that gladed his Heart, but the report brought
him by the Seventy, who returned with joy,
saying, <hi>Lord, even the Devils are subject to us
through thy Name;</hi> and he said unto them, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
Satan as lightning fall from Heaven,</hi> vers. 17, 18.
Satans Kingdom was going down in the World,
and the mysteries of Salvation revealed unto
Babes; this made his holy Heart leap with Joy
within him, to behold the success of the Gospel,
destroying Satans Kingdom, and the poorest,
meanest among Men, inlightned and converted
by it. This was a Cordial to his very Soul, and
speaks the earnestness of his desire after union
and communion with sinners.</p>
               <p>V. His Sorrows and Mournings upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the obstinacy and unbelief of sinners
speaks the vehemency of his desire after union
with them; it is said, <hi>Mark 3. 5. When he had
looked round about on them with anger, being grieved
for the hardness of their Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. You see from
hence, that an hard Heart is a grief to Jesus
Christ; O how tenderly did Christ resent it,
when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> rejected him! 'Tis said, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.
41. That <hi>when Iesus came nigh to the City he wept,
over it.</hi> The Redeemers tears wept over obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:109022:114"/>
                  <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> spake the zeal and servency of
his affection to their Salvation; how loath is
Christ to give up sinners; what a mournful voice
is that, in <hi>Iohn 5. 40. And you will not come unto me
that you might have life.</hi> How feign would I give
you life, but you will rather dye than come unto
me for it? what can Christ do more, to express
his willingness? All the sorrows that ever toucht
the Heart of Christ from Men were upon this
account, that they would not yield to his calls and
invitations.</p>
               <p>VI. This appears to be the great design of
Christ, by the unwearied labours he underwent
Day and Night to accomplish it; many weary
Journies Christ took, many Sermons and Prayers
he Preached and poured out, and all upon this
design to open the Hearts of sinners to him, and
win the consent of their Wills to become his;
this was the Work which he preferred to his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
food, <hi>Iohn 4. 34. My meat is to do the will
of him that sent me, and to finish his work. q. d.</hi> My
bringing home the Elect of God, and saving them
from wrath to come, 'tis more to me than meat
and drink; so vehement and intense were his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after the winning of sinners, that he would
lose no occasion to accomplish it, If he were
never so weary with his travels and labours, yet
if any occasion offered to save a lost Soul, he
would be sure to improve it; you have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this, in <hi>Iohn 4. 6. Then cometh he to a
City of</hi> Samaria, <hi>called</hi> Sychar, <hi>&amp;c. now</hi> Jacobs
<hi>well was there. Iesus therefore being wearied with his
Iourney, sat thus on the well,</hi> &amp;c. Christ was wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
with his Journy and sat on the Well for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
rest and refreshment, in the heat of the day;
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:109022:114"/>
at the same time comes a Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> to
draw water, a great sinner she was; Christ
compassionately beholding this miserable object,
forgets his own weariness, presently falls a
Preaching Repentance to this sinner, and opens
her Heart; a greater refreshment to him than
that Well could afford him, by giving him a seat
to sit on, or water to drink.</p>
               <p>VII. The great and admirable Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
Christ always gave to coming and willing
Souls, plainly speaks the earnest desire of his
Heart after union with them; never were the
like Encouragements given, that Christ gave, to
draw the Souls of Men to him. 'Tis remarkable
in what general terms and forms of expression he
delivered them, that none might be discouraged;
but come on in hope towards him: <hi>Come unto me
all ye that labour,</hi> Matth. 11. 28. <hi>If any Man thirst,
Iohn</hi> 7. 37. All along the terms of invitation are
exceeding large, which speak the desires of his
Heart to be so also; and his practice was answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to his invitations; his mercies and compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
never failed when the vilest of sinners came
to him in the way of Repentance and Faith;
you read, in <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 41, 42. that when Christ sat
at meat in the House of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Pharisee,</hi> there
came in a poor convinced sinner who had guilt
enough upon her, to sink Ten thousand Souls to
the bottom of Hell; this poor wretch comes with
a great deal of humility unto Christ; not presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to come before his Face, but falls down
behind him, kisseth his Feet, washes them
with Tears, wipes them with the hair of her
Head; all demonstrations of a broken Heart:
And how did the <hi>merciful Iesus</hi> welcome this poor
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:109022:115"/>
sinner? Seals her pardon, commends the fervour
of her affection, and sends her away a joyful
Soul; herein making good that gracious promise,
<hi>Iohn 6. 37. He that cometh unto me I will in no wise
cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIII. The dreadful Threatnings of Christ
against all that refuse him, and shut the doors of
their Hearts against him, speak his vehement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
to prevent the loss and ruin of Souls. The
threats of Christ are not intended to discourage
any from coming to him, to fright away Souls
from him; no, no, that's not their intention;
but to bring them under a blessed necessity of
compliance with his terms. O the dreadful
threatnings which, like claps of Thunder, brake
from the Mouth of Christ against all that should
refuse or delay to come unto him. <hi>If you believe
not, you shall dye in your sins: He that believeth not,
shall not see life,</hi> John 3. 36. What a terrible
Thunder clap is that against all Unbelievers? So
<hi>Mark 16. 16. He that believeth not, shall be damned.</hi>
All these, and many more, are warning pieces
shot off from Heaven to prevent the ruin and
damnation of Men; the very threatnings of
the Gospel carry a design of Mercy in them;
damnation is threatned that it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>IX. And then in the last place, herein appears
the earnestness of Christ after union with sinners,
that when he could be no longer a Preacher to
this World in his own Person, he ordained a
succession of Ministers in his Bodily absence from
us, to gather and build the Church, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to the end of the World; to carry on the
suit that Christ had begun, as long as there was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:109022:115"/>
one elect Soul in the World lying in the state of
Sin and Nature.</p>
               <p>Reader, Christ could not always abide here,
he must dye, or we could not live; he must rise
again, or we could not be justified; our buisness
call'd him to another Place and State: Now when
Christ was to ascend to Heaven what doth he do?
Why, he chuseth and calleth Men, Men made of
the same clay with our selves, whose presence
and appearance should not affright or discourage
us; who should treat with us in a familiar way
about the great concerns of our Salvation in his
Name and stead, <hi>2 Cor. 5. 20. We then are Ambas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors
for Christ, as though God did beseech you; we
pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi> He
did not commissionate Angels to be his <hi>Legates;</hi>
their presence would confound and terrifie us; but
Men cast into the same mould with your selves,
who may say to you as <hi>Elihu</hi> said to <hi>Iob, Iob 33.
6, 7. Behold, I am according to thy wish in Gods
stead: I also am formed out of the clay. Behold, my
terrour shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
Hand be heavy upon thee.</hi> Upon these Commission
Officers of Christ he poured forth excellent gifts in
great diversity, and useful variety, to fit the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities
and various dispositions of Mens Souls;
<hi>When he ascended up on high, he gave gifts unto Men;</hi>
this Ministerial Office is by him established in
the Church, <hi>Till we all come in the unity of the
faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Man, unto the measure of the stature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 4. 11, 12, 13. Unto these
his Ministers he gives the highest encouragements
to quicken them to their labour; if one do but
one part of the work, and another the other;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:109022:116"/>
one soweth, and another reapeth; he tells them
both, <hi>He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth,
and he that reapeth may rejoice togther,</hi> John 4. 36.
He tells them, that every Soul they win to him
shall be as a Jewel in their Crown of glory, <hi>Dan.
12. 3. And they that be wise, shall shine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Firmament, and they that turn many to
righteousness, as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi> What
is Christs intention in all these incouragements
to his Ministers? Surely it is as if he should say
to his Servants, Study hard, Pray earnestly,
Plead with sinners affectionately; every Soul you
win to me shall make an addition to your glory
in Heaven.</p>
               <p>Weigh now the force of this second Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
from the Life of Christ; will you have
a proof of Christs earnest suit to gain the Hearts
of sinners? his whole Life upon Earth was a
great proof of it; his Doctrin, so full of pathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
invitations, proves it; the Joy of his Heart
at the success of the Gospel; his Tears and Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
for the obstinacy of unbelievers; his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
and Travels to gather sinners to him; his
admirable Encouragements put into general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations;
his dreadful Threatnings to all that
reject his motions; his commissionating and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying,
continuing and encouraging his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
to carry on this suit in his Name: All these
things make up a full Demonstration that Jesus
Christ is an earnest suiter for union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with the Soul of sinners; which was the
thing to be proved.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</note> The Death of Christ is the fullest
Demonstration that ever was, or can be given of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:109022:116"/>
his love to sinners, and desire after union and
communion with him. His Doctrin and Life
discovered much, but his Death and Sufferings
abundantly more; in his Doctrin he spent his
<hi>Breath,</hi> but upon the Cross he spent his <hi>Blood.</hi>
Here he comes a suiting to the Souls of sinners
in his Scarlet robes, his Red garments; gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
dipt in his own Blood: You may now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
the same admiring question the Church
propounded, <hi>Isa. 63. 1, 2. Who is this that cometh
from</hi> Edom, <hi>with dyed garments from</hi> Bozrah? <hi>This
that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of his strength? Wherefore art thou red in thine
apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in
the Wine-fat?</hi> Wilt thou know sinner why he
cometh to thee in Red garments? It is to give
thee such a Demonstration of his love as may
draw forth all the love of thy Heart to him;
by this Blood he hath bought and purchased thy
Soul, for a Spouse for himself, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Now
there are two things in the Death of Christ
evidential of the fervency of his desires after us.
<list>
                     <item>1. The greatness of the sufferings which he
endured.</item>
                     <item>2. The Use and End to which they were
designed.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Both these shew how the Heart of Christ is
heated with the vehemency of his own desires
after union with our poor Souls.</p>
               <p>1. The greatness of the sufferings of Christ
discover the ardency of his affection. Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are two-fold.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:109022:117"/>
                  <item>1. External, in his Body.</item>
                  <item>2. Internal, in his Soul.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Both together making up the fulness of his
Sufferings: When you shall hear what Christ
hath endured in both kinds to purchase you to
himself, then you may guess what value he put
upon you, what desire he hath after you. Now
(1.) as to the external Sufferings of Christ in his
Body they were exceeding great, for the Death
he died was not a Natural but a Violent Death;
indeed he could not dye a Natural Death, for
there was no sin in his Nature to open a door to
Death that way: His Body was intended for a
Sacrifice to God, and as a Sacrifice it dyed;
therefore it is said, <hi>1 Pet. 3. 18. He was put to
Death in the Flesh;</hi> his Soul and Body were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
rent asunder in the fulness and perfection
of his strength and vigour; and this violent
Death was also a cursed Death; He was made a
Curse for us, <hi>For it is written, Cursed is every one
that hangeth on a tree,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. A ceremonial
Curse was affixed to the Death of the Cross; <hi>He
that is hanged is accursed of God,</hi> saith the Law:
The intention of that Death was to shew the
person that dyed, to be so vile, that he was not
worthy to touch Heaven or Earth, and therefore
was hanged betwixt both. Moreover, this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Death Christ dyed was a most painful
Death; full of Torture, and very Slow and
Lingering; the Cross was a Rack to the Body
of Christ: <hi>I may tell all my bones,</hi> saith he, <hi>they
look and stare upon me,</hi> Psal. 22. 17. But yet
(2.) the Sufferings of his Body were but the Body
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:109022:117"/>
of his Sufferings; it were the Sufferings of his
Soul, that were the very Soul of his Sufferings.
These inward Sufferings of Christ may likewise
be considered two ways. (1.) In his bitter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passions
in the Garden; O what Agonies and
Conflicts, what sharp Encounters and Distresses
did his Soul there meet with, from the Wrath of
God there endured for your sakes! Once and
again he cried out <hi>Abba</hi> Father, all things are
possible, let this Cup pass; Father, if it be possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
let this Cup pass; thrice he returned to the
same place rowling himself on the ground. The
Sufferings of his Soul cast his blessed Body into
a bloody Agony. <hi>His sweat was as it were great
drops of Blood falling to the ground,</hi> Luke 22. 43, 44.
(2.) In the fulness of his Passions on the Cross,
there was his blessed Soul for a time deserted of
the Father, as to any sensible communications of
Joy and Comfort from him; which occasioned
that bitter out-cry, <hi>Matth. 27. 46. My God, my
God, why hast thou for saken me?</hi> Never was there
such a cry heard since the Heavens were spread
over the Earth; never had Christ seen one
frown in his Fathers Face from Eternity before
this time; but now the smiling Face of God was
hid, and a strong impression of his Wrath made
upon him. And now, Brethren, you see what
Christ hath endured both in his Body and in his
Soul, and all for the sake of Sinners: What
think you now, is not Christ an earnest Suiter?
Doth not all this fully and plainly speak the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
of his Love, the fervencies of his desires
after union and communion with us? If this do
not, then nothing can demonstrate Love and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.
That's the first thing the greatness of the
Sufferings which he endured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:109022:118"/>
Secondly, Let us next consider the Use and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of these Sufferings of Christ, and how
this also demonstrates the earnestness of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
after Conjugal union with us. Now there
was a double Use and End of the Sufferings of
Christ.
<list>
                     <item>1. To make us free, that we might be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Espousals.</item>
                     <item>2. To win our Affections by the argument
of his Sufferings.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. One End of Christs death was to purchase
our Freedom, that we might be capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Espoused to him; for you must know that we
were not in a capacity whilst under the curse of
the Law, to be married unto Christ; the Apostle,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 2, 3, 4. compares the Law to a Husband,
to whom the Wife is bound as long as he liveth,
and not capable of a second marriage until her
Husband be dead. The Death of Christ was the
Death of the Law, as a Covenant of Works
holding us under the bond of a Curse of it,
and so it gave us a <hi>manumission</hi> or freedom from
that bond, and a capacity of espousals to Christ,
as <hi>vers. 4. Wherefore my brethren, ye also are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
dead to the Law by the Body of Christ, that ye
should be married to another, even to him who is raised
from the dead.</hi> A Slave to another is not capable
of being disposed in marriage, until made Free;
you were in bondage to the Law, the slaves of
of Sin and Satan: Christ bought out your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(for his Blood is call'd a ransom, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. 28.)
and so put you into a capacity of being espoused
unto himself; here you see Christ loved you not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:109022:118"/>
for any advantage he could have by you, for you
had nothing to bring him; nay, he must pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
you, and that with his own Blood, before he
can be united to you. O incomparable love! O
fervent desires!</p>
               <p>II. Another design and end of the Death of
Christ was to win and gain our Hearts and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to himself, by the argument of his
Death; this himself hath declared to be the
very end and intention of it, <hi>Ioh. 12. 32. And I
if I be lifted up from the Earth will draw all Men
unto me; this, he said, signifying what Death he
should dye.</hi> Christ endured all that you have
heard, and infinitely more than the Tongue or
Pen of Man can express; and all to draw thy
Soul and win thy consent to come unto him: the
Lord Jesus by his sufferings casts a threefold cord
over the Souls of Sinners, to draw them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
               <p>1. The Death of Christ obtains compleat
righteousness for guilty sinners; and if any
thing in the World will draw the Heart of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
this will; the anxious search, and enquiry of
a convinced sinner, is after a perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to justifie him before God. O that's it the
sinner wants! Conscience saith, thou hast bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
all the Laws of God, and art therefore a
Law condemned wretch; the sentence of the
Law casts thee for Hell; Now what would a poor
sinner give for a release from this sentence of the
Law? O ten thousand Worlds for a Pardon!
Why here it is, saith Christ, Come unto me and
thou shalt receive a free, full, and final pardon;
my Blood cleanseth from all sin; my righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
answers all the demands of the Law. I have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:109022:119"/>
taken away the Hand-writing that was against
thee, and nayled it to my Cross, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14. Come
unto me and take up thy Bonds, thy cancelled
Bonds; come unto me and that dreadful attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of Divine Justice shall never scare or fright
thy Conscience any more; nay, thou shalt build
thy hope upon it; you read, <hi>Rom. 3. 25. That
God hath set forth Christ to be a propitiation through
Faith in his Blood, to declare his righteousness for
the remission of sins that are past, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of God: To declare, I say, at this time
his righteousness; that he might be just, and the justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier
of him that believeth in Iesus.</hi> Here you see
the justification and pardon of a sinner built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that very Attribute which was so frightful and
dreadful to him before. Well then, poor sinner,
is there guilt upon thy Conscience? And doth
thy Soul shake and quiver to think how it shall
stand before the Just and Terrible God in the
great Day? Hearken to the voice of Christ cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified,
who calls thee to him to receive thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge,
which if thou refuse, the Law still stands
in its full force and vertue against thy Soul. This
is one cord Christ casts from the Cross, over
the Souls of guilty sinners to draw them to
him.</p>
               <p>2ly, The Death of Christ purchases and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
perfect cleansing from the filth and polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of sin, to wash the defiled Souls of sinners
from all their uncleanness. For <hi>this is he that
came by water and by blood; not by blood only, but
by water also,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 6. He comes by way of
Sanctification as well as by way of Justification.
Lord, saith a convinced sinner, what an unclean
Nature, Heart and Life have I? O I am nothing
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:109022:119"/>
but a heap of uncleanness, an abhorence to God
and my self; how shall such an Heart as mine,
such an <hi>Augean</hi> Stable be cleansed? Come unto
me, saith Christ, I came by Water as well as
Blood; in me thou shalt find a Fountain for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
as well as Justification; come unto
me, and my Spirit shall undertake the cleansing
of thy Heart; he shall take away the pollutions
of sin perfectly, so that it shall be presented to
God without spot.</p>
               <p>3ly, And lastly, The transcendent love of
Christ shines out in its full strength upon the
Souls of sinners from the Cross; and there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
like love to draw love; when Christ was
lifted up upon the Cross, he gave such a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
demonstration of the strength of his love to
sinners, as one would think should draw love
from the hardest Heart that ever lodged in a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
Breast. <hi>Herein is love</hi> (saith the Apostle)
<hi>not that we loved God, but that he loved us; and sent
his Son to be the propitiation for our sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 10.
<hi>q. d.</hi> Here's the triumph, the riches and glory of
Divine Love, never was such love manifested in
the World. There's much of Gods love in
Temporal Providences, but all's nothing to this,
this is love in its highest Elevation; Love in its
Meridian Glory; before it was none like it, and
after it shall none appear like unto it. And thus
you see Christ from the Cross casting forth a
threefold cord (which is not easily broken) to
draw the Hearts of sinners to him.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, to Conclude,<note place="margin">4. Demonst<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> What mighty De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
of the desires of his Heart towards
us, did our Redeemer give at, and since his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
into Heaven? As the whole Life of Christ
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:109022:120"/>
upon Earth was a perswasive Argument to draw
sinners to him, so his Ascension to Heaven hath
many things in it which are mighty attractives
to the Hearts of Men. I will only mention two,
<list>
                     <item>1. The gifts he bestowed at his Ascension.</item>
                     <item>2. The ends and designs of his Ascension.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) The gifts he bestowed on Men at his As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension;
for this very end and purpose; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the <hi>Psalmist</hi> gives this account, <hi>Psal. 68. 18.
Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast received gifts
for Men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord
God might dwell among them.</hi> He alludes to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Conquerors,</hi> who in the day of their triumph
did <hi>Spargere missilia,</hi> scatter their largesses among
the people. Thus Christ at his Ascension shed
forth the gifts of the Spirit in various kinds, qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying
Men for the Work of the Ministry; to
enable them to plead with your Souls, and carry
on his suit, when he should be in Heaven. These
gifts were extraordinary in the first Age; as the
gift of Tongues, and Miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
to continue to the end of the World, <hi>Eph.</hi>
4. 8, 9. To some he gives depth of Learning and
Judgment, to others a mighty <hi>Pathos,</hi> a melting
influence upon the Affections; but all designed to
win over your Hearts to Christ. This shews
what care he took, and what provision he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably
made, for the success of his great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign,
to draw the Hearts of sinners to him.</p>
               <p>(2ly,) The ends of his Ascension, as they are
declared in Scripture, plainly speak the vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of Christs desire to draw Souls to him. Now
the declared ends of his Ascension were (1) to
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:109022:120"/>
make way for the Spirits coming, to Convince,
Convert, and Comfort the Souls of all that come
unto him, <hi>Iohn 16. 7. Nevertheless I tell yon the
truth, It is expedient for you that I go away; for if
I go not away the Comforter will not come to you; but
if I depart I will send him unto you. And when he is
come he will reprove the World of sin, and of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and of judgment.</hi> Without the Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of these things no Man can come to Christ;
and no such Convictions can be wrought upon
the Conscience of any Man without the Spirit;
and the Spirit could not come to effect these
things upon Mens Hearts if Christ had not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended,
<hi>Iohn 7. 39. But this spake he of the Spirit,
which they that believe on him should receive: for the
Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Iesus was
not yet glorified.</hi> Thus Christ provided for the
carrying on of his great design upon your Hearts
when he was entring into his own Glory: The
thoughts of that Glory made him not to forget
his great design upon Earth. (2) Another end
of Christs Ascension was to make Intercession
with the Father for all and every Soul that
should come unto him; that their future sins
might make no breach of the bond of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
betwixt God and them. A Privilege able
to draw the Hearts of all sinners to him, <hi>1 Iohn</hi>
2. 1, 2. <hi>My little Children, these things write I unto
you, that ye sin not:</hi> Mark it, the intercession of
Christ must incourage and embolden no Man to
sin; that would be a vile abuse of the Grace of
God. <hi>But if any Man sin, we have an Advocate
with the Father Iesus Christ the righteous, and he is
the propitiation for our sins. i. e.</hi> If sin surprize
and deceive any gracious Soul, the bent of whose
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:109022:121"/>
Heart is against it, let him not be discouraged
he hath a potent Advocate ascended into the
Heavens to continue the peace betwixt God and
that Soul. O what an encouragement is here to
gain the consent of a sinners Heart to embrace
Jesus Christ! (3) Another declared end of
Christs Ascension was to lead captivity captive,
as in the forecited place, <hi>Psal.</hi> 68. 17. that is, to
captivate and triumph over Satan as a conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Enemy; who led us captive in the days of
our vanity: He conquered Satan upon the Cross,
<hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. but he triumphed over him at his Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
And without such a conquest and triumph
no Soul could come to Christ. (4) In a word,
Christ ascended into Heaven to prepare Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of rest and glory for every Soul that should
embrace him, in the way of repentance and faith
in this World, <hi>Iohn 14. 2 In my Fathers house are
many mansions, if it were not so I would have told
you; I go to prepare a place for you. q. d.</hi> It satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
me not to enjoy my glory in Heaven alone,
all that come unto me by Faith shall be with me
where I am; let them know for their encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that the glory which God hath given me, I
have given them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 22. All these things
loudly speak the fervent desires of Christs Soul
after union and communion with poor Sinners;
which was the thing to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p>(2ly,) Having proved the Point that Christ is
an earnest Suiter for union and communion with
the Souls of sinners; we next come to shew the
marvellous and admirable Grace, and Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cension
of Christ that it should be so. And this
will appear five ways, to the astonishment of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
considering Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:109022:121"/>
1. Though Christ be thus intent and earnest
in his suit for your consent, yet he gaineth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by you when you do consent; the gain is
to your selves, but not to him; <hi>He is over all
God blessed for ever,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. above all accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
from the Creature: What doth the Sun gain
by enlightning and animating the lower World?
Or what doth a Fountain gain when Men drink
and are refreshed by its Waters? If any Soul
that heareth me, this day, should presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
henceforth to break asunder all the tyes
and engagements betwixt him and sin, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
the Articles of the Gospel, to give away
himself Soul and Body to Christ, to live hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
as an hallowed dedicated Creature to the
Lord Jesus; this indeed would turn to the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
and everlasting advantage of such a Soul,
but yet Christ cannot be profited thereby.</p>
               <p>2ly, And that which still encreaseth the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is this, that though Christ makes no gain or
profit by our Conversion, yet hath he impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished
himself to gain such unprofitable Creatures
as we are to him. He hath made himself poor to
make us rich; so speaks the Apostle, in 2 <hi>Cor.
8. 9. For ye know the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ,
that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became
poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> He
expends his riches, makes no advantage unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self;
his incarnation impoverished his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7. How poor was Christ when he said,
<hi>Psal. 22. 6. But I am a worm, and no man; a r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>proach
of Men and despised of the people?</hi> How poor in
temporal comforts, when he said, <hi>Matth. 8. 20.
The Foxes have holes, and the Birds of the air have
nests; but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:109022:122"/>
Head.</hi> Yea, how poor was he in Spiritual Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
when that astonishing outcry brake from
him upon the Cross, <hi>Matth. 27. 46. My God, my
God, why hast thou forsaken me?</hi> O let it astonish
us that Christ should earnestly desire union with
our Souls upon terms of such deep self-denial to
himself.</p>
               <p>3ly, Though Christ gain nothing by you, and
impoverished himself for you; yet doth he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
many vile repulses, delays and denials of
his Suit, and will not leave it for all that. O
astonishing grace! One would think that the least
delay, and much more a refusal of an overture
from Christ, upon such terms as you have heard,
should make his indignation presently to smoak
against such a Soul; and that he should say, Thou
hast refused my offer, so full of self-denying and
condescending grace, never shall another offer
be made to so unworthy a Soul; and yet you
see he is contented to wait as well as knock, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I stand at the door and knock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4ly, Herein the admirable Grace of this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
suiter appears, that Jesus Christ passeth by
millions of Creatures of more excellent Gifts
and Temperaments, and never makes them one
offer of himself; never turneth aside to give one
knock at their door; but comes to thee the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
and bafest of Creatures, and will not be
gone from thy door without his errands end.</p>
               <p>Knowest thou not sinner, that among the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified
there are to be found multitudes of
Men and Women of more raised and excellent
Parts, nimble Wits, strong Memory, solid Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
yea, Men and Women of cleaner Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations,
strict Morality, adorned with excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:109022:122"/>
homilitical Vertues, capable, if called, to
do him abundantly more service than thou canst;
yet these are past by, and he becomes a Suiter to
such a poor worthless thing as thou art; yea, and
rejoyces in his choice, <hi>Matth. 11. 24. I thank thee,
Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou
hast hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and
hast revealed them unto babes.</hi> Here is the triumph
of Free-grace.</p>
               <p>5ly, And then in the last place, this justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth
the wonder, That ever Jesus Christ
should desire and delight to dwell in such an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
Heart as thine, which from the beginning
hath been the Seat and Throne of Satan, full of
all uncleanness and abominations. O that ever
Christ should make an overture of love to such
a polluted Soul! That he should chose to erect
his Throne where Satans seat was! Look into
thine Heart sinner, and think what can Christ see
here to be desired? Thou knowest thy Heart
hath been a sink of sin, thy Conscience, like the
common shoar, into which all the filth of thy
life hath been cast; yet Christ passeth by thee, as
thou liest in thy blood and filthyness, and casteth
love upon thee, and desire towards thee, as it is
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6, 8. All these things put together make
it justly admirable and astonishing in our Eyes,
that ever Jesus Christ, the Lord from Heaven,
should become an earnest Suiter for union and
communion with the Souls of sinners.</p>

It were no less than a blasphemous imputation of

that Scripture, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. puts it out

cast out.</hi> I know guilt breeds many fears and
jealousies in the Hearts of sinners; will Christ
ever accept, and receive such a one as I? Try
him Soul, he hath said he will; let him have but

of them; he counts when he hath gained a

for the Salvation of them. Two things

                  <p>I. It is a marriagable Creature to Christ now,
capable of espousals to the Son of God; upon
which account it is Christ so earnestly seeks its
love, and sues for its consent: Now this is a
dignity beyond all other Creatures in Heaven or
Earth; no Angel in Heaven, no other Creature
but the Soul of Man on Earth, is capable of
espousals unto Christ; 'tis a dignity above that
of Angels, for Christ took not on him their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the Hypostatical union is the ground
and foundation of the Mystical union. They
are Members indeed of Christs Kingdom, and he
is to them a Head of dominion; but this honour
was never conferred upon Angels to be Members
of his Body, Flesh and Bones, as the Saints are,
<hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 30.</p>
                  <p>II. As the Soul is capable of espousals to
Christ on Earth, so it is capable of glory with
Christ in Heaven, throughout eternity, <hi>Iohn 17.
24. Father, I will that they also whom thou hast gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
me, be with me where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the glory which thou hast given me.</hi> It hath a
natural capacity of enjoying eternal Blessedness,
which the Souls of other Creatures have not.
And this will be the aggravation of Hell tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
that Men capable of the highest happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
should as it were receive that capacity in
vain; but that which constitutes an actual right
to the everlasting enjoyment of Christ in glory,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:109022:124"/>
is the Souls espousals to him here in the way of
Grace. Upon these two accounts it is that Christ
puts such a price upon them. Courts their love
so passionately, laments their loss so pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
and encourages his Ministers to all diligence
in perswading and woing them for him with such
abundant rewards, <hi>Dan. 12. 3.</hi> Know then your
own worth and dignity; neither pawn nor sell
so precious a thing as thy Soul, for any thing
Satan can set before thee by way of exchange
for it; <hi>What shall a Man give in exchange for his
Soul?</hi>

                  <p>Is Christ such an earnest Suiter for union with

                  <p>Some there are that labour to create jealousies

bring up an evil report upon Christ, and strict

consent to his terms: And that this is no ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less

hath openly declared as much; <hi>That he that
will come after him, must hate Father and Mother,

is what they must expect as the fruit of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent

Men have to answer, and how will they stand
before Christ another day, who are such profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
enemies to his Cross, and set themselves so
directly in opposition to the great design Christ
is driving on in the World! Is it not enough
that you will not enter your selves, but you will
hinder them that would? <hi>Matth. 23. 13.</hi> Thus
carnal Parents discourage their Children, one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
another. But to help Souls under this
discouragement, I will leave only this one Caveat
with them, <hi>That such seeming Friends are their
real mortal Enemies, their Words are poison to your
Souls:</hi> Satan hath feed them to do his Work;
hired their Tongues for his Service: But if the

fling off my Father and tread upon my Mother that
bear me, to go to Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Head also belong all those scandals
and offences which loose and careless Professors
cast in the way, to discourage others from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

nay, you your selves would become importunate

that is to say, Christ with his yoak of obedience,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:109022:127"/>
and Christ with his Cross of Sufferings, all your
debts to the Law are discharged and paid; what
have you been doing ever since you came into the
World but runing upon score to God, deeper,
and deeper every day? O what a vast sum owest
thou to his Justice? And not able to pay one far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
If thou consent not to Christs offer, the
Bailiff and Executioner, Death and the Devil,
will shortly be upon thy back, and hurry thee
away to that prison from whence thou shalt not
come out until thou have paid the last farthing,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 25, 26. If thou consent to Christs terms
thy debts are paid upon thy marriage day; thy

to them that are in Christ;</hi> and the reason is
given, <hi>vers. 4.</hi> in this, <hi>That the righteousness of the
Law is fulfill'd in us that believe.</hi> But how in us?
Certainly the meaning is not that the <hi>To credere,</hi>
the act of Faith doth, as it is, a work of ours,
satisfie the demand of the Law, and fulfil its
righteousness; no, but it apprehends the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
of Christ, applies it, and makes it ours,
and so <hi>the righteousuess of the Law is fulfilled in us
that believe.</hi> Is it an ease, is it a comfort to be
out of debt? Then embrace the offer of Christ,
for after thy espousals to him, the Law cannot
touch thee by any act of condemnation; it goes
to the Husband Christ, thou art discharged. Well
then, resolve what to do; shall the debt run on
and increase till Justice come to levy it upon you
in Hell Torments? Or will you accept of Christ
and the riches of righteousness that are in him,
and so be fully and finally acquited from all your
debts at once, and so be able to lye down in

advantages, and it certainly puts a great

               <p>3ly, Christ will not only pay all your debts,
and exalt you to a dignity above Angels; but in
that day wherein you cordially consent to his
terms, he will intitle you to the most glorious
inheritance purchased by his Blood; <hi>You shall be
heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Christ,</hi> Rom. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

to take Christ upon Gospel terms, I shall
thereby be intitled to all the glory that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
it shall be mine as truly as it is Christs:
'Tis true, the glory of Christ will in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
far surpass the glory of the Saints; he
will shine among them as the Sun compared with
the Stars; but yet the glory which God gave
him, that is, the communicable glory, shall be
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:109022:128"/>
truly theirs as it is his, Iohn 17. 22. The glory
which thou gavest me, I have given them. <hi>Tell my
Brethren (saith he)</hi> Iohn 20. 17. I ascend unto my
Father, and your Father; to my God, and your God.
This you shall gain also by closing this Treaty
with an hearty consent to Christs terms and
proposals.</p>
               <p>4ly, If you will consider and consent you shall
be presented by him to the Father, pure and
spotless, with exceeding joy and gladness in the
great day. This will be such a presentation of
your persons to God, as will make your Hearts
leap for joy, to read what the Scriptures speak
about it. This methinks should induce every
Soul, without further delay, to present himself,
Soul and Body, chearfully and willingly to Jesus
Christ. For (1.) Christ will bring you in the
great day to his Father, in the shining beauty of
perfect holyness, not a spot or wrinkle upon
your Souls, <hi>Ephes. 5. 27.</hi> The Blood of Christ
perfectly washes off every spot of guilt, for then
the Spirit of Christ hath perfectly cleansed the
Soul from all the desilement and filth of sin; so
that it shall come to God a pure and beautiful
Creature out of Christs Hand. (2.) This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation
will be made with greatest honour and
solemnity; we little think in what state and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
Christ intends to bring the poorest belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to his Father, <hi>Psal. 45. 14, 15. With joy and
gladness shall they be brought, &amp;c. So Iude vers. 24.
They shall be presented faultless, before the presence of
his glory with exceeding joy.</hi> Joy running over;
Joy upon all Hands; God himself will rejoyce
that ever he created such a Soul, as hath sincerely
bestowed it self upon Christ. Jesus Christ will
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:109022:128"/>
rejoyce that ever he shed his Blood for that Soul,
that now places his sole righteousness therein;
the Holy Spirit will rejoyce, that ever he came
with a commission from the Father, and the Son,
to draw such a Soul to Christ, who hath obeyed
his voice; the Angels will rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable,
<hi>Luke 15. 10. There is joy in the presence
of the Angels of God over one sinner that repenteth.</hi>
If the consent of any of your Souls shall be this
day gained to Christ, if the Word you have
heard this day shall send any poor Soul hence to
his Closet, or into a Corner, there to make his
Covenant with Christ, (for that's the way of
making up the match with Christ) in that hour
the news of it will be in Heaven, and excite joy
among the Angels of God; lay these and many
other Privileges together, which I want time to
mention, but the Scriptures will abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
you with them; and then consider what a
rich bargain, what an advantageous match Jesus
Christ is for your Souls.</p>
               <p>II. Upon the other-side cast up the account
what you may lose by your consent to be Christs;
and whether those losses be sufficient to ballance
or preponderate the gain that comes by such a
consent; that so your choice of Christ may be a
deliberate and full choice, and you may never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
afterwards of the choice you have made: It
is a rule in the Civil Law, <hi>Non consentit qui non
sentit;</hi> he cannot consent, that doth not think,
understand, and deliberate; and this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of so much flinching from Christ, and shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
apostacy in times of Persecution; Men did
not think of such sufferings and losses, they are
meer surprisals to them; to forelay all such oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:109022:129"/>
of offence; our Lord deals candidly and
openly with us, and tells us before Hand what
are the worst things that may besal us for his
sake, <hi>Iohn 16. 1, 2. These things have I spoken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you, that you should not be offended; they shall put
you out of the Synagogues. Yea, the time cometh that
whosoever killeth you will think he doth God service.</hi>
But, <hi>vers. 4.</hi> he adds, <hi>These things I have told you,
that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I
told you of them. q. d.</hi> Remember your selves in
times of Persecution, that all these things were
propounded, considered, and consented to; they
were the very terms you subscribed to me; had
you not liked them, you might at the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
damage and ruin of your immortal Souls
have refused and rejected them. Now, the
things you are to ballance with the gain of Christ,
must by you be'sorted into two Ranks.
<list>
                     <item>1. Things that <hi>must</hi> be parted with.</item>
                     <item>2. Things that <hi>may</hi> be parted with for
Christ.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. The things that you must part with, <hi>viz.</hi>
your Lusts, and all the vicions pleasures you have
had in them; how much profit or pleasure so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they have brought you in, away they must
go; they must be devoted to destruction, and
mortification, or you can have no interest in
Christ: You must shake Hands for ever with all
your sinful courses and companions, <hi>Rom. 6. 16.
His Servants you are to whom you obey.</hi> Be they as
pleasant and profitable, as your right Hand or
Eye, they must be pluckt out, and cut off, <hi>Matth.</hi>
5. 29, 30. Doth this sound harsh and unpleasant
to your Ears? Doth this cause the demur? O
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:109022:129"/>
consider, what it is to part with sin; it is but to
part with the Disease of your Souls, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
of your everlasting ruin; which of
you would not be glad to part with a Fever, the
Stone, or Dropsie? What is Passion, but the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of the Soul? What is a hard Heart, but a
Stone? What is Covetousness, and Earthly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness,
but the insatiable Dropsie of the
Soul? Now if Men would be glad to be rid of
such dreadful Diseases in their Bodies, and be
restored to Soundness, Ease and Health; how
much more should you be glad to be rid of your
Corruptions, and have the rectitude, ease and
pleasure of your Soul restored again? Yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of those impure, vicious, bruitish pleasures
you have taken in sin; you shall enjoy the pure,
divine, suitable, and everlasting pleasures of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness.
Consider now, and accordingly make your
choice, whether you will take the pleasures of
sin, which are but for a season, in exchange for
the everlasting joys which are at Gods right
Hand for ever.</p>
               <p>II. There are other things which you may be
called to part with, and give up for Christ; it
is uncertain whether God may actually call you
to part with your Liberties, Estates, Relations,
and Lives for Christ. Many are never actually
called forth to such sufferings; but because many
are, and every one of you may be so called, you
must reallize them, ponder them, and subscribe
those very terms, making full account of these
things as if they were now before you, <hi>Luke 9.
23.</hi> For so Christ hath propounded them; but
then with all, weigh these troubles with the gain
and advantages you shall have by them, and not
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:109022:130"/>
singly and alone by themselves; for so Christ
hath presented them to you, <hi>Matth. 19. 28. And
every one that hath forsaken Houses, or Brethren, or
Sisters, or Father, or Mother, or Wife, or Children,
or Lands, for my Name sake, shall receive an
hundred fold, and shall inherit everlasting Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, if you think such gainful troubles, such
Soul-enriching losses, be worth accepting for
Christs sake; then close the match with Christ,
and bring the matter to a conclusion: Do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fool
your selves with a fond and groundless pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
that these things will never befal you.
I fear many flatter themselves with such vain
hopes; the Lord knows how soon these supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
at a distance, may be turned into realities
before your Eyes: You have much reason to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
them, and much more to embrace them,
when ever Christ shall call you to them. This
is the great Work you have now to do; and
really you cannot safely demur any longer; this
matter must come to a conclusion, and the sooner
the better. For you know (1.) that your Lives
are immediately uncertain, and it is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
madness to let the great concern of
your Salvation lye one day or night at hazard;
your breath is continually coming and going, and
that which is going, must at last be gone, <hi>Iames</hi>
4. 14. You Souls hang over everlasting dangers
by the single thread of that feeble breath which
plays in your Nostrils, and every Disease, like
the flame of a Candle, held under that thread;
and can it either be safe or comfortable, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
so great a Work as this, upon which all your
expectations and eternal Blessedness depends?
(2.) Not only your Lives are hazardous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:109022:130"/>
but the enjoyment of the Gospel, and
all the opportunities and means of your Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
are as uncertain as they. 'Tis true, and
to the glory of God be it acknowledged, we
now enjoy the freedom and fulness of Gospel
mercies; but where hath God made any such
settlement of these blessings upon you as puts
the enjoyment of them out of hazard? The rain
is over, but yet the clouds may return after the
rain; we are upon our good behaviour, if it
bring forth the fruits of your Conversion, well,
if not, the Ax lieth at the root of the trees,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 10. And if God remove the Gospel
from among us, (as our delays and triflings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
him to do) then the Treaty is ended, and
there's little probability that any thing further
will be done betwixt Christ and you, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 25.
(3.) Bring this matter to an issue, with all due
speed, because you are not capable to give one
sound reason for a moments delay of so great and
weighty a concernment; can you be safe too
soon? Can you be happy too soon? Certainly
you cannot be out of the danger of Hell too soon;
and therefore why should not your close with
Christ upon the terms propounded, be your very
next work? For certainly if the buisness, the
main work and buisness of every Mans life, be to
fly from the wrath to come, as indeed it is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7.
and to fly for refuge to Jesus Christ, as indeed it is,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. Then certainly, all delays are highly
dangerous in such a buisness as this; the <hi>Manslayer,</hi>
when flying to the refuge City before the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of Blood, when his Heart was hot within
him, did not think he could recover the City too
soon; and now set all your own reason to work
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:109022:131"/>
upon this matter; put the case as really it is, I
am fleeing from wrath to come; the Justice of
God, and curses of the Law are closely pursuing
me; is it reasonable that I now sit down in the
way to gather flowers or play with trifles? For
such are all our other concernments in this
World compared with our Salvation. (4.) Bring
this Treaty to an issue with all due speed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
most Souls that perish, perish by delays;
Men think they have time enough before them,
and that to morrow will be as to day, and so
Satan gets part by part, what he had not confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to demand in the whole lump. Most that
perish under the Gospel, had convictions upon
their Consciences, and vain purposes in their
Hearts; but not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> them to a speedy exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
that was their undoing, <hi>Iames 1. 24. He
beholdeth himself and goeth his way, and straight way
forgetteth what manner of person he was.</hi> It is an
allusion to a Man that looks in the morning into
a Glass, where he discerns a spot upon his Face,
and resolves with himself, anon to wash it off;
but some diversion or other falls in, other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
take up his thoughts, and so the spot remains
all day, and he carries it with him to bed at
night. O these delays are the undoing of millions.
(5.) Delay not to close this Treaty with Christ,
because all delay increases the difficulty, and the
longer you neglect, the more will your Hearts
be hardned by the deceitfulness of sin, <hi>Heb. 3. 13.</hi>
Continuance in sin, and quenching of convictions,
do sensibly harden the Heart, and stiffen the Will:
Under the first convictions the Heart is tender,
the affections flowing, O if this advantage were
apprehended, and pursued, how soon might the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:109022:131"/>
work come to a comfortable conclusion! but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while those Soul-affecting words, Sin,
Christ, Heaven, Hell, Death, and Eternity will
become words of a common sound. (6.) And
lastly, Beware of delays in this matter because
you can never expect a fitter, and fairer oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
and season for the dispatch of this great
concernment than by the special indulgence of
Heaven you enjoy this day, <hi>2 Cor. 6. 1, 2. Now is
the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation.</hi> You
have now the Wind and Tide with you, if you
will not weigh Anchor now, you may lye Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
to your dying day; what advantages can
you reasonably expect, which God hath not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
you with at this day? You have the means
of Grace among you, you have liberty and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to attend on those means without fear. Say
not, I have such, or such troubles and encum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances
in the World; for you must never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
to be without them, except you only shall
find the World another thing than all others find
it; have you health? O what a precious season
and advantage is that! Art thou sick? O what a
spur is that! What is to be done must be done
quickly.</p>

            <div n="3" type="application">
               <head>III. Vse for Direction.</head>
               <p>But it may be some Souls will plead ignorance
that they know not how to manage and transact
so great a concernment with Christ, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
set not about it; and it is very likely there
may be much truth in that plea. For the help,
and assistance of such Souls, I will gather up the
sum of what hath been, and ought to be further
spoken about this matter, in the following Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:109022:132"/>
so that nothing but your unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and slothfulness, shall remain to hinder you.</p>
               <div n="1" type="direction">
                  <head>I. Direction.</head>
                  <p>First, If ever you bring the Treaty betwixt
Christ and your Souls to an happy issue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,
you must, as before was noted, sit down
and count the cost, <hi>Luke 14. 28.</hi> 'twill be in vain
else to engage your selves in the profession of
Religion; it is not Christs design to draw you
under a rash inconsiderate engagement, and so
to reap more dishonour by your apostacy and
hypocrisie than ever he shall have glory by your
Profession. No, he would have you to foresee
and seriously bethink your selves of all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
troubles and inconveniencies you may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
meet with for his sake. You are to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark
your selves with Christ and abide with him
in storms, as well as halcyon days; you must
follow the Lamb whether soever he goeth, <hi>Rev.</hi>
14. 4. There's no retreating after engagement to
Christ; <hi>If any Man draw back, my Soul shall have
no pleasure in him,</hi> Heb. 10. 38. 'Tis eternal death
by that martial Law of Heaven to run from
Christs colours in the day of battle. Well then,
retire thy self into the innermost closet of thy
Soul; sit quiet and patiently there till thou hast
debated this matter fully with thine own
thoughts; and hast ballanced the good and the
evil, the profits and losses of Religion; for
want of this the Church is filled with hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites,
and Hell with inconsiderate and rash Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors;
the more we deliberate, the better we

                  <p>Secondly, Having debated the matter over
and over in thy most sedate and serious thoughts,
let not Satan discourage thee from casting thy
Soul at Christs Feet with an hearty consent to all
his terms, for want of such and such qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
as thou canst not find in thine own Soul:
'Tis usual for Satan to suggest at this time, the
want of greater sorrow and humiliation for sin;
that the Soul hath not layen long enough under
the humbling work of the Law; that the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of its sins have been such, that there is
no hope of acceptance; free thy Soul from these
snares of Satan, by the consideration of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable
truth; That Christ expects from
thee no more humiliation than what produceth
such a hearty deliberate consent, as thy Will is
now to give; and such a consent once gained, no
aggravation of sin is pleadable against the duty
of believing.</p>

               <div n="3" type="direction">
                  <head>III. Direction.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, Distrust not the sincerity of Christ
in those gracious offers he makes unto coming
Souls. Be satisfied, he speaks his very Heart in
them to thee; the Devil labours to sow jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
and beget suspicions in the Hearts of poor
convinced sinners, that they will not find such
a welcom entertainment with Christ as he seems
to promise them, in those encouraging Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>Matth. 11. 28, 29. Iohn</hi> 6. 37. But that
something else lies hid in those Scriptures, as a
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:109022:133"/>
mystery which they understand not; and so by
shaking the assenting act, labours to hinder the
accepting act of Faith; this is a case as common
as it is sad; the Lord help poor Souls to avoid
this snare, lest in stead of honoring Christ by a
resolved adherence to him, they make him a
lyer and impute insincerity to the God of truth.
<hi>For he that believeth not, hath made him a lyer.</hi>

                  <head>IV. Direction.</head>
                  <p>Fourthly, Look up to God for power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
you to come to Christ in this supernatural
and difficult work of Faith. Dont think Faith is
of the growth of thine own Heart; <hi>No Man
can come unto me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>except my Father,
which hath sent me, draw him.</hi> There is a legal
Spirit working under Evangelical pretences in
many Souls; they look within them to find that
which is quite above them; the Apostle points
you to the fountain of Faith, in <hi>Eph. 2. 8. It is
not of your selves, it is the gift of God.</hi> 'Tis one of
the greatest difficulties in the World to believe:
For if the power of God must be owned as the
cause of every new degree of Faith, in the
greatest believers in the World, as is plain, <hi>Luke
17. 5. The Apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our
Faith.</hi> How much more is the production of
Faith it self, and the first vital act thereof, to be
ascribed to the Almighty Power of God?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="direction">
                  <head>V. Direction.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, Keeping thine Eye of Expectation
upon that Almighty Power, pray and plead with
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:109022:133"/>
the Lord assiduously, and importunately for the
exerting of that Power upon thy Soul; and give
not over thy Suit till thou feel that Power coming
upon thee: The time of believing is a time of
earnest pleading, thine own danger and necessity;
and the Spirit of the Lord improving them, will
abundantly furnish thee with Pleas, and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to enforce this Suit. Such as these,
(1.) Lord, I have thy call and invitation, yea, I
have thy command to encourage me to believe;
it is not presumption therefore in thy poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to come after thou hast invited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me; hadst thou not encouraged me, I
durst not have moved towards thee; Lord, whose
Word is it, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 23. is it not thine own?
This makes my Faith an act of obedience.
(2.) Yea, Lord, I have thy promise as well as
thy command, made upon no other condition
but my coming to thee; blessed Jesus, hast not
thou said, <hi>Iohn 6. 37. Him that cometh unto me I
will in no wise cast out?</hi> An invitation is much, but
thy promise is more. (3.) O my God I have
not only thy command making it my duty to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
and thy promise to encourage me to that
duty, but I have the examples of other sinners
that came unto thee long ago, and thou didst not
reject them; nor do I abuse those examples in
drawing incouragement from them, for it was
thy very design in recording them, that they
might be so many patterns to all that should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
believe on thee, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. (4.) O my
God I am shut up under a plain necessity, I have
no other way to take, thus stands the case with
me, I am beaten off from all other refuges,
there is no help for me in Angels nor Men, in
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:109022:134"/>
duties or self-righteousness, in thee only my
Soul can find rest. I am shut up to thee as to
the only door of hope, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23. here I must
speed or perish; my Soul is burthened and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
I know not how to dispose of it, but into
thy Hands; nor where to lay the burden of my
guilt but upon thee; if I miss here, I am gone
for ever. (5.) Lord I am willing to renounce
and abandon all other hopes, refuges and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
and to stick to, and rely upon thee only.
Duties cannot justifie me, tears cannot wash me,
reformation cannot save me; nothing but thy
righteousness can answer my end: I come to thee
a poor naked Creature, saying as the Church, <hi>Hos.
14. 3. Asshur shall not save us, &amp;c. for in thee do
the fatherless find mercy.</hi> Thus plead it with God,
and still remember you are pleading for Life,
yea, for your eternal Life.</p>

                  <head>VI. Direction.</head>
                  <p>Sixthly, Labour to make a resolved adventure
upon Christ amidst all those encouragements,
let the issue be what it will; resolve to venture
though you have not the least degree of assurance
that you shall be accepted and pardoned. This is
that brave and noble act of Faith which carries
the Soul to Christ, much as Hester came to the
King, <hi>Yet will I go in to the King, and if I perish, I.
perish, Hest. 4. 16.</hi> It pities me to think how the
saving act of Faith is grosely mistaken in the
World; the generality think it is enough for
them to believe that Christ died for sinners, and
therefore for them as well as any other; but you
see Faith is another matter: O there are great
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:109022:134"/>
difficulties and mighty wrestlings in the Work
of Believing; 'tis a great matter for a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced

                     </gap>ess, and amidst such manifold damps and
discouragements from Satan, to cast and adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
himself upon Christ, and that upon such
self-denying terms; but the pinch of necessity
will bring the Soul to this, for now it reasons
with it self as the <hi>Lepers</hi> did, <hi>2 Kings 7. 4, 5.</hi> If
we go to the Camp of the <hi>Assyrians</hi> we can but
dye, and if we abide here we must certainly dye;
thus here, if I sit still in the state of Nature and
still continue demurring and delaying, my damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is unavoidable, to Hell I must go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if I
cast my self upon Christ, I can but be rejected;
but he hath said, <hi>He will not cast out those that
come unto him;</hi> in this way of Faith there is a
possibility of Salvation, yea, there dawns from it
a strong probability; this therefore is my only
way, <hi>To him I will go, and if I perish, I perish.</hi>

                  <p>Seventhly, Never measure the grace of God,
nor the mercy of Christ, by the rule of your
own narrow conceptions and apprehensions of
him; but believe them to be far greater than
your contracted and narrow understanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents
them to you: Our casting of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
power and mercy of God into the mould
of our own thoughts, disfigures and alters them,
so that they look not like themselves, but with a
very discouraging aspect upon our Souls; by this
Satan keeps off many a Soul from coming to
Christ; the Lord knows how to forgive thee,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:109022:135"/>
though thou scarce knowest how to forgive thy
self, for the injuries thou hast done against him;
that's a very considerable Scripture to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in <hi>Isa. 55. 7, 8, 9. Let the wicked for sake his
way, and the unrighteous Man his thoughts, and let
him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him; and to our God, for he will abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither
are your ways my ways, saith the Lord. For as the
Heavens are higher than the Earth, so are my ways
higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your
thoughts.</hi> Man lies under a double misery, one
by reason of Affliction, another by reason of
Transgression; concerning both these, Gods
thoughts are not as ours, but far above what we
can think; either (1.) with simple cogitation <hi>(i. e.)</hi>
we cannot think such thoughts to others, under
misery in themselves, or under transgression
against us, as God doth towards as. Or (2.) by
way of reflexive comprehension, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
conceive what those thoughts of God are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
us, when we are under misery or sin just as
he thinks them; still his thoughts will be above
ours, as the Heavens are above the Earth; such
is the altitude of Heaven above the Earth, that
the vast body of the whole Earth is but a small
inconsiderable point to it; the highest Cedars,
Mountains, Clouds, cannot reach it; Gods
thoughts are infinite, ours finite; his thoughts
are continued, ours interrupted and at a stand;
his are immutable, ours changable; his are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitive,
ours discursive: therefore never measure
his by your own; the thoughts of pardoning
Grace in him, are rich, plenteous, and glorious;
but when our unbelieving Hearts have practised
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:109022:135"/>
upon them, they are quite another thing. Thou
saist how can such a Wretch as I obtain mercy?
Thou knowest not, but the Lord knoweth. O
if we could take in such a proper Idea, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of the mercy and goodness of God,
as he hath given of them himself, in <hi>Exod. 34. 6, 7.</hi>
this would bring you to Christ with much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.</p>

                  <p>Eighthly, Be not discouraged in the work of
Faith, though no peace or comfort should come
in by the first act of it: Nay, though there
should be an increase of trouble for the present;
the first saving act of Faith certainly puts you
into a state of peace, but it may not presently
produce the sense of peace; you may after you
have believed and really closed with Christ, meet
with some discouragements, which may make
you question whether Christ have received you or
no? Whether he have any love for your Souls
or no? Yet held on, whether comfort come or
come not; though Christ and comfort are insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
yet Christ and the sense of comfort are
not so; think not that all your troubles shall be
over as soon as ever you believe, because it is
said, <hi>Heb. 4. 3. We which have believed do enter
into rest:</hi> That Scripture speaks of a state of
rest, and not of the present or continued sense
of rest; the Woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in <hi>Matth. 15. 26,
27.</hi> did really believe in Christ, yet met with
sore tryals under the first act of her Faith; yet
this took her not off from the work of Faith,
but rather quickned and inflamed her the more;
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:109022:136"/>
she was glad of a word from Christ, and she ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
deeds. O but the words were discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>It is not meet to take the Childrens bread and
give it to Dogs;</hi> yet this beats not off her Faith,
the Dog belongs to the Family, and crumbs to
the Dog. <hi>O Woman,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>great is thy
Faith.</hi> If you resolve for Christ, you must not
be discouraged; a resolute Faith overcomes all
difficulties. You pray, you believe, and yet no
comfort; well, the vision of Peace is for an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
time, at the end it will speak and not
lye.</p>

taken away by the gracious extent of Christs

throughout the whole Gospel, that
Christ never made any objection against any Soul
that came to him upon the account of its sinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and unworthiness; but all the complaints of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:109022:138"/>
Christ are still upon the account of their unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingness;
so in his complaint over <hi>Ierusalem,
Luke 13. 34. I would, but you would not;</hi> so again,
<hi>Iohn 5. 40. You will not come unto me, that you might

In the stating of this Point, I shall
Doctrinally discourse these two things,
<list>
                     <item>1. What it is to be truly willing to receive
Jesus Christ.</item>
                     <item>2. How it appears that they who are so, shall
certainly be received and graciously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
of him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, What it is to be truly willing to receive
Jesus Christ. For this is meant by opening to
him; now this implies and involves in it many
great and weighty things.</p>
               <p>1. It implies and necessarily includes the right
understanding and true apprehension of Gospel
Terms and Articles: these must be known, pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
and duly considered, before the Will can
savingly open in an act of consent to Christs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.
I desire this may be especially observed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
multitudes are mistaken and deceived about
this thing; he that doth not consider doth not
consent; you must exercise your understandings
upon the Terms and Articles of Christianity,
or else your consent is rash, blindfold and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable,
this in <hi>Luke 14. 31.</hi> is call'd consulting;
the consent of Faith is the result of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
consultations and debates in the mind; the
Soul that comes to Christ must take up Religion
in his most sedate and serious thoughts; turn
both sides of it, the dark as well as the bright side
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:109022:138"/>
of Religion to the Eye of his mind; ballance
all the conveniencies and inconveniencies, losses
as well as gains. If I open to Christ, this I shall
gain, but that I must lose; I cannot separate
Christ from sufferings, Christ will separate me
from my sins; if I seek him, I must let them go;
if I profess Christ, providence will one time or
other bring me to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either Christ
or Earthly comforts must go; 'tis necessary
therefore that I now propound to my self what
providence may, one time or other, propound
to me; he hath set down his terms, <hi>Matth. 16. 24.
If any Man will come after me, let him deny himself,
and take up his cross and follow me.</hi> This self-denial
deserves serious consideration; for Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
it to natural Self, righteous Self, and civil
Self; and requires that I give up my Life, my Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
my Estate and Relations, my own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
as hard to be parted with as any of
the former. I must take up my Cross, that is,
the sufferings and troubles God shall appoint for
me, and which I cannot avoid or escape without
sin; and I must follow Christ, follow him whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
soever he goes. I know not what Religion
may cost me before I dye; all this it hath cost
others; and there is no bringing down Christs
terms lower than he hath laid them. I must
come up to them, they will not come down to
me; if I like them not as Christ hath left them,
the Treaty between him and me is ended, <hi>Matth.
10. 37, 38. He that loveth Father or Mother, more
than me, is not worthy of me: And he that loveth
Son or Daughter, more than me, is not worthy of
me: And he that taketh not his Cross, and followeth
after me, is not worthy of me.</hi> Where by worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:109022:139"/>
we are not to understand the meritoriousness
of these Acts; but the necessary qualification of the
Will, and due qualification of a comer unto
Christ; these previous consultations, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
in the Mind, prepare and enable the Will
to make a serious and well advised choice of
of Christ; and for want of this there are such
swarms of Hypocrites and Apostates in the
World.</p>
               <p>2ly, It implies such a sence of misery in us,
and of the necessity and excellency of Christ, as
determines the Will to the choice of him, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
all those difficuties and troubles
which have fallen, or can fall under considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and debate in the Mind; when the Soul sees
that in Christ which preponderates all suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
all losses, all reproaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termins
I will have Christ though I sacrifice all
that is dear to me in the World for him; this is
to be truly willing to open to Christ. 'Tis true,
the enjoyments of this World are understood by
Christians as much as other Men; they have a
feeling sence of the sweetness and comfort of
Earthly enjoyments; their Souls have as much
affection to the Body as other Men; they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the charming language of the World,
and their dear Relations in it as well as others;
only they see a greater necessity of Christ, and a
greater worth in Christ, than they do in these
things; you read, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 11. that in the famine
of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> they gave their pleasant things, for
meat to relieve their Soul; Jewels, Bracelets,
Gold, Silver, any thing for Bread; they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the worth of those things, knew the price
and cost of them; but away they go to preserve
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:109022:139"/>
Life. So 'tis here, no earthly enjoyment of what
value soever it be, hath such an excellency in it,
such an absolute necessity of enjoying it as Christ
hath.</p>
               <p>But, O saith the poor Soul,<note place="margin">Object.</note> who can do this?
I am willing to have Christ, and to come up to
every term he hath laid down in the Gospel; I
am willing to part with every sin, and to endure
any suffering for Christ; but, Oh, I tremble to
think, if it should come to a Prison, to a Stake,
to an actual separation from all the Comforts
and Relations I have in the World, what I shall
do for strength to go through such hard and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
work as this? Here's the great rub in the
way of many Souls, they find a willingness, but
fear the want of strength.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> How or where you shall find strength to
endure and suffer these things for Christ,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> is not
the question now before you. God will take care
for that, and it shall be given you in that hour, and
so others have found, who have had the very
same fears you have. I say, the question is not
whether you be able, but whether you be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
willing. Christ asks but your Will, he will
provide Ability; the greatest Believer in the
World cannot say I am able, to suffer this or
that for Christ; but the least Believer in the
World must say I am willing, the Lord assisting
me, to endure and suffer all things for his sake;
and this is the Second thing included in opening
to Christ.</p>
               <p>3ly, The Third thing which perfects, and
consummates the whole act, is an entire choice of
of Jesus Christ upon all those terms prescribed
by him; the entireness of the choice, without
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:109022:140"/>
halfing or dividing, excepting or reserving,
makes the consent full and effectual. There is a
twofold consent of the Will to Christ.
<list>
                     <item>(1.) One partial, and with exception.</item>
                     <item>(2.) The other entire, and without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. There is a partial consent which is always
hypocritical, defective, lame, and ineffectual;
thus the hypocrite consents to the offer of Christ,
he is really willing to have the pardons of Christ,
and the glory purchased by Christ; but to part
with his beloved lusts, and to give up his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyments, that his Will cannot consent to.</p>
               <p>II. There is a full and entire consent of the
Will, called, <hi>a believing with all the Heart, Acts</hi> 8.
37. Now this integrity and fulness of the Wills
choice, is that which closes the match betwixt
Christ and the Soul, and frees a Man from the
danger of hypocrisie. And there are three things
which make the consent to, and choice of Christ,
compleat and full.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When we give up all we are and have, to
him.</item>
                  <item>2. When we derive and draw all we want,
from him.</item>
                  <item>3. When we are ready to deny any thing for
his sake.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. We do then heartily consent to be Christs,
when we give up all we are and have, to him; so
that after this choice of Christ we look upon
our selves thenceforth as none of our own; but
bought with a price, to glorifie God in our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and Soul, which are his, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 19, 20. Soul
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:109022:140"/>
and Body is all that we are, and both these parts
of our selves do now pass, by an act of our own
consent, into the Redeemers right; we are not to
have the dispose of them, that belongs to him
that purchased them: You know in all purchases
property is altered; you did live as your own,
followed your own Wills, Lusts, Passions; were
under the dominion and at the beck of every
Lust; but now the case is altered, <hi>Titus 3. 3. We
our selves were sometimes foolish, disobedient, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
serving divers lusts and pleasures:</hi> So many
Lusts, so many Lords; but now the case is altered,
we have given our selves to Christ, no more to
be swayed this way or that, against his Word,
and the voice of our own Conscience: Thus our
Souls and Bodies are his, hallowed, dedicated
things to Christ; Temples for God to dwell in,
and then all other things follow of course; if I
am the Lords, then my time, my talents, and all
that I have is his.</p>
               <p>2ly, As we must give up all to Christ, so we
must derive and draw all we want from him; else
your choice of Christ is not entire and full:
God hath stored up in Christ all that you want,
a suitable and full supply for every need; and
made it all communicable to you, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 30.
Who of God is made unto us, wisdom and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
sanctification, and redemption.</hi> All the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
fresh springs are in Christ: Have I any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
buisness to do that requires counsel? Then I
must repair to Christ the Fountain of Wisdom:
Am I under any guilt? Then I must repair to
Christ for righteousness: Is my Soul defiled by
corruption? Then must I go to Christ for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification:
Do I groan under troubles of Soul
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:109022:141"/>
or Body, temptations, afflictions? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then
must I relieve my self by the Faith and Hope of
that compleat Redemption, and final deliverance
procured by Christ from all these: if you consent
to be Christs you must not look for Justification,
partly upon his Righteousness, and partly upon
your own Graces and Duties; but must make
mention of his Righteousness, even of his only.
If there be but one Conduit in a Town, and not
a drop of Water to be had elsewhere, then all
the Inhabitants of that Town repair thither for
Water. In the whole City of God there is but
one Conduit, one Fountain, and that is Christ;
there's not a drop of Righteousness, Holiness,
Strength, or Comfort to be had else where:
Then do we fetch all from Christ, when we live
upon him, as the new born Infant doth upon the
Mothers Breast.</p>
               <p>3ly, Then is our consent to, and choice of
Christ intire and full, when we are ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
give up, and part with any thing we have
for his sake; reckoning nothing to be lost to us,
which goes to the glory of Christ; how dear so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
our Liberties, Estates, or Lives are to us, if
the Lord have need of them, we must let them
go; thus you read, <hi>Rev. 12. 11. They loved not
their lives unto the death.</hi> These three things shew
saving Faith to be another manner of thing than
the World generally understands it to be; and it
is impossible for any Mans Will to open to, and
receive Christ upon terms of such deep self-denial
as these; until there be,
<list>
                     <pb n="239" facs="tcp:109022:141"/>
                     <item>1. A Conviction of our sin and misery.</item>
                     <item>2. A Discovery of Christ in his glory and
necessity.</item>
                     <item>3. The drawing Power of the Spirit upon
the Soul.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1. Conviction of our sin and misery makes
these terms of Religion acceptable; poor sinners
stand huckling with Christ, excepting and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
against his terms until the Lord have
shaken them by Conviction over Hell, made them
to see the dreadful danger they are in; and then
the next cry is, <hi>Men and Brethren what shall we do,
Acts 2. 37. q. d.</hi> Prescribe any means, impose
upon us the greatest difficulties, we are willing to
comply with them.</p>
               <p>2ly, Nor will Souls ever comply with these
terms of the Gospel until a discovery have been
made to them of Jesus Christ in his glory and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity;
when a Man feels his wants, and sees a
compleat remedy, his Will then complies and
bows, readily and freely; the convinced sinner
sees a full and suitable supply in Christ for all his
wants; a compleat Saviour in whom there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
defective, but in all respects according to
the wish of a sinners heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>3ly, To all this must be superadded the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
drawings of the Spirit; in the vertue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Will comes home to Christ, <hi>Iohn 6. 44. No
Man can come unto me, except the Father which hath
sent me, draw him.</hi> When these things are past
upon the Soul, then it hears Christs voice, his
powerful call, which breaks asunder all the ties
and bonds betwixt a Man and his Lusts; a Man
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:109022:142"/>
and his Earthly enjoyments; and without these
things the Will is unperswadable to comply with
the difficulties and severities of Religion. This
is the first thing, what the opening of the door,
or consent of the Will to receive Christ is.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next thing to be opened in its
order, is, How it appears that Jesus Christ will
not refuse to come into the Soul of any sinner, be
his sins or unworthiness never so great; when
once he is made heartily willing thus to embrace
and receive Christ upon his own terms? O sinner,
what good tydings are these to thy Soul, that
Christ will not disdain to be in union and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with thee, as vile as thou art, if thy
Will thus stand open to him! The tydings are
sweet, and I hope thou wilt find them as sure,
and certain, as they are sweet and comfortable;
when thou shalt have seriously perused and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the following Evidences.</p>
               <div n="1" type="evidence">
                  <head>I. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>The truth of this sweet assertion clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denceth
it self from the form and manner of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
invitations; they are designedly put into
large, general, free, and most extensive terms,
to assure sinners that Christ will not be shy of the
worst sinner in the World, thus made willing to
embrace him; they are so framed on purpose to
anticipate or take away all objections from sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
No other condition is put in the Gospel,
but this only, Art thou heartily willing to take
Christ upon his own terms? The offers of Christ
are extended to all that thirst and desire after
him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. 37. To the greatest of sinners,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:109022:142"/>
upon this only condition, that they be willing
and obedient, <hi>Isa. 1. 18, 19. Go Preach the Gospel
to every Creature: He that believeth shall be saved,
Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. 'Tis extended to all Nations,
<hi>For in Christ Iesus there is neither Greek nor Iew,
Circumcision nor Vncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
Bond or Free,</hi> Col. 3. 11. If there be any poor
Soul of any quality or condition whatsoever, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the cope of Heaven, whose Will is wrought
up to an hearty compliance with the terms of
the Gospel, Christ will not be shy of coming
into that Soul, though it have been never so vile
and abominable; the Heart of a <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
which had been an Habitation of Devils;
the Soul of a <hi>Saul,</hi> a Bloody raging Persecutor,
will make as delightful Habitations for Christ,
as the Soul of the most civilized person in the
World, when once the Will is thus opened.</p>

               <div n="2" type="evidence">
                  <head>II. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>The truth of this assertion further appears,
from the incouraging Promises made by Christ
unto all who are thus made willing to come unto
him: All the Promises, with one Mouth, assure the
willing sinner of a welcom with Christ; so doth
that glorious Promise to which so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Souls have been beholding, for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and help, at their first coming to Christ,
<hi>Iohn 6. 37, 38. All that the Father hath given me,
shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will
in no wise cast out. For I came down from Heaven,
not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent
me.</hi> Note here, (1.) That this is not a Promise
made to them that are already in Christ, that
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:109022:143"/>
they shall never be cast out by Apostacy, or fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
desertion; but it is a Promise made to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Souls, to such as are moving towards Christ
under great discouragements, fears, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings;
when a poor sinner looks to Christ,
sees his fulness and suitableness; and feels the
pinching need and want of him; Oh, saith he,
that I had an interest in him, though I should
beg my Bread in desolate places! But looking
into his own Heart, and seeing such an heap of
guilt and unworthiness there, then, saith he,
how can I think that ever Jesus Christ will come
into such a Heart as this? These are the persons
upon whom this Promise casts an encouraging
aspect. (2.) And because the fears of such poor
Creatures are double to the fears that others
have, Christ hath put a double negative into this
Promise, for the Souls encouragement; <hi>I will not,
not, in no case, or at any Hand cast out, such a
Soul as this.</hi> (3.) And to put all out of doubt,
he doth not only assure the Soul that he will not,
but condescends to gives it the reason why he
will not cast it out; for, saith he, <hi>vers. 38. I
came down from Heaven not to do mine own Will, but
the Will of him that sent me.</hi> As if he should say,
This was the very errand upon which I came
from Heaven; it was my great business to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
all that were made willing to embrace me;
for this I had my Fathers Commission, <hi>Isa. 61. 1.
To preach good tydings to the meek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to bind up the
broaken Hearted; and to comfort all them that mourn.</hi>
I cannot be faithful to the trust committed to me
by my Father, should I shut the door upon such
Souls: How can Christ comfort the Soul that
mourns, but by opening his Arms of mercy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:109022:143"/>
it? If Christ should say to a convinced
mourning sinner, hold thy peace Soul, I will
give thee Riches, Honors, and Pleasures in the
World; but as for me thou canst not have uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with me; I say, this would never comfort
the Heart of a convinced sinner; 'tis Christ, and
none but Christ can quiet it. Like unto this is
that Testimony and Promise, made on purpose,
for the incouragement of willing Souls, <hi>Acts</hi>
10. 43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witness, that
through his Name, whosoever believeth in him shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
remission of sins.</hi> This you see is a truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Testimony of all the <hi>Prophets,</hi> who
foretold what his gracious readiness to receive
poor broken Hearted sinners should be; and sure
they neither did, nor could conspire to deceive
the World: These gracious Assurances and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
cut off all pleas against Faith, from the
greatness of sin; and why should we except,
where God hath not excepted? Had Christ said,
all sinners of such a size and degree may come
unto me, but let all others stand back, the case
had been otherwise; but this Promise assures us,
all that are sincerely willing shall be truly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com
to Jesus Christ. Moreover, these universal
Promises take away all fear and doubt of presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption
in coming to Christ. That's the case of
many a poor Soul; I am affraid, I am running
out of despair into presumption; I doubt I am an
unbidden, and therefore shall be an unwelcom
guest to Christ. All this is prevented and cut off
by those sweet universal Terms, inserted on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
in these Promises for our encouragement.
That's the Second Evidence of this Truth.</p>

               <div n="3" type="evidence">

                  <head>III. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>The willingness of Christ to receive the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Soul, how many, and great, soever its sins
and unworthiness be, appears from the <hi>actual
grants</hi> of Pardon and Mercy, even to the vilest
sinners that ever were upon the Earth, when they
thus came unto him. Here you see how the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Free Grace rise higher and higher; an
Invitation is much, a Promise of welcom is more;
but the actual grants of Mercy is most satisfying
of all. Come on poor trembling Soul, dont be
discouraged, stretch out the small weak Arms of
thy Faith to that great and gracious Redeemer;
open thy Heart wide to receive him, he will not
refuse to come in; he hath sealed thousands of
pardons to as vile Wretches as thy self; he never
yet shut the door of Mercy upon a willing, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
Soul. It is a great matter to have the
Way beaten, and the Ice broken before thee, in
thy way to Christ. If thou wert the first sinner
that had cast his Soul upon Christ, I confess I
should want this encouragement I am now giving
thee; but when so many have gone before thee,
and all found a welcom beyond their expectation,
What incouragement doth this breath into thy
trembling discouraged Heart, to go on and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thy self upon Christ as they did? what an
Example have we in <hi>Manasseh, 2 Chron. 33. from
vers. 3. to</hi> 12. An <hi>Idolater,</hi> one that used En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments
and Divinations, familiar Spirits,
shed innocent Blood in the Streets of <hi>Ierusalem?</hi>
a Man might rake the World, and hardly bring
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o sight a viler Wretch, a greater Monster in sin
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:109022:144"/>
and wickedness; yet his Heart being broken, and
his Will bowed, this Man found Mercy. How
great a sinner was <hi>Mary,</hi> that came to Christ in
the House of <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Pharisee, Luke</hi> 7. 39. So
notorious a sinner, that <hi>Simon</hi> took offence at
Christ, for suffering so vile Wretch to come into
his presence. <hi>If this Man were a Prophet,</hi> saith
he, <hi>he would have known who, and what manner of
Woman this is that toucheth him; for she is a sinner.</hi>
Yet <hi>Maries</hi> Heart being broken for sin, and made
willing to accept of a Saviour; what a gracious
demonstration of welcom did Christ give her,
and to all other sinners a singular encouragement
in her Example? Once more, you have an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Example of the abundant welcom of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sinner to Christ, who owned himself for the
greatest of Sinners, a Persecuter, a Blasphemer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Injurious; but, saith he, <hi>I obtained Mercy, 1 Tim.</hi>
1. 16. And the Example of his gracious Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
with Christ, is recorded on purpose
for an encouragement unto all that should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
believe. How many thousands are there
now in Hell that never stood guilty of greater
enormeties than the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did; Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
Idolaters, Adulterers, Thieves, Covetous,
Drunkards, Revilers, Extortioners, such were
some of them; yet Sanctified, Washed, Justified,
in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of our God. If ever Christ would have shut
the door of Mercy upon any; if ever he would
have been coy and shy of coming into any Souls,
certainly these were the Souls he would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to come near. O what a demonstration
is here of that comfortable Point before us! That
Christ will not refuse to come into the Soul of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:109022:145"/>
vilest Sinner when ones it is made Heartily wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to open to him.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="evidence">
                  <head>IV. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>A further Evidence of this comfortable Truth
shall be taken from the <hi>Scripture resemblances</hi> of
the abundant Grace of God, and riches of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in Christ towards all broken Hearted and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
Sinners. There are some chosen resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances
and excellent Emblems, which bring down
the Grace of God before the very Eyes of Men;
amongst which I will single out three glorious
Resemblances of Free Grace, chosen by his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
on purpose for the incouragement of poor
drooping Sinners. A Resemblance from the
<hi>Heavens,</hi> a Resemblance from the <hi>Sun,</hi> and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
from the <hi>Sea;</hi> all such as the Wisdom
of Men and Angels could never have chosen for
such a purpose as this is.</p>
                  <p>I. A Resemblance from the <hi>Heavens,</hi> those
vast extended Heavens that cover and compass
this Earth; what an inconsiderable spot is the
whole Terrestrial Globe, to those high and all-surrounding
Heavens? and yet these Heavens
are not at so vast a distance above the Earth, as
the pardoning Grace of God is above the guilt,
yea, and the very thoughts of poor Sinners. For
of the pardoning Grace of God to penitent and
willing Souls, that precious Scripture speaks,
<hi>Isa. 55. 8, 9. Let the wicked for sake his way, and the
unrighteous Man his thoughts; and let him return
unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and
to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> O saith
the Soul, I cannot think God will ever have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:109022:145"/>
on such a Wretch as I, why saith he, <hi>vers. 8.
My thoughts are not your thoughts,</hi> and 'tis well
they are not; <hi>but as the Heavens are higher than
the Earth, so are my thoughts higher than your
thoughts.</hi> You cannot take the height, nor sound
the depth of my pardoning Grace. That's one
Emblem, from the unconceivable height of the
Heavens above the Earth.</p>
                  <p>II. Another is taken from the <hi>Sun</hi> in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
a Creature of admirable Power and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue;
you know that anon this part of the
World will be the Throne of Darkness, the
Sable curtains of the Night will be spread over
all the beauties of this part of the Earth, and
it may be in the Morning a thick Fog or Mist
will cover it; thick and dark Clouds may darken
the Heavens, but behold this glorious Creature
the Sun chasing before him the darkness of the
Night, breaking up the Mists and Fogs of the
Morning, scattering the dark and thick Clouds
of Heaven; they are all gone and there is no
appearance of them. Just so saith God, shall it
be with thy sins, and thy Cloudy fears arising
out of sin, <hi>Isa. 44. 22. I have blotted out as a thick
Cloud thy transgressions, and as a Cloud thy sins.</hi>
Thy Soul is beclouded, thy fears have bemisted
thee; so that thou canst not see the grounds of
thine encouragement; but my Grace shall arise
upon thee, like the Sun in the Heavens, and
scatter all these dismal Clouds both of guilt and
fear, and make a clear Heaven over thee, and a
clear Soul within thee. <hi>Vnto you that fear my
Name, shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under his wings,</hi> Mal. 4. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="248" facs="tcp:109022:146"/>
III. Another Resemblance you have from the
<hi>Sea,</hi> the great Abyss, that vast Congregation of
Waters, whose depth no line can fadom; Veer
out as much Line as you will, you cannot touch
the bottom. To this unfathomable Ocean the
pardoning Grace of God is also resembled, <hi>Mich.</hi>
7. 18, 19. <hi>Who is a God like unto thee, that pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the
remnant of his heritage? he retaineth not his anger
for ever, because he delighteth in mercy. He will
turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
subdue our iniquities, and thou wilt cast all their sins
into the depths of the Sea.</hi> If the loftiest Pyramid,
or highest Mountain were cast into the depth of
the Sea, it would never be seen more by the
Eyes of Men. God hath on purpose chosen this
Emblem of his Grace to obviate that common
discouragement of Satan taken from the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and aggravation of sin; and in that case
thou art to make use of them, and bless the Lord
for them; he never designed them for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to sin, but for encouragements to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Faith. That's the Fourth Evidence of
the Truth before us.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="evidence">
                  <head>V. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>The Truth of this Conclusion will also evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear, from the innate characters and
properties of the Grace and pardoning Mercy of
God towards penitent and hungring Sinners.
Now there are three glorious Characters of
Divine Grace, which do all assure such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
welcom to Christ, whatever they have
been or done; the Grace of God, shines forth
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:109022:146"/>
in Scripture in three illustrious Characters.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. As superabounding Grace.</item>
                     <item>2. As Free Grace.</item>
                     <item>3. As Grace exercised with delight.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>First, It is superabounding Grace; Waters
do not so abound in the Ocean, nor Light in the
Sun, as Grace and compassion do in the bowels of
God towards broken Hearted and hungry sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<hi>Isa. 55. 6. Let him return unto the Lord, and
he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he
will abundantly pardon.</hi> The compassions of our
God inserted that word on purpose to relieve
poor Souls fainting under the sense of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
iniquities. Here's abundant Pardon,
for abounding Guilt; and yet left a despond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sinner should not find enough here to quiet
his fears; the Lord goes yet farther in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression
of his Grace, <hi>Rom. 5. 20. Where sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded,
Grace did much more abound.</hi> It over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
all the bounds, it rose quite above the
high-water Mark of sin and guilt; but these
overflowings of Grace run only through that
channel of all Grace, Jesus Christ, to broken
Hearted and obedient Sinners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Grace of God to such Souls is
free, every way free; it is the very design of the
Gospel to exhibit it in this its glory. It costs you
nothing but acceptance, its free without merit,
yea, free against merit; you can deserve nothing
of God, therefore his Grace is free without me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
yea, you have deserved Hell, as often as
you have sinned against him, and so it is free
against merit. If a pardon were to be purchased
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:109022:147"/>
by us, we want a stock for such a purchase; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can we borrow from Men or Angels a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
sum for such a purchase: Blessed be God,
therefore, that it flows freely to us without money
and without price, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 2.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Grace glories in another property
also; which is very encouraging to the Soul of a
drooping sinner, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is the darling attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
which God greatly delights to exercise. The
tender Mother draws not out her aking Breast,
with such delight to her hungry crying Child, as
the Lord doth his Mercy and Compassion, to
broken Hearted and hungry Sinners; in this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
and in this property of it, his people
therefore admire him, <hi>Mich. 7. 18. Who is a God
like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and passeth by
the transgression of the remnant of his heritage? He
retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth
in mercy.</hi> You cannot put Jesus Christ upon a
more delightful imployment, than to bind up the
Wounds, and set the broken Bones of poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
humbled Sinners. Let every such Soul come
to Christ and welcom, for he greatly delights in
such imployments.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="evidence">
                  <head>VI. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>Such sinners need not doubt a welcom recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with Christ; for should he reject and turn
back such as these, then none can have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of his Blood; and consequently it must be
shed in vain, as Water spilt upon the ground.
The Blood of Christ is invaluably precious, and
it cannot be lost; it were a desperate impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Wisdom and Goodness of God to
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:109022:147"/>
think so; yet so it must be, if broken Hearted
and willing Souls be rejected and turned back
from him. There are but two sorts of Sinners
in all the World, <hi>viz.</hi> hardned and broken
Hearted Sinners; willing and unwilling Sinners.
The whole World falls into these two ranks; as
for impenitent, hardned, and obstinate sinners,
'tis certain they can have no benefit by the
Blood of Christ; they shall dye in their sins;
the Gospel cuts them off (so continuing) from
all expectation of pardon and mercy. Now
there is but one sort of Sinners more left in the
World, and they are convinced and humbled
Sinners, who are made heartily willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Christ upon his own terms; who stretch
forth the Hands of their desires to him, and
pant after an interest in him. Should Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
these also, who then shall receive the benefit
of his Blood? Did Christ dye in vain? Or can
the Counsels of Heaven prove abortive? No,
no; fear not therefore, to go to Christ thou
broken Hearted Sinner, thou poor panting, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Soul; fear not, he will not cast thee out.</p>

                  <head>VII. Evidence.</head>
                  <p>Moreover, for the encouragement of all such
Souls, mercy and pardon are designed by, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
upon the greatest and vilest of sinners,
to enhance and raise the glory of Free Grace to
the highest pitch. God picks out such Sinners
as you are, on purpose to illustrate the glory
of his Grace in and upon you; he knows you to
whom so much is forgiven, you will love much,
<hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. You that have done so much against

and obedience, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 9, 10. You will go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
others in service for God, as you have done
in sinning against him. All these things laid toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make up a full demonstration of the Point,
<hi>That Iesus Christ will not refuse to come into the Soul
of the vilest Sinner, when once it is made heartily
willing to open unto him.</hi> Which was the thing to
be proved; and now our way is open to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

                     <hi>that the greatness,

Christ upon Gospel terms.</hi> Let no sinner be
dismaid by the atrocity, and heynousness of sins
past, from coming unto Jesus Christ for remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and peace. I am awar what mischievous use
Satan makes of former sins, to discourage Souls
from the work of Faith, by heaping them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
he raiseth up a Mountain betwixt Christ
and the distressed Soul; but behold this day
Christ leaping over these Mountains, and skip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over these Hills. Could this objection be
rouled out of the way, sinners would go on in
hope; but certainly if God have given thee a
broken Heart, and a willing Mind, the greatness
of thy sin need not discourage thee from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.
For (1.) thou hast sufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from the sufficiency of the causes of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
whatever thy particular enormities have
been; there is a sufficiency in the impulsive
cause, the Free Grace and Mercy of God, <hi>Exod.</hi>
34. 6, 7. <hi>Micah 7. 18, 19. Isa.</hi> 55. 7, 8, 9. It is well
there is Mercy enough in God to heal and cover
all, and there is no less sufficiency in the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
cause of pardon, the Blood of Jesus
Christ, which taketh away all sin, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7.
1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 29. And it must needs be so, because it is
Divine Blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. Neither is there any
defect in the applying cause, the Spirit of God,
who hath already begun to work upon thy Heart,
and is able to break it and bow it, and bring it
home fully to Christ; and to compleat the work
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:109022:149"/>
of Faith upon thee with power; thou complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
thou canst not mourn, nor believe as thou
wouldst; but he wants no ability to supply all
the defects of thy repentance and faith. Well
then, if the mercy of God be sufficient to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the sin of a Creature; if the Blood of Christ,
the Treasures and Revenues of a King be able
to pay the debts of a Beggar; if the Spirit of
God, who works by an Almighty Power, be
able to convince thee of righteousness, as well as
sin, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 9. I say, if all the three causes of
forgiveness be sufficient, every one in its kind;
the first to move; the second to purchase; and
the third to apply; what hinders but thy trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
Conscience should go to Christ; and thy
discouraged Soul move onward, with hope, in
the way of believing, whatever thy former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormities
have been? (2.) If God raises glory to
his Name, out of the greatness of the sins he
pardoneth, then the greatness of sin can be no
discouragement to believing; but so God doth,
he raiseth the glory of his Name from the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and magnitude of the sins he pardoneth,
<hi>Ier. 33. 8, 9. I will cleanse them from all their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
whereby they have sinned against me; and I
will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and whereby they have transgressed against me:
And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise, and an
honour before all the Nations of the Earth; which
shall hear all the good I do unto them. And they shall
fear and tremble for all the goodness, and for all the
prosperity that I procure unto it.</hi> As a cure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
upon a Man labouring under a desperate
Disease; it magnifies the Physitian, and spreads
his Name far and near. The Devil envies God
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:109022:150"/>
this glory, and thy Soul this comfort; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
scares thee off from Christ, by the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
of thy sins. <hi>David</hi> was willing to give
God the glory of pardoning his great iniquities,
and with that very argument moves him for a
pardon, <hi>Psal. 25. 11. Pardon mine iniquitie, for it
is great.</hi> You see there are strange ways of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Scripture, which are not in use among
Men; this is one, <hi>Lord pardon my sin, for it is great;</hi>
he doth not say, <hi>Lord pardon it, for it is</hi> but a
small offence; no, but pardon it, because it is
<hi>great;</hi> and the greater it is, the greater Glory
wilt thou have in pardoning it: And then there
is another way of arguing for pardon in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which is peculiar; and that is to argue
from former pardons unto new pardons; when
Men beg their pardon one of another, they use
to say, I never wronged you before, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
forgive me now; but here it is quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise;
Lord thou hast signed thousand of pardons
heretofore, therefore pardon me again; such is
that plea, <hi>Numb. 14. 19. Pardon, I beseech thee, the
iniquity of this people, according to the greatness of
thy mercy; and as thou hast forgiven them from</hi>
Egypt <hi>even until now.</hi> (3.) As great sins, as
those that now stare in the Face of thy Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
have been actually forgiven to Men, upon
their humiliation and closing with Christ. Poor
sinners, under trouble of Conscience, are apt to
think, there is no sin like theirs. God forbid I
should diminish and extenuate sin, but certain I
am that Free Grace hath pardoned as great Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
as thou art, upon their repentance and
faith: What think you, had you had a Hand in
putting Christ to Death, would not that sin have
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:109022:150"/>
been as dreadful as any that now discourages
you? Yea, certainly, you would have thought
that an unpardonable sin; and yet behold that
very sin was no bar to their pardon, when once
they were pricked at the Heart and made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to come to Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36, 37, 38.
(4.) If it be the design and policy of Satan to
object the greatness of your sins, to prevent the
pardoning of them; then certainly 'tis neither
your duty nor interest to plead it to the same
end the Devil doth, to lay a confederacy, and
joyn with your mortal enemy in a plot against
the honour of Christ, and Salvation of your own
Souls; take heed what you do, seal not Satans
conclusions; do you think it is a small matter to
be confederate with the Devil? Certainly this is
his design, he magnifies your sins, on purpose to
discourage you from faith; while you were secure
and carnal, the Devil never aggravated, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minished
your sins to you; but now the Lord
hath opened your Eyes, and you are come near
to the door of hope, mercy, and pardon; now
he magnifies them; hoping thereby to ham-string
and lame thy faith, that it shall not be able to
carry thee to Christ. (5.) If thy sin be really
unpardonable, then God hath somewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
it in the Gospel grant. He hath some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
said, The Man that hath committed this
sin, or continued so many years in sin, shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be forgiven: but now in the whole Gospel
there is but one sin that is absolutely excepted
from the possibility of pardon, and that such a sin
as thy sorrows and desires after Christ, do fully
acquit, and clear thee from the guilt of; this sin
indeed is excepted, <hi>Matth. 12. 31. But the sin
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:109022:151"/>
against the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven.</hi> This
is that which the Scripture calls a sin unto death.
Let Apostate Professors, transformed into Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors,
Scoffers, and Haters of godliness and the
Professors of it, look to themselves; the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
symptoms of this sin seem to appear upon
such. But the humbled, thirsty Soul after Christ,
stands clear of the guilt of that sin. (5.) If
there were no forgiveness with God for great
sinners, then great sinners had never been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to come to Christ. The invitations of the
Gospel are no mockeries, but things of most aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
solemnity. Now such sinners are called and
invited under the encouragement of a pardon;
consult <hi>Isa. 1. from vers. 10. to 17.</hi> and see the
horrid aggravations of that peoples sins; and
yet at vers. 17, 18. you may read the gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations
of God, with conditional promises of
a plenary remission; so in <hi>Ier. 3. from 1. to</hi> 13.
what a sad Catalogue of sins, with their horrid
aggravations, do you find there? and yet it said,
<hi>vers. 12. Go and proclaim these words towards the
North, and say, Return thou backsliding</hi> Israel, <hi>and
I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you, for I am
merciful.</hi> (6.) If thy sins had not been capable
of remission, God would never have given thee
conviction and compunction for sin; nor have
drawn forth the desires of thy Heart in this
manner after Christ. He hath tact remission to
repentance, Acts 5. 31. a blessing to gracious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and hungerings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hope that when God hath given the one, he
will not long withhold the other. This very
wounding of thy Heart by compunction, and
drawing forth thy Will by inclination, shew that
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:109022:151"/>
remission is not only possible, but even at the door.
(7.) And lastly, Let this be thine encouragement,
(whatever Satan, or thine own Heart, suggests
to discourage thee) that great Sinners are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in the way of repentance and faith, to a
great Saviour, who hath merit enough in his
Blood, and mercy enough in his Bowels, to save
to the uttermost all that come unto God by him,
Heb. 7. 25. The Lord open to the Eyes of your
Faith, that rich Exchequer of Free Grace, <hi>Exod.</hi>
34. 6, 7. and give you a sight of that plenteous
Redemption, and forgiveness that is with God,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 130. 4, 7. that you may not at once cast re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
upon the most glorious Attribute of God;
impeach the precious Blood of Christ, and stab
your own Soul with a death-wound of desperati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
which is that the Devil designs, and the
whole strain of the Gospel designs to prevent.</p>

No Man can satisfie God by any thing himself

one debt cannot satisfie for another. Nor yet

Christ. Now to remove this great mistake, let
two things be considered.</p>
                  <p>1. That such a conceit as this crosses the very
stream of the Covenant of Grace, where nothing
is sold, but all freely given; this is the very Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Covenant of Works, fain we would
find something in our selves to bring to God, to
Procure his favour and acceptance; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
tells us we must come naked, and empty
handed; to be justified freely by his grace, <hi>Rom.</hi>
2. 24. We must be justified as <hi>Abraham</hi> was; who
believed in him that justifieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.
4. 5. But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him
that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for
righteousness.</hi> The meaning is, to him that worketh
not in a law sense, to procure pardon and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
by and for working. Go then poor sinner
unto God through Christ, and tell him thou hast
nothing to bring him; thou comest not to bring
but to receive. Lord, I am a vile sinner, I have
nothing to plead but thy mercy, and Christs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
This is the Spirit of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>2ly, By standing off from Faith for want of
these qualifications, you invert the setled order
of the Gospel; by puting consequents in the
place of antecedents, and antecedents in the
places of consequents; it is as if a Man should
say, If I were cured of such and such Diseases,
then I would go to the Phisitian; alas, could you
otherwise procure the healing of your corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
or the gracious qualifications you speak of,
you would have no need to go to Christ at all;
nothing is required of us in our coming to
Christ, but such a sense of, and sorrow for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

he will come into the Heart of the vilest sinner, and

                  <p>There are two things wherein the admirable
condescension of Christ appears. (1.) In taking
union with our Nature after sin had blasted the
beauty of it; this was a marvelous stoop indeed,
and justly admired by the Apostle, <hi>Phil. 2. 7. He
made himself of no reputation, and was made in the
likeness of Men.</hi> Yea, <hi>God sent his own Son in the
likeness of sinful flesh,</hi> Rom. 8. 3. But (2ly,) 'tis
justly admirable in our Eyes, that Christ should
also take union with our persons; and take his
habitation and abode in our Hearts, after Satan
and sin had so long inhabited and defiled them;
that he should accept those Members as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his service; that very Tongue to
praise him that had blasphemed him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet so
he is willing to do, and commands us to deliver
them up to him, <hi>Rom, 6. 19. As ye have yielded
your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity

Service, and he shall refuse so to do, how just and

thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he
will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he
will abundantly pardon,</hi> Isa. 55. 7. And as the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of such is just, so it will be inevitable;
for if there be no way to glory but by Christ, as
you know there is not, <hi>Acts 4. 12. Neither is there
salvation in any other.</hi> And if there be no way to
Christ but by our accepting him upon these very

the voice of Christ, who takes them all within

be, because the malignity of this sin exceeds the
meritorious and pardoning vertue of the Blood of
Christ; but rather because there is no sacrifice

appointed by the Lord for it. God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
that the Blood of Christ should be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory
Sacrifice for that sin; as the Apostle
plainly speaks, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6, 7. All other sins and

there is a vast difference found betwixt
them in the weight and aggravations of them.
Now I will labour to shew you by what rules Men
are to estimate the greatness and aggravation of
sin; and then to convince you that the greatest
of sinners stand yet fair for mercy, as well as the
lesser; and sometimes much fairer: <hi>Publicans and
Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 31. Now the rules to estimate
the aggravations and greatness of sin by, are
these,</p>
               <p>(1.) There be sins of infirmity, committed
out of weakness, and there are crying sins in the
Ears of the Lord; of the former sort, sins of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,
you read <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. where it is called an
overtaking in a fault; here's no premeditation,
nor deliberate consent, but a surprize; these go
not to the account of gross and heynous enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
called in Scripture crying sins, such as are
the sin of oppression, <hi>Hab. 2. 10, 11. The stones
shall cry out of the wall, aud the beam out of the tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
shall answer it.</hi> The meaning is, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:109022:155"/>
and oppression which Men have used in
raising their own Houses, shall cry in the Ears of
the Lord for vengance. The Stone in the Wall
shall say, I was digged out of the Quarry, hewen,
and layed here, by the unrewarded labours of
the poor <hi>Mason;</hi> and the Timber out of the
Beam shall say, I was hewn, squared and placed
here, by the unrewarded Hands of the poor <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter.</hi>
This is a crying sin; so also is the sin of
Murder, when our Hands have been defiled with
innocent Blood; this makes a dismal cry in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<hi>Gen. 4. 10. The voice of thy Brothers blood cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
unto me from the ground.</hi> A sin that makes an
horrid outcry in both Worlds at once; in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and in the sinners Conscience. Such also is
the sin of unnatural lusts; the sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> made
a cry which came up to Heaven, <hi>Gen. 18. 20. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the cry of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Gomorrah <hi>is great, and
their sin is very grievous.</hi> Compare these sins with
the sins of common infirmity, which come by
way of involuntary surprize, and what vast odds
will be found in the weight and aggravations of them?</p>
               <p>(2ly,) You find in Scripture a great difference
put betwixt sins committed against the clear shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
light of Knowledge in the sinners Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and sins of Ignorance which are committed
for want of Knowledge: Christ himself puts a
great difference betwixt them, <hi>Luke 12. 47, 48.</hi>
and so doth the Apostle, <hi>Iames 4. 17. To him that
knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is sin.</hi>
Sin with a witness.</p>
               <p>(3ly,) There are single acts of sin, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
or repeated acts of sin. Sins committed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Conviction, Promises, and Resolutions. Now
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:109022:155"/>
there is not so much of guilt in a single act of
sin, as there is in a repeated and continued
course of sin, called <hi>Deut. 29. 19. Adding of
drunkenness to thirst,</hi> and <hi>Isa. 30. 1. Adding sin to sin.</hi>
For as it is in numbring, so it is in sinning;
if the first figure be one, the second is ten, the
third an hundred, the fourth a thousand; and
every addition makes a greater multiplication.
O what a dreadful reckoning will here be for the
Consciences of poor sinners!</p>
               <p>(4ly,) Contrivers and studiers of sin are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
in Scripture placed in the first rank of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
The best servant God hath in the World
may be surprized by the deceitfulness of sin,
against the gracious bent and resolution of his
Soul; but the contrivance and plotting of sin is
quite another thing; therefore it is said of the
wicked, <hi>Iob 15. 35. They conceive mischief, and
bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</hi>
That is, sin like the <hi>Foetus</hi> in the Womb, hath its
time of conception, growth, and birth; and all
this by the deliberate consent of the naughty
Heart, and Will, which fosters and cherishes it.</p>
               <p>(5ly,) There are ring-leaders in sin, and
single personal sins which spread no farther than
our selves; a ring-leader in sin is in Scripture
reckoned amongst the greatest of sinners; so
<hi>Revel. 2. 14. Thou hast them that held the Doctrin of</hi>
Balaam, <hi>who taught</hi> Balac <hi>to cast a stumbling block
before the Children of</hi> Israel; thus <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the
son of <hi>Nebat</hi> made <hi>Israel</hi> to sin. There is the
same difference betwixt these and single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
sins, as there is betwixt a chain shot,
and a single bullet: Mind this, you that have
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:109022:156"/>
induced others to sin by your counsel or exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>(6ly,) There are sins in which men glory and
take pleasure, and sins for which men groan and
mourn. Now the more pleasure any man takes
in sin, the greater doth the sin arise in its aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
We read of some, <hi>Iob 20. 12.</hi> in whose
mouths <hi>wickedness is sweet, and they hide it under their
tongue:</hi> that is, they draw a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
delight before and after the commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of sin, as well as in the commission of it.
'Tis bad enough to sin and sigh, to sin and weep;
but to sin and boast, to sin and make a mock of
sin, what a prodigious way of sinning is this? O
Sinner, what an heart hast thou, that canst play
and sport with that which grieves God, crucified
Christ, and with without deep and sound Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
will damn thine own Soul!</p>
               <p>(7ly,) The more Bonds of Restraint any man
breaks asunder to commit sin, the greater, and
more aggravated always that sin is in the sight of
God. There be some persons upon whom God
hath laid more bonds of restraint to keep back
their souls from iniquity, than he hath upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The more mercies he hath bestowed upon
you, the more restraints from sin. So many
mercies, so many tyes, <hi>Ier.</hi> 2. 5, 6. especially spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
mercies; as light in your minds, pardons
sealed to your consciences, love manifested to your
souls. Such also are your own Vows, Promises
and Resolutions; <hi>Ier. 2. 20. Thou saidst, I will
no more transgress.</hi> Didst not thou promise me,
saith God, more care and circumspection for time
to come? And such are all the Examples and
Warnings God hath given us, by his Judgments
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:109022:156"/>
upon others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. These things put an
Accent upon sin, and make it out of measure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
               <p>And now my Friends, what have have I been
driving at all this while, in opening the greatness
and aggravations of sin? The design of all this
is to shew you the indispensible need of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Faith to carry you to Christ.</p>
               <p>But I am the person upon whom these crying
aggravated sins are found.<note place="margin">Object.</note> you tell me of going
to Christ; alas, there is no hope of mercy for
such a wretch as I am. There it sticks. Poor
sinners think 'tis to no purpose, they had as good
go on in sin, for they conclude there's no hope
for them.</p>
               <p>Come sinners, give me leave to tell you, you
have a Text before you, that the clears the way
of your duty and salvation at once.<note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
                  <hi>If any man,</hi>
be he what he will, be his sins never so great, yet
if <hi>he hear my voice, and open the door, I will come
into him,</hi> saith Christ. There is mercy in Jesus
Christ for thee who art guilty of crying sins: For
thee, that hast added sinned against light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
For thee, that hast drunkenness to
thirst: For thee, that hast contrived sin with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation:
For thee, that hast induced others to
sin by counsel or example: For thee, that hast
taken pleasure in iniquity, and made a sport of
sin: Yea, and for thee also, that hast broken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder
the bonds of mercies, vows and warnings,
provided thou wilt now hear the voice of Christ,
and thy Will open to him with an hearty firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 4. You are great and heinous sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
but I shew this day a Great and Almighty
Saviour: One that is able to save to the utmost all
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:109022:157"/>
that come unto God by him. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 25. There
is a Sacrifice laid out and appointed for these sins.
O bless God for that. They are no where ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
from the possibility of forgiveness. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the impenitency of thy heart, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
of thy Will, can bar thee from a full and
final pardon. Jesus Christ can save thee to the
uttermost. Say not within thy self, Can the
virtue of his Blood extend it self to the remission
of this or that sin? He can save to the uttermost.
Look round about thee to the uttermost <hi>Horizon</hi>
of all thy guilt, and Christ can save thee to the
uttermost, that the Eye of thy Conscience can
discern, yea and beyond it too; but then thou
must come unto him. You speak of the greatness
of sin, and you have cause to have sad thoughts
about it; but in the mean time you consider not,
that your Unbelief, by which you stand off from
Christ your only Remedy, is certainly the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of all the sins that ever you stood guilty of
against the Lord. This is the sin that binds the
guilt of all your other sins upon you. Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
address my self, (1) To you who cry out of
the greatness of sin, and that discourages you
from going to Christ: (2) To lesser sinners, who
because they are clear of great Enormities, see
not their need of Christ.</p>
               <p>1. This Exhortation speaketh to you whose
Consciences are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eared with the horrid and hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
aggravations of your sins, by reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
your own misgiving hearts, assisted by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
of Satan, discourage you from all Attempts
to gain Christ and Pardon in the way of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Faith. Let me at this time hint three
or four Considerations to you by way of Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:109022:157"/>
(1) The sparing goodness of God till now,
gives some encouragement that God may have a
reserve of mercy for so great and vile a sinner as
thou art. O what a mercy is it that thy life
hath been spared hitherto! Many of thy Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
in sin are beyond hope and mercy, whilst
thou art left. I confess this is no sure sign of Gods
gracious intention to thee, unless the goodness
and forbearance of God did lead thee to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
then the gracious intention of God in
prolonging thy life would evidently appear. But
however, it is in it self a very great mercy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
without it no spiritual mercy could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>(2ly,) 'Tis matter of encouragement and hope,
That though your Disease be dreadful, yet it is
not desperate and incurable. The Text takes it
within the compass of mercy: O bless God for
that, <hi>If any man,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>(3ly,) As great sinners as you have been have
found mercy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 16. and God would have
it to be recorded for your encouragement. If
now the Lord shall make thy heart to break, and
thy Will to bowe, whatever thy sins have been,
they shall not bar thee from mercy and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
But if thou resolve to go on in sin, or sit
down desponding or discouraged, and wilt not
come in at the Invitation and Call of Christ,
then thy wound is incurable indeed; and there is
but one way with thee, thy <hi>Mittimus</hi> is already
made for Hell; and that Scripture in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9.
will tell thee whither thou art going. But God
forbid that this should be the Issue of Christs gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
invitations to thee, and forbearance of thee.
Seeing mercy is tendred to any man that will
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:109022:158"/>
accept it upon Christ's terms, exclude not thy self
when he hath not excluded thee.</p>
               <p>2. I will close up this Use of Exhortation to
another sort of persons who are not of the noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
infamous rank of profane Sinners, but their
lives have been drawn more smoothly through a
course of Civility. These have as great need to
be prest to Repentance and Faith as the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious
Sinners in the world. These are a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
that bless themselves in their own eyes, and
thank God with the <hi>Pharisee, Luke 18. 11. That
they are not as other men.</hi> They acknowledge Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
to be the duty of the profane; that such
Sinners as I last dealt with, stand in apparent need
of it: But as for themselves, they scarce know
where to find matter for Repentance, nor do they
feel any need of Christ. Now I would lay three
Considerations before such persons, to convince
them that their Case is as sad and hazardous, yea,
and in some respect more hazardous than the state
of the most notorious Sinners in the world; and
that a Change must also pass upon them, or else
<hi>it had been good for them they had never been born.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I. <hi>Consideration.</hi> Let the civilized part of the
world lay this thought close to their hearts, That
though their sins be not so gross and horrid to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
as other mens are, yet continued in, they
will prove as mortal and destructive, as those
greater Abominations of other men. No sin ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
considered is small. Every sin is mortal
and damning without Christ; <hi>Rom. 6. ult. The
wages of sin is death.</hi> 'Tis no great odds, if a
man be killed, whether it were by a broad Sword,
or by a small Penknife. The least sin violates the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:109022:158"/>
whole Law, <hi>Iames 2. 10. He that offendeth in one
point is guilty of all.</hi> The least transgression of
the Law, pulls down the guilt and curse of the
whole Law upon the Sinners head. And this is
your misery that are out of Christ, and stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the rigorous terms of the first Covenant.
Moreover, the Law of God is violated grosly, and
externally, or spiritually, and more internally.
Thus every unchast thought is Adultery: And the
very inward burnings of Malice and Anger in the
heart is Murther. Now if the Lord shall bring
the spiritual sense of the Law home to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
as he did to <hi>Paul</hi>'s, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. You will
certainly give up that plea, that you have not so
much need of conversion as other Sinners have.
There are sins of greater infamy, and sins of deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
guilt. There may be more guilt in those sins
that are stifled in thy heart, and never defamed
thee, than there may be in some sins that make a
louder noise in the world.</p>
               <p>II. <hi>Consideration.</hi> You are guilty of one sin (how
civil and blameless soever your lives are) which
is certainly more great and heinous than any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
act of sin can ordinarily be, and that is,
your trusting to your own Righteousness, as the
<hi>Pharisees</hi> did, <hi>Luke 18. 9. He spake this Parable unto
certain which trusted in themselves that they were righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous,
and despised others.</hi> Here's an Idol of Jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
set up in the room of Christ: 'Tis true, this
sin makes not so loud a noise in the world, raises
not such a dust, as the sins of prophane ones do.
But certainly it is as abominable in the eyes of
God, as the sins that stink so much in the nostrils
of Nature. Civilized persons thus trusting to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:109022:159"/>
their own civility, and neglecting Jesus Christ,
will be one day put into the Van of that wretched
Crue that are going to Hell; a <hi>portion with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
as the Scripture speaks.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>Consideration.</hi> Lastly, It hath been always
found a more rare and difficult thing, to convince
and bring home to Christ the civilized part of the
world, than it is to convince and work upon the
prophane part of it, <hi>Matth. 21. 31. Publicans
and Harlots go into the Kingdom of God before you.
Publicans</hi> were reckoned the vilest sort of men,
and <hi>Harlots</hi> the worst sort of women; yet either
of these were easier to be brought to Christ, than
self-righteous <hi>Pharisees.</hi> Well then, away with
your vain and idle pretensions, that your Case is
safer and better than others. By what hath been
said, it evidently appears that you stand in as
much need of Christ as the most infamous Sinners
in the world do.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="3" type="application">
               <head>III. Vse.</head>
               <p>This point winds up in encouragement to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
willing and obedient soul whom the Lord shall
perswade to comply with the Call of the Gospel,
whatever his former Rebellions have been. There
are some whose hearts the Lord hath touched with
a deep sense of their sin and misery, and of the
all-sufficient remedy that is in Christ; but the sense
of former rebellions appals and daunts them, they
cannot hope for acceptance with him. Here's
good news for such souls; Christ is at the door,
and former Rebellions are no barr to him, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
there be now a hearty compliance with his
voice, <hi>I will come in to him.</hi> A glorious promise,
comprising five inestimable benefits or mercies in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:109022:159"/>
it. (1.) This is the most glorious work of God
that ever was wrought, or can be wrought in this
world, upon the heart of a poor sinner, to open
it by Repentance and Faith, and put Christ into
the full possession of it.</p>
               <p>The power of all the Angels in Heaven, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
on Earth, Duties and Ordinances cannot
effect this; this is the peculiar work of God,
1. <hi>Cor. 1. 30. But of him are ye in Christ Iesus.</hi>
Look, as it was the marvellous work of God to
unite our Nature unto Christ by an <hi>Hypostatical</hi> U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
so it is no less a marvellous work of God to
unite our persons to Christ by a <hi>Mystical</hi> Union,
to prepare the soul as an habitation for Christ,
and give him the possession of it. (2.) This
Coming of Christ into the Soul is the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of all our Hopes for Glory; till this be
done, we are without hope. But in the same hour
Christ comes in to the Soul, a solid Foundation
of the hopes of Glory is laid in that Soul, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.
27. <hi>Which is Christ in you the hope of Glory.</hi> I know
the unregenerate World is full of hope, but their
hopes are built upon that Sand. Union with Christ
is the steady foundation on which the hopes of
Heaven are laid. (3.) <hi>I will come in to him,</hi> that
is, to dwell in his soul for ever, never to leave
him more: Therefore (<hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 17.) he is said to
<hi>dwell in our hearts by faith;</hi> not sojourn for a
night, but abide there for ever: Nothing can se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
Christ and that Soul, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 35. Thy Soul
shall never be an habitation for Satan any more.
When Christ comes in, he saith, as of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<hi>Here will I dwell for ever.</hi> (4.) This Coming
in of Christ intitles the Soul to all Spiritual Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges;
1 <hi>Iohn 5. 12. He that hath the Son hath
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:109022:160"/>
life:</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor. 3. ult. All is yours, for ye are
Christs.</hi> (5.) This is the highest honour that
ever God put upon a Creature. I will come in
to him. O how should the Soul feel it self advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by such an honour as this! What, to be the
living Temple of Jesus Christ! for Christ to dwell
and walk in thy Soul! as it is 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. I tell
you this is an honour beyond and above the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
done to Angels.</p>
               <p>And how near art thou to all these blessed Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
in the day that thy heart is wounded for
sin, thy thoughts become solicitous about union
with Christ, and thy Will begins to bowe, and
yield, after a serious debate of the terms of the
Gospel in thy most solemn thoughts! Now is the
door half-open, and Christ ready to make his
first entrance into thy Soul. God forbid any thing
should now hinder the compleating of so great a
Work.</p>

            <p>IN the former Sermon Christs free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
invitation to sinners hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered;
in the next place, we are to
take into consideration the principal
means or instrument by which the Heart
of a sinner is opened to receive Christ; and that
is not by the native power of his own Will, nor
by the alone efficacy of the Gospel preached,
but by <hi>the voice of Iesus Christ,</hi> which opens the
Will, and makes the perswasions of the Gospel
effectual. <hi>If any Man hear my voice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hearing is either <hi>External,</hi> or <hi>Internal;</hi> for
the Soul hath its Ears, as well as the Body. <hi>He
that hath an Ear let him hear, what the Spirit saith
unto the Churches,</hi> Rev. 2. 17. (<hi>i. e.</hi>) He that hath
a <hi>Spiritual Ear,</hi> to perceive and judge the voice of
the Spirit by; and it is a sore Judgment when
God denies such an Ear to the Soul, <hi>Isa. 6. 9. Go
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:109022:161"/>
tell this people, hear ye indeed, but understand not.</hi>
Spiritual hearing is the Work of the inner Man.
And though we have many <hi>Auditors,</hi> yet in this
sense no more hearers than believers; words of
sense do in Scripture connote affections. This
hearing of Christs voice implies not only the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
of the sound of the Gospel into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
organ; but it notes the work of the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi>
which by the Ear trieth words, as
the Mouth tasteth meat, <hi>Iob</hi> 12. 11. And the
work of the <hi>affections;</hi> which receive the truth
in love, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 10. It also implies the <hi>obedience</hi>
of the Soul to what we hear. We cannot be said
in this sense to hear, what we obey not. Our
minds may be delighted with the pleasant air and
melody of the Gospel, and yet it is all one as if
we heard it not, when obedience doth not follow
hearing, <hi>Ezek. 33. 32. Thou art unto them a very
lovely son,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for they hear thy words, but they do
them not;</hi> but in this place it especially signifies
the <hi>vital sound of Christs efficacious internal voice,</hi>
which is the principle of Spiritual Life to the
Souls of dead sinners; according to that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Christ, <hi>Iohn 5. 25. Verily, verily, I say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you the hour is coming, and now is; when the dead
shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that
hear shall live.</hi>

Now touching this Almighty Spiritual voice
of Christ, by which the Hearts of sinners are ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
opened; Six things must be opened in
order.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The divers sorts and kinds of Christs voice.</item>
                  <item>2. The general Nature of this internal voice.</item>
                  <item>3. The innate characters and special proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it.</item>
                  <item>4. The objects to whom it is directed.</item>
                  <item>5. The motives inducing Christ to speak to
one, and not to another.</item>
                  <item>6. The special effects wrought and sealed by
it upon every Soul that hears it.</item>
               </list>
               <p>First, We will speak of the divers sorts and
kinds of Christs voices. I am here only concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about two, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. His External.</item>
                  <item>2. His Internal voice.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. There is an <hi>External voice of Christ,</hi> which
we may call his Ministerial voice in the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Gospel; the Scriptures are his Word,
and Ministers his Mouth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 19. He that
heareth them, heareth Christ.</p>
               <p>2ly, There is also an <hi>Internal energetical voice
of Christ,</hi> consisting not in sound, but power:
And betwixt these two, there are two remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
differences. (1.) The External or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial
voice of Christ, is but the Organ or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of conveying his Internal and Efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
voice to the Soul; in the former he speaks to
the Ear, and in, or by that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound conveys his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:109022:162"/>
Spiritual voice to the Heart. (2ly,) The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
voice is evermore ineffectual and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,
when it is not animated by this Internal
Spiritual voice; it was marvellous to see the
walls of <hi>Iericho</hi> falling to the ground at the sound
of Rams-horns; there was certainly more than
the force of an external blast, to produce such
an effect; but more marvellous it is, to see at
the sound of the Gospel, not only the weapons
of iniquity falling out of sinners Hands, but the
very enmity it self out of their Hearts. Here
you see is a voice in a voice, an Internal efficacy
in the External sound; without which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
makes no saving impression.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This Spiritual voice of Christ must
be considered in its general Nature, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
two things in it,
<list>
                     <item>1. Almighty Efficacy,</item>
                     <item>2. Great Facilty.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. Almighty Efficacy, to quicken and open the
Heart with a word. O what manner of voice is
this, which carries such a vital power along with
it! In all the mighty works of Christ, his power
was still put forth in some voice, as at the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11. 43. <hi>He cryed with a
loud voice, Lazarus come forth; and he that was
dead came forth.</hi> So in the curing of the deaf
Man, <hi>Mark 7. 34. He saith unto him</hi> Ephphathai,
<hi>and straight way his Ears were opened.</hi> Thus in the
exerting of his Almighty glorious power in
quickning, a Soul Spiritually dead, and opening
the Heart that was lockt up by ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief;
an Internal Almighty Efficacy passeth
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:109022:162"/>
from Christ, along with the voice of the Gospel,
to effect this glorious work upon the Soul; an
Emblem where of we have in <hi>Ezek. 37. 9, 10. Then
said he unto me, Prophesie unto the wind, prophesie,
Son of Man to the wind, saith the Lord God; Come
from the four winds, O breath, and breath upon
these slain, that they may live. So I prophesied as he
commanded me, and the breath came into them, and
they lived and stood up upon their Feet, an exceeding
great Army.</hi> The animating vital breath which
quickned the dead, came in or with the four
winds of Heaven; as this Almighty power of
Christ doth with the sound of the Gospel; and
before it the Heart opens, the Will bows, <hi>Psal.
110. 3.</hi> Man can no longer oppose the power of
God; Man and Man stand upon equal ground;
the power of Man can repel the power of a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
creature; but when the power of Christ
comes along with the voice of Man, there is no
more power to resist.<note n="*" place="margin">Clamor hic est pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satio; signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata a Deo injecta, ad monendam peccatoris conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am;id Deus aliquandiu facit, non semper.</note> This voice of Christ
then, of which the Text speaks,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pools Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nops.</hi> in loc.</note> is an Almighty
impression made upon the Soul of a sinner from
Heaven; which is to that Soul in stead of a voice;
and as fully expressive of Gods mind concerning
it, as any Articulate voice in the World can be.
It is a beam of light shining immediately from
the Spirit, into the Soul of a sinner; as plainly
and evidently discovering both its danger and
duty, as if a voice from Heaven had declared
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thus it is said, <hi>Isa. 8. 11.</hi> The Lord spake
to <hi>Isaiah</hi> with a strong Hand, that is, by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
impression upon the Prophets Spirit, which
was as a voice to him; thus here, the Lord not
only directs a suitable word to a sinners con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
but also impresses it with such a strong
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:109022:163"/>
Hand upon his Heart, as leaves no doubt behind
it, but that it was the Lord himself that spake
to his Soul; this is Christs way of speaking by
his Spirit, to the inner Spiritual Ear of the Soul;
not by Oraculous voices, which I take to be but
the suppositions of an overtroubled fancy; but
by an efficacious impression upon the Heart. As
to Oraculous voices, we may sooner meet Sata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
delusions, than Divine illuminations in that
way. The Learned <hi>Gerson</hi> speaks of a good
Man who being in Prayer seemed to hear such a
voice as this; <hi>I am come in person to visit thee, for
thou art worthy;</hi> but he justly suspecting a delusion
of Satan, shut his Eyes and said, <hi>Nolo hic videre
Christum,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will not see Christ here, it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
me to see him in glory.</hi> I am sure Christs voice
in the written Word is more sure than a voice
from Heaven, 2 <hi>Pet. l. 1. 9.</hi> This inward Spiritual
impression is Christs effectual call from Heaven;
and it is a voice <hi>sine strepitu Syllabarum,</hi> without
sound or syllable.</p>
               <p>II. As this voice of Christ implies Almighty
efficacy, so it implies in like manner the <hi>facility</hi>
of conversion unto Christ; he can do it easily
with a word of his Mouth; as in the bodily cures
performed by him in the days of his flesh, how
suddainly and easily did Christ effect them? <hi>Speak
the word only,</hi> said the <hi>Centurion, and my servant
shall be healed.</hi> Thus let the Spirit but speak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally
to the deadest Soul and it lives. <hi>Elijah</hi>
did but cast his mantle upon <hi>Elisha,</hi> as he was
plowing in the Field, and he presently entreats
the <hi>Prophet</hi> to give him leave to go home and bid
his friends farewel, and he would follow him;
thus it is here, let a beam of saving light shine
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:109022:163"/>
from the Spirit into a Mans Heart, let an effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
impression be made upon his Soul, and he is
presently made willing to quit and give up his
dearest lusts and interests, and to imbrace Christ
upon the severest terms of the Gospel. Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
is too difficult a work for Angels or Men to
effect in their own strength; but Christ can do it
with a word. And thus much of the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Christs Spiritual Internal voice; but all
this gives us but a remote imperfect knowledge
of it: Therefore</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I shall endeavour to open the innate
characters and special properties of this Internal
Spiritual voice of Christ, which must be heard, or
there can be no opening the door of the Heart to
receive him.</p>
               <div n="1" type="character">
                  <head>I. Character.</head>
                  <p>And the first Character is this, It is a <hi>secret</hi> and
a <hi>still</hi> voice; whereby somewhat is as it were
whispered into the Ear of the Soul, making a
particular application of what is spoken Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
to the Ear, much like that of <hi>Nathan</hi> to
<hi>David, Thou art the Man.</hi> This still voice sounds
throughout the whole Soul, yet none hear it but
the Soul concerned in it; it is said, 1 <hi>Sam. 9. 15.
The Lord told</hi> Samuel <hi>in his Ear, the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</hi>
&amp;c. That is, he whispered the secret into
the Prophets mind; so the Spirit of Christ whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
a word into the Ear of a sinner which makes
his Heart to tremble; after this manner, <hi>This is
thy very state and condition; this is thy sin, which is
now opened by the Gospel in thine Ears.</hi> This is a
voice without sound or noise to any others, but
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:109022:164"/>
very intelligible to the Soul unto whom it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.
You read in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 11, 12. when <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi>
stood upon the <hi>Mount</hi> before the Lord, there
came <hi>a great and strong wind which rent the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
and brake in pieces the Rocks before the Lord,
but the Lord was not in the wind; and after the wind
an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake;
and after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord
was not in the fire; and after the fire a still small voice;
And it was so, when</hi> Elijah <hi>heard it, that he wrapped
his face in his mantle,</hi> &amp;c. So it is here. Dreadful
things are thundred against men by the voice of
the Law, the Terrours of the Lord are made
known, Hell and Damnation are set before the
eyes of Sinners; but until the Lord come in the
still voice of his Spirit, and apply those things to
the Conscience, the Sinner never covers his face
with shame and confusion, nor goes aside to mourn
and lament his misery. This voice of God sounds
to the very Centre of the Soul. As for the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
voice of the Gospel alone, it signifies little,
<hi>in hearing men hear not,</hi> Matth. 13. 13. They have
the voice of Man, but not the voice of God:
They hear the sound, but feel not the power of
the Word. What is spoken externally, dyes in
the ear that hears it: But this still voice of the
Spirit by secret passages makes its way to the
heart, and none knows what God speaks but the
Soul to whom he speaks. That is the first Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="character">
                  <head>II. Character.</head>
                  <p>The internal spiritnal voice of Christ is a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal</hi>
and particular voice, speaking distinctly,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:109022:164"/>
and particularly to the case and state of the Soul,
as if it were by name. Ministers do and must
speak in general; they draw the Bow of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
at an adventure, not knowing to whom God
will direct the Arrow; but the Spirit guides it to
the Mark. He applies general Truths unto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
persons, so as the Soul to whom he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
it, is fully convinced and satisfied the Lord
intends and means it, in such a convictive and
threatning Expression. O, saith the Soul, hath
the Lord singled me out in special? this is my
very state and case. You read <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. 5. that
<hi>Christ calleth his sheep by name.</hi> How doth he call
them by name? but by speaking directly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to their Condition and Case, as if he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them by their particular Names. He doth not
now in an extraordinary way, as of old, call <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,
Samuel;</hi> or <hi>Saul, Saul;</hi> but he sends a Beam
of convincing light into the Conscience, plainly
discovering this or that to be our sin, danger, or
duty; and so as to the effect, it is all one as if
God named him: And truly, till it comes to this,
the Word hath no saving operation upon the
Soul. A man may hear ten thousand general
Truths, assent to them, and never be the better
for them. How still and quiet was <hi>David</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
till <hi>Nathan</hi> struck the nail upon the head,
by an home personal application, and then his
Conscience startled? Thus God singles out one
man or woman from among a thousand in the
Congregation, speaks to the heart, rips up the
secure Conscience; the rest hear the same words,
but feel not the same efficacy. And truly, 'tis a
choice mercy when God shall please thus to single
out one person from among many after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:109022:165"/>
to speak to his heart. As Christ said in
<hi>Luke 4. 25, 26. Many widows were in</hi> Israel <hi>in the
days of</hi> Elias, <hi>&amp;c. but to none of them was</hi> Elias <hi>sent
save unto</hi> Sarepta <hi>a City of</hi> Sydon, <hi>unto a woman that
was a widow;</hi> so here, Multitudes sate with you
under the same Prayer or Sermon, but unto none
of them at that time was the Spirit sent, to make
a particular convictive application thereof, but
unto thee. In this the peculiar goodness of God
shines out, and should for ever be admired in the
eyes of that Soul.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="character">
                  <head>III. Character.</head>
                  <p>Thirdly, This spiritual internal voice of
Christ is <hi>distinguishable</hi> by the Soul that hears it
from all other voices, <hi>Iohn 10. 4. The Sheep know
his voice.</hi> As in the style of the Scriptures, there
is a weight and majesty which distinguishes it
from all human composures; so in this voice of
Christ, there is a Majesty, a peculiar Efficacy, a
divine and awful Authority, by which the Soul
distinguishes it from all human voices. It was said
of Christ in the days of his flesh, <hi>Iohn 7. 46. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
man spake like this man.</hi> The same may we
say of his spiritual voice, the Soul never heard
such a voice before; it seals the truth upon the
heart so firmly, that no Objections are left against
it. It was not so when we heard the voice of man.
And there are two things in this inward voice of
Christ, which apparently difference it from all
human voices. (1.) A marvellous light comes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Soul with it, which discovers all the secrets
of the heart. God shines into the heart the same
time he speaks unto it, <hi>2 Cor. 4. 6.</hi> and now the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:109022:165"/>
secrets of the heart are manifest, and God is
acknowledged to be in that Word of Truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
14. 25.</p>
                  <p>(2ly,) A marvellous Power accompanieth this
voice, to make a deep and firm impression of what
is spoken upon the Soul: and this Power is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Character of the voice of God, whereby the
Soul receives it as his, with much assurance, as
the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Thess. 1. 5. Our Gospel came
not to you in Word only, but also in Power, and in the
Holy Ghost; and in much Assurance.</hi> They could
not be more certain of any thing in the world,
than they were of this, That it was the Lord
that spake to them in that Word. 'Tis true, at
the first instant the Soul may be amazed, and at a
loss, as <hi>Peter</hi> when he was delivered out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<hi>Acts</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 11. thought at first he had seen a
Vision; but when he was come to himself, <hi>Now,</hi>
said he, <hi>I know of a surety that the Lord hath sent
his Angel,</hi> &amp;c. Thus it is with the Soul, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed,
and doubts what manner of Call or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
this is; sure it is, it never heard such a voice,
nor ever felt any thing like this before: But the
matter is quickly cleared up when the Soul hath
reflected duly upon it, and finds (as it quickly
doth) such a wonderful change of the frame and
temper of the heart following upon it. I now
speak not of those into whom Grace is distilled in
the way of godly Education in their tender years,
but of adult persons, and especially such as have
been grosser Sinners.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="character">
                  <head>IV. Character.</head>
                  <p>This spiritual internal voice of Christ is a <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing</hi>
                     <pb n="288" facs="tcp:109022:166"/>
voice, altogether unexpected by the Soul
that hears it; <hi>I am found of them that sought me
not, Isai.</hi> 65. 1. Little do we foresee the designs
God hath upon us in bringing us to such a place,
and under such a Sermon, at such, or such a time;
even as little as <hi>Saul</hi> thought of a Kingdom when
he was seeking his Fathers Asses. 'Tis much with
us as it was with the <hi>Apostles</hi> when Christ called
them; little did <hi>Matthew</hi> think when he sate at
the Receipt of Customs, or <hi>Saul</hi> think when po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
unto <hi>Damascus</hi> upon the Devils errand, that
Christ and Salvation had then been so near them.
Some have come to scoff and deride the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and Truths of God; others to gratifie their
curiosity, and many in a customary course, not
knowing where else with peace to themselves, or
reputation with others, to spend that hour: But
God's thoughts were not theirs; the time of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
was now come, and whatever sinful or low ends
brought them thither, the Lord's design was then
and there to manifest himself to them. It is with
such Souls, in some respect, as it was with the
Spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. 12. to whose expression I may
here allude, <hi>Or ever I was aware my Soul made me
as the Chariots of</hi> Aminadab. I went to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation
for Company, I was fitting under the
Word with a careless wandring heart, as at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times; when lo, above all the thoughts of
my heart, an Arrow of Conviction was suddenly
shot into my Conscience, which so startled,
wounded, and disquieted it, as it is now beyond
the power of any but Christ himself to settle and
satisfie it.</p>

                  <head>V. Character.</head>
                  <p>Fifthly, This spiritual internal voice of Christ
is <hi>energetical,</hi> great and mighty in power, piercing
the heart, cleaving as it were the very reins; full
of efficacy to the Soul that hears it. The power
of God comes along with this voice of God. You
read <hi>Hebr. 4. 12. The Word of God is quick and
powerful, and sharper than any two-edged Sword;
piercing even to the dividing asunder of the Soul and
Spirit, of the Ioynts and Marrow.</hi> Now this effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
is not inherent in the Word it self, it works
not thus as a natural Agent, then all would feel
this power that come within the sound of it. No,
this comes from the Spirit of Christ, speaking in
it to the Sinners Conscience; when it is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the Spirit, then it becomes thus
efficacious. You read in <hi>Psalm</hi> 29. from <hi>v.</hi> 3. to
10. of the wonderful efficacy of God's providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
voice; the voice of the Lord is powerful;
<hi>The voice of the Lord is full of majesty; it breaks
the Cedars, divides the flames of fire, shakes the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
maketh the Hynds to calve.</hi> This the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
voice of God in the winds, thunders, and
lightnings can do; but alas, what's this to the
efficacy of his spiritual voice? What is the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Cedars of <hi>Lebanon</hi> to the breaking of
the heart of a Sinner? what is the shaking of the
Trees in the wilderness, to the fears of wrath to
come, which shake the Souls of convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and make their very hearts to tremble?
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. What is the dividing of the flames
of fire, to the dividing of a Soul from its beloved
Lusts? <hi>The weapons of our warfare</hi> (saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle)
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:109022:167"/>
                     <hi>are mighty through God, to the pulling down of
strong holds, casting down imaginations, and every
high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge
of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to
the obedience of Christ, 2 Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. Here be
the glorious effects of this voice, which plainly
discover from whom it comes. The voice of
God is no less to be admired in its magni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icent
effects, in the new Creation, than in the first Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
with which the Apostles compares it 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.
6. <hi>God that commanded the light to shine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
hath shined into our hearts.</hi> It was marvellous
to see, at the word of Christ, <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that was
dead in his Grave, to come forth bound in his
Grave-cloths; and no less to see a Soul dead in
sin, bound in the bonds of corruption, at a word
of Christ to arise, and come forth with spiritual
life, <hi>Iohn 5. 25. The dead shall hear the voice of the
Son of God, and they that hear it shall live.</hi>

               <div n="6" type="character">
                  <head>VI. Character.</head>
                  <p>This spiritual voice of Christ is so <hi>convictive</hi>
to the Conscience of a Sinner, that it puts a final
end to all shifts and evasions. Whilst Man only
spake, the Soul had a thousand shifts to evade and
put off what was spoken; but now all Disputes
and Debates are at an end. No more Subterfuges
and cunning Evasions now. The Spirit, when he
cometh, <hi>he shall convince the World of sin,</hi> John 16. 8.
The word signifies to convince by demonstration;
and that is, to shew a thing to be impossible to be
otherwise than we represent it to be. Formerly
when the Terrours of God were threatned against
sin, the shuffling heart was wont to say, This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:109022:167"/>
me no more than others; if it go ill with
me, it will go ill with thousands as well as me.
'Tis true, this is my Evil, and who is without
them? I have some evils in me, but yet I have
some good too. But no sooner doth the Spirit
speak conviction to the Conscience, but all these
pleas are out of doors. It may be the state of
the Sinner's Soul was doubtful to him before, but
it is not so now. It had some fears of Hell, but
ballanced with some vain hopes of Heaven. But
now the Debate is ended, the great Question de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
Whatever I am, or have, whatever
Duties I have done, and whatsoever sins I have
avoided, I see I am not regenerated, I am in my
natural Christless state, and except I be changed
I must be damned. This was the effect of Christs
convictive voice unto <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 9. <hi>I was alive
without the Law once, but when the Commandment
came, sin revived and I died.</hi> He had read the
Law many a time, and had the litteral knowledge
of it; but under these things his vain hopes lived
and flourish'd, until the spiritual sense of the Law
came home to his heart by the teaching and voice
of the Spirit, and then his vain hopes gave up the
ghost, and his sin and guilt stared in the face of
his Conscience.</p>

                  <p>The voice of Christ whereof we now speak is
generally and ordinarily conveyed to the Souls of
men through the <hi>Word preached,</hi> which is the <hi>chosen
Organ</hi> or Instrument of its Conveyance. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
absolutely and universally affirm that Christ
always speaks to men this way, but certainly this
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:109022:168"/>
is his standing and ordinary course, 1 <hi>Thess. 1. 5.
Our Gospel came not to you in word only, but in power,
and in the Holy Ghost.</hi> Our Gospel, because preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and ministred by us; but had that been all, it
had come to you in word only, as it doth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thousand others in the world, who hear and
feel nothing in it more than what is human; but
unto you it came in power, and in the Holy
Ghost; that is, our words were the <hi>Vehicle</hi> or
<hi>Organ</hi> through which the vital power of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was conveyed into your Souls. Providences
have their voices, as well as the Word; and
sometimes the voice of Christ hath accompanied
the voice of Providence, to the conversion of
mens Souls; but this is more rare and unusual:
The established and ordinary way of Christ's
speaking to the hearts of Sinners is by the Word,
and especially the Word preached, which upon
that very account and consideration, as it is the
Organ of conveying the voice and power of Christ
to the Soul, is therefore called <hi>the power of God to
salvation, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. This Instrument the Lord

unto us which are saved it is the power of God, 1 Cor.</hi>
1. 18. <hi>i. e.</hi> the chosen Instrument by which the
saving power of God communicates it self to the
Souls of men: And although God may exert his
saving power through Providences, yet we seldom
or never find he doth so where the Word may be
had, but is despised and neglected. And truly
herein God consults our peace and satisfaction;
for suppose he should make use of another <hi>medium,</hi>
                     <pb n="293" facs="tcp:109022:168"/>

may be a Delusion? may not Satan impose upon
poor Mortals; and this voice from Heaven be a

it, and I had need to be sure it was the very
voice of God himself. In such a case as this it
would be hard to give such clear distinguishing
Characters as might be to the satisfaction of the
Soul, and clearly difference the one from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But now when God makes the Word his

                  <p>The voice of Christ leaves <hi>abiding effects and
lasting impressions</hi> upon the Soul that hears it. The
words of men are scattered into the wind, but the
effects of Christ's voice are durable and lasting
things; <hi>Psal. 119. 93. I will never forget thy Word,
for by it thou hast quickned me.</hi> How many hundred
Sermons have we heard, and all those excellent
Truths vanished away as a Dream? Oh, but if
ever thou heardest Christ speaking to thy heart in
any Sermon, or Prayer; to be sure that will stick

by thee for ever: His words are sealed upon the
Soul for ever, they are written in the heart, <hi>Ier.</hi>
31. 33. What <hi>Iob</hi> wished concerning his words,

<hi>they are written as in the Rock for ever.</hi> We have

and must retain the words of Christ, spoken to

<hi>Iob 33. 16. He sealeth their instructions,</hi> and this

of Christ's voice.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I shall next speak unto the personal
Objects unto whom Christ ordinarily directs this
his internal, efficacious, and saving Voice or Call.
And although it be true that the Spirit of Christ
is a free Agent, acting with the greatest liberty,
and calleth whom he will, according to that, <hi>Iohn</hi>
3. 8. <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth.</hi> And it is
true <hi>de facto,</hi> That Christ hath made some of all
sorts and ranks of men to hear his voice; yet if
we consider the way he commonly takes, we shall
find that it is very rare and seldom that Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects
this saving voice or call of his to the great
and wise of this world, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 26. You see your
Calling, Brethren, how that not many wise men after the
flesh, not many mighty, not many noble are called.</hi> He
saith not <hi>any,</hi> but not <hi>many.</hi> Some Christ doth
call, <hi>Lest</hi> (as one notes) <hi>the world should think that
Christians were deceived through their simplicity and

                        </gap>odemus,</hi> but not many. Men of the
greatest fame and renown in the world have been
the greatest and fiercest Enemies against Christ.
<hi>Gallen</hi> the chief Physician, <hi>Porphyry</hi> the chief <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotelian, Plotinus</hi> the chief <hi>Platonist, Lybanus</hi> and
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:109022:169"/>
                     <hi>Lucian</hi> the chief <hi>Orators,</hi> were all the professed
Enemies of Christ. Two things make a man
great in the eye of the world; The external en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
of Providence, heaping up Riches and
Honours upon the outward man; and internal
gifts and endowments of the mind, adorning the
inward man, as strong Reason, sharpness of Wit,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> when both these meet (as many times they
do) in one and the same person, they make him
great in the eye of the world, and usually in his
own eyes too; yea, too great to stoop to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of the Gospel, and the humbling self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
terms thereof. These the Lord usually
passes by, and directs his voice to the poor; the
poor receive the Gospel: <hi>God hath chosen the poor
of this world, rich in faith, and Heirs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
James 2. 5. And this choice of God Christ
blesseth him for, <hi>Matth. 11. 25. I thank thee, O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
Lord of Heaven and Earth, because thou hast
hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast
revealed them unto babes;even so Father, for so it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
good in thy sight.</hi> And indeed the wisdom of
God deserves our admiration in this dispensation.
For (1.) hereby the freeness of his Grace is vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.
None can now pretend that any earthly
excellency commends any man to God, or that
the favour of Heaven is engaged by the same mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
that the respects of this world are: For
now you see the truth of that Scripture, <hi>Iob</hi> 34. 19.
before your eyes, <hi>He accepteth not the persons of
Princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor,
for they are all the work of his hands.</hi> Earthly
Riches and Honours, as empty things as they are,
yet are too much idoliz'd by men: What would
they be, could they procure our favour and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:109022:170"/>
with the Lord? (2ly,) By such a
choice as this the Lord plainly shews us, That Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
needs not worldly props to support it. As
at first it was spread by the power of God in the
world by poor contemptible men, so it is still
upheld without human policy or riches. The
church is called <hi>the Congregation of the poor, Psal.</hi>
74. 20. The Lord will have us know that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to maintain and carry on his counsels in the
world without the wealth of rich men, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of great men, or the policies of wise men;
he needs them not. (3ly,) By this choice he
pours contempt upon those things which are most
admired among men: So he tells us, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 27.
God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
the wise, and the weak things of the world to
confound the things that are mighty.</hi> And certainly,
shame and confusion of face will cover the great
ones of this world, in the world to come: when
they shall see those poor Christians, whom they
contemned and scorned upon earth, as not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to come into their presence, to be so infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
preferred before them in the favour of God. In
a word, this efficacious spiritual voice of Christ is
directed but to a few, even of the many that sit
within the sound and call of the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi>
22. 14. <hi>Many are called, but few are chosen.</hi> Christ's
flock is a little flock. There be many <hi>Birds of
prey,</hi> to one <hi>Bird of Paradice:</hi> Many common
<hi>Pebles,</hi> to one <hi>Saphir</hi> or <hi>Diamond.</hi> 'Tis not for us
to dispute the Reason, but to adore the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of God in this matter. And of those few whom
he calleth, the greatest part are of the lower rank
and order of men. The glitter and dazel of this
world blinds the eyes of the greatest. Extremity
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:109022:170"/>
of pinching wants, diverts the mind of the very
lowest; but betwixt these two extreams there is
a third sort of persons whom the Lord most
usually calls.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, If it be queried why the voice and
call of Christ should be directed to this person
rather than to that? Certainly it is not from any
dignity or excellency outward, or inward, that
Christ sees in one above another; for all are shut
up under the same common sin and misery of the
fall; and therefore the Apostle told the <hi>Ephesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
who had heard and answered the voice of
Christ; <hi>That they were by nature children of wrath
even as others,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. If it were not so, Man
would have something to glory in before God;
but Christ resolves this whole dispensation into
its proper cause, the good pleasure of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Will, <hi>Matth. 11. 26. Even so Father, for so it
seemed good in thy sight.</hi> This good pleasure of
the Will of God sometimes orders those to hear
the voice of his Son, that seem to stand at a far
greater distance and improbability to hear it than
others do. 'Tis said of the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that they
were a far off, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 13. yet they heard the
voice of Christ; when that discreet Scribe,
<hi>Mark</hi> 12. 34. who was not far from the Kingdom
of God, and <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26. 28. who almost
or within a very little was perswaded to be a
Christian, never heard it; therefore it is said,
<hi>Matth. 8. 11, 12. Many shall come from the East and
West, and shall sit down with</hi> Abraham, <hi>and</hi> Isaac,
<hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>in the Kingdom of Heaven; but the
children of the Kingdom shall be cast out into outer
darkness.</hi> O marvelous dispensation! Many a
poor Soul under the greatest disadvantages, a
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:109022:171"/>
poor Servant that hath but little time and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of encumbrances, yet such a one is often
called effectually by this voice of Christ; when
those that enjoy multitudes of opportunities and
have abundance of time lying upon their Hands,
which they know not what to do with; who have
the choicest Books at command, yet hear nothing;
feel nothing amidst all these advantages to any
purpose; all this is wholly to be resolved into
the good pleasure of the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, In the next place, let us view the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of this voice of Christ upon the Souls of
Men, and we shall find divers remarkable effects
wrought upon the Heart by it.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="effect">
                     <head>I. Effect.</head>
                     <p>And the first Effect of the voice of Christ, is
<hi>Conviction</hi> upon the Conscience; Conviction both
of sin and misery, <hi>Iohn 16. 9. The Spirit when he
cometh, shall convince the World of sin.</hi> This is
a voice of terror, it strikes dead the vain hopes
of a sinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9. Now the Soul that was
before secure and quiet, becomes the seat of
trouble and anxiety. 'Tis true, there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Conviction of sin before, they knew that
all are sinners; that they denied not; but alas,
this general Conviction is quite another thing to
what the Soul feels now; now it can shift and
wave the matter no longer. This voice of Christ
<hi>shews them their iniquities, and how they have exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
as the expression is, <hi>Iob</hi> 36. 8, 9. exceeded
in number, and exceeded in heinousness of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation:
A general Conviction of sin, affects
a Man no more than the sight of a painted Lion
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:109022:171"/>
upon a Sign-post; but when a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
is set on upon the Conscience by this spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
inward voice of Christ; sm is now like a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Lion meeting a Man in the way, and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
dreadfully upon him. This is the first Effect
of Christs voice, and is introductive unto the</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="2" type="effect">
                     <head>II. Effect.</head>
                     <p>Which is, <hi>humiliation,</hi> and contrition of Heart
for sin; those threats of Scripture against sin and
sinners, which were wont to be sleighted, are now
trembled at; those <hi>Iews, Acts</hi> 2. 37. to whose
Hearts Christ spake in <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, as soon as
ever they heard his voice, sounding Conviction
in their Consciences, they were presently <hi>pricked
at the Heart;</hi> no Sword, or Poyniard can make
such a wound, and put a poor creature into such
pain as a sight of sin will do; therefore <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.
10. they are said to mourn for Christ as for an
only Son. Now this is the glorious prerogative
of Jesus Christ, to be able to reach and wound
the Heart with a word: The voice of Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do it; but the Spirit of a Man lies naked
and open both to be wounded and healed by a
word from the Mouth of Christ. No sooner
hath a poor sinner heard the awful voice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
spoken to his Conscience by the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
but he feels himself sick at Heart; home he
goes from that Sermon, by which Christ spake
effectual Conviction to him, crying, O sick, sick;
my Soul is distressed, because of sin. There is
indeed a great difference in the depth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of this contrition and humiliation; it soaks
deeper into some Hearts than others, and holds
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:109022:172"/>
them longer under it; but certain it is, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath heard the convincing voice of Christ;
he feels so much sorrow for sin as for ever sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
him from the love of it.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="3" type="effect">
                     <head>III. Effect.</head>
                     <p>Thirdly, This voice of Christ rouzes and
awakens the careless and sluggish mind, to the
greatest solicitude and thoughtfulness after deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and escape from the danger that hangs
over it, <hi>Acts 16. 30. Trembling and astonished, he
cried out, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</hi> All the
powers of the Soul run into solicitude and care
about deliverance. You shall generally observe
in convinced and humbled sinners, three evident
signs of extraordinary solicitude about Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
(1.) There is a strong intention of their
minds and thoughts, they stand night and day
like a Bow at the full bent; their thoughts are
still poring upon this matter; their sleep departs,
for their sin and danger is ever before them.
(2ly,) It appears by their searching inquisitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
about the way of escape; the question they
still carry with them from company to company,
where they meet with any whom they judge able
to resolve or direct them, is this; What course
shall I take? What shall I do? Is there any hope
for such a one as I? Did you ever know a Soul in
my condition? (3ly,) It appears by the little
notice they take at this time of their outward
troubles and afflictions; which it may be are
strong and sharp enough to overwhelm them at
another time; but now they take little notice of
them. Sin lies so heavy, that it makes heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
lye light.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="4" type="effect">
                     <pb n="301" facs="tcp:109022:172"/>
                     <head>IV. Effect.</head>
                     <p>A fourth Effect of the voice of Christ, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
and hope, puting the Soul upon the
use of means in order to the attainment of
Christ and Salvation; for it is an inviting as well
as a convicting voice; and this is a remarkable
difference betwixt the voice of Christ and the
voice of Satan; with respect to sin. Satan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to cut off all hope, and strike the Soul
dead under despair of mercy; as well knowing
that if he can cut off hope, all emotions and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of the Soul after Christ are effectually
stopt, and at a dead stand; but how much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
terrors soever there are in the voice of
Christ, there is always something left behind it
upon the Heart to breed and support hope. And
truly the Soul amidst these sad circumstances
hath great need of some encouragement; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
the Lord usually after sharp convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
sets on upon the Soul such a word as that,
<hi>Iohn 6. 37. Him that cometh to me I will in no wise
cast out; for I came down from Heaven not to do
mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</hi>
Wherein Christ offers the most rational satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
and greatest encouragement imaginable;
that a poor convinced sinner, if he be made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
shall certainly find an hearty welcom and
acceptation with Christ. For mark how he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
it on purpose for the satisfaction of such
Souls; <hi>I came not down from Heaven to do mine own
Will, but the Will of him that sent me.</hi> The force of
the encouragement lyes here, <hi>I and my Father are
one;</hi> one in Will, and one in Design; our Wills
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:109022:173"/>
never did, nor possibly can jar and clash one with
another; that would be utterly repugnant to
the perfect unity that is betwixt us. <hi>Now,</hi> saith
he, <hi>I came down from Heaven not only to do my own
Will</hi> (which must necessarily be supposed to be
intently set, and strongly enclined to receive and
save all convinced and willing sinners, this being
the very end of my Incarnation and Death)
<hi>but also to do the Will of my Father;</hi> who hath sent
me to bind up the broken hearted, and anointed
me to preach good tydings to the meek, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61. 1.
and therefore no such Soul can rationally doubt
of a welcom reception with me. And because
the fears and jealousies of a convinced Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
are great and many, and the Devil sets in
with them to aggravate them beyond the hopes
of mercy; therefore it is usual with the Lord,
at such a time as this, to direct the convinced
and trembling sinner to such a Scripture as that,
<hi>Heb. 7. 25. Wherefore he is able also to save them to
the uttermost that come unto God by him,</hi> &amp;c. Making
the fulness of Christs saving power to shine with
a chearful beam into the dark and distressed Soul
of a sinnner, from such a word as that.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div n="5" type="effect">
                     <head>V. Effect.</head>
                     <p>A fifth Effect or consequent of Christs power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
voice, is an <hi>attractive efficacy,</hi> or <hi>sweet allicion</hi>
of the Soul to Christ, by that power and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
which it communicates to the Soul, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.
44, 45. <hi>No Man can come to me except the Father,
which hath sent me, draw him. Every Man therefore
that hath heard and learned of the Father cometh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me.</hi> Mark it, this voice speedily puts the Soul
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:109022:173"/>
into motion after Christ; coming follows hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
When once the Soul hath heard the voice
of God, away it comes from all the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in the World; all bonds and ties betwixt
the Soul and sin break asunder and give way;
nothing can hold it from Christ. There is a
strange restlesness in the Spirit of Man, nothing
but Christ can centre and quiet it.</p>

                     <p>And then lastly, The last Effect of Christs
voice or call <hi>is sweet rest and consolation to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
Man.</hi> When once the Soul is come home to
Christ by the efficacy of this heavenly call or
voice, it enters into peace, <hi>Heb. 4. 3. We which
have believed do enter into rest;</hi> not only <hi>shall,</hi> but
do enter into rest. As the first Effect of Christs
voice was terror and great trouble to the Soul,
so the last Effect is peace; it puts the Soul into
the most excellent position in the World, for
comfort and joy; it never stood upon such ground
before; for this vocation, stands betwixt prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination,
and glorification, <hi>Rom. 8. 30. Moreover,
whom he did predestinate, them he also called; and
whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he
justified, them he also glorified.</hi> See here into what
a blessed Mount of vision the voice of Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
the Souls of sinners? where let the Soul
look backward, or forward, from eternity to
eternity, there is nothing but a vision of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
its Eyes. This call of God points it backward
to Gods eternal choice, which by this very call
it is now manifest he made of that Soul before
the World was; and it also points forward, to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:109022:174"/>
that eternal glory unto which God is leading it.
These are the Effects of this Almighty voice of
Christ, and these the special instructions sealed
by it upon the Hearts of Men.</p>
                     <p>But now, this voice of Christ is not heard
at all times, but in some special season or hour,
as Christ calls it, <hi>Iohn 5. 25. The hour cometh
when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God.</hi>
And elsewhere, by the Apostle, it is called, <hi>the
accepted Time, the day of Salvation, 2 Cor.</hi> 6. 2.
And the conjunction of the Spirit of Christ with
the Word, Ordinances, or Providences of God;
but especially the Word, makes this blessed hour.
The Word alone, though never so excellently
preacht, conduces no more to the Conviction
and Salvation of a sinner, than the Waters of
<hi>Bethesda</hi> did, when the Angel came not down to
trouble them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 4. But when the Lord
pours out his Spirit with the Word, according
to that promise, <hi>Prov. 1. 23. I will pour out my
Spirit upon you, and make known my Words unto you;</hi>
then Christ speaks to the Heart; this great
conjunction of the Word and Spirit makes that
blessed nick, and season of Salvation. The time
of love, the time of life. Now the voice of
Christ is heard with effect; the Ordinances im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated
with convincing and converting effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy.
There was an abundant effusion of the
Spirit in the first Age of Christianity, and then
the voice of Christ was heard by multitudes of
Souls at once: There hath since been a restraint
of the Spirit, comparatively speaking, whereas
three thousand Souls were then converted at one
Sermon; possibly, three thousand Sermons have
since been preached, and not one Soul effectually
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:109022:174"/>
called. This hath made the Church like a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
a Land of drouth; and so 'tis like to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
<hi>until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high,
and the wilderness be a fruitful field;</hi> according to
that promise, <hi>Isa.</hi> 32. 15. And such a time we
expect, Lord hasten it; when the waters of the
Ordinances shall be healed, <hi>and every thing that
liveth, which moveth, whithersoever the River shall
come, shall live. And fishers shall stand upon it from</hi>
Engedi, <hi>even unto</hi> Eneglaim, <hi>they shall be a place to
spread forth nets, their fish shall be according to their
kinds, as the fish of the great Sea, exceeding many,
Ezek.</hi> 47. 9, 10. Then Ministers shall no longer
fish with Angles, catching now one, then another;
but shall spread forth their nets, and inclose
whole shoals, multitudes of Converts; in the
mean time there are some signal periods, and
happy seasons, wherein Christ uttereth his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
voice in the World; but that season is
utterly unforeknown to Man; we cannot say
when it will come, but are to wait for it, as the
Man did at the pool of <hi>Bethesda.</hi> Ministers must
preach in hope, wait in hope, if at any time
God will give the people repentance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 25.
We are often mistaken in our conjectures, when
we have made the best preparations, and find a
more than ordinary enlargedness of Spirit, we
are apt to conclude certainly this is the blessed
hour wherein Christ will speak to the Heart as
we do to the Ear; but we oft-times find our
selves mistaken, yet we must wait in hope, and
so must our people. Such a happy time may come,
and when it doth, it will be a day for ever to be
remembred; because then the first actual appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Christ will be made to your Souls;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:109022:175"/>
without which all that the Father had done in Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and the Son in his meritorious Redemption,
had been of no benefit or advantage to your
Souls: And therefore you shall find that this
work of the Spirit stands betwixt both those
works, and makes them both effectual to our
Salvation, <hi>1 Pet. 1. 2.</hi> This is that blessed hour
upon which your eternal blessedness depends;
eternity will be taken up in blessing God for this
hour; it will be celebrated for ever in your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in the World to come. O what an influence
hath this hour into all eternity! The hearing of
this voice of Christ, effectually opens the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
counsels of Heaven, and brings to light the
eternal counsels of God concerning you, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi>
1. 4, 5. <hi>Knowing brethren,</hi> beloved, <hi>your election of
God: for our Gospel came not to you in word only, but
also in power, and in the Holy Ghost.</hi> This gives
greater assurance of the eternal love of God to a
Mans Soul, than the sweetest smile of providence,
or any oraculous voice from Heaven can do. This
is the time of life, the day of your Spiritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 25. A greater and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

your Souls is above your Bodies. As also, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the blessedness of your Corporeal Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
depends upon this your Spiritual Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
by the voice of Christ. Dreadful will
the voice of Christ be at the Resurrection of your
Bodies, except you first hear this vital voice of
Christ quickning your Souls on Earth with spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
life. To conclude, this is the great <hi>Aera</hi>
or head of account from which you are to reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and date all your spiritual sanctified mercies;
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:109022:175"/>
for as the Lord said unto the Jews, <hi>Hag. 2. 19.
From henceforth will I bless you.</hi> So saith the
Lord to you, from this hour wherein you have
heard and obeyed the voice of Christ, will I bless
you for ever, with all Spiritual blessings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly

                  </gap>. 37. <hi>who have not heard the voice of God at any
time;</hi> the Ministerial voice of Christ they hear
dayly; but this Efficacious Internal voice, which
makes the Ministerial voice, the Word of Life
and Power, they have not heard. The Gospel, to
the most of our hearers, is but an empty sound;
this is a sad symptom, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 3. If our Gospel
be hid, it is hid to them that are lost; in whom the
God of this World hath blinded the minds of them
that believe not,</hi> &amp;c. This hiding of the Gospel
is not opposed to the external administration of
it, nor yet to the understanding of the true
sense and meaning of the truths delivered by it;
but only to that <hi>internal efficacy</hi> which is here
called the hearing of Christs voice. Our people
are generally well satisfied when they have heard
a Sermon, much more if they can remember some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of it; though the Lord hath not spoken
one truth they have heard, home to their Hearts.
Now this is a sad case, and God grant it be
not that very judgment threatned, <hi>Isa. 6. 9. Hear
ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:109022:176"/>
perceive not.</hi> So that hearing the meer voice of
Man, without feeling the power of God, is all
one as if we heard not. Reflect sadly upon this,
you that sit as unconcerned under the Word as the
Seats you sit upon. God speaketh once, yea,
twice, but man perceiveth it not. Well, the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Decrees and Counsels of God are now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuting
upon the Souls of Men under the Gospel.
As many as are ordained to eternal Life, shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and feel the power of Gods truths upon
their Hearts, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 48. And methinks it should
be of a startling consideration, when you shall
see others struck to the Heart, cast into fears and
tremblings, by the same Word that doth not in
the least touch your Hearts. It may be you think
this is but fancy and melancholy; that very
thought is an artifice of Satan to blind your
Eyes. I am sure Christ makes another use of it,
when he told the secure and self-righteous Jews,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 32. John <hi>came unto you in the way of
righteousness, and ye believed him not; but the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
and Harlots believed him: and ye when ye had
seen it, repented not afterward that ye might believe
him. q. d.</hi> What shift did you make to quiet your
Consciences, when you saw other poor sinners
so humbled, and bronght to Faith under <hi>Iohn</hi>'s
Ministry? 'Tis strange there should be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections
in your Consciences upon your own
state and condition; but thus it must be, one shall
be taken, and another left; to some it shall be
the savour of life unto life, and to others the
savour of death unto death. O who can look
over so great a part of a Congregation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
melting bowels of compassion? Consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that unto this day the Lord hath not given
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:109022:176"/>
them Eyes to see, nor Ears to hear: They have
heard multitudes of Sermons; they have heard
also what effects they have had upon other Mens
Hearts, but none upon theirs. O that such poor
Souls would cry to the Lord Jesus, in such Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as that, <hi>Cant. 8. 13. The companions hearken
to thy voice, cause me to hear it.</hi> Lord let me not
sit under the Word any longer, deaf to the voice
of thy Spirit in it. Open and unstop the Ears
of my Soul, that I may hear thy voice and feel
thy power; otherwise, the external ministerial
voice will be ineffectual to my Salvation. 'Twill
be but a Rattle to still and quiet my Conscience
for a little while, and a dreadful aggravation of
my misery in the issue.</p>

                        </gap>
things that were spoken, and some believed not.</hi> Here
you see the different, yea, contrary events of
the preaching of the Gospel, according to the
Scripture account of it; it quickens some, and
kills others; it brings some to Faith, and leaves
others still fixed in unbelief. Compare this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with what is daily before your Eyes; do
you not see Souls differently influenced to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
effects under the same word? One melting and
tender, another hardned, and wholly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?
Tell me, you that are apt to ascribe all
to nature, how comes it to pass that men exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
reason alike, men that have the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
fears and hopes of things eternal, who have
the same passions and affections, and are in the
self same condition and state with others; yet
one Mans Heart shall be wounded and go away
trembling from under the self same word, which
affects the other no more than if it had been
preached among the Tombs to the dead that lye
there? Say not, some have more courage than
others, or clearer understandings, for it is most
certain the Word hath convinced as rational
and courageous persons as those upon whom it
hath had no such effect. I doubt not but the Jaylor
that was cast into such tremblings and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. was as stout and rugged a
person as any to whom <hi>Paul</hi> usually preached;
his very office bespake him such a Man; wonder
not what it is that makes Men fright at such a
sound, which you hear as well as they, but it.
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:109022:177"/>
affects you not: The Lord speaks in that voice
to their Hearts, but not to yours; and so it
must be according to the account the Scripture
gives us of the contrary events of the Gospel
upon them that hear it; which is, I say, a fair
and firm Seal of the truth of the Scriptures,
and highly worth the due observation of all
Men.</p>

                  <p>What dignity hath God stampt on Gospel Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
in making them the organs and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diums
through and by which Christ speaks life
to dead Souls! This greatly exalts the dignity
of the Gospel, and deservedly endears it to all
our Souls. I deny not but God can convey Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual

he hath not tyed up himself, yet he hath tyed
us up to a diligent and constant attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; and that with the deepest respect and

to the hight of sinfulness. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of the Gospel runs much higher than
Men are aware of. We think it no great matter
to neglect or contemn a messenger of Jesus
Christ; but that contempt flies in the very face
and authority of Christ, who gave them their
Commissions; yea, in the very face of God the
Father, who gave Christ his Commission. Christ
speaks in and by his Ministers, they are as his
mouth, <hi>Ier.</hi> 15. 19. Moreover, the sin sticks at
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:109022:178"/>
our own Souls, and we injure them as well as
Christ: For the Word preached is his appointed
Instrument to convey spiritual life, the best of
Blessings to our Souls. Upon which account it is
called <hi>the Word of life, Phil.</hi> 2. 16. and <hi>the power of
God to salvation, Rom.</hi> 1. 16. We then militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our life and salvation when we despise and
neglect the Ordinances of God. 'Tis good for
men to lye under them, and continually wait on
them; who knows when the Spirit of God will
breathe life to your Souls through them? What
if yet you have found no such benefit from them?
the very next opportunity may be the time of life,
the appointed season of your salvation. Bring
your carnal Relations to them, as they did their

Christ's Call is a sufficient warrant to believe.
Many poor Souls are stagger'd in their work of

which they know not how to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves

without a Call or Warrant; but if Christ have
spoken to your hearts by the voice of his Spirit,
you have the best warrant in the world to go to
him. What though you know not the Issue? yet
your Obedience is due to his Call. <hi>By faith Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,

hand what the Event and Issue thereof shall

voice of Christ that calls you. When therefore
Satan shall object, What, such a wretched Soul as

and deeply wronged? Thy answer should be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
'Tis true, I have been a vile wretch, and have

                  <p>If no Soul can open to Christ until it hear his

                  </p>
                  <p>The rise of Faith is from this power of Christ,
not from the nature of Man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 13. Proud
Nature arrogates this power and honour to it self,
but without any ground; for though some things
may be done by men in their natural state, which
have a remote tendency to conversion and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
life, yet it can never open to Christ savingly
without a power communicated from himself.
There is a total impotence in Nature to produce
such an effect as this. The Scripture speaks it
roundly; telling us, <hi>The Natural man cannot</hi> (of
himself) <hi>know the things that are of God, 1 Cor.</hi>
2. 14. <hi>Cannot believe;</hi> for Faith is not of our selves,
it is the gift of God, <hi>Iohn 6. 44. Cannot obey,</hi> Rom.
8. 7. <hi>The carnal Mind is not subject to the Law of
God, neither indeed can be.</hi> Cannot <hi>speak a good
word,</hi> Matth. 12. 34. Cannot <hi>think a good thought,</hi>
2 Cor. 3. 5. What a poor impotent thing then is
the Natural man? who can neither believe, nor
obey, speak a good word, or think a good thought
by any natural power of his own.</p>
                  <p>Say not 'tis against Reason for God to require
men to do what they cannot, and then damn them
for not doing it. For (1.) though man hath lost
his ability to obey, yet God hath not lost his right
to command: for at that rate any man might
shake off the yoke of God's Soveraignty by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling
himself through his own sin, for the duties
of Obedience. (2.) Though man hath not a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:109022:180"/>
power, yet there is in him an intolerable
pride, which puffs him up with a conceit that he
hath what he hath not, and can do what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

               <p>This Point gives a loud Call to all that are

as begin to feel some power accompanying the

the voice of Christ, and obey his first Call with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

him that speaketh, for if they escaped not that refused

if we turn away from him that speaks from Heaven.</hi>
See that ye refuse not; the Caution implies the

O what a thick succession of Discouragements
do impetuously assault the Soul at this time! Art
thou young? then he insinuates that it is too soon
for thee to mind the serious things of Religion.
This will extinguish all thy pleasure in a dull me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy;
thou maist have time enough hereafter
to mind these matters. This Temptation <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
confesseth kept him off many years from
Christ. But certainly, if thou art old enough to
be damned, thou art not too young to mind Christ
and Salvation. There are Graves just of thy

as old <hi>Loggs,</hi> burning in Hell flames. Besides, all
those godly young ones which turned to the Lord

more, will be your Judges, and condemn you in

opened to Christ too soon: Thousands have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
that they kept him out so long. Art thou
old? then he scares thee with the manifold sins of
thy youth, and rouls them as blocks in thy way
to Christ. And whether young or old, he will
be sure to present the Sufferings, Reproaches,
and Persecutions of Godliness to discourage thee
from hearkning to the voice of Christ. But what

               <p>But you will say, All that hear this spiritual
voice of Christ are said to live, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 25. Now
I am much in the dark, whether ever this vital
voice of Christ hath founded unto my Soul. Alas,
I feel little, if any thing, of the spiritual life in
my Soul.<note place="margin">Quest.</note> I am dead and dark. <hi>By what means
doth the Life of Christ discover it self in the Souls of
Men?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I Answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> There are divers Signs of spiritual
life, and blessed is the Soul that finds them.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Sign.</note> There is a spiritual sense and feeling
flowing from, and accompanying the spiritual
life. I speak not only of the sense and feeling of
comfort; for many a Soul that is in Christ, feels
little of that; but certainly there is a sense and
feeling of the burthensomness of sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24.
And 'tis well that we can feel that; for there are
Multitudes in the world that are past feeling, <hi>Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi>
6. 9. 10. 'Tis a sign Christ hath spoken to thy
heart, if sorrows for sin begin to load it.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Sign.</note> Spiritual <hi>Motions</hi> towards Christ are
a sign of spiritual life; at least that God is about
that quickening work of Faith upon thy Soul,
<hi>Iohn 6. 45. Every man that bath beard and learned
of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> The effectual voice
of God sets the Soul in motion towards Christ;
the Will is moving after him; the Desires are
panting for him. The voice of God makes the
Soul that hears it, restless. As for others, their
Wills are fix'd, there is no moving of them, <hi>Iohn</hi>
                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:109022:181"/>
5. 40. Now consider how it is with thee, Reader:
Art thou one that art weighing and pondering the
terms of the Gospel? strugling through discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
and temptations to come to Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his own terms, lifting up thy heart to him for
power to believe, crying with the Sponse, <hi>Draw
me, I will run after thee?</hi> This is a comfortable
sign Christ hath spoken to thy heart.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Sign.</note> A Spirit of Prayer is an Evidence of
spiritual life, as the effect of Christ's voice to thy
Soul. Assoon as ever Christ had spoken effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
unto <hi>Paul</hi>'s heart, the first effect that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in him as a sign of spiritual life, was Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breath,
<hi>Acts 9. 11. Behold, he prayeth.</hi> God hath
no still-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orn Children. Measure thy self by this
Rule: Time was when thou couldst say a Prayer,
and wast very well satisfied with it, whether thou
hadst any Communion with God in it, or no; but is
it so still? Is there not an holy restlesness of spirit
after God since the time that his Word came
home to thy heart? Surely thou eanst remember
when it was not with thee as it is now.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a spiritual relish,<note place="margin">4. Sign.</note> a divine
gust resulting from the spiritual life, which is also
evidential of it; <hi>Omnis vita gustu ducitur.</hi> If
God have spoken life to thy Soul, there will be in
it an agreeable pleasure and delight in spiritual
things, <hi>Psal. 63. 5. My Soul shall be satisfied as with
marrow and fatness,</hi> &amp;c. Now thy thoughts can
feed with pleasure upon spiritual things, which
they nauseated before.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Spiritual <hi>aversations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5. Sign.</note> as well as spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:109022:182"/>
                  <hi>inclinations,</hi> speak spiritual life. Every
Creature hath an aversation to that which is noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and destructive to it. Now there is nothing
so destructive and dangerous to the spiritual life
as sin; that's the deadly poison which the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Soul dreads, <hi>Psal. 19. 13. Keep back thy servant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
from presumptuous sins.</hi> It cries out as a man that
finds himself upon the brink of a Pit, or edge of
a Precipice; <hi>Keep back thy Servant.</hi> Such aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations
to sin and tremblings under temptations
tending thereunto, are comfortable Sign Christ
hath spoken life to thy Soul.</p>
               <p>Lastly, Heavenly tendencies and <hi>propensions</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God are an excellent Sign thy Soul hath heard
his voice, and been quickned with spiritual life
by it. Sanctification is a Well of water spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up into everlasting life, <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 24. If thou
hast seen the beauty, felt the power, and heard the
voice of Christ, thy soul, like an uncentred Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
will be still propending, gravitating, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Christ-ward. When thou hast once heard
his effectual Call, <hi>Matth. 11. 28. Come unto me,</hi>
thy Soul will be continually echoing with the
Spouse, <hi>Rev. 22. 17. Come Lord Iesus. The Spirit
and the Bride say come, and let him that heareth, say
Come.</hi> A sweeter Sign of thy hearing Christ's
voice can hardly be found in the Soul of man, than
restless longing to be with Christ in a state of
perfect freedom from sin, and full fruition of the
beloved and blessed Jesus.</p>

               <q>
                  <bibl>Revel. 3. 20.</bibl> —If any Man hear my voice [and open
the door,]</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE powerful voice of Christ is the Key
that opens the door of the Soul to receive
him. The opening of the heart to receive
Christ is the main design aimed at in all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
and internal administrations of the Gospel
and Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Gospel hath two great Designs and Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
One is, To open the heart of God to
men, and to shew them the everlasting counsels
of Grace and Peace which were hid in God from
Ages and Generations past; that all men may now
see what God had been designing and contriving
for their happiness in Christ before the world was;
<hi>Ephes. 3. 9. To make all men see what is the fellowship
of the Mystery which from the beginning of the world
hath been hid in God, who created all things by Iesus
Christ, to the intent that now unto the Principalities
and Powers in heavenly places might be known by the
Church the manifold wisdom of God.</hi> The next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and Aim of the Gospel is to set open the
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:109022:183"/>
heart of man to receive Jesus Christ, without
which all the glorious discoveries of the eternal
Counsels and gracious Contrivances of God for
and about us, would signifie nothing to our real
advantage. Christ standing, knocking, and speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by his Spirit (of which we have before treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
receive their Success, and attain their End,
when the heart opens it self by Faith to receive
him, and not till then. Hence note,</p>
            <div n="9" type="doctrine">
               <head>IX. DOCT.</head>
               <p>That the opening of the heart to receive Christ
by Faith,<note place="margin">9. Doct.</note> is the great design and aim of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
               <p>This is the Mark to which all the Arrows in the
Gospel Quiver are levelled; the Centre unto
which those blessed Lines are drawn, <hi>Iohn 20. 31.
These things are written that you might believe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
might have life through his Name.</hi> All those
precious Truths that are written in the Scriptures
are to bring you to Faith. The great aim of the
Spirit in his Illuminations, Convictions, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the very same thing, <hi>Iohn 6. 29.
This is the work of God, that you believe.</hi> 'Tis not
only <hi>Opus Deo dignum,</hi> a work worthy of such an
Author, but it is that on which God's eye is
fixed in his workings upon us; the end and aim
of his work.</p>
               <p>Great persons have great designs. This is the
glorious project of the great God, and every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the Godhead is engaged and concerned in it.
(1.) The Father hath his hand in this work, and
such a hand as without it no heart could ever open
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:109022:183"/>
or move in the least towards Christ, <hi>Iohn 6. 44.
No man can come unto me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>except my
Father, which hath sent me, draw him.</hi> None but he
that raised up Christ from the dead, can raise up
a dead heart unto saving Faith in him. (2.) The
sons hand is in this work, he is not only the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>
but the <hi>Author</hi> of our Faith, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 20. We
know that the son of God is come, and hath given us
an understanding that we may know him that is true,
and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Iesus
Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.</hi> (3) And
then for the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he comes from Heaven design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
and expresly to convince Sinners of their need
of Christ, and beget Faith in them, <hi>Iohn 16. 9.</hi>
So that this appears to be the great design of
Heaven, the drist and level both of the Word
and Works of God. Touching this design of
the Gospel, I shall here speak, indeavouring to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
this great and glorious project of Heaven in
the ensuing Properties of it; which are
<list>
                     <item>1. The Greatness of it.</item>
                     <item>2. The Difficulty of it.</item>
                     <item>3. The Instruments imployed in it.</item>
                     <item>4. The Scope and aim of it. <hi>And</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, Of the <hi>Greatness</hi> of this design of God;
we little understand what a marvellous thing is
done in the Earth, when the heart of a Sinner is
brought to close with Christ by Faith. It would
transport us with admiration, did we throughly
consider it. Well may the <hi>Apostle</hi> place it in the
first rank of all the glorious and wonderful works
of God, as he doth 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16. Great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery
of godliness, God was manifest in the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sh, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:109022:184"/>
in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the
Gentiles, believed on in the World.</hi> Observe with
what works of wonder Faith is here ranked and
associated. It is an astonishing work of God that
ever God should be manifested in flesh, that he
that thunders in the Clouds should be heard cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in a Cradle; that he who is over all, God
blessed for ever, should become a man. It is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishing,
that when he was taken down dead
from the Cross, laid in the Sepulchre, and the
Stone sealed upon it; he should rise on the third
day from the dead by his own power. That ever
the Gospel should be preached to such a miserable
and sorlorn people as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were, the scorn
and contempt of the Jews. And no less marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
is it to see the hearts of such poor Creatures
glued so fast to Idolatry; so perfectly dead in sin,
to open to Christ upon such self-denying terms, as
to let go all they had in the world for a blessed
Inheritance which they never saw. And were
not this a marvellous work of God indeed, there
would never be such joy and triumph in Heaven
among the holy Angels, as there is upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
of every Sinners heart to Christ, <hi>Luke 15.
7.</hi> the whole City of God is moved with it. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
rings again with the joyful tydings; as soon as
ever the Will begins to bowe and open to Christ,
the news is quickly in Heaven, and all the Angels
of God rejoyce at the tydings. As when a young
<hi>Prince</hi> is born, the <hi>Conduits</hi> run with Wine, there
is Joy in every <hi>City</hi> throughout the Kingdom: So
also there is in Heaven when Christ hath gotten
a new habitation in the Soul of any Sinner upon
Earth. Moreover, the greatness of this design
appears from the great Rewards promised by the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:109022:184"/>
Lord to every Servant of his who hath but the
least hand to help it on. God would never reward
the Instruments so richly, if the success of the
work were not of great value in his eyes. The
Ministers of Christ may be ill rewarded by men,
perfecuted and reproached for their labour; but
God will bountifully repay their pains and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
<hi>Dan. 12. 3. They that turn many unto righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
shall shine as the Stars, and as the brightness
of the firmament for ever and ever.</hi> All these things
be speak it a very great and important design up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the heart of God is much set.</p>
               <p>Secondly, And then in the next place, as it is
an exceeding great and important design and work
of God, so it is a very <hi>hard and difficult work</hi> in
it self; a work whose difficulties surmounts the
abilities of <hi>Angels.</hi> It is certainly a work carried
on by the mighty power of God, through the
greatest oppositions imaginable. And therefore
it is noted, <hi>Rev. 3. 7.</hi> that it is the peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of Jesus Christ, who only hath the Key
of the house of <hi>David,</hi> to open the heart of a
Sinner by Faith. Men think it is an easie thing
to believe; but if you consult the Scriptures, you
will quickly be informed how grosly you mistake
the nature of this work. In <hi>Col. 2. 12.</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
Soul is said to <hi>rise with Christ, through the
faith of the operation of God, who raised him from
the dead.</hi> In the Resurrection of Christ, there
was a glorious operation of the power of God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
you know it astonished the world to hear of
it. The very same power that wrought that, must
also be put sorth to work this, or else it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be wrought. So again, <hi>Eph. 2. 8. By Grace
are ye saved through faith, and that not of your selves,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:109022:185"/>
it is the gift of God;</hi> not of your selves. You are
no more able to believe in Christ, than you were
to raise him from the dead: No more able to
come one step towards him by Faith in your own
power, than <hi>Lazarus</hi> was able to unbind himself
in the Grave, and come forth. Yea, in <hi>Eph. 1. 18,
19, 20.</hi> the work of believing is ascribed unto
the exceeding greatness of the power of God,
Nothing but power can do it; no other power
but the Almighty power of God can do it: It
exceeds the power of Ministers, yea of Angels.
Three things will evince the difficulty of this
work, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Nature of it.</item>
                     <item>2. The Subject of it.</item>
                     <item>3. The Enemies of it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, The Nature of the work of Faith which
is wholly supernatural; it is no less than the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the hearty and full consent of the Will
to take Jesus Christ with his yoke of Obedience,
<hi>Matth. 11. 29.</hi> and with his Cross of Sufferings,
<hi>Matth. 16. 24.</hi> And how far these will carry a man
into outward dangers, losses, torments, and
sufferings, who can tell? and all this upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of an unseen happiness and glory; dearest
Lusts and Corruptions must be mortified, sweetest
Pleasures and Profits in the World abandoned
and forsaken, all Reproaches, Losses, Pains and
Penalties the Devil and the World can lay upon
us for Christs sake, must be embraced and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed;
and can it be supposed that any power
beneath the Almighty Power of the Lord, any
voice except the efficacious voice of Christ, can
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:109022:185"/>
prevail with the Will to give its firm explicite
consent to such difficult and self-denying terms as
these?</p>
               <p>Secondly, Consider the <hi>Subject</hi> wrought upon,
<hi>viz.</hi> the dead, hard, obstinate heart of a blind
perverse sinner, an heart harder by Nature than
the nether Millstone. It is as easie to melt the
most obdurate Rock into a sweet Syrup, as it is
to melt the heart of a Sinner into penitential for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
for sin. What! to bring a dead heart to
life. To make that man bitterly bewail the sins
that were his pleasure and delight, more than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he bewailed the death of the nearest and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Relation in the world! To make a proud
heart renounce its own self-righteousness, which
it so dotes upon, and take all shame and reproach
to it self upon the account of sin! This is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful.
You would think it a strange thing to see
the course of the Tyde stopt with the breath of a
man; but O what a marvellous thing is here, that
at the preaching of the Gospel by a poor worm,
the Lord should turn the Tyde of the Will, and
thus work about the Soul to a ready compliance
with his most self-denying terms and proposals!</p>
               <p>Thirdly, And that which farther encreaseth
the difficulty of believing is the fierce and obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
opposition made by the Enemies of Faith:
All the powers of Hell and Earth, Devils and
Men without us, are confederate and in league
with the Corruptions within us, to res<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t and
hinder this work of believing. Never is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
more busie than when Christ and the Soul are
treating about Union. Oh the Discouragements,
Objections and Difficulties that are rowled into
the way of Faith! One while it is the highest
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:109022:186"/>
Presumption; another while it is impossible and
utterly too late: Sometimes blasphemous injecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
like fiery Darts, are shot reeking hot out of
Hell into the Soul: Otherwhile the invincible
difficulties of Religion are objected, all Losses,
Torments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> opposed unto this work: The
Tempter casts himself into a thousand shapes to
hinder the Souls passage out of Nature unto
Christ. Sometimes objecting the greatness of
sin, and sometimes the lapse and loss of the
proper season and opportunity of mercy, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the want of due <hi>qualifications</hi> to come
to Christ. Thus, and many other ways, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to rap off the fingers of Faith from
taking hold of Christ. And as every Devil in
Hell opposes this work, so every Carnal interest
we have in the world, is an Enemy to Faith. We
have Enemies enough within us, as well as without
us, both conspiring together to obstruct this work:
All things increase the difficulty of believing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, We are next to speak of the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
imployed in this great design; and these are
<list>
                     <item>1. Principal, or</item>
                     <item>2. Subordinate.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>(1.) The <hi>Principal instrument</hi> in whose efficacy
the Heart is opened, is <hi>the Spirit of God;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
whom it is impossible the design should ever
prosper; neither Ordinances, Providences, or
Ministers can successfully manage it without him.
If the Lord will make use of any Man for the
Conversion and Salvation of anothers Soul, he
may rejoyce in it; but withal must say as <hi>Peter</hi>
to the Jews, <hi>Acts 3. 12. Why look ye so earnestly on
us, as though by our own power, or holiness we had
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:109022:186"/>
made this man to walk?</hi> So may the ablest Minister
in the World say, when God blesses his labours
to the conversion of any Soul; look not upon
me, as though by the strength of my reason, or
power of my gifts, I had opened thy Soul to
Christ; this is the work of Gods Spirit, in
whose hand I am an instrument, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 7. He
that plants is nothing, and he that waters is nothing.</hi>
Nothing in himself, the very first stroak of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
which is introductive to the whole work of
conversion is justly ascribed to the Spirit, <hi>Iob. 16. 9.
The Spirit when be cometh shall convince the world of
sin.</hi> He is the Lord of all sanctifying and gracious
influences; Ordinances are but as the sayls of a
Ship, Ministers as the Seamen that manage those
sayls; the Anchor may be weighed, the sayls
spread, but when all is done, there is no sayling,
till a gale come. We preach, and pray, and you
hear; but there is no motion Christward, until
the Spirit of God (comparded to the wind, <hi>Iohn</hi>
3. 8.) blow upon them; till he illuminate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
with divine light, and bow the Will
by an Almighty power; there can be no Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
motion Heaven-ward. Now the Spirit of the
Lord is a free agent, tyed to means, time or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments;
but as at a certain time an Angel
came down upon the waters of <hi>Bethesda</hi> and put a
healing virtue into them; so it is here: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
never come to any Gospel Ordinance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
an Eye to the Spirit, on whom all their bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and efficacy depends. Oh, lift up your
Hearts for his blessing upon the means, as ever
you expect saving benefits from them.</p>
               <p>(2ly,) The Subordinate instrumental means
by which this blessed design is effectually manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the World, is the Gospel-ministry, 1 <hi>Cor.
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:109022:187"/>
3. 5. Who then is</hi> Paul, <hi>and who is</hi> Apollo, <hi>but
Ministers by whom ye believed?</hi> This is the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
stated method of begetting Faith, and though
God hath not tyed himself to this or that Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
time, or place; yet he hath tyed us to a
diligent and constant attendance upon them, <hi>Rom.
10. 14. How then shall they call on him in whom they
have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of
whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a preacher?</hi> I confess it seems a very unlikely
means, a weak and foolish method, according to
the dictate of corrupt humane wisdom; yet by
the foolishness of preaching, it pleases God to
save them that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. That which
the wisdom of Man derides, God makes effectual
unto Salvation. And oh how many are there that
will have cause to bless God to all eternity for
gifting and sending such Ministers among them,
whose Doctrin the Lord blessed unto the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Souls!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, In the next place, let us consider
the scope and intention of this great design,
wherein these instruments are employed: There
are no great designs in the World but aim at
some end to be accomplished by them. Now there
are two things in the Eye and intention of this
design, which are worthy of it;</p>
               <p>(1.) The <hi>exaltation of his own grace,</hi> and the
riches of his goodness before Angels and Men to
all eternity. The Name of God is never made
so glorious in this World, as it is by bringing
over the Hearts of Men and Women to believe.
God reaps more glory from the faith of a poor
creature that comes to Christ empty and weary,
than he doth from the other works of his Hands:
He hath not the like glory from the Sun, Moon,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:109022:187"/>
and Stars; as from such poor creatures, whose
Hearts open to Jesus Christ under the Gospel call.
Thus they are fitted to manifest the glory of his
grace, <hi>Eph. 1. 5, 6. To the praise of the glory of his
grace,</hi> &amp;c. God will have his rich and glorious
grace praised and admired by Angels and Men
for evermore; and every converted Soul is as it
were a monument erected unto the praise of his
grace. Heaven will ring with praises for ever,
that the great God would humble himself to
come into the Heart of a vile sinner, and dwell
and walk therein, as the expression is, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.
16. O this is admirable, that the high and lofty
one, who inhabits eternity, will take up his
dwelling place in a poor contrite sinner, that
trembles at his Word, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 15.</p>
               <p>(2ly,) The eternal Salvation and blessedness
of the Soul so opened to Christ, is also the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and aim of this work of opening the Heart,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 9. When the Soul of <hi>Zacheus</hi> was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by faith, <hi>This day,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>is salvation
come to this house.</hi> You do not only believe to the
glory of God, but to the Salvation of your own
Souls, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 39. The opening of our Hearts to
Christ now, is in order to the opening of Heaven
to us hereafter. This is both the <hi>finis operis &amp;
operantis,</hi> the end of the work, and intention of
the worker, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 21. It pleased God by the fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishness
of preaching, to save them that do believe.</hi>
It presently puts them into a state of Salvation,
though they be not yet actually and compleatly
saved. There is a necessary connection betwixt
Conversion and Salvation; though betwixt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
and compleat Salvation there may be
many groaning hours, sick and sad days and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:109022:188"/>
nights; but full deliverance from sin and misery
is secured to the Soul in the work of Faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.
27. <hi>Christ in you is the hope of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Thus you see this great and glorious
design projected and managed; and that this is the
very scope, aim, and intention of the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
even the opening the Hearts of sinners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ by faith, will evidently appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering
the several parts of the Gospel which
have a direct aspect upon this design; and the
declared end of the Spirit who is sent forth to
make it effectual to this very end and purpose.</p>
               <p>(1.) To this the <hi>commands</hi> of the Gospel look;
it lyes full in the Eye of the preceptive part of
the Gospel, 1 <hi>Iob. 3. 23. And this is his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that we should believe on the Name of his Son
Iesus Christ.</hi> And it is a very great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(if rightly considered) that faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted
a duty by a plain Gospel precept; for
this cuts off that vain pretence and plea of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption;
What, such a vile wretch as thou (saith
Satan) presume to believe in Christ! But this
cuts off the plea. Here's a <hi>command</hi> from the
highest Sovereignty, the contempt whereof Men
shall answer at their utmost peril.</p>
               <p>(2ly,) This also is the declared end and scope
of the Gospel <hi>promises and threatnings,</hi> whereby
the Souls of sinners are assaulted on both sides:
As for <hi>Promises,</hi> how are all the sacred pages of
the <hi>Bible</hi> adorned with them, as the Firmament
with radiant Stars! Amongst which that in the
Text seems to excel in glory, <hi>If any Man open to
me, I will come in to him.</hi> Like unto which, is that
<hi>Iohn 6. 35, 37. I am the bread of life, he that cometh
to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:109022:188"/>
shall never thirst; him that cometh to me, I will in no
wise cast out.</hi> Such rich and excellent encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to faith had never been put into the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi>
but for faiths sake; and then for Gospel
<hi>threatnings,</hi> though they have a dreadful <hi>sound,</hi>
yet they have a gracious design; what a terrible
thunder-clap is that, <hi>Iohn 3. 36. He that believeth
not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God
abideth on him?</hi> To which another Threatning
echoes with a like terrible voice, <hi>Mark 16. 16. He
that believeth not shall be damned.</hi> There be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
things, you see, threatned in the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
unbelievers; but what is the intention of
those threatnings, but to scare Men out of their
unbelief, and carnal security unto Christ? And
thus both the promises and the threatnings,
though of far different natures, conspire and
meet in the self same design, even to open the
Heart to Christ by faith.</p>
               <p>(3ly,) For the sake of this design all Gospel <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi>
and <hi>Officers</hi> are instituted and appointed,
maintained, and continued in the World unto
this day: Why did Christ at his Triumphant
ascension shed forth such variety of gifts upon
Men, but that God might dwell among them?
<hi>Psal. 68. 18. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast
led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts for
Men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God
might dwell among them.</hi> The whole frame of
Gospel ordinances is declaredly set up for this
purpose, to bring Men to Christ, and build them
up in Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12:</p>
               <p>(4ly,) All the Scripture records of converted
sinners, whose Hearts God hath in any age
opened, were made for this very purpose to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:109022:189"/>
other Souls by their examples to believe
in, or open unto Christ as they did. For this
purpose that famous and memorable conversion
of <hi>Paul</hi> was graciously recorded, 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 16.
Howbeit, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me
first, Iesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering,
for a pattern to them that should hereafter believe on
him to life everlasting.</hi> Never was any Mans Heart
bolted and made fast with stronger prejudices
against Christ, than this Mans was; yet the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of the Lord opened it: O how flexible was
his will! <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> This
gives great encouragement to other sinners to
come in to Christ as he did; and therefore when
Men shall see other sinners receiving Christ, and
themselves continue still obstinate, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving;
those very examples which God hath
set before their Eyes put a dreadful aggravation
upon their unbelief; as you may see, <hi>Matth. 21.
32. Iohn came unto you in the way of righteousness,
and ye believed him not; but the publicans and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
believed him; and ye when ye had seen it, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not afterward, that you might believe him. q. d.</hi>
Though you saw <hi>Publicans,</hi> reputed the worst of
Men, and <hi>Harlots,</hi> the worst of Women, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
humbled and brought unto faith; yet
these fights no way affected your Souls; you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
had one such reflection as this, Lord have not
I as much need to fly from the wrath to come,
and mind the Salvation of my own Soul as these?
Will it not be a dreadful aggravation of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
that such as these should obtain Christ and
Heaven, and I shut out?</p>
               <p>(5ly,) To conclude, The opening of the
Heart to Christ is the very end and errand of the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:109022:189"/>
                  <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> upon whose concurrence and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the success of all Ordinances depend; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this design he is sent expresly from Heaven,
to open the understanding and consciences of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
by conviction, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 9. For it is not in
the power of the Word alone to produce this
effect; thousands of excellent Sermons may be
preacht, and not one Heart opened by conviction.
He is expresly sent to this end and purpose. What
remains, is the Application of this Point.</p>

               <p>If the opening of the Heart to Christ, be the
great and direct intention and end of the Gospel,<note place="margin">I. Infer.</note>
                  <hi>How are they deceived that bless themselves in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of some lesser ends and intentions of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
whilst the great end, (the effectual perswasion
of the Will to Christ) is not at all effected upon
them!</hi> There are some collateral stroaks, some
by effects, as I may call them, which the Gospel
hath upon Men. It would pity a wise conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Man to see how poor Souls hug themselves
with a conceited happiness in these lesser things,
whilst they still stick fast in the state of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy.
I would seign undeceive such mistaken
wretches, who bow down under the power of
self-deceit; and that in so great and important
a Point, in which their eternal Salvation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corned.
There be two things which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coeding
apt to deceive Men in this matter, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Partial convictions on the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</item>
                     <item>2. Transe it motions upon the Affections.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="336" facs="tcp:109022:190"/>In these two things multitudes deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
as if the whole design of the Gospel were
accomplished upon them therein. (1.) Partial
Convictions upon the Understanding; light and
knowledge breaking into the mind, producing
orthodoxy of Judgment; this seems to be the
effectual opening of the Understanding to Christ,
though alas, to this day they never saw sin in its
vileness, much less their own special sin; nor
Christ in his suitableness and necessity. People that
live under the Gospel, can hardly avoid the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of their Understandings by the light
that shines upon them: Knowledge grows, Parts
thrive; these inable them to discourse and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>send
the Points of Religion excellently. Yea, it
may be from the strength of these Gifts, they
can pray with commendable variety and large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of expression: these things beget applause
from Men, and confidence in your selves, whilst
all the while, no saving influences are shed down
to quicken, change, and spiritualize the Heart.
(2.) There are transcient motions and touches
of the Gospel upon the affections, which give
some Men their melting pangs and moods, now
and then under the Word, though it never settles
into a spiritual frame, an habitual heavenliness
of temper; of such the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 5.
And this is the more dangerous, because they
now seem to have attained all that is essential to
Religion, or necessary to Salvation. For when
unto the light of their understandings, there shall
be added melting affections;<note place="margin">Mr. Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Burges in his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining.</note> a Man now seems
to be compleat in all that the Gospel requires
unto the being and constitution of a Christian,
as a great Divine speaks; for thus poor Souls
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:109022:190"/>
are apt to reason; If I had only light in my
mind, and never found any meltings of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
I might suspect my self justly to be a
hypocrite: but there are times when my <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
as well as my <hi>understanding</hi> seem to feel the
power of the Gospel. And yet these things
may be where the Heart never effectually opens
to Christ; all this may be but a morning dew,
an early cloud that vanishes away, as is plain in
<hi>Iohn</hi>'s hearers, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 35. and in <hi>Paul</hi>'s hearers,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 41. 14, 15. For except the convictions upon
the understanding be particular, and effectual,
and the motions upon the affections setled to a
heavenly habit and temper; the Man is but where
he was before, as to the real state and condition
of his Soul. Were thy understanding so convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the evil nature and dreadful consequences
of sin, and thy Affections and Will thereupon so
effectually determined to choose and embrace the
Lord Jesus upon a considerate and thorough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination
of his own Terms and Articles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
in the Gospel; then thou mightest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the great design of it were accomplished
upon thy Soul; but to rest in general <hi>convictions,</hi>
and transient <hi>affections</hi> without this, is but to
mock and deceive thy own Soul. Alas, this comes
not home to the main end of the Gospel.</p>

You have heard how all its <hi>commands, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
threatnings</hi> and <hi>examples,</hi> bear directly and
joyntly upon the Hearts of sinners, to get open
the Will to Christ. And yet how few are there

of the Hearts of Men, to batter down
their carnal reasonings, overthrow their vain
hopes, and open a fair passage for Christ into
their Soul, 2 <hi>Cor. 10. 4, 5. For the weapons of our
warfare are niot carnal, but mighty through God; to
the pulling down of strong holds, casting down imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
and every high thing that exalts it self
against the knowledge of God, and bringing into cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
every thought to the obedience of Christ.</hi> If a

thousands of shots made, and yet no breach, not

that's a strong Wall indeed. Beloved, God hath
as I may say, raised a Mount in the Gospel,
planted the great Ordinance of Heaven upon it;
discharged many dreadful vollies of threatnings,
nay he hath, as it were, come under the walls of
the unbelieving Soul, with terms of grace and
mercy, and yet no opening; O prodigious obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy!

Matth. 11. 17. Neither the sweet Airs of
Gospel Grace, nor the dreadful thunders of the
Law make any impression upon you. O what an
obdurate Rock is the Heart by nature! Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
every Christian may see enough in others,
and find enough in himself; without the help of
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:109022:191"/>
other Books, to confute the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrian
which so extolls and flatters the nature of man. It
is as possible to make an impression with your fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

in the world in its own strength, to make an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual

               <p>Is it the great design of the Gospel to open the
hearts of men to Christ, <hi>then wonder not that it
meets with such strong and fierce opposition from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
wherever it is sincerely and powerfully preached.</hi>
As for general and formal preaching, which comes
not to the quick, the <hi>Devil</hi> is not so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
about it; he knows it will do him no
great damage; nay, it fastens and secures his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the Souls of men. But wherever the
Gospel comes with spirit and power, laying the
Ax to the Root, shewing men the vanity of their
ungrounded hopes, pressing the necessity of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
and Faith, this preaching quickly gives
an alarm to Hell, and raises all manner of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
against it. <hi>What is it to preach the Gospel,</hi>
said <hi>Luther, but to derive the rage and fury of the
whole world upon us?</hi> Satan is the God of this world,
all men by Nature are his born Subjects: No Prince
on earth is more jealous of the revolt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects

liberty offered to them by Jesus Christ. Satan
suspecting the Issue of these things, bestirs himself
to purpose. O what showers of Calumnies, and
storms of Persecution doth he pour upon the
Names and Persons of Christ's faithful Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours!
certainly he owes Christ's Ministers a
spight, and they shall know and feel it, if ever
he get them within the compass of his Chain. But
let this discourage none imployed in this glorious

               <p>This is the sin that keeps the heart fast shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him. As Faith is the <hi>radical Grace,</hi> so Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
is the <hi>radical Sin.</hi> What shall I say of it?
it is the <hi>Traytors Gate</hi> through which those Souls
pass, that are to perish for ever. The Gospel
can do you no good, the Blood of Christ can yield
you no saving benefit, whilst your Souls remain
under the dominion and power of this sin. When
we consider the mighty Arguments of the Gospel,
we may wonder that all that hear them are not
immediately perswaded to Christ by them. And
on the other side, when we consider the mighty
power of Unbelief, how strongly it holds the
Soul in bondage to sin; we may admire that any
Soul is brought over to Christ by the Gospel. It
was not without cause that the <hi>Apostle</hi> puts faith
in Christ among the great Mysteries and Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Gospel, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 16.</hi> Now the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsick
evil and fearful consequences of this sin
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:109022:193"/>
of Unbelief will appear in these following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>1. Unbelief fixes the guilt of all other sins
on the person of the Unbeliever; it binds
them all fast upon his Soul, <hi>Iohn 8. 24. For if ye
believe not that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins.</hi> Dye
in thy sins man! it were better for thee to dye in
a Ditch. What more terrible can God threaten,
or man feel? This is the sin that makes <hi>the death
of Christ of none effect to us,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. There is
indeed a soveraign virtue in the Blood of Christ
to pardon sin, but thy Soul cannot have the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of it while it remains under the dominion of
this sin. As it was said of the miraculous works
of Christ, <hi>He could do no mighty works there, because
of their unbelief,</hi> Matth. 13. 58. so none of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
works, no ordinances can do thy Soul good
till the Lord break the power of this sin, <hi>Hebr.
4. 2. The word preached did not profit them, not being
mixed in faith in them that heard it.</hi> If a man were
dangerously sick, or wounded, the richest <hi>Cordial</hi>
or most soveraign <hi>Plaister</hi> in the world can never
recover him, unless received and applyed. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
spills the most soveraign Cordials of the
Gospel, as Water upon the ground. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
sins that ever thou committedst might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
did not this sin lye in the way; were this
gone, all the rest were gone too; but whilst Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief
remains, they also remain upon thee.</p>
               <p>2ly, Of all the sins that are upon the Souls of
men, this is the most difficult sin to be removed
and cured: Other sins lye more open to convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but this hath the most specious pretences to
countenance and defend it. Men commit this sin
out of a fear of sin. They will not <hi>believe,</hi> lest
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:109022:193"/>
they should <hi>presume.</hi> They dare not believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are not <hi>qualified.</hi> The strength of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sins meets in this sin of Unbelief: it is the
strongest Fort wherein Satan trusteth. Take an
Adulterer, or a profane Swearer, and you have
a fair open way to convince him of his sin: shew
him the Command he hath violated, and he hath
nothing to say in his own defence: but the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer
hath a thousand plausible defences.</p>
               <p>3ly, This is the great damning sin of the world.
I do not say but all other sins deserve damnation,
(for <hi>the wages of sin is death)</hi> but this is the sin in
the virtue whereof other sins damn and ruin the
Soul. <hi>This is the Condemnation,</hi> John 3. 19. And as
it is a damning sin, so it is a sin which damns with
aggravated damnation, 2 <hi>Thess. 1. 8.</hi> O then let
us mourn over, and tremble at this dreadful sin,
which opposes and so often frustrates the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and main end of the whole Gospel.</p>
            </div>

               <p>Is it the main scope of the Gospel to bring
men to Christ by Faith, <hi>then be perswaded heartily
to comply with this great design of the Father, Son, and
Spirit, Ministers, Ordinances, and Providences, in
opening your hearts to receive Christ this day by Faith
unfeigned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And oh that I could suitably press this great
Point, which falls in so directly with the main
stream and scope of the whole Gospel: And oh,
that whilst I am pressing it, you would list up an
hearty cry to Heaven, <hi>Lord give me faith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
else thou deny me; open my heart to Christ under
the Gospel Calls.</hi> I do not only press you to a
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:109022:194"/>
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and common assent to the Truths of the
Gospel, <hi>that Christ is come in the flesh, and laid down
his life for sinners;</hi> but unto <hi>an hearty Evangelical
consent to receive him upon Gospel terms; to close with
him in all his Offices, subjecting heart and life unto his
Authority, living entirely upon him for righteousness,
and to him by holiness.</hi> The value of such a Faith
as this, is above all estimation. For (1.) this is
the Grace which God hath dignified, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Glory and Honour above all its fellow
Graces. Its singular Praises and Encomiums are
in all the Scriptures. This is called <hi>precious faith,
2 Pet. 1. 1. Soul enriching faith, Iames 2. 5.</hi> That's
a miserable poor Soul indeed that is destitute of
it, whatever the Largesses of Providence have
been to him. And he is truly rich, to whom God
hath given Faith, whatever he hath denied him
of the comforts of this life. This Christ calls the
work of God, <hi>Iohn 6. 29. This is the work of God
that you believe.</hi> Why? so are all other things
that your eyes behold, they are the works of
God; the Earth, the Sea, the Sun, Moon and
Stars, they are his handy-work. True, they are
so; but this is <hi>the work,</hi> the most eminent, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and admirable work of God, <hi>sine pari,</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all his other works which your eyes behold.
And (2.) that which exalts and dignifies it, not
only above all the works of God's hands, but even
above its fellow Graces, the works of his Spirit,
is that high Office unto which it is appointed in
the justification of a Sinner. God hath singled
out this Grace from among all the other Graces,
to be the instrument of receiving and applying
the righteousness of Christ for the justification of
a guilty Soul, <hi>Rom. 5. 1.</hi> You are never said to be
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:109022:194"/>
justified by love, hope, or desire, but by faith.
'Tis true, all other Graces are supposed in the
person justified, but none apprehends and applies
the righteousness of Christ for justification, but
this only. And the justifying act of faith being
a receiving act, the Glory of God is therein se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,
<hi>therefore it is of Faith that it might be by
Grace.</hi> (3.) The Grace of Faith, which I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending
to you this day, is not only the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
of your Justification, but it is also the
bond of your union with Christ, <hi>Eph. 3. 17. That
Christ may dwell in your hearts by Faith.</hi> 'Tis the
uniting Grace, the Marriage Knot,'tis that which
gives interest in, and title to the person and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
of Christ. The great thing upon which the
eyes of all the awakened world are intently and
solicitously fixed. Whatever apprehensions you
have of an interest in Christ, and whatever his
benefits be worth in your eyes; neither himself,
or them can ever be obtained without Faith. O
Brethren, there is a day coming, when they that
now sleight and neglect this interest and concern
of their Souls, would gladly part with ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
worlds for a good title to Christ, could it be
purchased therewith: But it is Faith, and nothing
without Faith, that intitles you to Christ, and to
his benefits. (4.) That which should yet more
endear this Grace of Faith to you is this, that it is
the <hi>hand</hi> which receives your pardon from the
hand of Christ, the Messenger that brings a sealed
Pardon to a trembling Sinner, <hi>Acts 10. 43. And
by him all that believe are justified from all things, from
which they could not be justified by the Law of</hi> Moses.
Cleared of all those sins from which the Law could
never clear them, nor any Repentance, Restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:109022:195"/>
or Obedience of their own without Faith,
O what a welcom Messenger is Faith, and what
joyful tydings doth it bring! you would say so,
if ever you had felt the efficacy of the Law upon
your Consciences; if ever you had lain, as some
sinners have, with a cold sweating horrour upon
your panting bosoms, under the apprehensions of
the wrath God. This fruit of Faith is rather to
be admired than exprest, <hi>Psal. 32. 1.</hi> (5.) Faith
is not only the Messenger that brings you a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
from Heaven, but it is, as I may say, that
heavenly <hi>Herauld</hi> that publishes Peace in the Soul
of a Sinner. O <hi>Peace,</hi> how sweet a word art
thou! how welcom to a poor condemned Sinner!
<hi>Beautiful upon the Mountains are the feet of them that
publish peace.</hi> Now 'tis faith that brings this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
News, and publishes it in the Soul, without
which all the publishers of peace without us, can
administer but little support, <hi>Rom. 5. 1.</hi> Faith
brings the Soul out of the Storms and Tempests
with which it was tossed, into a sweet Rest and
Calm, <hi>Hebr. 4. 3. We which have believed do enter
into Rest.</hi> Is the quiet Harbour welcom to poor
weather-beaten Seamen after they have past fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
storms and many fears upon the raging Sea?
O how welcom then must Peace be to that Soul
that hath been tossed upon the tempestuous Ocean
of its own fears and terrours, blown up and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
by the terrible blasts of the Law and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?
It was a comfortable sight to <hi>Noah</hi> and
his Family to see an <hi>Olive leaf</hi> in the mouth of the
<hi>Dove,</hi> by which they knew the waters were aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But oh, what is it to hear such a voice as
this from the mouth of Faith! <hi>Fury is not in me,</hi>
saith the Lord; his anger is turned away, and he
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:109022:195"/>
comforteth thee. Fear not thou poor tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Soul, the God of Peace is thy God. (6.) Faith
doth not only bring the tempestuous Soul into a
Calm, but it is the Grace also which opens to the
Soul a door of access into the gracious presence of
God; without it there is no coming to him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably,
<hi>Hebr. 11. 6. He that cometh unto God must
believe.</hi> This liberty and access to God is indeed
the purchase of the Blood of Christ; he procur'd
it at a great Sum; But Faith is the Grace that
brings the Soul actually into the presence of God,
and there helps it to open and ease its griefs; and
with liberty of Speech to discover all its grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
fears, and burthens to the Lord. And truly,
this world were not worth the living in, without
such a blessed vent to our troubles as this is. The
Believer only hath gotten the key that opens the
door of access unto God; if he have any sins,
wants, burthens, affictions, temptations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
here he can ease them. Ah Christian, the time
may come when thy heart may be filled with sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
to the brim, and there may not be found
a person of thy acquaintance in all the world, to
whom thou canst turn to ease thy sorrows, or give
vent to thy troubles: Now blessed be God for
Faith. O the ease one act of Faith gives a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
Soul, which is like Bottles full of new Wine,
and must either vent or break! well may it be
said, <hi>The Iust shall live by Faith;</hi> how can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
we should live without it? Certainly our
Afflictions and Temptations would swallow us
up, were it not for the sweet assiduous reliefs that
come in by Faith. (7.) And yet farther to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame
your desires after Faith, this is the Grace
that gives you the Soul reviving sights of the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:109022:196"/>
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible world, without which this world would
be a dungeon to us, <hi>Heb. 11. 1.</hi> 'Tis not only the
substance of things hoped for, but the evidence
of things not seen. O'tis a precious Eye, how
transporting are those visions of faith, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8.
Whom having not seen we love, whom though now we
see him not, yet believing we rejoyce, with joy unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and full of glory.</hi> We that preach of Heaven
to you, cannot shew you the glorious person of
Christ there; nor the Thrones, Crowns, and
Palms that are above; but faith can make these
things visible. That's an Eye that can pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the Clouds, and shew you him that is invis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<hi>Heb. 11. 27.</hi> (8.) The grace of faith,
which I am recommending to you this day, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally
the livelyhood of your Souls in this
World, <hi>Hab. 2. 4. The just shall live by his faith.</hi>
When God gives a Soul faith, he gives it him for
a livelyhood, and expects he should keep house
upon it, while he is in this World; and God
reckons he hath made plentiful provision for your
Souls, when he hath given them faith, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
out such variety of precious promises for
your faith to feed upon. <hi>Abraham, Moses, David,</hi>
and all the Saints kept house upon no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
but what faith brought in, and at what a
high and excellent rate did they live? Here Man
eateth Angels food. 'Tis a store-house of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi>
'tis a shop of <hi>Cordials, I had fainted, unless I
had believed,</hi> Psal. 27. 13. A believer lives the
highest life of all Men upon earth; and as the
believers Soul is dayly fed by faith, so all the
other graces in his Soul are maintained and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
supported by the provisions faith brings them
in. The other graces (as one saith) like the
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:109022:196"/>
young birds in the nest, live upon that provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this grace of faith gathers for them, and puts
into their mouths. Take away faith, and you
quickly starve the Soul of a Christian; will not
all this engage your desires after faith? Why
then (9.) consider this is the grace whereby we
dye safely, as well as live comfortably; as you
cannot live comfortably without it in this World,
so neither can you dye safely or comfortably
without it when you go out of this World, <hi>Heb.
11. 13. These all dyed in faith, not having received
the promises; but having seen them a far off, and
were perswaded of them, and embraced them.</hi> Mark
here, how these excellent persons died; they all
died embracing the promises in the arms of their
faith. An allusion to two dear friends, hugging
one another at their parting. O precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
saith the dying believer; of what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable
use and benefit have you been to me all
the days of my pilgrimage! You are they to
whom I was wont to turn in all my troubles and
distresses; but I am now going into the life of
immediate Vision, farewel blessed Promises,
Scriptures, Ordinances and Communion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
Saints; I shall walk no more by faith,
but by sight. (10.) In a word, and that a great
word to; this is the grace that saves you, <hi>Eph.
2. 8. By grace are you saved, through faith.</hi> Your
salvation is the fruit of free grace; but grace it
self will not save you in any other method, but
that of believing. The grace of God runs
down through the channel of faith; faith is the
grace that espouses your Souls to Christ here, and
accompanies it every step of the way until it
come to his full enjoyment in Heaven; and then
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:109022:197"/>
is swallowed up in vision. It <hi>embarques</hi> you
with Christ, and <hi>Pilots</hi> you through the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Seas, till you drop Anchor in the Haven of
everlasting rest and safety; where you receive
the end of your faith, the salvation of your Souls
O then in consideration of the incomparable
worth, and absolute necessity of this precious
grace; make it your great study, make it your
constant cry to Heaven night and day; Lord
give me a believing Heart, an opening Heart to
Jesus Christ. If you fail of this, you come short
of the great end and design of the whole Gospel,
which is to bring you to faith, and by faith to
Heaven.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:109022:198"/>First, <hi>What Christs coming in to the Soul intends;</hi>
and in general, I must say, this is a great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
which will not be fully understood, till we
come to Heaven, <hi>Iohn 14. 20. At that day you shall
know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in
you.</hi> Then the <hi>essential union</hi> of Christ and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the <hi>mystical union</hi> between believers
and Christ will be more clearly understood, than
we are capable to understand them in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
state: yet for present so much is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
as may justly astonish poor sinners at
the marvelous condescension of the Lord Jesus
to them. More particularly, this expression, <hi>I
will come in to him,</hi> imports no less than his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
such a Soul to himself; for he comes in
with a design to dwell in that Soul by faith,
<hi>Eph. 3. 17.</hi> to make such a man a mystical member
of his body, flesh, and bones, <hi>Eph. 5. 30.</hi> which is
the highest honour the Soul of man is capable of;
indeed, this coming of Christ into the Soul of a
sinner, doth not make him one <hi>person</hi> with Christ,
that is the singular honour to which our nature is
advanced by the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion;</hi> but this
makes a person mystically one with Christ, and
though it be beneath the <hi>Hypostatical Vnion,</hi> yet
it is more than a meer <hi>Foederal Vnion.</hi> Christs
coming into the Soul signifies more than his
coming into Covenant with it, for it is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of such a person into a mystical Union
with himself by the imparting of his Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; as the vital sap of the stock coming into
the grass, makes it one with the stock, <hi>Iohn 15. 5.</hi>
So the coming of Christs Spirit into the Soul
makes it a member of his mystical body; and
this is a glorious supernatural work of God,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:109022:199"/>
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. most honorable, most comfortable,
and for ever sure and indissoluble;<note place="margin">Method of Grace, p. 25</note> as I have else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
more fully shewed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, I shall evidence the
truth and certainty of this most comfortable
point, that Christ will come in, and that with sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
refreshments and comforts, to every Soul
that hears his voice, and opens to him. No present
unworthyness, or former rebellions shall bar out
Christ, or obstruct his entrance into such a Soul.
Whatever thou hast been, or done; all that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
Christ will come into thee, and
dwell with thee; and make thy Soul an habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for himself through the Spirit, <hi>Eph. 2. 22.</hi> I
say, let thy Heart but open to him and he will
both fill and feast thee, with <hi>a non obstante,</hi> as to
all thy former miscarriages.</p>
               <p>I know it is the common discouragement that
multitudes of convinced humbled sinners lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
who seeing so much vileness in their natures,
and practices; cannot be perswaded that ever the
Lord Jesus will cast an Eye of favour on them;
much less, take up his abode in them. What,
dwell in such a Heart as mine, which hath been
an habitation of Devils, a sink, a puddle of sin
from my beginning! This is hard to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
but sinner, thou hast the word of a King
from Heaven for it; a word whose credit was
never crackt or stained from the first moment it
was spoken; that whatever thy former or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
vileness or unworthiness hath been, or is;
he will not be shy of such a Soul as thou art, if
thou be but willing to open to him; thy great
unworthiness shall be no bar to his union with
thee, <hi>If any man open, I will come in to him, &amp;c.</hi> For,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="355" facs="tcp:109022:199"/>
First, If personal unworthiness were sufficient
to bar Christ out of thy Soul, it would equally
bar him out of all the Souls in the World; for
all are unworthy as well as thy self. Where-ever
Christ finds sinfulness, he finds unworthiness;
and to be sure he finds this where-ever he comes.
Christ never expected to find worthiness in thee,
but it highly pleases him to find thee under a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
sense of thy personal unworthiness, <hi>Ier.
3. 13. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast
transgrest against the Lord thy God,</hi> &amp;c. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
prodigal acknowledged to his Father, <hi>I
am not worthy to be called thy Son,</hi> Luke 15. 18, 19.
But this did not bar his access to, or hinder his
acceptance by his Father. All that come to God
to be justified, must see and confess their own
vileness, and come to him as one that justifieth
the ungodly, <hi>Rom. 4. 5.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Thy former vileness and present
unworthiness can be no bar to Christs entrance,
because it can be no <hi>surprize</hi> to him. He knew
thou wast an unworthy Soul when he made the
first overture of grace and reconciliation to
thee; and if thy unworthiness hindred not the
beginning of his treaty with thee, it shall not
hinder the closing and finishing act thereof in his
union with thee. <hi>I knew that thou wast a transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor
from the womb,</hi> Isa. 48. 8.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ never yet came into any Soul
where Satan had not the possession before him.
Every Soul in which Christ now dwels, was once
in Satans power and possession, <hi>Acts 26. 18. To
turn them from darkness to light, and from the power
of Satan to God. So Luke 11. 21, 22. When a strong
man armed keepeth his pallace, his goods are in peace.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:109022:200"/>
But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and
overcome him; he taketh from him all his armour
wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thy present vileness and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
can be no bar to Christs entrance into thy
Soul, because Christ never yet objected to any
man his <hi>unworthiness,</hi> but his <hi>unwillingness</hi> to come
unto him, <hi>Iohn 5. 40. You will not come unto me,
that you might have life.</hi> And again, <hi>Matth. 23. 37.
How oft would I have gathered thy Children, and ye
would not?</hi> Indeed, you find something like a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse
from Christ to that poor <hi>Canaanitess, Mat. 15.
24, 26. Lord help me,</hi> said that poor distressed Soul;
<hi>but he answered and said, It is not meet to take the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bread, and cast it to dogs.</hi> However harshly
and discouragingly these words sound, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it was none of Christs intent to damp and
discourage her faith, but to draw it forth to a
more excellent and intense degree; which effect
it obtained, <hi>vers. 27.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, Neither would Christ have made the
tenders of mercy so large and indefinite, had
he intended to have shut out any Soul upon the
single account of personal unworthiness, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
it be but willing to come unto him. Cast
thine Eye, poor discouraged Soul, upon Christs
invitations and proclamations of grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the Gospel, and see if thou canst find any
thing beside unwillingness, as a bar betwixt thee
and mercy; harken to that voice of mercy, <hi>Isa.
55. 1. Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the
waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and
eat; come, buy wine and milk without money, and
without price. (i. e.)</hi> without personal desert, or
worthiness: So again, <hi>Rev. 22. 17. The Spirit and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:109022:200"/>
the bride say come, and let him that is athirst come;
and whosoever will, let him take the water of life free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
Here you see personal vileness and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is no obstacle in the way of Christ. Once
more, see <hi>Iohn 7. 37. In the last day, that great
day of the feast, Iesus stood and cried, saying, If
any man thirst, let him come to me and drink.</hi> Thus
you see what Christs coming into the Soul is,
and what evidences there are, that when once
the Soul is made truly willing, Christ will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
come into it; and no former vileness or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
unworthiness shall be a bar to obstruct his
entrance.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, In the next place, I shall shew you,
That when Christ comes into the Soul he will
not come empty handed. 'Tis Christs <hi>marriage
day,</hi> and he will make it a good day; a festival
day; bringing such comforts along with him, as
the Soul never tasted before; he spreads as it
were a Table, furnishes it with the delicates of
Heaven: <hi>I will sup with him,</hi> saith the Text: What
those Spiritual mercies are which Christ brings a
long with him to the opening willing Soul, comes
next in order to be spoken to. And</p>
               <p>1. When Christ comes into the Soul of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he brings a <hi>Pardon</hi> with him, a full, a free,
and a final pardon of all the sins that ever that
Soul committed. This is a feast of it self;
good cheer indeed: Christ thought it to be so
when he told the poor Palsey-man, <hi>Matth. 9. 2.
Son be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi> He
doth not say, Be of good cheer, thy Palsey is
cured, thy body recovered from the grave; but
<hi>be of good cheer, thy sins are pardoned.</hi> O how
sweetly may the pardoned Soul feed upon this!
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:109022:201"/>
And this is not any peculiar mercy, designed for
some special favorites, but what is common to
all believers, <hi>Acts 13. 43. By him all that believe,
are justified from all things.</hi> Christ and pardon
come together; and without a pardon no other
mercy would relish; no feast, no musick, no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or honour, have any favour or comfort with
them to a condemned man; but the comfort of
a pardon reaches to the very Heart, <hi>Isa. 40. 1, 2.
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith the Lord;
Speak comfortably to</hi> Jerusalem, or as in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,
<hi>Speak to the heart of</hi> Jerusalem. But what
are the ingredients of that cordial that will
comfort <hi>Ierusalems</hi> Heart? Why, <hi>Say unto her
that her iniquities are pardoned;</hi> that carries along
with it the Spirit of all consolation.</p>
               <p>And there are four things in the pardon of sin
that make it the sweetest mercy that ever the
Soul tasted; comfort which is impossible to be
communicated to another, with the same sense
that the pardoned Soul hath of it, <hi>Rev. 2. 17.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, That which makes the pardon of sin
ravishingly sweet, is the <hi>trouble</hi> that went before
it. The labourings and restless tossings of the
troubled Soul, which were antecedent to this
pardon, make the ease and peace that follows by
it incomparably sweet. As the bitterness of Hell
was tasted in the sorrows of sin, so the sweetness
of Heaven is tasted in the pardon of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The nature of the mercy it self is
incomparably sweet; for it is a mercy of the
first rank. Pardon is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uch a mercy as admits no
comfort to come before it, nor any just cause of
discouragement can follow after it. If God have
not spoken pardon to the Soul, it can have no
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:109022:201"/>
fetled ground for joy, <hi>Ezek. 33. 10.</hi> And if he
have, there can be no just ground for dejection,
whatever the troubles be that lye upon it, <hi>Isa.
33. 24. The inhabitants shall not say, I am sick: the
people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The third thing that makes this
mercy delicious, and ravishingly sweet to the
Soul; are the properties of it, which are four.
(1.) God writes upon thy pardon <hi>frank;</hi> 'tis a
free mercy, which cost thee nothing, <hi>Rom. 3. 24.
Being justified freely by his grace. Thou hast bought
me no sweet Cane with money, yet I, even I am be
that blotteth out thy transgression, for my own names
sake.</hi> (2.) God writes upon thy pardon <hi>full,</hi> as
well as <hi>free,</hi> the pardon extends to all the sins
that ever thou committedst, <hi>Acts 13. 43. By him
all that believe, are justified from all things.</hi> The
sins of thy nature, and practice; the sins of thy
youth, and age; great sins, and lesser sins, are
all comprehended within thy pardon. Thou art
acquitted not from one, but from all! Certainly,
the joy of Heaven must come down in the mercy
of remission. O what a feast of fat things with
marrow, is this single mercy; a pardon free
without price, full without exception! And then
(3.) its <hi>final,</hi> without revocation; the pardoned
Soul never more comes into condemnation: <hi>Thine
iniquities are removed from thee as far as the East
is from the West;</hi> as those two opposite points of
Heaven can never meet, so the pardoned Soul
and its pardoned Sins can never more meet unto
condemnation, <hi>Psal. 103. 12. (4.)</hi> God writes upon
the pardon another word, as sweet as any of the
rest, and that is <hi>sure.</hi> 'Tis a standing mercy
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:109022:202"/>
never to be recall'd, vacated or annulled, <hi>Rom.</hi>
8. 33, 34, 35. The challenge is sent to Hell and
Earth, Men and Devils; <hi>Who shall lay any thing to
the charge of Gods elect? 'Tis God that justifies, who
is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died,</hi> &amp;c.
Who can arrest when the Creditor dischargeth?
Who can sue the bond, when the debt is paid?
<hi>'Tis Christ that died.</hi> The Table is spread, and
the first mercy served in, is the pardon of sin.
<hi>Eat, O friends, drink, yea, drink abundantly O be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</hi>
Now the labouring Conscience that rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and tossed upon the waves of a thousand fears,
may drop Anchor and ride quiet in the pacifique
Sea of a pardoned State. What joy must stream
through the Conscience, when the sweetness of
that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 1. shall be pressed into thy
cup of Consolation! The pardoned Soul may
speak and think of Death and Judgment without
consternation; yea, may look upon it <hi>as a time of
refreshing from the presence of the Lord,</hi> Acts 3. 19.
This is heavenly Manna, the sweetness of it
swallows up all expression, all conceptions; no
words, no thoughts, can comprehend the riches
of this mercy.</p>
               <p>II. And yet this is not all, behold another
mercy in consequence unto this, brought in to
refresh and cheer the consenting Soul, and that
is peace with God. Pardon and peace go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Rom. 5. 1. Being justified by faith, we have
peace with God.</hi> Peace is a word of a vast com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension;
peace in the language of the Old
Testament, comprehends all Temporal good
things, 1 <hi>Sam. 25. 6.</hi> And peace in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
comprehends all Spiritual mercies,
2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 3. 16. the blessings of Heaven and Earth
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:109022:202"/>
are wrapt up in this word. The Soul that opens
to Christ hath peace of reconciliation in Heaven,
the enmity that was betwixt God and that Soul
is taken away through the blood of Christ, <hi>Isa.</hi>
12. 1, 2. <hi>O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast
angry with me, thine anger is turned away, and thou
comfortest me.</hi> This must be an invaluable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
for the purchase of it cost the blood of
Christ, <hi>Isa. 53. 5. The chastisement of our peace was
upon him.</hi> He made peace by the blood of his
Cross, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20. and this peace of reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is setled by Christ upon a firm foundation.
His blood gives it a more firm and steady basis
and foundation than that of the Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 54. 10. And that which makes it so
firm and sure, is the <hi>Advocateship</hi> of Jesus Christ
in Heaven, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 1. 2. If any man sin, we have
an Advocate with the Father.</hi> There is also peace
in the believers Conscience, peace as it were by
<hi>Proclamation</hi> from Heaven; and this is built upon
the peace of <hi>Reconciliation.</hi> We cannot have the
the sense of peace, till we are brought into a
state of peace; the latter is the result of the
former. And this is a special part of that supper
Christ provides to entertain the Soul that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
it. How sweet this is, is better felt than
spoken. A dreadful sound was lately in the Ears
of the Law-condemned sinner; but now his
Heart is the seat of peace. And this peace is
(1.) the Souls gard against all inward and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
terrors, <hi>Phil. 4. 7. The peace of God shall
keep</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or as the word is, <hi>guard your hearts
and minds.</hi> The persons of Princes are secured
by guards of armed and valiant Men, who watch
while they sleep. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> had his royal
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:109022:203"/>
guard, because of fear in the night, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3. 7, 8.
This peace of God, Christian, is thy life-guard,
and secures thee better than <hi>Solomons</hi> threescore
valiant men, that were about him. Time was
when thou wast affraid to sleep, for fear thou
shouldst awake in Hell: Now thou maist say with
<hi>David, I will both lay me down and sleep, for thou
Lord makest me to dwell in safety.</hi> Now, come life,
come death; the Soul is safe, the peace of God
is its royal guard. (2.) This peace is <hi>ease</hi> as
well as <hi>safety</hi> to the Soul; 'Tis heart-ease; no
sooner doth God speak peace to the Conscience,
but the Soul finds it self at ease and rest, <hi>Heb. 4.
3. We which have believed, do enter into rest.</hi> It is
with such a Soul as it was with the <hi>Dove, Noah</hi>
sent out of the <hi>Ark;</hi> that poor creature wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in the Air, as long as her wings could car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
her; had her strength fail'd, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the waters to receive her. O how sweet
was rest in the Ark? (3.) This peace is news
from Heaven, and the sweetest tydings that ever
blest the sinners Ear, next unto Christ, <hi>Heb. 12.
24. The blood of Christ speaketh better things than
that of</hi> Abel. And you are come to this blood
of sprinkling, the same day and hour that Christ
is come into your Souls. This is the voice of that
blood, <hi>Thou hast sinned, I have satisfied; Thou hast
kindled the wrath of God, And I have quencht it.</hi>
The Angels of Heaven cannot feed higher;
their joys are not more delicious than those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for believers are, whereof this is a foretast;
whatever circumstances of trouble a man be in,
this effectually relieves him. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were
in sad circumstances, shut up in the inner-prison,
their feet made fast in the stocks, their cruel
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:109022:203"/>
keeper at the door, their execution designed in a
few days: God did but set this dish upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
before the prisoners, and they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to sing at the feast, <hi>Acts 16. 25. At midnight
they sang,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>III. After these two royal dishes, <hi>Pardon,</hi> and
<hi>Peace,</hi> a third will come in, <hi>viz. Ioy in the Holy
Ghost;</hi> this is somewhat beyond peace, 'tis the
very quintessence and Spirit of all Consolation.
The Kingdom of God is said to consist in it, <hi>Rom.
14. 17.</hi> 'tis somewhat near to the joy of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,
<hi>1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8. 'tis Heaven upon Earth. All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
do not immediately attain it, but one
time or other God usually gives them a taste of
it; and when he doth, it is as it were a short Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
O who can tell what that is which the
Apostle calls, <hi>The shedding abroad of the love of God
into the Heart, by the Holy Ghost, which is given to
us!</hi> Rom. 5. 5. It is a joy which wants an Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet
to express the sweetness of it, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8.
Ioy unspeakable and full of glory.</hi> It hath the very
scent and taste of Heaven in it, and there is but
a gradual difference betwixt it, and the joy of
Heaven. This joy of the Holy Ghost, is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
cheeriness, streaming through the Soul of a
believer upon the Spirits testimony, which clears
his interest in Christ, and glory. No sooner
doth the Spirit shed forth the love of God into
the believers Heart, but it streams and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows
with joy. Joy is no more under that Souls
command; and this will evidently appear, if
you consider the matter of it; it arises from the
light of Gods countenance, <hi>Psal. 4. 6, 7.</hi> the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
<hi>1 Pet. 1. 8. Whom having not seen we
love,</hi> &amp;c. The Soul is transported with joy, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:109022:204"/>
with the glory and excellency of Christ.
Didst thou ever see this Christ whom thy Soul is
so ravished with? No, I have not seen him, yet
my Soul is transported with so much love to
him; <hi>Whom having not seen, we love.</hi> But if thou
never sawest him, how comes thy Soul to be so
delighted and ravished with him? why, though
I never saw him by the Eye of sense, yet I do see
him by the Eye of faith; and by that sight my
Soul is flooded with spiritual joy. <hi>Believing we
rejoyce.</hi> But what manner of joy is that which
you taste? why, no Tongue can express that, <hi>for
it is joy unspeakable.</hi> But how are Christ and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
turned into such ravishing joys to the Soul?
why, the Spirit of the Lord gives the believing
Soul not only a light to discern the transcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
excellency of these spiritual objects; but a
sight of his interest in them also. This is my
Christ, and this the glory prepared for me;
without interest, Heaven it self cannot be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into joy. <hi>My Soul rejoyceth in God my Saviour,
Luke 1. 47.</hi> We read, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. of some that
shall have a sight of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi>
and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and
yet a sight without joy; a dreadful sight to them,
for want of a joint interest with them in that
glory. They shall see, and yet wail and weep,
and gnash their teeth: But an interest sealed
gives joy unspeakable. Now as to the excellency
of this joy, it will be found to be the pleasant
light of the Soul; light and joy are <hi>Synonimous</hi>
terms in Scripture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. 11. 'Tis as the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
light of the Morning after a sad and dismal
Night. You that have sat in darkness and the
shadow of death, you that have sat mourning in
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:109022:204"/>
the dark without one glimpse of a promise, you
that have convers'd with nothing but dismal
thoughts of Hell and Wrath; O I shall be cast
away for ever! What will you say when after
all this darkness, the Day-star shall arise in your
hearts, the joy of Heaven shall beam upon your
Souls? Will not this be a glorious reward for
all your self-denyal for Christ? and fully recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense
for the frowns of carnal relations for giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
entertainment to Christ? This joy of the
Lord, if there were no other Heaven, is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant
recompense. This joy of the Lord
shall be your strength, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 10. Let God but
give a man or woman a little of this Joy into his
heart, and he shall presently feel himself strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
by it, either to do or to suffer the will of God.
Now he can pray with enlargement, hear with
comfort, meditate with delight; and if God
call him to suffer, this Joy shall strengthen him
to bear it. This was it that made the <hi>Martyrs</hi>
go singing to the stake. This therefore tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends
all the joys of this lower world: There
are sinful pleasures, men find in the fulfilling
their lusts: There are sensitive joys that men
find in the good creatures of God, filling their
hearts with food and gladness: There are also
delusive joys, false comforts that <hi>Hypocrites</hi> find
in their ungrounded hopes of Heaven. The joys
of the Sensualist are <hi>bruitish,</hi> the joys of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
are ensnaring and vanishing; but the
joys of the Holy Ghost are solid, sweet, and lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the fulness of everlasting joy. This is the
third heavenly dainty you may expect to feed
on, if you open your hearts to receive Christ by
Faith, else you have all the consolation that
ever you must expect.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:109022:205"/>
IV. We read in Scripture of the <hi>Sealings of the
Spirit,</hi> a choice and blessed Priviledg of Believers
consequent upon believing, <hi>Eph. 1. 13. In whom
after that ye believed, ye were sealed,</hi> &amp;c. This then
may be expected, by every Soul that opens to
Christ, how rich soever the comforts of it be.
The Spirit indeed seals not before Faith, for then
he should set his Seal to a Blank; but he usually
seals after believing, and that as the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.
Note here, the <hi>Agent</hi> or Person sealing,
<hi>the Spirit,</hi> he knows the counsels, thoughts, and
purposes of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11. He also is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
to this work; and being the Spirit of
truth, he cannot deceive us. There is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Seal spoken of in Scripture; one referring
to God's eternal foreknowledge and choice of
men, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 19. Nevertheless the foundation of
God standeth sure, having this seal, the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
who are his, (i. e.)</hi> the Lord perfectly knows
every Soul that belongs to him, through the
world. But now what comfort is this to a poor
Believer, that God knows who are his? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
there is another sealing referring to the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
as his act upon Believers, to make them
know that they are his. The first is general, <hi>The
Lord knoweth who are is:</hi> But this is particular,
<hi>The Lord knoweth thee to be his.</hi> This is joyful
news indeed: the former makes it sure in it self,
the latter makes it sure to us. Now this is a
most glorious priviledge, a work of the Spirit
which hath a most ravishing delicious sweetness
in it; and that which makes it so, is (1) The
weightiness of the matter sealed to, which is no
less than Christ, and the eternal Inheritance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
by his Blood. This Seal secures our Title
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:109022:205"/>
to Christ, and to the eternal glory: We are
<hi>sealed to the day of redemption.</hi> The sealed Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
can say, Christ, how great, how glorious
soever he be, is my Christ; the Covenant of
Grace, and all the invaluable promises contained
in it are mine.</p>
               <p>(2.) The <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>quietness</hi> which follows it,
makes it an invaluable mercy; this brings the
anxious solicitous Mind and Conscience to rest
and peace. O what a mercy is it to have all those
knots untied, those objections answer'd, those
fears banished, under which the doubting Soul
so long laboured, and which kept it so many
nights waking and restless! God only knows at
what rate some poor Creatures live under the
scarings of their own Consciences, and frequent
fears of Hell: And what an inconceivable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
it would be to them to be delivered at once
from their dangers and fears, which hold them
under a Spirit of Bondage? Open to Christ, and
thou art in the way to such a deliverance, <hi>Come
unto me and I will give you rest,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi>
11. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>(3.) This sealing of the Spirit which follows
upon believing, will <hi>establish the Soul in Christ,</hi>
confirm it and settle it in the ways of God,
which is an unspeakable priviledge, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 22.
Now he which establisheth us with you in Christ is
God, who also hath sealed us.</hi> Mark how establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
follows sealing. New temptations may
come, great persecutions and sore afflictions may
come; but how well is that Soul provided for
them all, that hath the sealings of the Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the day of redemption? Yea, though the Soul
that was sealed should for the present be under
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:109022:206"/>
new darkness, new temptations and fears; yet
former sealing will give establishment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
when the thoughts run back to the sealing
day, and a man remembers how clear God once
made his title to Christ, Well then, open to
Christ, if ever you expect to be sealed to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
If you continue to despise and reject the
tenders of Christ in the Gospel, whilst others
that embrace him are <hi>sealed to redemption:</hi> Your
unbelief and final rejection of Christ will seal
you up to the <hi>day of damnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>V. And lastly, we read likewise in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of the <hi>Earnest of the Spirit.</hi> This is three
times mentioned in the Scriptures, <hi>Eph. 1. 14.
Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the purchasad possession,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 22.
where it is joyned with the former priviledge of
sealing, <hi>Who hath also sealed us, and given the
earnest of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> And again,
2 <hi>Cor. 5. 5. He that hath wrought us for the self same
thing is God, who also hath given unto us the earnest
of the Spirit.</hi> The word is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> originally a
<hi>Syriak</hi> word: The <hi>Greeks</hi> are supposed to get it
from the <hi>Phonician Merchants,</hi> with whom they
traded; and it notes a part paid in hand to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
a bargain for the whole. There are two
things in an <hi>earnest.</hi> (1) It is part of the sum
or inheritance: If it were a contract for a sum
of mony, then it was a small part of a greater
parcel: If for an Inheritance, then the earnest
is a taking a part of the Inheritance, as a twig or
turf, part of the whole. Now the Spirit of God
chooses this word on purpose to signifie two great
things to his People by it.</p>
               <p>(1.) That those comforts communicated by
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:109022:206"/>
the Spirit to Believers are of the same kind with
the Joys of Heaven, though in a far inferiour
degree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. called there <hi>Ioy unspeakable and
full of glory,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 23. called there, <hi>The first-fruits
of the Spirit.</hi> The First-Fruits and the Crop
or Harvest are one in kind. Surely there is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Heaven as well as Hell tasted by men
in this world: Hell is begun here in the terrors
of some mens Consciences; and Heaven also is
begun here in the absolution, peace and comfort
of other mens Consciences.</p>
               <p>(2.) As an earnest is part of the sum or inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance,
so the use and end of it is confirmation
and security; as much as to say, Take this in
part till the whole be paid: yea, take it for thy
security that the whole shall be paid. Believers
have a double pledge or earnest for Heaven; one
in the person of Christ, who is entred into that
glory for them, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 2, 3. The other in the
joys and comforts of the Spirit, which they feel
and taste in themselves. These are two great
securities, and the design of God in giving us
these earnests and foretasts of Heaven, are not
only to settle our minds, but to whet our indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
that we may long the more earnestly, and
labour the more diligently for the full possession.
The Lord sees how apt we are to flag in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit
of Heavenly Glory: and therefore gives his
People a taste, an earnest of it, to excite their
diligence in the pursuits of it. God deals with
his People in this case, as with <hi>Israel;</hi> they had
been forty years in the Wilderness, many sore
temptations they had there encountred; at last
they were come upon the very borders of <hi>Canaan;</hi>
but then their hearts began to faint; there were
<pb n="870" facs="tcp:109022:207"/>
                  <hi>Anakims, Gyants</hi> in the Land, poor <hi>Israel</hi> feared
they should not stand before them; but <hi>Ioshua</hi>
sends Spies into the Land, who returning, bring
the first-fruits of <hi>Canaan</hi> to them, whereby they
saw what a goodly Country it was; and then
the fear of the <hi>Anakims</hi> began to vanish, and a
spirit of Courage to revive in the People. Thus
it is even with the <hi>Borderers</hi> upon Heaven; tho'
we be near that blessed Land of promise, yet our
hearts are apt to faint upon a prospect of those
great sufferings without us, and those conflicts
with corruptions we feel within us: But one
taste of the first fruits of Heaven, like those
grapes of <hi>Eshcol,</hi> revive our Spirits, rouze our
Zeal, and quicken our pursuits of blessedness.
For these reasons God will not have all of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
reserved till we come thither. And now tell
me, you that have tasted these first-fruits of the
Spirit, (1) Is there not something in faith of
that <hi>glorified Eye,</hi> by which the pure in heart do
see God in Heaven? <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 8. O that eye of
Faith! that precious eye! which comes as near
to the glorified eye, as any thing in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
state can come, 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Whom having not
seen ye love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet
believing ye rejoyce, with joy unspeakable and full of
glory.</hi> (2) Is there not something of that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
<hi>love</hi> to be felt in an inferiour degree by the
Saints in this world? What else can we make of
that transport of the Spouse, <hi>Cant. 2. 5. Stay me
with flagons, comfort me with apples, for I am sick
of love?</hi> 'Tis true, our love to God in Heaven is
much more servent, pure, and constant; yet these
high-raised acts of spiritual love have a tast and
relish of it. (3) Is there not something here of
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:109022:207"/>
that <hi>heavenly delight</hi> wherewith the glorified de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in God? As the visions of God are begun
on earth, so the heavenly delights are begun here
also. Some drops of that delight are let fall
here, <hi>Psal. 94. 19. In the multitude of the thoughts I
had within me, thy comforts delight my Soul. David</hi>'s
heart, 'tis like, had been full of sorrow and
trouble; a sea of gall and wormwood had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed
his Soul: God lets fall but a drop or two
of heavenly delight, and all is turned into sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and comfort. (4) Is there not something
here of that transformation of the Soul into the
image of God, which is compleat in Heaven, and
a special part of the glory thereof? 'Tis said in
1 <hi>Iohn 3. 2. We shall be like him, for me shall see him
as he is.</hi> This is Heaven, this is glory, to have
the Soul moulded into full conformity with God;
something thereof is experienced in this world:
O that we had more! 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. But we all with
open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the
Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory
to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> (5) Is there
not something felt here of the ravishing sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God's presence in Ordinances and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
which is a faint shadow at least, of the joys
of his glorious presence in Heaven? there is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
a felt presence of God, a sensible nearness
unto God at some times, and in some duties of
Religion, wherein his name is as an oyntment
poured forth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. something that is felt
beyond and above all the comforts of this world.
(6) In a word, the joys of Heaven are unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Joys; no words can make known to others
what they are. When <hi>Paul</hi> was caught up into
<hi>Paradice,</hi> he heard unspeakable words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4.
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:109022:208"/>
And are there not times even in this life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Saints do feel that which no words can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press?
1 <hi>Pet. 1. 8. Rev.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Now, if such earnests of the Spirit do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
after believing; if opening the Soul to
Christ do bring it into these Suburbs of Heaven;
who then would not receive Christ into his Soul,
and such an heaven upon earth with him? And
thus I have shewed you what some of those hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
rarities are with which Christ entertains
Believers upon earth, the fulness and perfection
whereof is reserved for Heaven, and hereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
to the opening or believing Soul: which
was the first thing to be discovered.</p>
               <p>Secondly. Next we shall enquire into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
why Christ thus entertains, feasts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshes
the Soul that receives him. And</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Reas.</note> This he doth to express the great joy
and satisfaction his Soul hath in the faith and
obedience of poor Sinners. We read, <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 11.
of the hard travel of Christs Soul, and the great
satisfaction he hath in the fruit and issue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<hi>He shall see of the travel of his Soul, and shall
be satisfied.</hi> O what pleasure and satisfaction
doth it give him to behold the eternal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
of God, and sore travels of his Soul brought
to such a birth! there is no pleasure like it, to the
Soul of Christ in this world. As it is abundant
satisfaction to a man to behold the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a design upon which he hath laid out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thoughts, and much cost, at last happily fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed:
Or as it is to a Woman that hath had a
hard labour, a sore travel for a Child, to behold
the fruit of her Womb, to embrace and smile
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:109022:208"/>
upon that Child she travail'd for. So and much
more than so it is to Christ; and therefore as
the Father of the Prodigal manifested the Joy
of his heart for the return of his Son, (who was
to him as dead and lost) by a feast and musick:
So doth Christ here answerably manifest the
content and satisfaction of his Soul, by entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Believer with these royal dainties of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:
'tis the Souls welcom home to Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Reas.</note> This Christ doth to relieve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh
poor distressed Souls, who have endured so
many fears and sorrows from the time of their
first conviction, until this day of their union
with Christ by Faith. The way of faith is a very
humbling way; there's much cutting work in
antecedent convictions and humiliations, sad
nights and sick days with many poor Souls; and
these things bring them very low: They see the
Law broken by sin, wrath hanging over them in
the threatnings, the bitter tast thereof they
have in their consciences; they have dwelt with
fears and horrors a long time, and they need suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
and support, which the Lord Jesus is now
resolved to give them, lest the spirit fail before
him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 16. He delights to comfort them
that are cast down, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 6. Christ is of a
compassionate nature, he is as ready as able to
succour them that are tempted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 18. That
word which we render <hi>Succour,</hi> signifies to run in
by way of help, at the cry of one that is in
distress. Many emphatical cries have gone up to
Heaven from the distressed sin-sick Soul; these
the compassionate Jesus hears, and now comes in
seasonably to succour and refresh it: He hath
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:109022:209"/>
rich Cordials for fainting hours: the Soul hath
had a bitter <hi>break-fast,</hi> and therefore Christ will
give it a comfortable <hi>Supper, I will come in to him,
and sup with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3. Reas.</note> Those that open their hearts to
Christ must expect to meet great troubles, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
and temptations in that new course
whereinto they are entred: Their way to Heaven
lies through much tribulation; all our troubles
are not over when we are got into Christ; nay,
then commonly our greatest outward troubles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
<hi>Heb. 10. 32. After ye believed, ye endured a
great fight of affliction:</hi> Carnal relations now scoff,
frown, and cast off; the world hates them, and
marks them out for persecution: Now that poor
Christians may not utterly be discouraged, when
they meet with those troubles in the way of their
duty; Christ will chear and hearten them by
these spiritual refreshments: This is a stock laid
in for a rainy day: Christ himself had a voice
from Heaven, <hi>Matth. 17. 5. This is my beloved
Son,</hi> a little before his great combat, much more
do his poor people need such consolations to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and encourage them. The wise God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,
and by this provision forelays the troubles
they are to meet with: An hour of <hi>Sealing</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies
the Soul for an hour of <hi>Suffering.</hi> It hath
been the observation of some Christians, when
they have felt more than ordinary comforts of
the Spirit, that some great tryal hath been near
them; and the event hath confirmed it. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
comforts Christ gives his people at their first
entrance into his Service, they will have need
enough of them all before they finish their
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:109022:209"/>
course. To these first sealings they will need
often to run back, and have frequent recourse to
them, and all little enough to support them in
after-tryals.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">4. Reas.</note> Christ comes in to the opening Soul
with such divine Cordials and refreshments, to
defeat and countermine the plot of <hi>Satan,</hi> who
hath so often, and so lately, been discouraging
them, by representing the ways of Christ as sad,
melancholy ways; telling them, they shall never
laugh more, never be merry more, after they
have embraced and espoused the ways of holiness,
<hi>Spiritus Calvinianus, est spiritus melancholicus.</hi> Well
their own experiences shall now confute it, for
they now taste that pleasure in Christ, in faith,
and obedience, which they never tasted in the
ways of sin; thus that scandalous <hi>libel</hi> of the
Devil is experimentally confuted. They find
they were never truly merry till now, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 24.
All true mirth commences from our closing with
Christ; <hi>and they began to be merry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now these spiritual refreshments are by Christ
here called <hi>a Supper,</hi> because the Supper among
the Jews was their best meal, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 17. and
because it is the last meal. This is not only the
best meal that ever a believer made, but upon
these spiritual comforts (though much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
and perfect) they are to feed for ever in
Heaven. O Christian, well maist thou be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
with thine outward lot of providence,
however it shall fall in this World with respect
to thy outward-man; Will a King from Heaven
come and sup with thee? Doth he feed thy Soul
with pardon, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost?
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:109022:210"/>
Seals an earnest of future glory? then thou livest
at an higher and nobler rate than any of thy car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
neighbours do. <hi>Blessed be the God and Father of
our Lord Iesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all
spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ,</hi> Eph. 1. 3.
The same person that thus blesses God with an
Heart over-flowing with joy and comfort, endured
as many Persecutions, felt as many wants and
straighs as any man. What <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f Providence do but
meanly cloath your Bodies, so that you cannot ruffle
it out in that splendor and gallantry others do?
yet mayst thou say with the Church, <hi>I will greatly
rejoice in the Lord, my Soul shall be joyful in my God;
for he hath clothed me with the garments of Salvation;
he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a
bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a
bride adorneth her self with Iewels,</hi> Isa. 61. 10.
What if thou fare not deliciously as the great
ones of this World do? yet if Christ will give
thee to eat of the <hi>hidden manna</hi> which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 17. Art thou not better clothed
and fed than any of the Grandees or Nobles of
the World? This takes away all grounds of
complaint; it may be you will say, O but we
have Bodies, as well as Souls; if God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us <hi>Angels,</hi> that we could live without mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
food it were another case. I reply, Christ
never thus intended to feast thy Soul, and starve
thy Body: he that feeds thy Soul with bread
from Heaven, will take care for all necessary
provisions on Earth, <hi>Isa.</hi> 41. 17. You have sought
and found the Kingdom of God, and his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness;
fear not but all other things shall be
added to you.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Devil in design to discourage men from
the ways of God, puts a frightful mask upon the
beautiful face of Religion, pretending there is
no pleasure or joy to be expected therein; but
this is abundantly confuted and refelled in the
Text, <hi>I will come in to him, and sup with him.
Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccles. 10. 19. A feast is made
for laughter.</hi> I am sure that Soul that sits with
Christ at such a feast as hath been described
above, hath the best reason of any man in the
World to be merry. Religion indeed denies us
all sinful pleasure, but it abounds with all spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
pleasure. No rational solid mirth can come
before Christ; the unsanctified rejoyce in things
of nought, and their joy will be soon ended; they
are hastning to that place where they will find
that to be verified of the wages of sin, which
they now falsely impute to the wages of holiness;
they shall never rejoyce more, never be merry
more: But believers shall find that Scripture at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
by their dayly experience, <hi>Prov. 3. 17. All
her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths
are peace.</hi> And that there are such pleasures in
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:109022:211"/>
the ways of God as they never experienced in
the ways of sin; for is it a solid ground of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
to a man to be out of debt, and all fears of
arrests? And is it not much greater to have our
debts paid to God by Christ our Surety? <hi>Matth.
9. 2. Be of good cheer, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
Is it matter of joy to have a sufficiency of all
things for the supply of every want? he that is
in Christ hath so, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. 22, 23. All are yours,
and ye are Christs.</hi> Is it a joyful life to be a bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
upon Heaven, to confine upon blessedness it
self? Then it is a joyful life to be in Christ, for
they that are so, may rejoyce in the hopes of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2. Is it matter of all joy to have the
<hi>Comforter</hi> himself, who is the Spirit of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation,
taking up his residence in thy Heart,
cheering, comforting, and refreshing it with such
Cordials as are unknown things in all the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
World? Then certainly the life of a
Christian, and the ways of holiness, must be
most pleasant and comfortable; and therefore
let none that are looking towards Christ be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
in their way, by the slanderous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
designedly cast upon Religion for that
end. Christ and comfort dwell together.</p>

usually meet the greatest difficulties at their first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into Religion.</p>
                  <p>The first work of Religion is cutting work,
wounding work, groaning and weeping work;
thus Religion usually begins, <hi>Acts 2. 37. Acts</hi> 16.
29. Now the Soul seems to be struck dead in the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:109022:211"/>
giving up of all its former vain hopes, <hi>Rom. 7. 9.
When the commandment came, sin revived, and I dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
but afterward comes pardon, peace, joy in
the Holy Ghost. They that go forth weeping,
bearing precious seed, now come back rejoycing,
bringing their sheaves with them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 126. 6.
Now that blessing takes place upon the Soul,
<hi>Matth. 5. 4. Blessed are they that mourn, for they
shall be conforted. Light is sowen for the righteous,
and joy for the upright in Heart.</hi> 'Tis quite contrary
in the ways of sin; all the pleasures of sin come
first, the terrors and gripes of Conscience come
after. Sin comes with smiles in its face, but a
sting in its tail. Pleasures lead the <hi>van,</hi> Hell

                  <p>Comfort and refreshment in the natural order
follow faith; 'tis the vainest imagination in the
World to expect solid Spiritual comfort before
union with Christ; you may as well expect an
harvest before a seed-time. I do confess there
are two sorts of comforts found in the World
without Christ. (1.) Men may have <hi>sensitive</hi> and
<hi>sinful</hi> comforts and delights without Christ;
these are common in the unregenerate World;
where you may dayly see rich men taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
in their riches; voluptuous men in their
pleasures, <hi>Iam. 5. 5. You have lived in pleasures up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth.</hi> But these are the pleasures common to
bruits, and beneath the noble immortal spirit of
a Man. (2.) Hypocrites have their delights
and comforts, in a false imaginary happiness
which they fancy to themselves; but this is a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
shadow: they take comfort from their
groundless hopes of Heaven, whither they shall
never come; 'tis a feast in a dream, <hi>Isa. 44. 20.</hi>
Thus they make a bridge of their own shadow,
and are drowned in the waters. Such sensitive
and false comforts and pleasures Men may have;
but no true solid scriptural joy takes place in any
mans Heart before Christ come into it.</p>

say, Whatever the comforts and joys of any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
in this World may be, yet Heaven will be
a surprize to him when he comes thither. The
joys of Gods presence are other manner of things
than our present comforts are; though these be
of the same kind with them, yet in a far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
degree. There is a fix-fold difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the Spiritual comforts of believers on
Earth, and the joys that are above. They differ,
<list>
                        <item>1. In Quantity.</item>
                        <item>2. In Constancy.</item>
                        <item>3. In Purity.</item>

                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, They differ in <hi>quantity; Here we know but
in part, but when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 9,
10. When the Scripture speaks of the comforts
communicated to Saints on Earth it usually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
them in some diminutive terms or other,
calling them first-fruits, earnests, and the like;
and indeed it is necessary we should receive them
here with such alloys, and in remiss degrees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the imperfection and weakness of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state will not bear them in their plenitude
and perfection. Here the joy of the Lord enters
into us, but there we are said, <hi>to enter into that
joy,</hi> Matth. 25. 21. 'Tis too great to enter into
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:109022:213"/>
us, therefore we enter into, and are swallowed
up in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They differ in <hi>Constancy;</hi> the best
comforts upon Earth are found to be intermitting
comforts; a Sun-blast and a Cloud; a good day
and a bad; you know houskeepers feed upon two
sorts of meat, dayly-bread, and dainties; rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
come not every day to the Table. The day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-bread
upon which believers live, is the recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bence,
and affiance of faith; as for assurance and
joy, those come but now and then.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They differ in <hi>Purity,</hi> as well as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy;</hi>
here we have the comforts of the Spirit,
but we mingle sin with them, and usually the sin
of Spiritual pride, which spoils all. Yea, many
times the Lord suffers Satan to mingle his tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and injections with them, lest we should be
exalted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. But above, the comforts of
the Saints are as the pure water of life, clear as
Cristal, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 1.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They differ in <hi>Efficacy</hi> as well as in
<hi>Purity.</hi> The highest comforts of the Spirit here
are not perfectly transformative of our Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the image of God, as they are in Heaven,
<hi>1 Iohn 3. 3. We shall be like him, for we shall see him
as he is.</hi> Here, after we are comforted by him,
we grieve the comforter himself by sin; neither
do the comforts of the Spirit, in this state, produce
the fruits of obedience in their perfect maturity,
as they do above; there is the same difference in
in point of efficacy as there is betwixt the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Sun beams in the winter-months, and
those in <hi>May,</hi> and <hi>Iune.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, There is a great difference in respect
of <hi>Society.</hi> Here the believer, for the most part,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:109022:213"/>
eats his pleasant morsels alone; one Christian
eats, and another hungers; but in Heaven they
all feast and feed together at one Table, <hi>Matth.</hi>
8. 11. <hi>They shall sit down with</hi> Abraham, Isaac, <hi>and</hi>
Jacob, <hi>in the kingdom of God.</hi> O what is it to
rejoyce in the fellowship of Patriarchs, Prophets,
and Apostles, where the joy of one is the joy of
all!</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, They differ also in <hi>Durability;</hi> sin
here puts a stop to our comforts, but in Heaven
as there is no comma, so there shall never be a full
point, or period: Everlasting joy shall be upon
their heads: There's an eternal feast, no taking
away the cloth, no rising from that feast, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>
2. 16. 'Tis everlasting consolation: <hi>We shall be
ever with the Lord.</hi>

               <head>II. Vse.</head>
               <p>This point puts serious matter of Exhortation
into my mouth. The Lord direct it to the Hearts
of all, whether they be in Christ, or out of
Christ.</p>
               <p>First, To those that are out of Christ, and
will not yet be perswaded to open their Hearts
and consent to his terms. O what a spiritual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation
is here! What, shut the door of thy
Heart against Christ, and all the delights and
comforts of this and the coming World! What
madness is this! Hear me thou poor deluded sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that wilt not be perswaded to part with thy
sinful sensual delights in exchange for Christ, and
the peace, comfort, and joy that follow him: I
have a few things to speak on Christs behalf at
this time; O that they might prevail, O that by
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:109022:214"/>
them the Spirit of the Lord might perswade thy
Spirit, thou poor unregenerate creature! Let
me offer four or five Considerations or Pleas on
Christs behalf; if haply they may prevail and
make way for his entertainment in thy Soul.
And</p>
               <p>I.<note place="margin">1. Plea.</note> Let me plead thine own <hi>necessity</hi> with thee;
a mighty argument, which in other cases useth
to make its way through all oppositions, and
make all difficulties fly before it; thou art a
poor, necessitous, pining, famishing Soul; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
thy body be accommodated, thou hast not
one bit of spiritual bread for thy famishing Soul
to live upon. Christ is the bread that cometh
down from Heaven; the starving <hi>Prodigal, Luke
15. v.</hi> 16, 17. is the lively Emblem of thy Soul,
he fed upon husks, and thou feedest upon that
which is not bread, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 2. Thou art wretched
and miserable, poor, blind, and naked, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.
17. Thy body hath often been fill'd and refresht
with the good creatures of God, but thy Soul
never tasted one bit of spiritual bread, since it
came into thy body; it never smackt the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of a pardon, the deliciousness of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
the joy and comfort of Christ; the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
food that ever thou tastedsts was such as thy
Soul cannot live upon.</p>
               <p>II.<note place="margin">2. Plea.</note> Christ is at the door of thy Soul with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and variety of heavenly comforts, costly
dainties purchased by his blood; if thou wilt but
open to him, <hi>Thou shalt be abundantly satisfied with
the fatness of his house, and drink the rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi>
Psal. 36. 7, 8. <hi>He that believeth, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:109022:214"/>
hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of
living water,</hi> John 7. 38. meaning the graces and
comforts of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>III.<note place="margin">3. Plea.</note> If Christ be put off and refused now, you
may never taste of those invaluable mercies for
ever, <hi>Luke 14. 24. For I say unto you, That none of
those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper.</hi>
They were bidden, invited to this feast, and so
are you; they refused to come, God grant you
may not; for methinks this sentence of Christ,
<hi>Those men which were bidden shall not taste of my sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;</hi>
is like the sentence upon a malefactor that is
to be hanged in chains, and whom the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
none to relieve. O'twill bed readful to see the
Saints sitting at the Royal feast in Heaven, and
your selves shut out; as a company of starving
beggars standing in the Streets, and about the
doors where the marriage supper is kept; they
see the lights, they behold the rich dishes carried
up, they hear the mirth and musick of the guests,
but not a bit comes to their share.</p>
               <p>IV.<note place="margin">4. Plea.</note> The refusal of Christs invitation, as it is
the greatest of all sins, so it will be avenged
with the forest wrath and greatest punishment;
'tis said of those guests that were bidden, <hi>Matth.</hi>
22. 5. that they made light of it, but it fell hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
upon them, <hi>vers. 7. He was wroth, and sent
forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and
burnt up their City.</hi> Have a care of making light
of Christ.</p>
               <p>V.<note place="margin">5. Plea.</note> What light and vain things are all those
pleasures of sin, for the sake whereof you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:109022:215"/>
your Souls of the everlasting comforts of
Jesus Christ? Deluded Soul, 'tis not the intent
of Christ to rob thee of thy comfort, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
thy sinful for spiritual delights, to thy
unspeakable advantage. 'Tis true, you shall have
no more pleasure in sin, but in stead of that, you
shall have peace with God, joy in the Holy
Ghost, and solid comfort for evermore; what
are the sensitive or sinful pleasures of this
World? You have the total sum of them, in
1 <hi>Iohn 2. 16, 17. All that is in the World, the lust
of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,
is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the
world passeth away, and the lust thereof; but he that
doth the will of God abideth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how may a poor unregenerate Soul be prevailed
with to make such a blessed exchange,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> to part with the
pleasures of sin, in exchange for the comforts of Iesus
Christ?</p>
               <p>Beside all that hath been offered before,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> let
me briefly add these three following Directions
and Counsels to such a Soul.</p>
               <p>First, Labour to see and feel thy need of Christ,
and then thou wilt quickly be willing to give up
all the pleasures of sin for the enjoyment of him.
What makes men so tenacious of their lusts, so
hard to be persuaded to give up their sinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
but this, that they never felt the need of
a Saviour! Oh sinner, didst thou but feel thy
need of Christ, wert thou but an hungry and
thirsty for him; thou wouldst never stand upon
such trifles for the enjoyment of him. We read,
in the famine of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> how they parted with
their pleasant things for bread to relieve their
Souls; Jewels, Rings, Bracelets, things which
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:109022:215"/>
cost dear, and were highly valued at another
time, now were willingly parted with for bread.
Christ is more necessary to thee than thy neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
bread.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Consider the spiritual and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
nature of thine own Soul, which cannot live
upon material things, and must over-live all
temporary things. Now if thy Soul cannot live
upon them, and must certainly over-live them;
what a miserable condition will it unavoidably
fall into, when all these sensual and sinful enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are vanished and gone, as thou knowest
they shortly will be, 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 17. These things
pass away;</hi> and then hath thy Soul nothing to
live upon to all eternity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Hearken to the reports and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
of the Saints, who have tried both sorts of
pleasures, which you never did: They have tried
the pleasures of sin, and they have tasted the
pleasures of Christ, and so are best able to make
a true judgment upon both; and they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
determined, <hi>That one glimps of the light
of Gods countenance, puts more gladness into their
hearts, than in the time that their corn and their wine
increased,</hi> Psal. 4. 7. Nay, the wisest Christians
upon tryal of both have rightly determined, <hi>That
the worst things in Religion are infinitly to be preferr'd
to the best things belonging to sin;</hi> the very suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and afflictions of the people of God, have
been pronounced better <hi>than the pleasures of sin for
a season,</hi> Heb. 11. 25. Could you but see with
their Eyes, and were you but capable of making
a right judgment as they did; there needed not
a word more to be said to perswade you to let
go your most pleasant and profitable lusts in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:109022:216"/>
for Christ and his beneficial comfortable
sufferings.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The point affords variety of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Exhortations to the Regenerate, who
have opened their Wills to Christ, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
admitted into this comfortable state.</p>
               <p>It is found; in experience, a difficult thing for
Souls after conversion to bear and duly manage
their own comforts, as it was to bear and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manage their troubles at conversion. My buisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
here is to advise Souls, under their first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
and sealings of the Spirit, how to manage
and improve their spiritual comforts that they
may abide with them, and be growing things
continually in their Souls.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And first,</hi> See that you humbly admire and adore
the condescending goodness of God to you, in all the
comforts of the Spirit which refresh you.</p>
                  <p>Oh, that ever God should comfort such a Soul
as thine, that hath so often grieved him! That
Christ should be a joy to thee, who hast been a
sorrow unto him! If you look into <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3. you
will find the Spirit of the <hi>Apostle</hi> there fill'd with
the sense and admiration of this mercy; which
breaks forth into this rapturous expression, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
be the God and Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,
who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
places</hi> (or things) <hi>in Christ.</hi> Some there
are that never enjoy an ordinary degree of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comforts, <hi>Iob 30. 3, 4, 5.</hi> others enjoy abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of earthly comforts, but no spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,
<hi>Psal. 17. 14.</hi> Some there are for whom
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:109022:216"/>
God intends everlasting consolations in the
World to come; but are kept low as to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
comforts in this Wold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 15. O what
cause have you to admire the bounty of God to
you, for whom there is not only fulness of joys
prepared in Heaven; but such precious foretasts
and earnest of it communicated in the way thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Cleave fast to Christ, and those sweet
and comfortable duties of Religion wherein you have
found and tasted the best comforts that ever your
Souls were acquainted with.</p>
                  <p>This is one thing God aims at in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
of these spiritual refreshments, to glue
your Souls fast by them to the ways of holiness.
The Lord knows temptations will befal you, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements
enough you shall be sure to meet
with; but these enjoyments of God, which you
have met with in Prayer and Hearing, in Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
Sacraments, &amp;c. should engage your
Hearts for ever to the ways of obedience. You
never found that sweetness in the ways of sin,
which you have found in repentance and faith.
When a temptation comes baited with sinful
pleasures, say as the <hi>Olive-tree</hi> and the <hi>Vine</hi> in
<hi>Iothams</hi> parable, <hi>Iudges</hi> 9. 9, 10, 11. Shall I leave
such Soul refreshing comforts as these for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid
pleasures of sin? God forbid.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Be communicative of the spiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
you enjoy, for the benefit and refreshment of

                  <p>The Lord never intended you should engross
the comforts of his Spirit to your selves, nor eat
your pleasant morsels alone, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 4. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
us, that we may be able to comfort them that are
in any trouble; by the comfort wherewith we our selves
are comforted of God.</hi> 'Tis true, Religion lays
not all open, nor yet doth it conceal and hide all.
There needs a great deal of wisdom, humility
and caution, to secure us from pride and vanity
in Spirit, whilst we communicate our comforts
to others; as <hi>Ostentation,</hi> so also <hi>Impropriation</hi> of
our comforts are against Scripture law; he may
be justly suspected that opens all, and so may he
too that conceals all. Spiritual comforts are not

                  <p>Your first faith hath brought in your first

motion towards Christ; the more you believe,
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:109022:217"/>
the more you will rejoyce. You see the door
through which comfort comes into your Souls.
Joy is the daughter of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 13. your

there are many comforts more in the womb of
faith, which will yet be born to your Souls if

the Lord write that caution upon thy Soul, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>Eph. 4. 30. and grieve not the holy Spirit of God,
whereby you are sealed to the day of Redemption.</hi> The
argument of the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this place, strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<hi>caution</hi> from <hi>comfort.</hi> Christ hath been all
joy, all peace, rest and comfort to you; take
heed you be not a grief and shame to him. The
intermissions of thy duties, the falling and flatting
of thy affections in duties, thy rash adventures
upon sin, will be a grief to the Heart of Christ,
who hath filled thy Heart with so much comfort;
and if you grieve him, you cannot expect he
should comfort you. A little sin may rob you of a
great deal of comfort.</p>

that there is no hazard of losing them. Alas,
nothing is more volatile than the joys of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
you will be apt to lose your first love,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 4. and if you lose your first love, no

it should so fall out, be not cast down, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged;
Christ is not gone, though comfort
be gone; and though comfort be gone, 'tis not
gone for ever; renew thy repentance, faith and
obedience, and try if God will not renew thy
comfort. There is a former, and there is a lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>WE have heard the first encouragement

and to make the encouragement compleat and

clause sets forth that Spiritual-soul-refreshing-communion
which is betwixt Christ and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;

in the World to come. Hence our tenth

            <div n="11" type="doctrine">
               <head>XI. DOCT.</head>
               <p>That there is a mutual, sweet and intimate commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
betwixt Iesus Christ, and believers in this
World.</p>
               <p>Communion with Christ is frequent in the
lips of many men, but an hidden mystery to the
Souls of most men. This Atheistical age scoffs, and
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:109022:220"/>
ridicules it, as Enthusiasm, and Fanaticism; but
the Saints find that reality, and incomparable
sweetness in it, that they would not part with it
for Ten thousand Worlds. When the <hi>Roman</hi>
Soldiers entred the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and
found no Image there, as they used to have in
their own <hi>Idolatrous</hi> Temples; they gave out in
a Jeer, that the Jews worshiped the Clouds. Thus
prophane <hi>Atheists</hi> scoff at the most solemn, aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and sweetest part of internal Religion, as a
meer fancy; but the thing is real, sure, and
sensible; if there be truth in any thing in the
World, there is truth in this, That there are
real intercourses betwixt the visible and invisible
World; betwixt Christ, and the Souls of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
which we here call communion, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 3.
Truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his
Son Christ Iesus.</hi> 'Tis really and truly so, we
impose not upon the World, we tell you no
more than we have felt. The life of <hi>Enoch</hi> is
call'd <hi>his walking with God, Gen. 5. 24.</hi> O sweet
and pleasant walk! All pleasures, all joys, are in
that walk with God. <hi>Blessed are the people that hear
the joyful sound, they shall walk, O Lord, in the
light of thy countenance,</hi> Psal. 89. 15. The joyful
sound there spoken of, was the sound of the
trumpet, which called the people to the solemn
Assemblies, where they walked in the light of
Gods countenance, the sweet manifestations of
his favour; and because the World is so apt to
suspect the reality and certainty of this Doctrin,
the Apostle again asserts it, <hi>Phil. 3. 20. Truly our
conversation is in Heaven.</hi> We breath below, but
we live above; we walk on Earth, but our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is in Heaven. To open this Point
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:109022:220"/>
three things must come under consideration,
<list>
                     <item>1. What Communion with Christ is?</item>
                     <item>2. That there is such a Communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and believers.</item>
                     <item>3. The excellency of this Communion.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, What Communion with Christ is in the
general nature of it. To open this it must be
considered that there is a twofold Communion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. A state of Communion.</item>
                  <item>2. Actual Communion.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The first is fundamental to the second; we
can have no actual Communion with the Father,
Son or Spirit till we be first brought into a state
of Communion. This state of Communion is
in Scripture called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, our fellowship or part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nership
with Christ. Such a Fellowship as Merch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants
have in one and the same Ship and Cargo;
where one hath more and another less, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a joint though unequal interest; one lives
in one Kingdom, another in another Kingdom,
but they are joyntly interested in the same Goods.
This comparison must not be stretcht beyond its
intention, which is to shew nothing but this, that
Christ and believers are co-partners, or co-heirs
in the same inheritance; hence they are called,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 7. his fellows; <hi>God even thy God hath
anointed thee with the oyl of gladness above thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows;</hi>
and again, <hi>Rom. 8. 17. If children, then heirs;
heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ.</hi> Christ
states his people, gives then a right and title not
only to himself, but to those good things pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:109022:221"/>
by him; yea, and the very glory he now
enjoys in Heaven, <hi>Iohn 17. 22. The glory which
thou gavest me, I have given them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, there are some things in Christ
which are peculiar to himself, and incommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
to any creature, as his eternity, consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiality
with his Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> neither have we
fellowship in his mediatorial Works; we have the
fruits and benefits of them, but no partnership
with him in the glory and honour of them; that
is peculiarly his own: and though it be said in
the Scriptures, that believers <hi>are righteous as he is
righteous,</hi> yet the meaning is not that they can
Justifie others, as Christ doth; no, they are Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified
by him, but cannot communicate righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to others as Christ doth to them. But there
are other things wherein there is a partnership
betwixt Christ and his people; among others,
they partake with him in the Spirit of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
on Earth, and glory in Heaven: The same
Spirit of holiness which dwells in Christ without
measure, is communicated by him to the Saints
in measure, 1 <hi>Iohn 4. 13. He hath given us of his
Spirit.</hi> And as Christ communicates his Spirit to
the Saints, so he communicates the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to them; not that they shall be as glorious in
Heaven as Christ is, no, no; he will be known
among the Saints in glory, as the Sun is known
from the lesser Stars. Thus briefly of the state of
communion which is called in Scripture, <hi>our being
made nigh,</hi> Eph. 2. 13. and indeed we must be
made nigh, before we can actually draw nigh.
We must be put into a state of fellowship, before
ever we can have actual communion with God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:109022:221"/>Secondly, Beside this state of Communion,
there is also an actual Communion, which the
Saints have in this World with the Father and
Son in the duties of Religion. This is that I am
here ingaged to open: This is our supping with
Christ, and his with us; and for clearness sake
I shall open it both,
<list>
                     <item>1. Negatively, What it is not.</item>
                     <item>2. Positively, What it is.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I. Negatively, What it is not; for I find
persons are hugely apt to mistake in this matter,
taking that for Communion with God which is
not so; and here let it be noted,</p>
               <p>First, That Communion with God doth not
consist in the bare performance of Religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
I do not say that Men may have Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God in this World without duties, 'tis
a delusion of Satan to think so; but this is what
I say, that Communion with God consisteth not
in the mere performances of Duties. Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and duties of Religion are two things sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
one from the other. Men may multiply du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and yet be strangers to Communion with
God in them; even humiliation and fasting days
may be kept by Souls that are estranged from
Communion with the Lord, <hi>Zach. 7. 5. Speak unto
all the people of the Land, and unto the Priests saying,
When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth, and seventh
month; even these seventy years, did ye at all fast
unto me, even unto me? q. d.</hi> Had your Souls pure
intentions and respects in those duties to my
glory? Had you special Communion with me,
or I with you in those duties? Did you ever
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:109022:222"/>
feel your Souls in these days wounded for sin?
Or did you not fast out of custom, and mourn
for company? God may be near in Mens mouths,
and at the same time far from their reins, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.
2. Religious words may flow out of Mens lips,
when not one drop of Religion touches their
reins and hearts; that is, the secret inward
powers of their Souls; you cannot therefore
safely depend upon this, Christ rejects this plea,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 7. 22. Get a better evidence of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God than this, or you will certainly
come short of your expectation. <hi>I know you not,</hi>
saith Christ; there was never any Spiritual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
betwixt your Souls and me; I know
you not in a way of approbation.</p>
               <p>2ly, Neither do all stirrings and workings of
the affections in duties, infallibly evidence and
prove Communion betwixt God and that Soul,
for it is possible, yea, common, to have the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
raised in a natural way, and by external
motives in the duties of Religion; this you see
in that Example, <hi>Ezck. 33. 32. And lo thou art unto
them as a very lovely song, of one that hath a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
voice; and can play well on an instrument: for
they hear thy words, but they do them not.</hi> The
sweet modulation of the Prophets voice, was
like the skilful touch of a rare musical Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which in a natural way moved and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their affections: thus <hi>Iohns</hi> hearers rejoyced
in his Ministry for a season. I confess, this is
very apt to cast Souls into a mistake of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.
They distinguish not betwixt the influences
that come upon their affections from without,
from extrinsick things, and those that are purely
inward, Divine, and Spiritual. But then,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:109022:222"/>
II. To shew you <hi>positively</hi> what Communion
with God is. Here we must consider two things.
<list>
                     <item>1. What things it presupposes in us.</item>
                     <item>2. Wherein the nature of it consists.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, There are divers things pre-required
and presupposed unto all actual Communion with
God in Duties; and where these things are
wanting men can have no communion with
God. You may have Communion with his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and Communion with his Ordinances, but
not Communion with God and Christ in them.
And these pre-requisites are three,</p>
               <p>I. <hi>Vnion with Christ</hi> is fundamentally necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to all Communion with him. All Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is founded in Union; and where there is no
Union there can be no Communion. <hi>You know</hi>
(saith an excellent Person) <hi>the member receives
nothing from the head,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Iacom</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. p. 69, 84.</note> 
                  <hi>unless it be united to it; nor
the branch from the root. All is yours, and ye are
Christs, 1 Cor. 3. 23. Here's a vast possession, but
all founded upon Vnion; as all Communion is founded
upon Vnion, so all Vnion terminates in Communion;
and the closer the Vnion, the fuller is the Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Before our Union with Christ, we are strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
unto God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. I3. <hi>We live without God in
the World;</hi> 'tis in Christ that we are made nigh;
'tis in the beloved we are made accepted. Whilst
we are in the state of alienation from Christ, we
have no more to do with the communications of
joy and peace, with the seals and earnests of the
Spirit, than a <hi>Native Indian</hi> hath with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
of <hi>London. If any man open to me,</hi> saith
Christ, <hi>I will come in to him and sup with him, and
he with me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="402" facs="tcp:109022:223"/>
II. Communion with God presupposes the
habits of grace implanted in the Soul by sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
a found and sincere change of Heart.
No sanctification, no communion, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 6.
If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in
darkness we lye, and do not the truth.</hi> The Apostle
gives the lye to such bold pretenders: <hi>The Lord
is nigh to all that call upon him, unto all that call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him in truth:</hi> That latter clause restrains all
spiritual communion unto upright Souls. <hi>For an
Hypocrite shall not come before him,</hi> Job 13. 16.</p>
               <p>III. Communion with God doth not only sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
grace implanted, but also implanted grace
excited; grace in act: For a man may have the
habits of faith, love and delight in him, and
yet be without actual communion with God; for
by this grace is awakned and put into act. A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
when he is asleep, and acts no grace, is in
a state of communion with God; but if he will
have actual communion, his faith, love, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
must be awakned; they must not lye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep
in the habit. <hi>Thou saidst, seek my face, my
heart said unto thee, thy face Lord will I seek,</hi> Psal.
27. 8. It was in order to actual communion with
Christ that the Church so earnestly begs fresh
influences of the Spirit to excite her graces in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
act, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. I6. <hi>Awake O North-wind, and come
thou South, blow upon my garden, that the spices
thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his
garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.</hi> And though
believers are not so to wait for influences of the
Spirit, as mean time to neglect all proper out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
means of exciting their own graces, enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
their Hearts to approach unto God, <hi>Ier.</hi> 30.
21. Yet certainly it is the work of Gods Spirit,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:109022:223"/>
and without him we can do nothing to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
The Seaman may trim the Sayls, wey the
Anchor, put all into a sayling posture; but till
a gale come from Heaven there is little or no
motion. The same Spirit that plants the habits,
is he also that excites the acts of grace. These
three things therefore are pre-requisites unto all
communion with God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Next let us consider wherein this
Heavenly privilege of communion with God
doth consist; and more generally it will be found
to lye in a spiritual correspondency betwixt
Christ and the Soul. God lets forth influences
upon our Souls, and we by the assistance of his
Spirit, make returns again unto God. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
is a mutual action, so in the Text, <hi>I will
sup with him, and he with me.</hi> We cry to God,
and God answers that cry, by the incomes of
Spiritual grace upon the Soul, <hi>Psal.</hi> I38. 3. <hi>In
the day that I cryed thou answeredst me, and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst
me with strength in my Soul.</hi> More particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there are many ways or methods wherein
Men have this Spiritual correspondence or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In the contemplation of his Attributes.</item>
                     <item>2. In the exercises of our grace in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
duties.</item>
                     <item>3. In his various Providences. In all these
the Saints have communion with them.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>First, There is a sweet and sensible communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt God and his people <hi>in the contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the divine Attributes,</hi> and the impressions God
makes by them, upon our Souls whilst we medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ate
on them, As for instance,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:109022:224"/>
(1.) Sometimes the Lord discovers and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests
to the Souls of his people his <hi>immense great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
the manifestation of which Attribute
makes an awful humbling impression upon the
Soul; makes them seem as nothing to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Thus when <hi>Abraham</hi> that great believer
considered the greatness of that God with whom
he had to do; that sight of God seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
him to his first principles, to crumble him
as it were into dust and ashes again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 27.
<hi>I that am but dust and ashes have taken upon me to
speak unto God.</hi> He now looks upon himself as
an heap of vileness and unworthiness; so <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi>
Psal. 8. 12. <hi>When I consider thy Heavens, the
work of thy hands; the Moon and the Stars which
thou hast made,</hi> (from whence he inferr'd the
greatness of the Creator) <hi>Lord what is man,
that thou art mindful of him? q. d.</hi> When I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
what a great God the Creator of the World
is, I am justly astonished that ever he should set
his Heart upon so vile a thing as Man. When
men compare themselves among themselves, and
measure themselves by themselves, their Spirits
are apt to swell with pride; but would they look
up to God, as these holy men did, they would
admire his condescension. And this is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God in the meditation of his immense
greatness.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The representations and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>purity and holyness of God,</hi> working
shame and deep abasement in the Soul, for the
pollutions and sinful filthiness that is in it. This
is communion with God, and an excellent way
of fellowship with him. Thus when a represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of God in his holyness was made unto
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:109022:224"/>
the Prophet, <hi>Isa. 6. 3, 4, 5.</hi> There were the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims,</hi>
covering their faces with their wings; and
crying one to another, saying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is
the Lord God Almighty; the Earth is full of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
The effect this produced, or the return
made by the Prophet to this manifestation of
God in his holiness, was deep abasement of soul
for his unsuitableness to so holy a God, <hi>vers. 5.
Then,</hi> said I, <hi>wo is me, for I am undone, because I
am a man of unclean lips,</hi> &amp;c. And this is real
communion with God in his holiness: Thus <hi>Iob</hi>
who had stifly defended his own integrity against
men, yet when God enters the lists with him,
and he saw what a great and holy God he had to
do with; cryed out, <hi>Iob 40. 4, 5. Behold, I am
vile, what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand
upon my mouth. Once have I spoken, but I will not
answer; yea, twice, but I will proceed no further.</hi> q. d.
I have done, Lord, I have done; I could answer
men, but I cannot answer thee; thou art holy
but I am vile.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are sometimes representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>goodness and mercy of God</hi> made unto
the Souls of his people. When these produce
an ingenuous thaw and melting of the Heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an humble, thankful admiration of it, and
an answerable care of pleasing him in the ways
of obedience; then have men communion with
God in his goodness: The goodness of God runs
down to men in a double channel; his goodness
to their bodies, in external providences; his
goodness to their Souls, in spiritual mercies.
When the goodness of God either way draws
forth the love, and gratitude of the Soul to the
God of our mercies; then have we real com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:109022:225"/>
with him: Thus <hi>Iacob, Gen. 32. 9, 10.
And</hi> Jacob <hi>said, O God of my Father</hi> Abraham,
<hi>and God of my Father</hi> Isaac; <hi>which saidst unto me,
Return unto thy Country, and to thy kindred, and I
will deal well with thee. I am not worthy of the
least of all the mercies, and of all the truth
which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with my
staff I passed over this</hi> Jordan, <hi>and now I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ands.</hi> Ah, Lord, I see a multitude of
mercies round about me, and the least of them is
greater than I: So <hi>David, 1 Chron.</hi> I7. I6, I7.
And <hi>David</hi> the King came and sat before the Lord,
and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine
house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? And yet
this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God, &amp;c.
what can <hi>David</hi> speak more to thee? You see in
these instances what effects the goodness of God
even in inferiour outward mercies, useth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
in sanctified hearts. But then, if you come
to spiritual mercies, and ponder the goodness of
God to your Souls, in pardoning, accepting,
and saving such vile sinful creatures as you have
been; this much more affects the heart, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms
it with an holy astonishment; as you see
in <hi>Paul, 1 Tim. 1. 16. The grace of our Lord was
abundant. I was a persecutor, a blasphemer, yet I
obtained mercy.</hi> So <hi>Mary,</hi> that notorious sinner,
when pardoning grace appeared to her, into
what a flood of tears, into what transports of
love did the sight of mercy cast her Soul! She
wept and washt her Saviours feet with tears of
joy and thankfulness, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 44. No terrors of
the Law, no frights of Hell, thaw the heart like
the apprehensions of pardoning mercy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="407" facs="tcp:109022:225"/>
Fourthly, Sometimes there are special repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations
of the <hi>veracity and faithfulness of God,</hi>
made unto his people, begetting trust and holy
confidence in their Souls; and when they do so,
then have men communion with God in his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,
Thus <hi>Heb. 13. 5, 6. I will never leave thee nor
forsake thee.</hi> There is a discovery of the faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of God; and what follows upon this? See
<hi>vers. 6. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is our
God; we will not fear what man can do unto us.</hi> Here's
faithfulness in God producing trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in the believer. This is that reciprocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that sweet fellowship and communion betwixt
God and a believer with respect to his fidelity.
<hi>Behold, God is my salvation, I will trust and not be
afraid, Isa. I2. 2.</hi> And truly, friend, this is what
the Lord justly expects from thee, even thy trust
and confidence in him, thy steady dependance on
him, in return to all the discoveries of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
to thee, both in his Word and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There are manifestations of the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
and displeasure of God,</hi> by the hiding of his
face from them, and the frowns of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
when these produce repentance, and deep
humiliation for sin; an unquietness, a restlesness
of Spirit till he restore his favour, and manifest,
his reconciliation to the Soul; even here also is
real communion betwixt God and the Soul, <hi>Psal.</hi>
30. 7. <hi>Thou hidest thy face, and I was troubled.</hi>
Nor will a gracious Soul rest there, but will take
pains to sue out a fresh pardon, <hi>Psal. 51. 8. Make
me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which
thou hast broken, may rejoyce; restore unto me the
joys of thy salvation,</hi> vers. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="408" facs="tcp:109022:226"/>
I cannot here omit to detect a great mistake
here, even amongst Gods own people; many of
them understand not what communion there
should be with God, under the manifestations
of his displeasure for sin; they know that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
meltings of their Souls into love,
praise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to be communion with God; but
that the shame, grief and sorrow, produced in
them by the manifestations of Gods displeasure;
I say, that even in these things there may be
communion with God they understand not. But
let me tell thee, that even such things as these
are the choice fruits of the Spirit of Adoption,
and that in them thy Soul hath as real and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
communion with God, as in the greatest
transports of Spiritual joy and comfort. O'tis
a blessed frame to be before the Lord, as <hi>Ezra</hi>
was, after conviction of thy loosness, carelesness,
and Spiritual defilements, the consequents of
those sins; saying with him, <hi>O my God I am
ashamed, and even blush to lift up my face unto thee,
Ezra 9. 6.</hi> Shame and blushing are as excellent
signs of communion with God, as the sweetest
smiles.</p>
               <p>Lastly, There are representations and special
contemplations of the <hi>omniscience of God,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
sincerity, comfort in appeals, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to it in doubts of our own uprightness.
And this also is a choice and excellent method of
communion with God. (1.) When the omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of God strongly obliges the Soul to since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and uprightness, as it did <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 139.
11, 12. compared with <hi>Psal. 18. 23. I was also up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
before him.</hi> The consideration that he was
always before the Eye of God, was his preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vative
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:109022:226"/>
from iniquity, yea, from his own iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
(2.) When it produceth comforts in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals
to it, as it did in <hi>Hezekiah, 2 Kings 20. 3.
Remember now, O Lord, that I have walked before
thee in truth, and with a perfect heart.</hi> So <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 7.
he also appeals to this attribute, <hi>Thou knowest that
I am not wicked.</hi> So did <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> Chap. 12. 3.
<hi>But thou, O Lord, knowest me, thou hast seen me,
and tryed my heart towards thee.</hi> (3.) When we
have recourse to it, under doubts and fears of
our own uprightness. Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 139.
23. <hi>Search me, O God, and try my heart; prove
me, and see my reins; see if there be any way of
wickedness in me.</hi> In all these attributes of God,
Christians have real and sweet communion with
him, which was the first thing to be opened:
Communion with God in the meditation of his
attributes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next method of communion
with God, is <hi>in the exercise of our graces in the
various duties of Religion;</hi> In Prayer, Hearing,
Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in all which the Spirit of the
Lord influences the graces of his people, and they
return the fruits thereof in some measure to him.
As God hath planted various graces in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Souls, so he hath appointed various duties
to exercise and draw forth those graces; and
when they do so, then have his people sweet actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
communion with him. And</p>
               <p>1. To begin with the first grace that shews it
self in the Soul of a Christian, to wit, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
and sorrow for sin. In the exercise of this
grace of repentance the Soul pours out it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord, with much bitterness and broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Heart; casts forth its sorrows, which
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:109022:227"/>
sorrows are as so much seed sown, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
thereto the Lord usually sends an answer of
peace, <hi>Psal. 32. 4, 5. I said, I will confess my trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</hi>
Here's a voice of sorrow sent up, and a voice
of peace coming down; which is real communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
betwixt God and Man in the exercises of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentace.</p>
               <p>2ly, As there are seasons in duty, wherein
the Saints exercise their repentance, and the
Lord returns peace; so likewise the Lord helps
them in their duties to act their <hi>faith,</hi> in return
whereunto they find from the Lord inward sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
rest and refreshment, <hi>Psal. 27. 13. I had
fainted unless I had believed.</hi> And oft-times an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of the mercies they have acted their
faith about, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. I4.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3ly, The Lord many times draws forth emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
degrees of our <hi>love</hi> to him, in the course of
our duties; the heart is filled with love to Christ.
The strength of the Soul is drawn forth to
Christ in love; and this the Lord repays in kind,
love for love, <hi>Iohn 14. 21. He that loveth me, my
Father will love him; and we will come and make our
abode with him.</hi> Here is sweet communion with
God in the exercises of love. O what a rich
trade do Christians drive this way in their duties
and exercises of graces!</p>
               <p>4ly, To mention no more, in the duties of
<hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> Christians are enabled to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their patience, meekness, and long suffering
for Christ; in return to which, the Lord gives
them the singular consolations of his Spirit.
Double returns of joy; <hi>The Spirit of glory and of
God resteth upon them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 13, 14. The Lord
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:109022:227"/>
strengthens them with passive fortitude, with all
might in the inner-man, unto all long-suffering;
but the reward of that long-suffering is joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<hi>Col.</hi> 1. 11. This is the trade they drive with
Heaven.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Beside communion with God in the
contemplation of his attributes, and graces ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
in the course of duties; there is another
method of communion with God in the way of
his <hi>Providences;</hi> for therein also his people walk
with him: To give a taste of this, let us consider
Providence in a fourfold aspect upon the people
of God.</p>
               <p>1. There are <hi>afflictive providences,</hi> rods and
rebukes, wherewith the Lord chastens his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
this is the discipline of his house, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
whereunto gracious Souls return meek and
childlike submission; a fruit of the Spirit of
Adoption; they are brought to accept the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment
of their iniquities. And herein lies com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God under the rod; this return to
the rod may not be presently made; for there
is much stubborness unmortified in the best hearts,
<hi>Heb.</hi> I2. 7. but this is the fruit it shall yield, and
when it doth, there is real communion between
God and the afflicted Soul. Let not Christians
mistake themselves, if when God is smiting they
are humbling, searching, and blessing God for
the discoveries of sin made by their afflictions;
admiring his wisdom, in timing, moderating,
and chusing the rod; kissing it with a childlike
submission, and saying it is good for me that I
have been afflicted; that Soul hath real commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God, though it may be for a time
without joy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="412" facs="tcp:109022:228"/>
2ly, There are times wherein <hi>providence
straightens</hi> the people of God; when the waters
of comfort ebb, and run very low; wants pinch;
if then the Soul returns filial dependance upon
fatherly care, saying with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 23. 1. <hi>The
Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want:</hi> It belongs to
him to provide, and to me to depend: I will
trust my Fathers care and love. Here now is
sweet communion with God under pinching
wants. The wants of the Body enrich the Soul:
Outward straightnings are the occasions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enlargments. O see from hence how good it
is to have an interest in God as a Father, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
changes of providence may come upon you.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There are seasons wherein the Lord
exposes his people to eminent and visible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
when to the Eye of sense there is no way
of escape. Now when this produceth trust in
God, and resignation to the pleasure of his
Will; here is communion with God in times of
distress and difficulty; thus <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 56. 3.
<hi>At what time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</hi> q. d.
Father, I see a storm rising, thy poor child comes
under his Fathers roof for she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>er; for whether
should a distressed Child go, but to his Father?
And then as to the issues and events of doubtful
providences, when the Soul resigns and leaves it
self to the wise disposal of the Will of God, as
<hi>David,</hi> in 2 <hi>Sam. 15. 25, 26. Here am I, let him do
with me as seemeth good in his sight.</hi> This is real and
sweet communion with God in his providences.
And so much for the nature of communion with
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the next place, I shall evidence
the reality of communion with God; and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:109022:228"/>
prove it to be no fancy. I confess it grieves me
to be put upon the proof of this, but the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism,
and prophaness of the age we live in seems
to make it necessary; for many men will allow
nothing for certain but what falls under the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisance
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ense. And oh, that they had their
Spiritual senses exercised, then they would sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
discern the reality of these things: but to
put the matter out of question, I shall evidence
the truth and reality of the Saints communion
with God divers ways.</p>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Evid.</note> From the Saints union with Christ; if
there be a <hi>union</hi> betwixt Christ and believers,
then of necessity there must be a <hi>communion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them also. Now the whole Word of
God which you profess to be the rule of your
faith, plainly asserts this union betwixt Christ
and believers; a union like that betwixt the
branches and the root, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15. 4, 5. or that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the head and the members, <hi>Eph<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 4. 16.
Now if Christ be to believers as the root to the
branches, and as the head to the members; then
of necessity there must be a communion between
them: for if there were not a communion,
there could be no communications, and if no
communications no life. For it is by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of vital fap and spirits, from the root
and from the head, that the branches and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
subsist and live.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. Evid.</note> There is a <hi>cohabitation</hi> of Christ
with believers; he dwells with them, yea, he
dwells in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> 2 <hi>Cor. 6. 16. I will dwell in them,
and walk in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> The Soul of a believer is the
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:109022:229"/>
Temple of Christ, yea, his living Temple,
1 <hi>Pet. 2. 5.</hi> And if Christ dwell with them, yea,
if he dwell in them and walk in them, then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there must be communion betwixt him and
them; if they live together, they must converse
together. A man indeed may dwell in his house,
and yet cannot be said to have communion with
it; but the Saints are a living house, they are
the living. Temples of Christ; and he cannot
dwell in such Temples capable of communion
with him, and yet have no communion with
them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">3 Evid.</note> The reality of communion betwixt
God and the Saints is undeniably evinced from all
the Spiritual relations into which God hath taken
them. Every believer is the Child of God, and
the Spouse of Christ. God is the believer Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the Church is the Lambs Wife. Christ
calls the believer not only his Servant, but
Friend; hence forth I call you not Servants but
Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, if God be the believers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and the believer be Gods own Child, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
there must be communion between them.
If Christ be the believers Husband, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
be Christs Spouse, there must be commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between him and them. What, no commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
between the Father and his Children, the
Husband and the Wife? We must either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and deny all such relations to him, and
therein renounce our Bibles; or else yield the
conclusion, that there is a real communion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Christ and believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="415" facs="tcp:109022:229"/>
Fourthly, The reality of communion with
God evidently appears from the institution,<note place="margin">4 Evid.</note> and
appointment of so many Ordinances, and duties
of Religion, on purpose to maintain dayly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
betwixt Christ and his People. As to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
but in that one institution of <hi>Prayer,</hi> a
duty appointed on purpose for the Souls meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with God, and communion with him, <hi>Iames</hi>
4. 8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to
you.</hi> Now to what purpose can it be conceived
such an Ordinance is appointed for the Souls
drawing nigh to God, and God to it; if there
be no such thing as communion to be enjoyed
with him? If communion with God were a meer
<hi>Phantome,</hi> as the carnal World thinks it to be,
what encouragement have the Saints to bow
their knees to the God and Father of our Lord
Jesus Christ? But surely there is an access to God
in prayer, <hi>Ephes. 3. 12. In whom we have boldness
and access with confidenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</hi> Access to what? If God
be not there, and that there can be no communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with him, what means that access? <hi>I will meet
you, saith the Lord, and I will commune with you
in every place where I record my name,</hi> Exod. 25. 22.
Certainly duties had never been appointed, but
for the sake of Gods communing with us, and
ours with him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, This is yet further evidenced from
the mutual desires both of Christ,<note place="margin">5 Evid,</note> and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to be in sweet and intimate communion one
with the other. The Scripture speaks much of
the Saints vehement desires of communion with
Christ, and of Christs desires after communion
with the Saints, and of both jointly. The Saints
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:109022:230"/>
desires after communion with him, are frequent
in all the Scriptures, see <hi>Psal. 63. 1, 2, 3. Psal. 42. 1.
Psal.</hi> 119. 20. and the like throughout the New
Testament. And Christ is no less desirous, yea,
he is much more desirous of communion with
us than we are with him. Consider that expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his to the Spouse, in <hi>Cant. 8. 13. O thou that
dwellest in the Gardens, the companions h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rken to thy
voice, cause me to hear it.</hi> As if he should say, O my
people, you frequently converse one with another,
you talk dayly together; why shall not you and
I converse one with another? You speak often to
men, O that you would speak more frequently to
me! <hi>Let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice;
for thy voice is sweet, and thy countenance comly.</hi> And
then these desires are mutually exprest one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Rev. 22. 20. Surely</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>I come
quickly, Amen, even so come Lord Iesus,</hi> saith the
Church: Now if there be such vehement mutual
desires after communion betwixt Christ and his
people in this World; then certainly there is
such a thing as real communion between them,
or else both must live a very restless and dissatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
life.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, The mutual complaints that are
found on both sides of the interruption of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,<note place="margin">6 Evid.</note>
plainly proves there is such a thing. If
God complain of his people for their estrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
from him, and the Saints complain to
God about his silence to them; and the hidings
of his face from them: Surely then there must
be a communion between them, or else there
could be no ground of complaints for the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
of it. But it is manifest God doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:109022:230"/>
of his people for their estrangments from
him, <hi>Ier. 2. 5. Thus saith the Lord, I remember
thee the kindness of thy youth, and the love of thy
espousals. What iniquity have your Fathers found in
me, that they are gone far from me?</hi> As if he should
say, You and I have been better acquainted in
days past; what cause have I given for your
estrangments from me? And thus Christ in like
manner complains of the Church of <hi>Ephesus,</hi>
after he had commended many things in her, yet
one thing grieves and troubles him, <hi>Rev. 2. 4. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless
I have somewhat against thee, because thou
hast left thy first love.</hi> And then on the other side,
when the Lord hids his face and seems to estrange
himself from his people; what sad laments and
moans do they make about it? As an affliction
they know not how to bear. Thus <hi>Heman,</hi> Psal.
88. 14. <hi>Lord, why castests thou off my Soul? Why
hidest thou thy face from me?</hi> So <hi>Psal. 27. 9. Hide
not thy face from me, put not thy servant away in
anger.</hi> This is what they cannot bear.</p>
               <p>Seventhly,<note place="margin">7 Evid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> The reality of communion with
God is made visible to others, in the sensible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of it upon the Saints that enjoy it. There
are visible signs and tokens of it appearing to
the conviction of others. Thus that marvelous
change that appeared upon the very countenance
of <hi>Hannah</hi> after she had poured her heart in
prayer, and the Lord had answered her, it is
noted, 1 <hi>Sam. 1. 18. She went away and her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
was no more sad.</hi> You might have read in
her <hi>face,</hi> that God had spoken peace and satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to her <hi>heart.</hi> Thus when the Disciples
had been with Christ, the mark of communion
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:109022:231"/>
with him was visible to others, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 13. Now
when they saw the boldness of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> they
marvelled; and took knowledg of them that they had
been with Iesus. 'Tis sweet, Christian, when the
heavenly cheariness, and spirituality of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses
with men, shall convince others that thou
hast been with Jesus.</p>
               <p>Eighthly,<note place="margin">8 Evid.</note> We may prove the reality of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God, from the impossibility of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staining
those troubles the Saints do without it.
If prayers did not go up, and answers come
down, there were no living for a Christian in
this World. Prayer is the out-let of the Saints
sorrows, and the in-let of their supports and
comforts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. Say not other men have
their troubles as well as the Saints, and yet they
make a shift to bear them without the help of
communion with God. 'Tis true, carnal men
have their troubles, and those troubles are often
too heavy for them. <hi>The sorrows of the world work
death;</hi> but carnal men have no such troubles as
the Saints have; for they have their inward Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
troubles, as well as their outward troubles.
And inward troubles are the sinking troubles;
but this way the strength of God comes in to
succor them: and except they had a God to go
to, and fetch comfort from, they could never
bear them, <hi>Psal. 27. 13. I had fainted unless <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> had
believed. Paul</hi> had sunk under the buffetings of
Satan, unless he had gone once and again to his
God, and received this answer, <hi>My grace is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
for thee;</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="419" facs="tcp:109022:231"/>
Ninthly, We conclude the reality of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God,<note place="margin">9 Evid.</note> from the end of the Saints <hi>voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
We read frequently in Scripture of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
calling; now what is that to which God
calls his people out of the state of nature, but
unto fellowship and communion with Jesus
Christ? 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 9. God is faithful, by whom
ye are called unto the fellowship of his son Iesus Christ
our Lord.</hi> They are called, you see, in to a life of
communion with Christ; therefore certainly
there is such a communion: else the Saints are
called to the enjoyment of a fancy, instead of a
privilege, which is the greatest reproach that
can be cast upon the faithful God that called
them.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">10 Evid.</note> In a word, the characters and descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
given to the Saints in Scripture evidently
prove their life of communion with God. The
Men of this World are manifestly distinguished
from the people of God in Scripture; they are
called, <hi>The Children of this World;</hi> the Saints, <hi>The
Children of light,</hi> Luke 16. 8. They are said to be
<hi>after the flesh,</hi> Saints to be <hi>after the Spirit,</hi> Rom.
8. 5. they <hi>mind earthly things,</hi> but the Saints <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
is in Heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 19, 20. By all
which it undeniably appears that there is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
in the Doctrin of communion betwixt
Christ and his people. We are not imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
'tis no cunningly devised fable; but a thing
whose foundation is as sure as its nature is
sweet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="420" facs="tcp:109022:232"/>
Thirdly, In the last place, I shall shew you
the transcendent excellency of this life of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God; it is the life of our Life,
the joy of our Hearts, a Heaven upon Earth;
as will appear by the Twenty Excellencies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
following.</p>
               <div n="1" type="excellency">
                  <head>I. Excellency.</head>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Assimilating</hi> instrument whereby the
Soul is moulded and fashioned after the image
of God. This is the Excellency of communion
with God, to make the Soul like him. There is
a twofold <hi>assimilation,</hi> or conformity of the Soul
to God, the one <hi>perfect</hi> and compleat, the other
<hi>inchoate</hi> and in part. Perfect assimilation is the
privilege of the perfect state, resulting from
the immediate vision and perfect communion
the Soul hath with God in glory, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <hi>When he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall
see him as he is.</hi> Perfect vision produceth perfect
assimilation; but the Souls assimilation or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
conformity to God in this World, is wrought
and gradually carried on by dayly communion
with him. And as our communion with God
here, grows up more and more into spirituality
and power, so in an answerable degree doth our
conformity to him advance, 2 <hi>Cor. 3. 18. But we
all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of
the Lord; are changed into the same image, from
glory to glory, as by the spirit of the Lord.</hi> All sorts
of communion among men have an assimilating
efficacy; he that walks in vain company, is made
vainer than he was before; and he that walks in
spiritual heavenly company will be ordinarily
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:109022:232"/>
more serious than he was before; but nothing so
transforms the Spirit of a man, as communion
with God doth. Those are most like unto God
that converse most frequently with him. The
beauty of the Lord is upon those Souls; it figures
the Spirit of a Man after the Divine pattern.
That's the first Excellency of communion with
God, it assimilates them to God.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="excellency">
                  <head>II. Excellency.</head>
                  <p>It is the <hi>beauty</hi> of the Soul, in the Eyes of God,
and all good men; it makes the face to shine.
No outward splendor attracts like this; it makes
a man the most desirable companion in the whole
World, 1 <hi>Iohn 1. 3. These things have I written
unto you, that you might have fellowship with us, and
truly our fellowship is with the Father and with the
Son Iesus Christ.</hi> This was the great and only
inducement the <hi>Apostle</hi> makes use of to draw the
World into fellowship with the Saints; that
their fellowship is with God. And if there were
ten thousand other inducements, yet none like
this. You read of a blessed time, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. When
the Earth shall be full of holiness; when the <hi>Iews</hi>
that are now as a lost generation to the Eye of
sense, shall be called, and an eminent degree of
sanctification shall be visible in them; and then
see the effect of this, <hi>vers. 23. In those days ten
men shall take hold, out of all languages, of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
Iew; saying, We will go with you for we have heard
that God is with you.</hi> This is the powerful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive,
<hi>the Lord is with you;</hi> 'tis the effect of
communion with God which makes the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:109022:233"/>
more excellent than his neighbour, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.
26. what a vast and visible difference doth this
make between one man and another! How hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
sweet and desirable, are the converses and
company of some men! How frothy, burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soin,
and unprofitable is the company of others!
And what makes the difference but only this, the
one walks in communion with God, the other is
alienated from the life of God?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="excellency">
                  <head>III. Excellency.</head>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Centre</hi> which rests the motions of a
weary Soul; 'tis the Rest and Refreshment of
a man's Spirit, <hi>Psal. 116. 7. Return unto thy</hi> rest,
<hi>O my Soul.</hi> When we attain perfect Communion
with God in Heaven, we attain to perfect Rest;
and all the Rest the Spirit of man finds on Earth,
is found in Communion with God. Take a san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified
person who hath intermitted for some
time his communion with the Lord; and ask
him, is your Soul at rest and ease? He will tell
you no. The motions of his Soul, are like those
of a member out of Joynt, neither comly, nor
easie. Let that man recover his spiritual frame
again, and with it he recovers his Rest and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.
Christians, you meet with variety of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in this World; many a sweet Comfort cut off,
many a hopeful project dasht by the hand of
Providence; and what think you is the meaning,
of those blasting, disappointing Providences?
Surely, this is their design and errand, to disturb
your false rest in the bosom of the Creature; to
pluck away those pillows you were laying your
Heads upon, that thereby you might be reduced
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:109022:233"/>
unto God, and recover your lost communion
with him; and say with <hi>David, Return unto thy
rest, O my Soul.</hi> Sometimes we are setling our
selves to rest in an Estate, in a Child, or the
like: at this time it is usual with God to say,
Go Losses smite and blast such a mans Estate, go
Death, and take away the desire of his Eyes with
a stroke, that my Child may find rest nowhere
but in me. God is the Ark, the Soul like the
Dove, <hi>Noah</hi> sent forth, let it fly where it will,
it shall find no rest till it comes back to God.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="excellency">
                  <head>IV. Excellency.</head>
                  <p>It is the <hi>Desire</hi> of all gracious souls through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World. Wherever there is a gracious
Soul, the desires of that Soul are working after
communion with God; as Christ was called, <hi>The
desire of all Nations;</hi> so communion with him, is
<hi>The desire of all Saints:</hi> and this speaks the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of it, <hi>Psal. 27. 4. One thing have I desired
of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I might
dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life,
to see the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his
Temple. (i. e.)</hi> To enjoy communion with him
in the publick duties of his worship. <hi>One thing
have I desired,</hi> that is, one thing above all other
things; such an one, as if God shall give me, I
can comfortably bear the want of all other
things. Let him deny me what he will, if so be
he will not deny me <hi>this one thing;</hi> this one thing
shall richly recompence the want of all other
things. Hence the desires of the Saints are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
and fervent after this one thing, <hi>Psal. 42. 1.
My Soul panteth after thee O God;</hi> and <hi>Psal. 119. 81.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:109022:234"/>
My Soul fainteth for thy Salvation,</hi> Psal. 101. 2.
<hi>When wilt thou come unto me?</hi> No duties can satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
without it; the Soul cannot bear the delays,
much less the denials of it. They reckon their
lives worth nothing without it. Ministers may
come, Ordinances and Sabbaths may come; but
there's no satisfaction to the desires of a gracious
Heart till God come too. <hi>O when wilt thou come
unto me?</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="excellency">
                  <head>V. Excellency.</head>
                  <p>As it is the <hi>Desire,</hi> so it is the <hi>Delight</hi> of all
the Children of God both in Heaven and Earth;
as communion with the Saints is the delight of
Christ, <hi>Cant. 2. 14. Let me hear thy voice.</hi> And
again, <hi>Cant. 8. 13. The companions harken to thy voice,
cause me to hear it.</hi> So communion with Christ is
the delight of his people, <hi>Cant. 2. 3. I sat under his
shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
my taste.</hi> 'Tis the pleasure of Christ to see
the yearning Countenances, the blushing Cheeks,
the droping Eyes of his people upon their Knees.
And it is the delight of the Saints to see a smile
upon his Face, to hear a voice of pardon and
peace from his Lips. I must tell you Christians,
you must look for no such delights as these in
any earthly enjoyment; none better than these
till you come home to glory. Communion with
God then appears most excellent in as much as it
is found to be the desire and delight of all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Souls.</p>

                  <p>'Tis the <hi>Envy</hi> of Satan; that which cuts and
grates that wicked Spirit. O how it grates and
galls that proud and envious Spirit, to see Men
and Women enjoying the felicity and pleasure
of that communion with God, from which he
himself is fallen, and cut off for ever! To see
the Saints embosomed in delightful communion
with Christ, whilst himself feels the pangs of
horror and despair! This is what he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
to behold. And therefore you shall find in
your experience, that times of communion with
God, are usually buisie times of temptations
from the Devil, <hi>Zach. 3. 1. And he shewed me</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua
<hi>the high Priest standing before the Lord, and
Satan standing at his right-hand to resist him.</hi> 'Tis
well for thee Christian, that thou hast an <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
standing at Gods right-hand to resist and
frustrate his attempts upon thee; otherwise <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
would this way destroy your communion with
God, and make that which is now your delight,
to be your terror. Many ways doth the <hi>Devil</hi>
oppose the Saints communion with God. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he labours to divert them from it. This
business shall fall in, or that occasion fall out,
on purpose to divert thy Souls approach to God;
but if he cannot prevail there, then he labours
to distract your thoughts, and break them into a
thousand vanities. Or if he succeed not there,
then he attacks you in your return from duty,
with Spiritual Pride, Security, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These fierce
oppositions of Hell discover the worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of communion with God.</p>

                  <p>'Tis the <hi>End</hi> of all Ordinances and Duties of
Religion; God hath instituted every Ordinance
and Duty, whether publick or private, to beget
and maintain communion betwixt himself and
our Souls. What are Ordinances, Duties, and
Graces, but perspective Glasses to give us a sight
of God, and help us to communion with him?
God never intended his Ordinances to be our rest,
but <hi>mediums</hi> and instruments of communion with
himself, who is our true rest. When we go into
a <hi>Boat,</hi> 'tis not with an intention to dwell and
rest there, but to Ferry us over the Water,
where our business lies. If a Man miss of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God in the best Ordinances or Duty, it
yields him little comfort. He comes back from
it, like a man that hath travelled a great many

God is a terror to my Soul. I am going to his

place, <hi>Gal. 5. 25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also
walk in the Spirit;</hi> that is, let us evidence the
life of grace in us by exercising that grace in a

most excellent and successful instrument for that
purpose in all the World, <hi>Gal. 5. 16. This I say
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:109022:237"/>
then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the
works of the flesh.</hi> Walking in the Spirit is the
same thing with walking in communion with
God. Now, saith the Apostle, if you thus walk
in the Spirit, in the acting of faith, love and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
throughout the course of holy duties,
the effect of this will be, that ye shall not fulfil
the lusts of the flesh; he doth not say, You shall
not feel the motions of sin in you, or temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to sin assaulting you; but, he saith, you shall
not fulfil the lusts of the flesh; sin shall not have
dominion over you; this will let out the life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood
of sin. A temptation overcome this way,
is more effectually subdued than by all the vows,
resolutions, and external means in the World;
as a Candle that is blown out with a puff of
breath, may be rekindled by another puff; but
if it be quencht in water, 'tis not so easily light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
again. So it is here, you never find that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or success in temptations, when your hearts
are up with God in the exercises of faith and
love, as you do when your hearts hang loose
from him and dead towards him. The <hi>Schoolmen</hi>
assign this as one reason why the Saints in Heaven
are impeccable, no sin can fasten upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
say they, they there enjoy the beatifical vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of God. This is sure, the more communion
any man hath with God on Earth, the freer he
lives from the power of his corruptions.</p>

which lye the pleasant kernels and grains, and
that's the food. The Hypocrite who goes no

Children of light, in a state of reconciliation,
yet walk in the darkness of outward afflictions,
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:109022:238"/>
and inward desertions and temptations; but as
soon as ever the light of Gods countenance
shines upon the Soul in the duties of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

When in reality the sweetest liberty is enjoyed
in those Duties at which they thus snuff. The
Law of Christ is the Law of Liberty; the Soul
of man never enjoys more Liberty, than when it
is bound with the strictest bands of Duty to God.
Here's liberty from enthralling lusts, and from
enslaving fears. <hi>The Spirit of Life which is in

any restraint from their lusts, they will
have their freedom to sin; a freedom they shall
have, such as it is, <hi>Rom. 6. 20. When ye were the

A peculiar mercy which none but the Redeemed

they are uncapable of these. No supping
with Christ upon such excellent privileges and
mercies as these, till the heart be opened to him
by faith; you cannot come nigh to God, until
you be first made nigh by reconciliation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.
13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. What would your

were it not for this mercy that sweetens
them all. And there is this difference among
many others, betwixt this mercy and all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  <p>'Tis <hi>Natural</hi> to the new Creature; the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

as it is to the new-born babe to make to the

There is a law upon the regenerate part which
inwardly, and powerfully obliges it, to acts of
Duty and converse with God in them. Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with God is a thing that riseth out of the
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:109022:240"/>
principles of grace. You know all Creatures in
this lower World act according to the Laws of
Nature, the Sun will rise, and the Sea will flow
at its appointed time; and the gracious Soul will
make towards its God in the times and seasons of
Communion with him. They are not forced on
to those Duties by the frights of Conscience, and
the fears of Hell, so much as by the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
of the new Creature. Two things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate
Communion with God to be co-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to the regenerate part, called the inner-man,
and the hidden-man of the heart, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) The
<hi>Restlesness</hi> of a gracious Soul without it, <hi>Cant.</hi>
3. 2. The Church in the first <hi>verse</hi> had sought her
beloved, but found him not; doth she sit down
satisfied in his absence? No, no, <hi>I will rise now
and go about the City, in the streets, and in the
broad ways; I will seek him whom my Soul loveth.</hi>
(2.) The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> the rest and
delight which the Soul finds and feels in the
enjoyment of Communion with God, plainly
shews it to be agreeable to the new Nature, <hi>Psal.</hi>
63. 5. <hi>My Soul shall be satisfied whilst I think on thee.</hi>
And when it is thus, then Duties become easie,
and pleasant to the Soul, 1 <hi>Iohn 5. 3. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
are not grievous.</hi> Yea, and such a Soul
will be constant and assiduous in those Duties.
That which is natural, is constant, as well as
pleasant; what's the reason Hypocrites throw up
the Duties of Religion, in times of difficulty,
but because they have not an inward principle
agreeable to them? The motives to Duty lie
without them, not within them.</p>

that way, so that word signifies. There be few
Christians that have driven this Soul-enriching

strength, <hi>Psal. 13 8. 3. I cryed, and thou strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedst

of our Comforts; what a poor House is kept
by many of Gods own Children? Living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
hopes and fears, seldom tasting the riches
and pleasures, the joys and comforts of assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;
and will you know the reasons of it,
there are Five things which usually keep them
poor and low as to Spiritual Joys and Comforts.
(1.) The incumbrances of the World, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
them from, or distract them in their duties
of Communion with God; and so keep them low
in their Spiritual Comforts: They have so much
to do on Earth, that they have little time for
Heavenly employments. Oh, what a noise and
din do the trifles of this World make in the
Heads and Hearts of many Christians! How
dear do we pay for such trifles as these? (2.) A
Spirit of formality creeping in to the duties of
Religion, impoverishes the vital Spirit thereof;
like the wanton embraces of the Ivy, which
binds and starves the Tree it clasps about. Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
cannot thrive under formality; and 'tis dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to keep out formality in a setled course
of Duty, and much more when Duties are inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
(3.) The business of temptations pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering
the minds of many Christians; especially
such as are of melancholy; constitutions; how
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:109022:243"/>
importunate and restless are these temptations
with some Christians? They can make little
comfort or advantage out of Duty by reason of
them. (4.) Heart-apostacy, inward decays of
our first love, is another reason why our Duties
prosper so little, <hi>Rev. 2. 4. Thou hast left thy first
love.</hi> You were not wont to serve God with such
coldness. (5.) In a word, Spiritual pride im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishes
our Comforts. The joys of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
like brisk Wines, are too strong for our
weak heads. For these causes many Christians
are kept low in Spiritual comforts.</p>

                     <hi>How sweet and desirable is the society of the
Saints! it must needs be desirable to walk with them,
who walk with God, 1</hi> John 1. 3. No such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
as the Saints. What benefit or pleasure
can we find in converses with sensual world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings?
All we can carry away out of such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
is guilt, or grief. <hi>All my delights,</hi> saith
<hi>David, is in the Saints, and in the excellent of the
Earth, which excel in vertue,</hi> Psal. 16. 3. And
their society would certainly be much more
sweet and desirable than it is, did they live more
in Communion with God than they do. There
was a time when the Communion of the Saints
was exceeding lovely, <hi>Mal. 3. 16. Acts</hi> 2. 46, 47.

                  <p>What an unspeakable Mercy is Conversion which
lets the Soul into such a state of Spiritual pleasure?</p>
                  <p>Here's the beginning of your acquaintance
with God, the first taste of Spiritual pleasures,
of which there shall never be an end. All the
time men have spent in the World in an uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
state, hath been a time of estrangement
and alienation from God; when the Lord brings
a man to Chris, in the way of Conversion, he
then begins his first acquaintance with God, <hi>Iob
22. 21. Acquaint now thy self with him, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e at
peace, thereby good shall come unto thee.</hi> This is your
first acquaintance with the Lord, which will be
a growing thing; every visit you give him in
prayer increaseth your acquaintance, and begets
more intimacy, and humble holy familiarity, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and you. And oh, what a paradice of
pleasure doth this let the Soul into! The life of
Religion abounds with pleasures, <hi>Psal. 16. 11. All
his ways are ways of pleasantness, and his paths are
peace,</hi> Prov. 3. 17. Now you know where to go
and unload any trouble that presseth your Hearts;
whatever prejudices and scandals Satan and his
instruments cast upon Religion; this I will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
of it, that that man must necessarily be a
stranger to true pleasure, and empty of real
comfort, who is a stranger to Christ and the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of Communion with him. 'Tis true, here's
no allowance for sinful pleasures, nor any want
of Spiritual pleasures. Bless God therefore for
converting grace, you that have it; and list up
a cry to Heaven for it, you that want it.</p>

                  <p>Lastly, <hi>If there be so much delight and pleasure
in our imperfect and often interrupted Communion
with God here; O then, what is Heaven! What
are the immediate visions of his face in the perfect
state?</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 9. <hi>Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard,
neither have entred into the heart of man, the things
which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> You
have heard glorious and ravishing reports in the
Gospel of that blessed future state, things which
the Angles desire to look into. You have felt
and tasted joys unspeakable, and full of glory, in
the actings of your faith and love upon Christ;
yet all that you have heard, and all that you
have felt and tasted in the way to glory, falls
so short of the perfection and blessedness of that
state, that Heaven will and must be a great sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
to them that have now the greatest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
with it. Though the present com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
of the Saints are sometimes as much as
they can bear, for they seem to reel and stagger
under the weight of them, <hi>Cant. 2. 5. Stay me
with flagons, comfort me with apples, I am sick of
love.</hi> Yet, I say, these high tides of present joy,
are but shallows to the joys of his immediate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 12. And as they run not so deep,
so are they not constant and continued as they
shall be above, 2 <hi>Thes. 4. ult. Ever with the Lord.</hi>

in the ways of your Communion with God,
see that you be strict and circumspect in the
course of your Conversations. 'Tis the loosness
and carelesness of our hearts and lives, which
impoverishes our Spiritual comforts. A little
pride, a little carelesness dashes and frustrates a
great deal of comfort which was very near us,
almost in our hands; to allude to that, <hi>Hosea
7. 1. When I would have healed</hi> Israel, <hi>then the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
of</hi> Ephraim <hi>was discovered.</hi> So here, just
when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> desire of thy heart was come to the

Isa.</hi> 59. 2. The Comforter, the holy Spirit, is
sensible and tender, he hath quick resentments of
your unkindnesses and offences. As ever therefore
you expect comfort from him, beware of him,
and grieve him not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the last place, this Point speaks
necessary counsel and advice to <hi>Vnbelievers;</hi> to
all that live estranged from the life of God, and
have done so from the Womb, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58. 3. To
you the voice of the Redeemer sounds a summons
once more, <hi>Behold I stand at the door and knock.</hi>
Oh, that at last you might be prevailed with to
comply with the merciful terms propounded by
him. Will you shut out a Saviour bringing Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
Pardon and Peace with him? Christ is
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:109022:246"/>
thy rightful owner, and demands possession of
thy Soul, if thou wilt now hear his voice, thy
former refusals shall never be objected. If thou
still reject his gracious offers, mercy may never
more be tendered to thee; there is a call of
Christ, which will be the last call, and after that
no more. Take heed what you do, if you still
demur and delay, your damnation is just, inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
and unexcusable. Hear me therefore you
unregenerated Souls, in what rank or condition
soever providence hath placed you in this World;
whether you be rich or poor, young or old, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
or Servants, whether there be any stirrings
of conviction in your Consciences or not. For
however your conditions in this World differ
from each other at present, there is one common
misery hanging over you all, if you continue in
that state of unbelief you are now fixed in.</p>
                  <p>And first, Harken to the voice and call of
Christ, you that are exalted by providence above
your poorer neighbours; you that have your Heads,
Hands and Hearts full of the World; men of
trade and business; I have a few solemn questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to ask you this day.</p>
                  <p>I. You have made many gainful bargains in
your time, but what will all profit you if the
agreement be not made betwixt Christ and your
Souls? Christ is that treasure which only can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
you, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 44. Thou art a poor and
miserable wretch, whatever thou hast gained of
this World, if thou have not gained Christ;
thou hast heaped up guilt with thy riches, which
will more torment thy Conscience hereafter than
thy estate can yield thee comfort here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="449" facs="tcp:109022:246"/>
2ly, You have made many assurances to secure
your floating Estates, which you call <hi>Policies;</hi>
but what assurance have you gotten for your
Souls? Are not they exposed to eternal hazards?
O impolitick man! To be so provident to secure
trifles, and so negligent in securing the richest
treasure.</p>
                  <p>3ly, You have adjusted many accounts with
men, but who shall make up your accounts with
God, if you be Christless? <hi>What shall it profit a
man to gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul?
Matth.</hi> 16. 26. Say not you have much business
under your Hands, and cannot allow time; you
will have space enough hereafter to reflect upon
your folly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, You that are poor and mean in the
World, what say you, Will you have two Hells,
one here, and another hereafter? No comfort in
this World, nor hope for the next? Your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations
here laid in the dust, and your hopes
for Heaven built upon the sand? O, if you were
once in Christ, how happy were you, though you
knew not where to fetch your next bread! <hi>Poor
in the World, but rich in faith; and heirs of the
Kingdom which God hath promised,</hi> James 2. 5. O
blessed state! If you had Christ, you had then a
right to all things, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 22, 23. You had then
a Father to take care for you: but to be poor,
and Christless; no comfort from this World,
nor hopes from the next; this is to be truly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
indeed. Your very straights and wants
should prompt you to the great duty I am now
pressing on you; and methinks it should be
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:109022:247"/>
matter of encouragement that the greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Christs friends and followers came out
of that rank and order of men to which you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, You that are <hi>Seamen,</hi> floating so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon the great deeps, you are reckoned a
third sort of persons between the living and the
dead; you belong not to the dead, because you
yet breath; and scarcely to the living, because
you are continually so near death: What think
you friends, have you no need of a Saviour? Do
you live so secure from the reach and danger of
death? Have your lives been so pure, righteous,
and innocent, who have been in the thick of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
in the World abroad? Ponder that
Scripture, I <hi>Cor. 6. 9, 10. Be not deceived, neither
Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate,
nor Abusers of themselves with man-kind,
&amp;c.</hi> Ponder it, I say, and think whether you
have not as great and pressing a necessity of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, as any poor Souls under Heaven?
You have had many temporal Salvations from
God, great and eminent deliverances, and will
these satisfie you? Is it enough that your bodies
are delivered from the danger of the Sea, though
your Souls sink and perish in the Ocean of Gods
wrath for ever? If you will yet accept Christ
upon his terms, all that you have done shall be
forgiven, <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 2. The Lord now calls to you
in a still voice, if you hear his voice well, if not
you may shortly hear his voice in the tempestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
storms without you, and a roaring Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
within you. Poor man, think what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:109022:247"/>
in Christ will be worth, wert thou now
(as shortly thou maist be) floating upon a piece
of wreck, or shivering upon a cold and desolate
rock, crying mercy, Lord, mercy: Well mercy
is now offered thee, but in vain wilt thou expect
to find it, if thou continue thus to despise and
reject it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, You that are aged and full of days,
hearken to the voice of Christ, God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
upon you a long time: When you were
young, you said, 'tis time enough yet, we will
mind these things when we are old, and come
nearer to the borders of Eternity. Well, now you
are old, and just upon the borders of it; will
you indeed mind it now? you have left the great
concernments of your Souls to this time, this
short, very short time: And do the temptations
of your Youth take hold upon your Age? what,
delay and put off Christ still, as you were wont
to do? Poor Creatures, you are almost gone out
of time, you have but a short time to delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate;
what you do must be done quickly, or it
can never be done: Your night is even come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, when no man can work.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, You that are young in the Bud or
Flower of your time, Christ is a Suiter for your
first Love; he desires the kindness of your youth;
your Spirits are vigorous, your Hearts tender,
your Affections flowing and impressive; you are
not yet entred into the incumbrances and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracting
cares of the World; hereafter a crowd
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:109022:248"/>
and thick succession of earthly employments and
engagements will come on; sin will harden you,
by custom and continuance; now is your time;
you are in the convertible Age; few that pass
the season of youth (comparatively speaking)
are brought over to Christ afterwards: 'Tis a
rarity, the wonder of an Age, to hear of the
conversion of aged Sinners; besides, you are the
hopes of the next Generation: Should you be
Christ-neglecting and despising Souls; how bad
soever the present Age is, the next will be worse.
Say not, we have time enough before us, we will
not quench the sprightly vigour of our Youth
in melancholy thoughts: Remember there are
Sculls of all sizes in <hi>Golgotha;</hi> Graves of all lengths
in the Church-yard: You may anticipate those
that stand nearer the Grave than you seem to do.
O you cannot be happy too soon: As young as
you are, did you but tast the Comforts that be
in Christ, nothing would grieve you more, than
that you knew him no sooner. Behold he stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at thy Door, in the morning of thy
Age, knocking this day for admission into thy
Heart.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, You that have had some slight
ineffectual vanishing Convictions upon you
formerly; the Lord Jesus once more renews
his call, will you now at last hear his voice?
'Tis an infinite mercy to have a second
call. I doubt not, but there are many among
you, whilst you have sat under the Word, have
had such thoughts as these in your Hearts, sure,
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:109022:248"/>
my condition is not right, nor safe; there must
another manner of work pass upon my Soul, or
I am lost for ever. External duties of Religion
I do perform, but I am a stranger to Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Such inward convictions as these were
the Knocks and Calls of Christ, but they passed
away and were forgotten; your Convictions are
dead, and your Hearts the more hardned; for
it is in puting a Soul under Conviction, as it
is in puting Iron into the Fire, and quenching it
again: which hardens it the more. You have
been near the Kingdom of God, but the more
miserable for that, if you be shut out at last.
The quicknings of your Convictions is the right
way to the saving of your Souls. The Lord
make you this day to hear his Voice.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Such as have come hither upon
vain or vile accounts, for meer novelty, or
worse ends; to catch advantages, or reproach
the truths of God. Scoffing at the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
and awful Voice of Christ. The Word
that you have slighted and reproached, the
same shall Judge you in that great Day, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Lord give you Repentance unto Life,
and make the Heart tremble under it, that
hath scoffed at it. <hi>Be not mockers, lest your bands
be made strong,</hi> Isa. 28. 22.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, To Conclude, Let all, whose Hearts
the Lord hath opened this day, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of the Gospel, the blessed instrument
of their Salvation, bless the Lord, that
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:109022:249"/>
hath made it a Key by Regeneration to open
the door of Salvation to your Souls. And as
you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so
walk ye in him.</p>

of men, who hold the truth in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</head>
            <p>IN all the foregoing Sermons I have been plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and wooing for Christ. And as <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Servant to win the <hi>Damsels</hi> Consent, told her
what Treasures his Masters Son had, so have I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
to shew you some part of the unsearchable
Riches of Christ, if by any means I might allure
your hearts, and be instrumental to close the happy
Match betwixt him and you; and (as the <hi>Apostle</hi>
speaks) espouse you to one Husband, even to
Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:109022:250"/>
But alas! How few stir towards him? The
most seem to be immovably fixed in their Natural
State, and sinful Courses. All our Arguments and
Intreaties return to us again, and effect nothing.
'Tis amazing to think what is the matter, that Souls
which have in them the inbred Hopes and Fears of
the World to come, and self reflecting Powers;
cannot for all this be prevailed with to quit the way
of sin, and to embrace the way of Holiness, though
their Consciences mean while stand convinced that
Eternal Damnation is the issue and result of the one;
Life, Peace and Eternal Joyes of the other.</p>
            <p>This hath put me upon a serious search what
may be the cause and reason of this fixed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
obstinacy, and in this it seems evidently
to lye, with most that live in an unregenerate state
under the Gospel; that they put a force upon their
own Consciences, and do imprison and hold the
Truth in unrighteousness, though the Wrath of
God be revealed from Heaven against all that do
so.</p>
            <p>If by this Discourse I can but set truth at Liberty,
and loose the Lords Prisoners which lye bound in
your Souls. I shall not doubt but the value of
Christ will quickly rise among you, and free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions
will make the work of your Ministers
much more easie and successful than they now find
it. 'Tis hardly imaginable but the things you have
heard must leave your Souls under Convictions,
but if you suppress and stifle them, they produce
nothing but aggravations of Sin and Misery. Now
in order to the free and effectual working of all
your Convictions, and begetting that reverence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:109022:250"/>
which is due to them from every Soul, as to the
Voice of God, I have chosen this Scripture, the
scope and sense whereof I shall next give you.</p>
            <p>The true scope and aim of this Context, is to
prove the Justification of Sinners to be only by the
imputed Righteousness of Christ in the way of

or vengeance of God. 'Tis a word of deep and
dreadful signification; the Damned that feel the

in <hi>Psal. 90. 11. Who knows the power of thine anger,
according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</hi> That is, the
fears of an incensed Deity are no vain Bug-bears,
Nor the effects of Ignorance and Superstition as
<hi>Atheists</hi> Fancy; but let mens Fears of it be what
they will they shall find except they repent, the
Wrath of God to be according to, yea and far
above their Fears of it. If the Wrath of a King
be as the Messengers of Death, what then is the

Wrath is here said to be <hi>revealed,</hi>

their own Consciences gave them notice and
warning of it. Thus it was revealed to them by
an internal Testimony, a Witness within them,
and it was also revealed to them by the Instances
and Examples of strokes and punishments of Sin

comprizeth all sins against the second Table,
acts of Fraud, Uncleanness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> against Men:
And because these two general comprehensive
words are branched out into many particulars,
therefore he saith, <hi>the wrath of God is revealed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all ungodliness and unrighteousness.</hi> There is
not one of the many sins into which ungodliness and
unrighteousness are branched out, but incenseth
the Lords Wrath, and though he only mentions
the Sins, in the <hi>Abstract,</hi> we are to understand the
Abstract put here for the <hi>Concrete;</hi> the sins for the
sinners that commit them; or Gods punishing these
sins upon the persons of the Sinners.</p>
            <p>(3.) Lastly, We have here before us the special
aggravation of these sins, or that which made them
much more provoking to God than otherwise they
had been. And it was this, that whilst they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
these Sins, or omitted those Duties, <hi>they
held the truth in unrighteousness:</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the

in the way of that Truth of God, or those
common Notions they had of his Being, Power,
Goodness, Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as also of his Worship,
and the difference between Good and Evil. These
Truths struggled in their Consciences, as the Child
in the Womb, to come to the Birth; Conscience
instigated them to Duty, and laboured to restrain
them from Sin, but all in vain, they overbare their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:109022:252"/>
own Consciences, and kept those Sentiments and
Convictions Prisoners, though they struggled for
Liberty to break forth into Practice and Obedience.
Their Convictions were kept down under the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
and Power of Corruptions, as a Prisoner is
shut up by his Keeper: Their Lusts were too hard
for their Light. Thus you have both the Scope
and Sense of the Text. The Point from it is
this.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>That the wrath of God is dreadfully incensed against

               <p>Sins of Ignorance provoke the Wrath of God,

               </list>
               <p>(1.) 'Twill be needful to speak a little to the
nature of Conscience in general. Conscience (as
our <hi>Divines</hi> well expresse it) is the judgment of a
man upon himself, as he is Subject to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God. A Judgment it is, and a practical
Judgment too; it belongs to the understanding fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 31. If we would judge our selves,</hi>
&amp;c. this self-judgment is the proper Office of the
Conscience; and to enable it for this its work and
office, there are (as is generally observed) three
things belonging to every mans Conscience.</p>
               <p>(1) A Knowledge of the Rule or Law according
to which it is to judge, called the <hi>Synteresis,</hi> which
is a treasury of Rules and Principles without which
Conscience can no more do its work, than an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificer</hi>
that wants his Square or Level can do his.</p>
               <p>(2) Knowledge of the Facts or Matters to be
judged, called the <hi>Syneidesis.</hi> The Conscience of
every man keeps a Register of his Actions,
Thoughts, and the very Secrets of the Heart.</p>
               <p>(3) An Ability and delegated Authority to pass
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:109022:253"/>
Judgment on our selves and Actions according to
the Rule and Law of God, called <hi>Crisis,</hi> Judgment.
Here it sits upon the Bench as Gods Vicegerent,
Absolving or Condemning as it finds the Sincerity
or Hypocrisie of the heart upon Tryal. 1 <hi>Ioh.
3.</hi> 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Conscience therefore is an High and Aweful Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
it is <hi>solo Deo minor;</hi> next and immediately
under God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Judge; riding as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did in the
second Chariot, and concerning Conscience he saith
to every man, as he once did to <hi>Moses</hi> with respect
to <hi>Pharaoh, See, I have made thee a god to Pharaoh,
Exod.</hi> 7. 1. The Voice of Conscience is the Voice of
God. What it bindeth or looseth on Earth, <hi>Clave
non errante,</hi> is accordingly bound or loosed in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 21. the greatest deference and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
Obedience is due to its Commands. Its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
are of all the most sweet, and its Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnations
(only excepting those by the mouth of
Christ in the last Judgment) most terrible. <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi>
spake not without ground when he said, <hi>What
Death would I not rather chuse? what Punishment
would I not rather bear? yea, into what profound
Abyss of Hell would I not rather enter, than to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
against my Conscience?</hi> 'Tis like he had felt
the Terrors of it, to be more bitter than Death.
How many have chosen strangling rather than life
under the Terrors of Conscience? Wherever you
go, Conscience accompanies you. VVhatever you
say, do, or but think, it Registers and Records in
order to the Day of Account. VVhen all Friends
forsake thee, yea, when thy Soul forsakes thy Body.
Conscience will not, cannot forsake thee. When thy
Body is weakest and dullest, thy Conscience is most
vigorous and active. Never more life in the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109022:253"/>
than when Death makes its nearest approach
to the Body; when it smiles, chears, acquits, and
comforts, O what an Heaven doth it create within
a Man? And when it frowns, condemns, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies;
how doth it becloud, yea, benight all the
Pleasures, Joyes and Delights of this World. O
Conscience, how glad would the damned be to have
taken their last farewel of thee, when they bid this
World, and all its Inhabitants farewel at Death!
And what had become of all the Sufferers and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,
when shut up from Friends in Dungeons, had
it not been for thy chearing Cordials and Comforts,
thou there administredst to support them! 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the best of Friends, or the worst of Enemies
in the whole Creation. This is Conscience, these are
its Powers and Offices, which was the first thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Our next enquiry must be into the Light
of Conscience, and the various kinds of that Light.</p>
               <p>The Lord did not frame such an excellent Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
as the Soul of Man, without Windows to let
in light; nor doth he deny the benefit of light to any
Soul: But there is a twofold Light which Men
have to inform and guide their Consciences.
<list>
                     <item>1. The Light of Natural Reason, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</item>
                     <item>2. The Light of Scripture Revelation, which is
special.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>(1,) There is the common light of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
which is connate, called by <hi>Solomon, Prov.
20. 27 The Candle of the Lord. The Spirit of Man
is the Candle of the Lord.</hi> This is affirmed by him
that had an extraordinary portion of intellectuals,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109022:254"/>
a brighter lamp of Reason and Wisdom than other
Men: And this is not only true of the Soul in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
but of that special Power of it, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Conscience,</hi> which is Gods Spie, and Mans O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verseer.
The <hi>Heathens</hi> had this Light shining in
their Minds and Consciences: Some of them by the
alone help of this Natural Light made wonderful
discoveries of the Mysteries of Nature, yea, they
found its Efficacy and Power great in their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to raise their hopes or fears according to the
good or evil they had done.</p>

               <p>And to the shame of many that are called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
some among them pay'd great Reverence to
their own Consciences</p>
               <q>

                  <l>Turpe quid ausurus, te sine teste time.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But however, the generality of them did not so,
and are taxed for it in the Text: And besides, this
Light can make no discoveries of Christ, and of
the way of Salvation by him. The most Eagle-ey'd
Philosophers among them, were in the dark
here. And therefore,</p>
               <p>(2.) God hath afforded Men a more clear and
excellent Light to shine into their Minds and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
even the Light of the Gospel, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the Light of Natural Reason, is as the
Light of the Sun to the dim Moonlight, <hi>Psal. 147.
20. He sheweth his word to Iacob, his Statutes and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109022:254"/>
his Iudgments to Israel; he hath not dealt so with
any Nation, and for his Iudgments they have not
known them, Praise ye the Lord.</hi> Every Creature
hath the Name of God engraven on it, but he hath
magnified his Word above all his Name, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 2.
God who best knows the rate and value of his own
Mercies, accounts this a singular favour and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to any Nation. Without Revelation, we
could never have known the cause of our Misery,
the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> or the only way and means of
our recovery by Christ: By this a People are lifted
up to Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 21. in respect of means
and advantages of Salvation; and consequently the
contempt or neglect of such Light and Love, will
certainly plunge the guilty into proportionable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.
<hi>Iohn 3. 19. This is the condemnation that Light
is come into the World, and Men love Darkness rather
than Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, God doth not only afford the Light
of Natural Reason, and External Gospel Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to some Men in an eminent degree; but to both
these he superadds the internal illumination of his
Spirit, which is the clearest and most glorious
Light in the whole World. <hi>He shineth into their
hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the
Glory of God, in the face of Iesus Christ, 2 Cor.
4. 6.</hi> These are the three sorts of Light that God
makes to shine into the Soules and Consciences of
Men, to direct and guide them; the first a common
and general Light, the two last the most clear and
transcendent in Excellency; especially that of the
Spirit with the Gospel: For though the Sun be ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen,
yet men may draw the Curtains about them,
and lie in darkness, but the Spirit opens them, and
makes it shine in.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:109022:255"/>
(3.) How this Light shining into the Consciences
of Men, obligeth them to Obedience, and how
Mens Lusts struggle against the Obligations of an
enlightned Conscience, is the next thing to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to.</p>
               <p>'Tis manifest and beyond all Controversie, that
an enlightned Conscience lays strong and indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Obligations and Engagements on the Soul to
Obedience: For the Will of God is the Supream
Law, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 15 'tis the Will of <hi>the only Potentate
the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords:</hi> And the
promulgation and manifestation of it, so binds the
Conscience of the Creature to Obedience, as no
Authority or Power on Earth can loose those bands;
no Man can grant a <hi>supersedeas</hi> in this case, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Soul so bound by a <hi>noli prosequi;</hi> for
Conscience as Gods <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in his Name requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Obedience, and the Man that heareth the
Voice of God from the Mouth of his own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
presently thereupon becomes a <hi>Debtor, Rom.
1.</hi> 14. put under a necessity, 1 Cor. 9 16.</p>
               <p>Now Conscience by reason of the Light that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
into it, feeling it self under such strong bands
and necessities, stimulates and urgeth the Soul to
Obedience, warnes, commands, and presses the
Soul to its duty, against the contrary Interests and
inclinations of the Flesh: And hence arise those
Combats and conflicts in the bosoms of Men; as
the struggles of the Child in the Womb at the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of time causes the throws and pangs of Travail.
Sometimes Conscience prevails, and sometimes
Lusts and Corruptions prevail, and that with great
difficulty; for 'tis not alike easie to all Men to shake
off, or burst the bands of their own Consciences,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:109022:255"/>
though others can do it easily What an hard
tugg had <hi>Saul</hi> to conquer his own Conscience? <hi>I
forced my self,</hi> saith he, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. 12. He knew
it belonged not to him to offer Sacrifice, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
plainly told him, it would be his Sin,
but yet the fear of the Philistins being stronger
than the fear of God, he adventured upon it
<hi>renitente conscientiâ,</hi> against the plain dictates of
his own Conscience. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> gives Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to put <hi>Iohn</hi> to death, <hi>Matth. 14. 9. The
King was sorry, nevertheless, for his Oaths sake, and
them which sate with him at meat, he commanded it
to be given her.</hi> His Honour weighed up all his
fears of sin, his own Word weighed more with
him than Gods Word: <hi>Nemo ita perplexus tenetur
inter duo vitia, quin exitus pateat absque tertio:</hi> No
man is held so perplexed between two Vices, but
he may find an issue, without falling into a third.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilates</hi> Conscience was convinced of Christ's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency;
<hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 18, 19. yet the fear of <hi>Coesar</hi>
hurries him on to the greatest of wickednesses, even
to give Sentence against Innocent Blood, yea, the
Blood of the Son of God. <hi>Darius</hi> in like manner,
<hi>Dan.</hi> 6. 14. He knew that <hi>Daniel</hi> was not only an
excellent Person, but that he was entrapt by the
<hi>Nobles</hi> merely for his Conscience, and that to put
him to Death, was to sacrifice him to their Malice,
this he and his Conscience debated all the day, many
encounters he had with it, for the Text saith, He
was sore displeased with himself, and set his Heart
on <hi>Daniel</hi> to deliver him, and laboured until the
going down of the Sun to deliver him; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a days sharp fight betwixt him and his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Lust prevails at last against Light, and returns

                  <hi>Victor</hi> out of the Field in the Evening. So it was

inward Voice, <hi>Don't write</hi> Spira, <hi>don't write;</hi> but
the love of his Estate, Wife, and Children drew his
Hand to the Paper, though Conscience struggled
hard to hold it back.</p>
               <p>Thus as the restless Sea strives to beat down, or
break over its bounds, so do impetuous Lusts strive
to overbear Light and Conviction; <hi>video meliora
proboque, deteriora sequor:</hi> They know this or that to
be a Sin, and that they hazard their Souls by it,
but yet they will adventure on it, and rush into
Sin as the Horse into the Battle.</p>
               <p>(4.) I promised to give you some instances of the
Conflicts betwixt Mens Consciences and their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
wherein Conscience is vanquisht and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born,
and by what Weapons the Victory over Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is obtained. Now the Convictions of Men
are two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>I. General, Respecting their State.</item>
                     <item>II. Particular, Respecting this or that Action.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>(I.) There are general Convictions, and Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
given to some Men and Women by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that their Condition or State of Soul is
neither right, nor safe; that they want the main
thing which constitutes a Christian, <hi>viz.</hi> Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or a gracious change of Heart and Life: They
hear and read the signs and effects of these things,
but their Conscience plainly tells them, it cannot
find them in them; that they enjoy the External
priviledges of the Saints, but they belong not to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:109022:256"/>
them, that something is still wanting, and that the
main thing too: O my Soul, thou art not right;
thou hast gifts, thou hast a Name to live, but for all
that thou art dead. Some further work must be
done upon thee, or thou art undone to Eternity:
thou passest for a good Christian among Men, but
wo to thee if thou die in the State thou art. These,
and such as these are the whispers of some Mens
Consciences in their Ears; and yet they cannot yield
themselves up into the hands of their Convictions,
so as to confess, and bewail their Hypocrisie, and
gross mistakes, and seek for a better foundation to
build their hope on. <hi>Foelix</hi> his Conscience gave
him such a terrible rouze and monition as this, and
made him to tremble whilst <hi>Paul</hi> reason'd with him
about Righteousness, and Temperance, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to come, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 25. it whispered in his
Ear such Language as this, O poor Soul, how shall
such an Oppressor, such an intemperate wretch as
thou art stand before God in this day of Judgment,
which <hi>Paul</hi> proves in thy face, is certainly future;
for as <hi>Tacitus</hi> sayeth of him, He was <hi>inexplebilis
Gurges,</hi> an insatiable gulph of Covetousness; so
it was with <hi>Agrippa, Acts</hi> 26. 28. He stood at
half bent, dubious and unresolved what to do: He
saw the Heavenly Doctrine of Christianity evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
confirmed by Doctrine and Miracles, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
pleaded hard with him to embrance it, and
had almost prevailed. Almost, or within a little
as the word is, thou perswadest me to be a
Christian; but <hi>Agrippa</hi> had too much Wealth and
Honours to deny and forsake for Christ; the Love
of the present World overbore both the hopes and
fears of the World to come: And thus that Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Fisher for Souls, who had throughly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:109022:257"/>
so many to Christ, caught but a piece of <hi>Agrippa,
almost</hi> is a great deal for so great a person: The
Gospel is a Drag-net, and brings up all sorts, whole
Christians, and half Christians. The Conscience
is caught, and the Will begins to incline, but oh
the power and prevalence of Sin! which like the
Rudder, commands all to a contrary course.</p>
               <p>If we come a little nearer, and enquire what are
those <hi>remoraes</hi> that stop Conscience in its course,
bind and imprison, stifle and suppress its Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
that although a Man strongly suspect his
foundation to be but Sand, his hopes for Heaven a
strong delusion, yet he will throw up his vain hopes,
consfess his self deceits, and begin all anew: What
is it which overbears Conscience in this cafe? Let
Men impartially examine their hearts, and it will
be found that these three things bind and imprison
these Convictions of Conscience, and hold the truth
in unrighteousness, <hi>viz.</hi> shame, fear, and pride
of Heart.</p>
               <p>(I.) Shame, Men that have been Professors, and
of good esteem in the World, are ashamed the
World should know the Mistakes and Errors of all
their life past, and what deluded Fools and self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
they have been: This is a powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
upon Conviction; how shall they look their
Acquaintance in the face? What will Men think
and say of them? How can ye believe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Honour one of another? Saith Christ, <hi>Iohn
5. 44. q. d.</hi> What you be Christians, and yet not
able to endure a censure, or a scoff upon your
Names? That stand more upon your Reputation,
than your Salvation: How can you believe?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:109022:257"/>
Oh what Madness and exalted Folly appears in
this Case! Men will chuse rather to go on, though
Conscience tells them the end of that way will be
Death, than suffer the shame of a just and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
retraction, which yet indeed is not their shame,
but their Duty, and Glory. You that are so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the shame of men, how will you be able to
endure the contempt and shame that shall be cast on
you from God, Angels and Men in the great Day?
<hi>Luk 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>26.</hi> 'Tis no shame to acknowledge your
mistake, but persist in it after Conviction, is shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Madness.</p>
               <p>I knew an excellent Minister, who proved an
eminent Instrument in the Church of God, who in
the beginning of his Ministerial Course, was not
upon the right Foundation of Regeneration. This
Man had rare Abilities, excellent Natural and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
Gifts, and could Preach of Regeneration,
Faith, and Heavenly-mindedness, though he felt
nothing of these things in his own Experience. His
Life was very unblameable, and he had no
mean Interest and esteem among good men. It
pleased the Lord whilst this Man was studying an
excellent Spiritual Point to preach to others, his
Conscience first preach'd it in his Study to himself,
and that with such a close and rousing Application,
as made him to tremble at it; telling him, that
though he had Gifts above many, and sobriety in
his Conversation; yet one thing, and that the main
thing Sanctifying Grace was wanting. Hereupon
the pangs of the New Birth seized his Soul, and the
Lord made him a most inward, searching, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Minister, and crown'd his Labours with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual
Success. This Minister to his dying day, was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:109022:258"/>
not ashamed in all companies to acknowledge his
mistake, and bless God for his recovery out of it,
and in most of his Sermons, he would endeavour to
convince Professors of the necessity of a second
Conversion.</p>
               <p>(2.) <hi>Fear</hi> is another pull-back, which with-holds
men from executing the Convictions of their own
Consciences, and obeying its calls in this grand case
and concern of the Soul. They are pretty easie and
safe under the External Profession, and Duties of
Religion, and are afraid of throwing up their vain
hopes, and engaging themselves heartily and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
in Religion, and there be two things scare
them.</p>
               <p>(1) The inward pains and troubles of Spirit at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
the New-Birth; which they have read and
heard of, and seen the effects of in others. Oh 'tis
a dreadful thing to lye under the Terrors that many
have felt, and so 'tis with them as with one that hath
a bone ill set, who if he have any ease, will rather
endure a little dayly pain, and be content to halt all
his Life, than undergoe the pain of another fraction
or dislocation in order to a perfect cure.</p>
               <p>(2) They are afraid of External Sufferings. The
form of Godliness leaves men a latitude to take or
leave according as the times favour or frown upon
the wayes of Religion, but the power of Godliness
that will engage and put them beyond retreat: They
must then stand to it, come what will. But Soul
let me tell thee if the just fears and apprehensions of
Hell, and the Eternal Wrath of God were upon
thee, to which thy Hypocrisie and formality will
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:109022:258"/>
expose thee; all these fears of inward or outward
troubles would vanish the same Hour.</p>
               <p>(3.) Pride of Heart suffers not this Conviction
of Conscience to work out its effects, but holds this
Truth in unrighteousness, to the hazard and ruine
of many Souls. Men that live upon their own Duties,
and Self-Righteousness are not easily brought to
renounce all this, and live upon the Righteousness
of Christ alone for Justification. Proud nature will
rather venture the hazzard of Damnation than such
self denial, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 3. As you see it common
among poor People, to live meanly on coarse Fare
of their own, than upon the Almes and bounty of
another.</p>
               <p>O but if once the day of Gods Power be come,
and a man begins to feel the Commandment come
home to his Conscience as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9.
when he comes to realize the World to come, the
value of his Soul, and the danger it is in; then all
these Remora's are as easily swept away, as so many
straws by the rapid Course of a mighty torrent.
Then let men say or think what they please, I must
not throw away my own Soul, to maintain a vain
Estimation among men. Let inward or outward
sufferings be never so great, 'tis better for me to
feel them, than to suffer the everlasting wrath of
the great and terrible God. Let my own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness
be what it will, all is but dung and dross to
the pure and perfect Righteousness of Christ.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As this General Conviction with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Mens State and Condition is held in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,
and Men and Women go with grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:109022:259"/>
Consciences and frequent inward Fears by
reason of it: so there are many particular Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
bound and imprisoned in Mens Souls. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Convictions I say, both as to sins committed,
and known Duties omitted against both Tables of
the Law of God; called in the Text, <hi>ungodliness</hi>
and <hi>unrighteousness.</hi> Conscience labours and strives
to bring men to confess, bewail, and reform them,
but cannot prevail; contrary Lusts and Interests
overpower them, and detain them in unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
What these are, and how they are with-held
by those Lusts, I shall give some Instances.</p>
               <div n="1" type="instance">
                  <head>I. Instance.</head>
                  <p>And First, for Convictions of <hi>Vngodliness.</hi> There
are many that call themselves Christians, whose
Consciences tell them God is to be daily and duely
worshipped by them, both in Family, and Closet
Prayer. It sets before them <hi>Iosua</hi>'s pious practice,
<hi>Ios. 24. 15. As for me, I and my house we will serve
the Lord.</hi> They know God is the <hi>Founder,</hi> the
<hi>Owner,</hi> the <hi>Master</hi> of their Families; that all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Blessings are from him, and therefore he is to
be owned, acknowledged and sought, in daily Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
Prayers and Praises. It tells them the Curse
of God hangs over prayerless Families, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10. 25.
and that they live in the inexcusable neglect of these
Duties, seldom worshipping of God with their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
or in their Closets; and that therefore they
live without God in the World. And dreadful
will the account and reckoning be at the Great Day,
for their own Souls, which they have starved for
want of Closet Prayer, and for the Souls commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to their charge, which perish for want of Family
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:109022:259"/>
Duties. This is the case of many who yet will
needs pass for Professors of Christianity.</p>
                  <p>Lord, how sad a case is here? How can men
possibly live in the daily neglect of so great, so
necessary a Duty? Certainly 'tis not for want of
Light or Conviction, the very light of Nature, if
we had no Bibles, discovers these Duties. But
three things hold this Truth of God dictated by
Mens Consciences in Unrighteousness, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Love of the World.</item>
                        <item>2. Consciousness of Inability.</item>
                        <item>3. A Disinclined Heart.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <hi>The Love of the World</hi> choaks this Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in the Souls of some; and they think it enough
to plead for their Excuse, the want of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and many encumberances they have, which
will not allow them time for these Duties. The
World is a severe Taskmaster, and fills their heads
and hands all the day with Cares and Toyles.</p>
                  <p>And must the mouth of Conscience then be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
with such a plea as this? No, no, God and
Conscience will not be answered and put off so.
The greatest number of Persons in the World from
whom God hath the most Spiritual and excellent
Worship; are of the lower and poorer rank, <hi>Psal.
74. 20. Iam.</hi> 2. 5. And its highly probable your
Necessities had been less, if your Prayers had been
more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And what sweeter outlet and vent to all these
troubles can you find, than Prayer? This would
sweeten all your Labours and Sorrows in the
World.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:109022:260"/>
Secondly, <hi>Consciousness and sense of Inability
and want of Gifts,</hi> restrains this Conviction in others.
Should they attempt such duties before others,
they shall but expose their own ignorance &amp; shame.</p>
                  <p>But this is a vain pretence of shake off Duty.
The neglect of Prayer is a principal Cause of that
inability you complain of. Gifts as well as Grace
grow by Exercise. To him that hath shall be given,
and he shall have more abundantly. And besides,
'tis the fruit of Pride, and argues your eye to be
more upon your own Honour than Gods. The
Lord regards not Oratory in Prayer; your broken
Expressions, yea, your Groans and Sighs please
him more than all the Eloquence in the VVorld.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, But the principal thing that restrains
Men from obeying their Convictions as to Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
and Closet Prayer is, <hi>A disinclined Heart.</hi>
That's the root and true cause, of these sinful neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
and Omissions. You favour not the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of these things, and what a man relishes no sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in, or finds no necessity of, is easily omitted
and let pass.</p>
                  <p>But wo to you that go from day to day self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
for the neglect of so known, so sweet, and
so necessary a Duty. If our Hearts condemn us,
God is greater than our hearts, I <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 20. He
that lives without Prayer, is dead whilst he lives;
and let men talk what they please, of secret Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with God; I am sure, if Religion did thrive
in the Closet, it could never be banished out of the
Family. The time is coming also when death will
disband and break up your Families, separate the
VVife from the Husband, the Child from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
the Servant from the Master; and then where
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:109022:260"/>
you shall find relief and comfort who have spent
your time together so sinfully and vainly, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, nor what account you can give to God in
the great day. Think sadly on these things, they
are worth thinking on.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="instance">
                  <head>II. Instance.</head>
                  <p>A second Instance of <hi>Vngodliness</hi> continued in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Convictions of Conscience, is <hi>Formali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y</hi> in
all the external duties of Religion, and Ordinances
of God. Have not some of your Consciences often
and plainly told you that though you be often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in the publick duties of Hearing, Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
yet your hearts are not with God in those duties.
They do not work after communion and fellowship
with him therein. 'Tis nothing but the force of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,
Custom, and care of Reputation brings
you there.</p>
                  <p>Such a conviction as this could it work home,
and do its work throughly, would be the salvation
of thy Soul. Were power added to the form, as
Conscience would have it, thou wert then a real
Christian, and out of the danger of Hell. The want
of this thy Conscience sees will be thy ruin, and
accordingly gives thee plain warning of it. O what
pity is it such a conviction as this should be held in
Unrighteousness! but so it is in very many souls,
and that on several accounts.</p>
                  <p>First, Because Hypocrisie is so odious and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
a sin that men are loath to own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
it how guilty so ever they be of it. What,
dissemble with God, and play the Hypocrite with
him; 'tis so black and foul a Crime that men cannot
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:109022:261"/>
easily be brought to charge themselves with it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
They may have the infirmities which are common
to the best of men, but yet they are no hypocrites,
thus Pride of Heart casts a chain upon this convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and binds it that it cannot do its work.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, 'Tis a cheap and easie way to give God
the external Service and Worship of the Body, but
Heart-work is hard work. To sit or kneel an
hour or two is no great matter, but to search, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and break the Heart for sin; to work up the
dead and earthly Affections into a spiritual heavenly
frame, this will cost many an hard tugg. 'Tis no
severe task to sit before God as his people, whilst
the fancy and thoughts are left at liberty to wander
which way they please, as the thoughts of formal
Hypocrites use to do, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 31. but to set a
watch upon the heart, to summon in the Thoughts
to God, to retract every wandering thought with a
sigh; this is difficult, and the difficulty overpowers
conviction of duty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Atheisme</hi> of the heart quenches
this conviction in mens Souls. Formality is a secret
invisible sin, not discernable by man; the outside of
Religion looks fair to mans eye, and so long its
well enough, as if there were not a God that trieth
the hearts and the reins. This when a beam of
light and conviction shines into the Soul, a cloud
of natural Atheism overshaddows and darkens it.</p>
                  <p>But poor self-couzening-hypocrite, these things
must not pass so; thy Conscience as well as the
Word tell thee that it is not the place of Worship,
but the spirituality of it that God regards, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.
23, 24. That they are Hypocrites in Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:109022:261"/>
who have God in their mouthes, but he is
far from their reins, <hi>Ier.</hi> 12. 2. and that hypocrites
will have the hottest place in Hell, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 51.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="instance">
                  <head>III. Instance.</head>
                  <p>A Third instance of Convictions of ungodliness
held in unrighteousness is in declining or denying to
consfess the known truths of God, which we our
selves have professed, when the confession of them
infers danger.</p>
                  <p>In times of danger conscience struggles hard with
men to appear for the Truths of God, and upon no
account whatsoever, to dissemble or deny them;
and enforceth its Counsels and VVarnings upon us
with such awful Scriptures as these, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. 62. No
<hi>man having put his hand to the plough, and looking
back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</hi> And <hi>Matth. 10.
33. But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will
I also deny before my father which is in heaven.</hi> In
this case Conscience useth to struggle hard with
men, yet is many times over-born, by the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Temptations of the Flesh, as</p>
                  <p>First, By Carnal Fears. The fear of Suffering
gets the ascendant of the fear of God. Men chuse
rather to adventure their Souls upon Wrath to come,
than the present VVrath of incensed Enemies. They
vainly hope to find mercy with God, but expect
none from men. Thus the fear of man brings a
snare, <hi>Prov.</hi> 29. 25. and so the voice of conscience
is drowned, by the louder clamours and threats of
Adversaries.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As the fear of mans Threatenings, so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:109022:262"/>
the distrust of Gods Promises defeats the design of
Conscience. If men believed the promises, they
would never be afraid of their duties. Faith in a
promise would make men as bold as Lions. If such
a word as that <hi>Isa. 57. 11. Of whom hast thou been
afraid or feared, that thou hast lyed, and hast not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
me?</hi> Men would say, as <hi>Zuinglius</hi> did in
the like case, what Death would I not rather chuse
to dye? what punishment would I not rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go?
yea, into what vault of Hell would I not rather
chuse to be cast, than to witness against my own
conscience?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The immoderate and inordinate Love
of the VVorld overpowers conscience, and drowns
its voice in such an hour of Temptation. <hi>So Demas</hi>
found it, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 10. O what a dangerous conflict
is there in an hour of Temptation betwixt an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
head, and a worldly heart?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The Examples of others who comply, and
embrace the sinful termes of Liberty to escape the
danger emboldens men to follow their Examples,
and Satan will not be wanting to improve their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.
Don't you see such and such men beating
the road before you? Learned Men, and prudent
men, who it may be have less heat, but more VVis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
than you. VVhy will you be singular? VVhy
will you hazzard all for that others will hazzard
nothing.</p>
                  <p>But certainly such sins as these will cost you dear,
'tis a dreadful thing to betray the Truths and Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
of God, for base secular ends; and you will
find it so, when you and your consciences shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate
it together in a calm hour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:109022:262"/>
Secondly, There are also sins of <hi>Vnrighteousness,</hi>
against the <hi>Second Table,</hi> in which many live against
the plain dictates and warnings of their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
though they know the wrath of God is
revealed from Heaven against all unrighteousness of
men, who hold the Truth in unrighteousness. To
give some Instances of this.</p>
                  <div n="1" type="instance">
                     <head>I. Instance.</head>
                     <p>And first let me Instance in that sin of <hi>Defrauding,</hi>
and going beyond others in our civil Commerce and
Dealings with them; over-reaching, cozening,
and cheating the ignorant or unwary, who it may
be would not be so unwary as they are, did they
not repose trust and confidence in your deceitful
words and promises. Conscience cannot but startle
at such sins, the very Light of Nature discovers the
evil of it, and the sober Heathen abhor it; but we
that live under the Gospel cannot but feel some
terror and trembling in our Consciences when we
read such a severe and awful prohibition back'd
with such a dreadful threatening as that is in 1 <hi>Thes.
4. 6. That no man defraud or go beyond his brother in
any matter, because that the Lord is the Avenger of
all such.</hi> The word is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that no
man overtop, <hi>viz.</hi> by power or by craft and policy.
To this sin a dreadful threatening is annexed, the
Lord is the <hi>Avenger</hi> of all such. The word is
<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, but once more that I remember used in the
New Testament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 4. and is there applied
to the Civil Magistrate, he must see Execution done
upon Malefactors, but here, the Lord himself will
do it, he will be this mans Avenger. This Rod, or
rather this Ax, Conscience shews men, and gives
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:109022:263"/>
warning of the danger, and yet its Convictions are
overpowered and bound as Prisoners, by</p>
                     <p>(1.) The Excessive Love of Gain; 1 <hi>Tim. 6. 9.
But they that will be rich, fall into Temptation, and
a snare; and into many foolish and hurtful Lusts,
which drown men in destruction and perdition.</hi> When
a resolution is made for the world, men will be
rich by right or wrong, this powerfully armes the
Temptation. Set Gain before such a man, and he
will break through the Law of God, and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Conscience but he will have it. This drowns
them in perdition and destruction, that is, it surely,
throughly, and fully ruins them; as he is a dead man
that is only drowned, but to be drowned in destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yea in destruction and perdition too; this must
needs make his ruin sure; as sure as words can
make it, and so all such persons shall surely find it,
who persist in such a Course.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Pinching Necessities and Straights overbear
Conscience in others. Necessity hath no Ears to
attend the voice of the Word and Conscience. Here
Conscience and Poverty struggle together, and if
the Fear of God be not exalted in the Soul, it now
falls a prey to Temptation. This danger wise
<hi>Agur</hi> foresaw, and earnestly intreated the Lord for
a competency, to avoid the snare of Poverty, <hi>Prov.</hi>
30. 8, 9. Poor Wretch! how much better were it
for thee to endure the pains of a griping stomach,
than those of a griping Conscience? such gains may
be sweet in thy mouth, but bitter in thy Bowels.</p>
                     <p>(3.) The Examples of others who daily venture
on such sins without scruple, and laugh at such
squeamish Consciences as cheque at such things:
this emboldens others to follow them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 18,
and thus the voice of Conscience is drowned, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:109022:263"/>
Convictions buried for a time, but it will Thunder
at last, and thy buried convictions wil have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,

                     <p>The truth of God is held in Unrighteousness,
when mens Lusts will not suffer them to restore,
what they have sinfully and unjustly gotten into their
hands. This Sin lies boking in the Consciences of
some men, makes them very uneasie, and yet they
make an hard shift to rub along under these regrets
of Conscience. Now those things which make a
forcible entry into the Conscience, take the truths
of God Prisoners, and bind them, that they cannot
break forth into the duty of Restitution are,</p>
                     <p>(1.) The shame which attends and follows the
duty to which God and Conscience calls the Soul.
O 'tis a shame and reproach they think, to get the
name of a <hi>cheat.</hi> Loath, loath they are, these works
of darkness should come into the open Light; men
will point, and hiss at them; and say, there goes a
Thief, a Cheat, an Oppressor; this keeps many
from Restitution.</p>
                     <p>But dost thou not here commit a greater Cheat
than the former? Which is the greater shame
thinkst thou? to commit sin, or to confess and reform
it? to tye the snare upon thy soul by Commission, or
loose it off from thy Conscience by Repentance and
Restitution? to be the derision of wicked men, (for
none else will deride thee for thy duty) or to be
the contempt and derision of God, Angels, and all
good Men for ever. To attain inward peace at this
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:109022:264"/>
hazzard, or to lie under the continual lashes and
wounds of thy own Conscience?</p>
                     <p>(2.) Poverty and inability is sometimes pleaded
to quiet the troubled Conscience; and indeed this is
a just and very frequent blast of God upon ill gotten
goods. The curse of God is upon them. They
melt away. O what a miserable snare have you
now intangled your souls in? once you could, but
would not restore, a Worldly heart would not part
with unjust gains; now you would, but cannot.
Thus a worldly heart, and an empty purse holds
you first and last under the guilt of a known sin. A
lamentable case!</p>
                     <p>(3.) Vain purposes do often suppress and silence
convictions, my condition may after, I may be in a
capacity hereafter when I can better spare it than at
present. Or I'le do it in my last Will when I dye,
and charge my Executors with it. Thus do men
bribe their Consciences, to get a little quiet whilst
they continue under known guilt, and cannot tell
how soon death shall summon them to the aweful
Bar of a just and terrible God.</p>
                     <p>Sirs, As you value your peace, and which is
more, your Souls; release the Lords <hi>Prisoner</hi> which

no Repentance: For how can you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
of a sin you still knowingly continue in? Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
is the Souls turning from sin, as well as its
sorrow for sin. You cannot therefore repent of sin,
and still continue in it; <hi>How shall we that are dead

A little that a Righteous man hath is better

                     <p>Truth is often held in unrighteousness by sinful
Silence, in not reproving other mens sins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
making them our own. We are sometimes cast
into the company of ungodly Men, where we hear
the name of our God blasphemed, the Truth, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
or Servants of God reproached; and have not so
much courage to appear for God, as others have to
appear against him. In such cases Conscience useth to
instigate men to their duty, and charge it home upon
them in the authority of such a Scripture, as that
<hi>Lev. 19. 17. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy
heart, thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and
not suffer sin upon him.</hi> O saith Conscience, thy si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
now will be thy sin. This poor wretch may
perish for want of a seasonable, plain, and faithful
rebuke. Thy silence will harden him in his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness.
No sooner doth such a conviction stir in
the Conscience, but many things are ready to lay
hold on it; as</p>
                     <p>(1.) A Spirit of Cowardice, which makes us
afraid to displease men; and chuses rather the wrath
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:109022:265"/>
of God should fall on them, than that their wrath
should fall on us. We dare not take as much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
to reprove sin, as others do to commit it.
They glory in their shame, and we are ashamed of
what is both our glory, and our duty.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Dependance on, or near relation to the
Person sinning. 'Tis a Father, an Husband, a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
on whose favour I depend; and should I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
him, I may ruine my self: this is the voice
of the Flesh. Hence duty is neglected, and the
Soul of a Friend basely betrayed. Our Interest
preferr'd to Gods, and thereby frequently lost: for
there is no way to secure our own interest in any
mans heart, as to settle it by our Faithfulness in his
Conscience, and by being willing to hazzard it for
Gods interest and glory. The Lord blesseth Mens
Faithfulness above all their sinful Carnal Policies,
<hi>Prov. 28. 23. He that rebuketh a man, afterwards
shall find more favour than he that flattereth with his
lips.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(3.) Mens own Guilt stops their Mouths, and
silences them. They are ashamed and afraid to
reprove other mens sins, left they should hear of
their own. Fear of Retortion keeps them from
the duty of Reprehension. Thus we fall into a
new sin for fear of reviving an old one. <hi>He that
reproveth a scorner, getteth to himself shame; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Prov. 9. 7.</p>
                     <p>But this is the fruit of our Pride and Ignorance,

                     <p>Another Instance of Convictions of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
imprisoned in mens Souls, is in not distributing
to the necessities of others, especially such as fear
God, when it is in the power of our hands to do it,
and Conscience as well as Scripture calls us to our
Duty.</p>
                     <p>Men cannot be ignorant of that Text, <hi>Math. 25.
40,</hi> 41. where by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> Charity to the
Saints is by Christ put for the whole of Obedience;
and mens Eternal States are cast according to their
observance of this command; though I fear few,
very few study and believe it as they ought. Thou
canst, saith Conscience if thou wilt relieve such or
such a poor Christian, and therein express thy love
to Christ; yea refresh the bowels of Christ, do it,
God will repay it; if thou refusest, <hi>how dwelleth the
love of God in thee? 1 Ioh.</hi> 3. 17. This is the
Voice of God and Conscience, but divers Lusts are
ready to lay hold on and bind this Conviction also,
assoon as it stirs, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(1) The excessive love of Earthly things. The
World is got so deep in mens Hearts, that they
will rather part with their peace, yea and with
their Souls too, than to part with it. Hence
come those Churlish answers like that of <hi>Nabal,
1 Sam. 25. 11. Shall I take my bread, and my water,
and my flesh; and give it to men, whom I know not
whence they be?</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="35" facs="tcp:109022:266"/>
(2.) Unbelief, which denies to give Honour
and due Credit to Christs Bills of Exchange drawn
upon them in Scripture and presented to them by
the hands of his poor Saints. They refuse I say to
credit them, though Conscience protest against
them, for their Non-compliance. Christ saith,
<hi>Mark 9. 41. Whosoever shall give you a cup of cold
water to drink in my name, because ye belong to Christ,
verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.</hi> He
shall gain that which he cannot lose, by parting with
that which he cannot keep.</p>
                     <p>(3.) The want of love to Jesus Christ. Did
we love Christ in sincerity, and were that love so
fervent as it ought to be; it would make thee more
ready to lay down thy neck for Christ, than thou
now art to lay out a shilling for him. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 16.
'Tis our Duty in some cases to spend our blood for
the Saints. So it was in the primitive times, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold

                     <p>How many stand convinced by their own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
what a sin it is to spend their precious time
so idly and vainly as they do? When a day is lost

at night Conscience reckons with them for

are</p>
                     <p>(1.) In some men, their Ignorance and Insensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the Preciousness of time. They know 'tis
their sin, to spend their time so vainly, but little
consider that Eternity it self hangs upon this little
Moment of Time; and that the great work of their

if it be not finished in this small allottment of time,
it can never be finished, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 9. 4.</p>
                     <p>(2.) The Examples of other vain persons, that

dreadful evil of holding the truth in unrighteousness
is; yet these are but a few selected from among
many.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:109022:267"/>
(5.) In the next place I am obliged to shew, how
and why the imprisoning of Convictions, or holding
the Truths of God in Unrighteousness, so dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incenseth his Wrath. And this it doth upon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
accounts:</p>
                     <p>(1.) Knowledge and Conviction of sin is an
excellent means, or choice help to preserve Men
from falling into sin: There be Thousands of sins
committed in the World, which had never been
committed, if Men had known them to be sins, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they committed them. Every Sinner durst not
make so bold with his Conscience as you have done.
The <hi>Apostle</hi> tells us the reason why the Princes of
this World crucified the Lord of Glory, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they knew him not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. Had they
known him, they would not have dared to do as
they did. And so it is in multitudes of lower and
lesser sins than that, Satan mops their Eyes with
Ignorance, then uses their Hands and Tongues in
Wickedness; he is the Ruler of the darkness of the
World: <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12. But when Men do know this
or that to be sin, and yet venture on it, here an
excellent Antidote against sin is turned into a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
aggravation of sin, which highly incenses the
Wrath of God.</p>
                     <p>(2.) Knowledge and Conviction going before,
adds presumption to the Sin that follows after it;
and presumptuous Sin is the most provoking and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
Sin; from this way of sinning <hi>David</hi> earnestly
beseeches God to keep him, <hi>Keep back thy servant</hi>
(saith he) <hi>from presumptuous sins:</hi> When a man sees
sin, and yet adventures on it, in such sinning there
is a despising of the Law of God: A Man may
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:109022:268"/>
break the Law, whilst he approves, reverences,
and honours it in his heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12, 13. but
here the Commandment is despised, as God told
<hi>David, 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 9. 'Tis as if a Man should say,
I see the Command of God armed with threatnings
in my way, but yet I will go on for all that.</p>
                     <p>(3.) Knowledge and Conviction leave the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a Sinner naked, and wholly without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
or apologie for his sin: In this case there is no
plea left to extenuate the offence: <hi>Iohn 15. 22.
Now they have no cloak for their sin;</hi> if a man sins
ignorantly, his ignorance is some excuse for his sin,
it excuses it at least <hi>a tanto,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, thus
and thus I did, <hi>but I did it ignorantly:</hi> Here is cloak
or covering, an excuse or extenuation of the sin, but
knowledge takes away this cloak, and makes the
sin appear naked in all the odious deformity of it;
nothing left to hide it.</p>
                     <p>(4.) Light or Knowledge of the Law and Will
of God, is a very choice and excellent Mercy; 'tis
a choice and singular favour, for God to make the
light of Knowledge to shine into a Mans mind or
understanding: 'Tis a Mercy withheld from multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19. and those that injoy it, are
under special engagements to bless God for it, and
to improve it diligently and thankfully to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and Glory; but for a Man to arm such a Mercy
as this against God, to fight against him with one of
his choicest Mercies, this must be highly provoking
to the Lord: 'Tis therefore mention'd as an high
aggravation of <hi>Solomons</hi> sin in the 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 11. 9.
that he sinned against the Lord, <hi>after the Lord had
appeared unto him twice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="39" facs="tcp:109022:268"/>
(5.) This way of sinning argues an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
degree of hardness of heart; 'Tis a sign of little
tenderness, or sense of the evil of sin: Some Men,
when God shews them the evil of sin in the glass of
the Law, they tremble at the sight of it: So did <hi>Paul,
Rom. 7. 13. When the Commandment came, sin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,
and he died;</hi> he sunk down at the sight of it:
But God shews thee the evil of sin in the glass of
his Law, and thou makest nothing of it: O obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
heart! When the Rod was turned into a
Serpent, <hi>Moses</hi> fled from it, was afraid to touch it,
but though God turns the Rod into a Serpent, and
discovers the venomous Nature of Sin in his Word,
thou canst handle and play with that Serpent, and
put it into thy bosome, this shews thy heart to be
of a strange complexion.</p>
                     <p>(6.) To go against the convincing warning voice
of Conscience, violates and wounds a Mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
more, than any other way of sinning doth;
and when Conscience is so wounded, who, or what
shall then comfort thee? 'Tis a true Rule, <hi>Maxima
violatio Conscientiae, est maximum peccatum:</hi> The

were <hi>Romans,</hi> they <hi>feared,</hi> and well they
might, for the punishment was great for any Man

every Conviction you imprison is a Messenger of
Heaven, a Commission Officer of God, and woe to
him that binds or abuseth it. Do you know what
you do? Are you aware of the danger? Wast thou
not afraid (said <hi>David</hi> to the <hi>Amalakite</hi>) to stretch
forth thine hand to destroy the Lords Anointed? So
say I, Art thou not afraid to destroy the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate

Conviction is a kind of Embrio of Conversion; the
Conversion and Salvation of thy Soul would be the
Fruit of it, were it obeyed: Thy strivings with it
causes it to miscarry, renders it Abortive, and thy
Life must go for it, except God revive and recover
it again: As you know the Law is for striking a
pregnant Woman, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21, 22, 23. Loose then
every Man the Lords Prisoners, I mean your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained

you see what a dreadful aggravation of sin it is, and
that the Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven
against all Ungodliness and Unrighteousness of Men

                  <p>You can never have peace with your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
whilst you keep Convictions Prisoners.
Now a mans Conscience is his best Friend, or his
worst Enemy. Thence are the sweetest Comforts,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:109022:275"/>
and thence are the bitterest Sorrows. 'Tis a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
thing for a man to lie with a cold sweating Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
upon his panting Bosom. <hi>Tum pallida mens est
Criminibus, tacit a sudant praecordia culpâ.</hi> And this
(or which is worse) Obduration and Stupidity must
be the case of them that hold the Truth in Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.
There can be no sounding a retreat to
these terrors, till <hi>Sheba</hi>'s Head be thrown over
the Walls; I mean, till that Sin your Conscience
convinceth you of, be delivered up. As <hi>Israel</hi> could
have no peace, till <hi>Achan</hi> was destroy'd, so thou
shalt have no peace, whilst thy sin is covered, and
hid. Men may cry peace, peace, to themselves,
whilst they continue in sin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 18, 19. but
the sharpest troubles of Conscience, are better than
such peace. Deliver up thy self Man, if thou love
peace, into the hands of thy own Convictions, and
thou art in the true way to peace. Thy rejoycing
must be in the Testimony of thine own Conscience, as
the <hi>Apostle</hi> speakes, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. or thou rejoycest
in a dream, in a delusion, in a thing of nought.</p>

Conscience is never more active and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
than in the last hours and moments of Life.
Now, it will be stifled, and over-ruled no longer.
It whispered before, but now it thunders. If a
Man have a clear and quiet Conscience, his Evening
is clear, and his Sun sets without Clouds, See <hi>Psal.</hi>

the result of a Mans integrity, and Obedience to
the voice of Conscience, this being the Evidence, we
can most safely rely upon, of our Uprightness, and
Interest in Christ, but the result of such violences
and abuses to thy Conscience, cannot be peace to
thy Soul: 'Tis true, some wicked Men dye in seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the one and other are mistaken; the first, as to the
good Estate he fancies himself in, and the other
as to his bad Estate; and a few Moments will

                  <p>Obedience to Convictions will not only produce

the fruit of Righteousness is peace, quietness, and
assurance for ever: On the contrary, you find in
<hi>Iob</hi> 20. 20. Wicked Men have no quietness in their
Bellies, that is, in their Consciences: For Guilt
lies boking there as a Thorn doth in the Flesh: And
what is Life worth without ease? To live ever in
pain, to live upon the Rack, is not worth while to
live: If then you love ease and quietness, obey
your Consciences: Pull out that Thorn, I mean
that Sin that sticks fast in thy Soul, and akes in thy

Do not your own Consciences tell you, that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Conscience sometimes whisper thus into thine Ear,
Soul thou art not right; something is wanting to
make thee a Christian: Thou wantest that which
others have; and except something further be done
upon thee, thou wilt be undone for ever: If it be
so, let me advise thee to hearken diligently to this
voice of Conscience: Don't dare to adventure to
the Judgment-seat of God in such a case: Ponder

                  <p>And to this end, my first Counsel and Direction
is, that you fail not to put every Conviction in
speedy Execution. Don't delay, 'tis a very criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
hour, and delayes are exceeding hazardous:
Convictions are fixed and secured in Mens Souls four
wayes.</p>
                  <p>(1.)<hi>By deep and serious consideration,</hi> Psal.
119. 59. I thought upon my wayes, and turned my
feet unto thy testimonies.</p>
                  <p>(2.) By earnest Prayer, thus <hi>Saul</hi> under his first
Convictions fell presently on his knees, <hi>Acts 9. 11.
Behold be prayeth:</hi> The warm breath of Prayer fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and nourishes the sparks of Conviction, that
it be not extinct.</p>
                  <p>(3.) By diligent attendance upon the Word, the
Word begets it, and the Word can through God's
blessing preserve it, 1 <hi>Iam.</hi> 23. 24.</p>
                  <p>(4.) Present Execution, falling without delay on
the Duty thou art convinced of, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 24. Be not
forgetful hearers, but doers of the work; otherwise
a Man is as one that looks into a glass, and straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:109022:279"/>
forgets what manner of man he was. Take
the sense thus, a man looks into the Glass in the
Morning, and there perhaps he sees a spot on his
Face, a disorder in his Hair, or Cloaths; and thinks
with himself, well I will rectifie it anon; but being
gone from the place, one thing or other diverts
his mind, he forgets what he saw, and goes all the
day with the spot on his Face, never minding it any
more. O brethren, delayes are dangerous, sin is
deceitful, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 13. Satan is subtil, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3.
and this way gains his Point. This <hi>Motto</hi> may be
written on the Tomb-stones of most that perish,
<hi>Here lies one that was destroyed by delayes.</hi> Your
Life is immediately uncertain, so are the strivings
of the Spirit also. Besides, there is a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
in the <hi>primus impetus,</hi> the first heat of the
Soul, when thy heart is once up in warm Affections
and Resolutions, the work may be easily done, as a <hi>Bell</hi>
if once up goes easily, but hard to raise when down.
See 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 36. What advantage there is in a
present warm frame! Beside, the nature of these
things is too serious and weighty to be post-pon'd
and delay'd. You cannot get out of the danger of
Hell, or into Christ too soon Moreover, every
repetition of sin, after Conviction greatly aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates
it. For it is in sinning, as it is in numbering;
if the first be one, the second is ten, the third an
hundred, the fourth a thousand. And to conclude,
think what you will, you can never have a fitter
season than the present, the same difficulties you
have to day you will have to morrow, and it may
be greater. Fall presently therefore to execute your
Convictions.</p>

is our rejoycing, the testimony of our Consciences.</hi>

the opposition, Conscience gives the Backslider his

that is from his own Conscience, which though it
be not the Original Spring, yet it is the Conduit at

and not to lye stupid and senseless under guilt,
<hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30, 31.</p>
                  <p>(5.) 'Tis a powerful Antidote against formality

                  <p>And he that feels such effects as these from the
consideration of that Day, is fortified against that
sin my Text warns of; and dares never hold the
Truth of God in Unrighteousness. 'Tis our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardlessness

of the Nature of it, which so emboldens us to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect

that so often overbears Conscience, but if men
were once made throughly sensible, that the least
sin is worse for them than the greatest affliction or
suffering; the peace of Conscience would be well
secured. And that this is really so, appears thus;</p>
                  <p>(1.) Afflictions do not make a man vile in the
Eyes of God. A Man may be under manifold Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,
and yet very dear and precious in Gods
Account; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 36, 37, 38. but S in makes a man
vile in the Eyes of God, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
                  <p>(2.) Afflictions do not put men under the Curse
of God, Blessings and Afflictions may go together;
<hi>Psal.</hi> 94. 12. but Sin brings the Soul under the
Curse, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10.</p>
                  <p>(3.) Afflictions make men more like unto God,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. but Sin make us more like the Devil,

(4.) Afflictions for Conscience sake are but the
Creatures wrath inflam'd against us, but Sin is the
inflamer of Gods Wrath against us, as in the
<hi>Text.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(5.) Afflictions are but outward Evils upon the
Body, but Sin is an internal Evil upon the Soul.
<hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36.</p>
                  <p>(6.) Afflictions for Duties sake have many sweet
Promises annexed to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 10. but Sin
hath none.</p>
                  <p>(7.) The effects of Sufferings for Christ are
sweet to the Soul, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 4. but the fruits of Sin
are bitter; it yields nothing but shame and fear.</p>
                  <p>(8.) Afflictions for Christ are the way to Heaven,
but Sin is the <hi>Road-way</hi> to Hell, <hi>Rom. 6. ult.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>(9.) Sufferings for Duty are but for a Moment,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. but Sufferings for sin, will be Eternal,
<hi>Mark</hi> 9. 44.</p>
                  <p>If such thoughts might be suffered to dwell with
us, how would they guard the Conscience against

Christian Courage and Magnanimity, for want of
this Conscience, is often overborn against its own
Light and Conviction. Christian magnanimity, is
Consciences security. 'Tis excellent and becoming
a Christian, to be able to face any thing but the
frowns of God and his own Conscience. All the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:109022:284"/>
famous Champions of Truth, and VVitnesses for
God that came victorious out of the Field of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
with safe and unwounded Consciences, were
men of Courage and Resolution; see <hi>Dan. 3. 16.
Heb. 11. 27. Acts</hi> 21. 13. and what is this Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Courage, but the fixed resolution of the Soul to
Encounter all dangers, all sufferings, all reproaches,
pains and losses in the strength of assisting Grace,
that shall assault us in the ways of our duty, and so
it stands opposed in Scripture to <hi>the Spirit of Fear,
Heb.</hi> 11. 27. to <hi>Shame, Mark</hi> 8. 38. to <hi>Apostacy,
Heb.</hi> 10. 39. He must neither be afraid, nor asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
nor lose one inch of ground for the sake of what
dangers he meets with, and that because he hath
embraced Christianity upon those terms, and was
told of all this before, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16. 1. because there's
no retreating but to our own ruin, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 38. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

our Faith thus exalted, how free and safe would
Truth be in our Consciences. He that owns any
Truth to live upon it, or accommodate a carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
by it, will disown that Truth, when it comes
to live upon him, let Conscience plead and say what
it will; but he that hath agreed with Christ upon
these Terms, to be content to be miserable for ever,
if there be not enough in Christ to make him happy;
this man will be a steddy Christian, and will rather
lie in the worst of the Prisons, than to imprison
Gods known Truths in Unrighteousness.</p>

you the Lord Jesus in the glory of his Free Grace,
and condescending Love to Sinners; Oh that I had
skill and ability to have done it better; I have wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and expostulated with you on Christs behalf. I
have laboured according to my little measure of
strength, to cast up and prepare the way by remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the stumbling Blocks and Discouragements out
of it. This hath been a time of Conviction to many of
you, some have not been able to hold their Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
any longer under restraints, but many I fear do
so, and therefore I have in the close of all, handled
this startling and awakening Scripture among you, to
shew you what an horrid evil it is to detain Gods
Truths in Unrighteousness. I have also in the Name
and Authority of God demanded all the Lords Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
his suppressed and restrained Truths at your
hands: If you will unbind your Convictions this
day, cut as under the bonds of carnal fear, shame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
with which you restrain them; those Truths you
shall so make free, will make you free: If not, but
you will still go on stifling and suppressing them in
your own Bosomes; remember that there are so
many VVitnesses prepared to give evidence against
you in the Great Day. And Oh that whilst you
delay this Duty, the sound of this <hi>Text</hi> may never
out of your ears, nor suffer you to rest. <hi>For the
