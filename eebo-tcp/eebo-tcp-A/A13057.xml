            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He must be carefull to serue God priuately and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely; for all professions are therevnto tied, that carry hope with them to prosper, and none more highly then the souldier, for hee is euer in the mouth of death, and certainly hee that is thus religiously armed, fighteth more confidently and with greater courage, and is thereby protected through manifold dangers, and otherwise vnpreuentable euents.</p>
               <p>He must bee no blasphemer nor swearer, for such an one is contemptible to God and the world, and shall be assured to be found out and punished by the diuine Iustice: whereof we haue instant examples.</p>
               <p>He must refraine from dicing, carding, and Idle ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: for common gamsters, although they may haue many good parts in them, yet commonly they are not esteemed according to their better qualities, but cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured according to their worst, procuring enemies, questions, brawles, and a thousand following incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences.</p>
               <p>He must not set his minde ouer-greedily vpon his belly, and continuall feeding, but rest himselfe conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with such prouisions as may bee conueniently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, his owne labour purchase, or his meanes reach vnto: aboue all things he must eschew that detestable vice of drunkennesse; for then a man is not apt nor good for any thing, and by that beastly disorder, many great armies haue miscarried, and much disquiet and tumults raised in campe, and ciuill townes, wherevpon doth fail the sword of Iustice vpon their necks, which in that case they haue compelled to be drawne.</p>
               <p>Chastitie is a vertue much commended in a souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when vncleanesse doth defile both body and soule,

and makes a man stinke in the nostrils of God &amp; man, and laieth him open to the malice &amp; sword of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for commonly it makes a man effeminate, coward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, lasie, and full of diseases, &amp; surely such who haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful women stil trudging about with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or in whom custome hath taken away the sence of offending in that kind, commonly come to dishonorable ends.</p>

               <p>He must be true-hearted to his Capt. and obey him and the rest of the officers of the Campe, Towne, or Fort, with great respect, for by the very oath which he taketh hee doth binde himselfe and promise to serue his Prince, and obey his officers: for the true order of warre is fitly resembled to true religion ordeined of God, which bindeth the souldier to obserue iustice, loyaltie, faith, constancie, patience, silence, and aboue all, obedience, through the which is easily obteined the perfection in armes, and is as a meanes to atchieue great enterprises, though neuer so difficult: certainly, who wanteth the vertue of obedience and patience, though neuer so valiant otherwise, yet is he vnworthy of the same name.</p>
               <p>A souldier must patiently suffer the aduersities and trauailes which do fall out in the courses and chances of warre: he must not be ouer-greedy, nor hasty of his pay, albeit he may stand in some want thereof, but must with a chearfull alacrity shew his constancy, auoyding

by al possible meanes, rebellions and mutenies, which most vpon such pettish occasiones are runne into: by no meanes must hee bee a pertaker with such mutiners, for the end of such is sharpe and shamefull death.</p>

whereby hee may obey that which he is commanded; for the Drum often-times is the voice of the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, hee shall carefully note and marke the signes made by the Captaine and officers, without talking or prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto his next companions: for that is vnbesitting a Souldier, and makes him vncapable to heare what is giuen in command.</p>
               <p>In skirmishes and incounters he shal be resolute and valiant, for that souldier which is timorous and fearfull can neuer bring his heart to any hearty enterprise, nor dareth to attempt any hotte, bold, or audacious charge or seruice, by reason of his cowardly spirit and feare.</p>

And call in the Iewes together with the fulnesse of the gentiles, that thy name may be glorious in al the world, the daies of iniquity may come to an end, and we with all thine elect people may come to sée thy face in glorie, and be filled with the light thereof for euermore.</p>
            <p>And now O Lord of mercie, O Father of the spirits of all flesh, looke in mercie vpon the Gentiles, who yet know thée not, O gracious God be mercifull to vs, and blesse vs, and not vs alone, but let thy waies be knowne vpon earth, &amp; thy sauing health amongst all nations: we praise thée, and we blesse thée: But let the people praiss thée O God, yea let all the people praise thée, and let these ends of the world remember themselues and turne to thée the God of their saluation.
