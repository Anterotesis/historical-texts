            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A
CAUTION
TO
Constables, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAving observed of late, that divers Constables and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferiour Officers, have either run themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the danger of the Law, or brought upon themselves
trouble of mind, by acting too officiously against their
honest Neighbours, upon the <hi>Conventicle-Act,</hi> at the
Instigation of (that shame of Christianity, and Pest of Mankind) In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers;
and considering with my self, that this Mischief for the most
part happens through fear, occasioned by want of a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
what is positively required of them by that Act, what not:
I thought I should do no unacceptable Work, in presenting the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Observations upon that Act, by way of Cautionary Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the view and consideration of such of those Officers, as are
<hi>willing</hi> to act <hi>warily</hi> with respect to themselves, and yet <hi>favourably</hi>
with respect to their peaceable Neighbours.</p>
            <p>First then, be pleas'd to observe, That no Constable, or other
Officer, is bound to be an Attendant upon an Informer, to be at
his <hi>Reck,</hi> and run like a Lacquey after him whensoever, or whether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
he shall think fit to call him. The Officer is not obliged to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65536:3"/>
stay at home, to wait the Informer's coming: but is at liberty to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
his own Affairs, and to go whithersoever his own Occasions
draw, or his Inclinations lead him. And if casually the Informer
light upon him, either at home or abroad, and inform him of a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Conventicle within his Parish or Precinct, he is not bound to
take notice of it, unless he take the Information to be credible. For
that is the Word used in the Act in this very Case, <hi>viz. <hi>Be it further
Enacted,</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c. <hi>That is any Constable,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who shall know or be
credibly informed of any such Meetings,</hi> &amp;c. So that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
idle and groundless Information from <hi>sorry Fellows of no repute
nor credit,</hi> the Officer is obliged to take notice of; but such Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
only as are <hi>credible,</hi> (or his own knowledg) upon which he is
required to act. And by his own knowledg here, is to be understood
a <hi>certain knowledg, a personal</hi> knowledg, not a knowledg by Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
Report, or common Fame only; for that may be as little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
as the least credible Information. The Officer then it seems,
must have either a personal and certain knowledg, or such an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as he shall judg credible, that there is an unlawful Assembly or
Meeting in his Parish, before he is obliged to stir.</p>
            <p>2. And if the Officer should receive a credible Information of such
a Meeting; yet he is not bound to wait upon the Informer to the
place where he informs the Meeting is: But the first thing that is
required of the Officer by this Act is, to give in Information thereof
some Justice of the Peace. And having done that, then in the next
place to endeavour the Conviction of the Parties according to his
Duty. For so are the Words of the Act, <hi>viz. [<hi>Be it Enacted</hi>
               </hi> &amp;c.
<hi>That if any Constable</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who shall know, or be credible infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of any such Meetings, or Conventicles held within his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts,
Parish or Limits, and shall not give Information thereof
to some Iustice of the Peace, or the chief Magistrate and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the Conviction of the Parties according to his Duty; But,</hi>
&amp;c.] Instead of which, many Constables, and other Officers, are
trickt in by cunning and swaggering Informers, to go along with
them to Meetings, and there take Observations of the persons pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
(yea, and sometimes also to inform the Informer who the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are, and where they live) and from thence wait on the Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to the Justice, and so are unawares drawn in by the Informer, to
joyn with him in swearing against their Neighbours; thereby unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly
bringing their <hi>quiet</hi> Neighbours into <hi>needless</hi> trouble, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65536:3"/>
themselves under the <hi>foul</hi> Brand, and <hi>hated</hi> Name of being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Informers also. Now all this is more than the Officers are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to do. 1. They are not bound to go with the Informer, to
the place where he shall tell them there is a Meeting. 2. Neither
if they do go with him, are they bound to tell him the Names, or
places of abode, of any persons that they shall see there. 3. Neither are
they bound to go <hi>with him</hi> to a Justice, nor yet, without him, to
the <hi>same</hi> Justice that he goes to. But when they have received the
Informer's information, leaving him to pursue his own projects,
they are to repair to some Justice, or chief Magistrate (and it is in
their own choice to what Justice they will go) and give him Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
thereof, if they think it Credible. And although they are
further required, after such Information given to the Justice, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
the Conviction of the Parties: yet that is to be done but
<hi>according to their duty.</hi> And sure it is not the duty of Officers to turn
Informers. They would be very troublesome and thankless Officers
indeed, if all Constables, Headboroughs, Tithingmen, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens
and Overseers of the Poor, should be bound by the duty of
their Offices to turn Informers.</p>
            <p>3. These Officers would not be so scared by Informers, nor terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the talk of forfeiting 51. if they did rightly understand and
well consider how hard a thing it is, for them to be Convicted by
this Act. The words of the Act are these, <hi>viz. [<hi>But such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stables,</hi>
               </hi>
&amp;c. <hi>shall</hi> wilfully <hi>and</hi> wittingly <hi>omit the performance of
his Duty in the execution of this Act, and be thereof convicted
in manner aforesaid, he shall forfeit for every such offence the sum
of</hi> 5 l.] Observe here, the Officer doth not forfeit 5 l. unless he be
convicted of omitting the performance of his duty <hi>wilfully and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly.</hi>
And this Conviction must be made either by the <hi>Confession</hi>
of the Party, or <hi>Oath</hi> of two Witnesses, or by notorious Evidence
and Circumstance of the Fact. As to the Confession of the Party,
that need not be: for <hi>no man is bound to accuse himself;</hi> and he has
not much Wit, sure, that will, especially in such a case as this. The
second way of Conviction is by the Oath of two Witnesses. But
how is it possible for two Witnesses to swear (unless they be such as
regard not what they swear) that the Officer did <hi>wilfully and witting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
omit the performance of his duty? Such Witnesses put their Ears
in the Officers hands, as having a mind (one would think) to look
through the Pillory. And indeed, scarce any would dare to swear
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65536:4"/>
so desperately, that had not deserved the Pillory before. Then for
the notorious Evidence and Circumstance of the Fact (the onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
way of proof) how can it be thereby proved that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
did <hi>willfully and wittingly,</hi> omit the performance of his duty,
when so many <hi>just excuses</hi> may be alleadged, as of Absence, Illness,
Urgency of Business, Ignorance, Misunderstanding, and the like;
all which, if the Officer fined, do appeal, a Jury of his Neighbours
is to try. And besides, it is a Question among the Lawyers, how
this sine or forfeiture of 5 l. can be levied upon the Officers, there
not being in the Act, any particular and express direction for the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying
of it; as there is in the other Cases, both of the Meeters and
of the Justice: for it is not to be supposed, that the Officers of a Town
or Parish, should levy the fine upon themselves; and it they do
not, none else is required or impowered by the Act to do it.</p>
            <p>4. If a Warrant under the hand and Seal of a Justice of the Peace,
be delivered to any Constable, or other inferiour Officer, to levy
any fines upon the Goods and Chattels of any person within his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
such Warrant ought to express for what Offence the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was made, and at what time the Offence was committed; which
if it do not, the Warrant is not <hi>formal,</hi> nor good in Law, to make
a distress by.</p>
            <p>5. But if the Warrant be <hi>formal</hi> and sufficient, yet the Officer
cannot thereby justifie the breaking open any dwelling House, or
Out-house belonging thereunto, to take distress (no, not although
the Warrant should expressly require it) as <hi>the Opinion of able Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
is:</hi> For a man's House is to him as a Castle of Defence, and so
is every part or room therein. And therefore, as the Officer may
not break or force open any Door or Lock to get into a man's House:
so if, finding the outward Door open, he be got in, he may not break
or force open any Doors or Locks, to get into any other parts or
Rooms in the House, that are lock't; but must content himself with
what he finds there. Neither may he climb over any Hatch, or in
at any Window, whether it be the Shop-window or other: for the
entring through or in at any Window, though open, is held by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
to be <hi>a breach of the House:</hi> Nor is he bound to lie perdue, and
wait continually at the Door to get an entrance; but may take such
times and seasons for it as he shall judg most fit and proper: for
he is not wholly to neglect his own Occasions to attend upon
this. That were a way to <hi>ruine the Officers,</hi> as well as their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65536:4"/>
onely to enrich the Informers. But if, as often as the Officer
comes, he shall find the Doors shut, and entrance upon demand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
him, and no Distress to be taken without Doors; he need not
fear the penalty of forfeiting 5 l. or that he can possibly be convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of <hi>wilfully and wittingly</hi> omitting the performance of his Duty in
that respect. And besides, it is the Opinion of some Lawyers, that
the penalty of 5 l. is not imposeable upon the Officers for not levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fines imposed upon others; but only for not Informing the
Justices, and endeavouring the Conviction of the Parties according
to their duty. And the Reason of such their Opinion is this, that
in that part of the Act where the said Officers are authorized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to levy the said fines, there is no mention of any forfeiture
on their part, for not doing it. And in this part of the Act, where
the 5 l. forfeiture is imposed, there is no express mention of levying
the Fine upon others. It is said here indeed [<hi>If he</hi> shall <hi>wilfully
and wittingly omit the performance of his Duty</hi>] but the word <hi>[Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty]</hi>
being mentioned just before, with particular relation to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the Justice, and endeavouring the conviction of the Parties,
that wilful and witting omission of Duty, to which the forfeiture of
5 l. is annexed, must (say they) by intendment be restrained or
applied only to the subject matter of that branch of the Act, and
be extended no further than to the neglect of that Duty, therein
particularly enjoyned. But of this let Lawyers judg.</p>
            <p>6. If the Constable, or other Officer, hath opportunity and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
way to make Distress, yet he is not bound to take more than
the Fine comes to; but he may (and indeed in Justice ought)
proportion the Distress in its real value, <hi>as near to the Fine as he can.</hi>
And when he hath so done, and taken such Distress into his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stody,
<hi>he is not bound</hi> to drive or carry, the Goods so distrained, to
any Fair or Market, out of the Limits of his Constableship, to
fell; for he is not to act any thing in relation to his Office, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than those limits extend (save only in some especial cases, where
he is particularly necessitated, or impowered by Act of Parliament
to go further, which in this Case he is not.) Nor may he <hi>imbezil</hi>
any of the Goods, for he is accomptable for every particular of
what he hath so distrained. <hi>Nor is he bound</hi> to sell such Goods
at under rates, and below the real worth or Market-price of such
Commodities; but having offered them to publick Sale, and tried
the Markets, Fairs and Chapmen, within his Liberty, if none
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65536:5"/>
will give a reasonable price for them, <hi>he is not bound</hi> forth with
to sell them, but may keep them in hopes of a better Market.
And if they remain unsold till he is out of his Office, if he then
return them again to him from whom he took them, I know
no danger he can incur thereby; I am sure I have known it done
without any detriment to him that did it. But if he be not willing

            <head>Some Observations upon the Conventicle-Act,
humbly offered, by way of Advice, to
such well-meaning and moderate Justices
of the Peace, as would not willingly
ruin their Peaceable Neighbours, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHen I consider the quality and qualifications of <hi>Iustices</hi> of the
<hi>Peace,</hi> how many of them are profest Lawyers, and how
generally they are (or at least should be) Men of Learning and
Knowledg, in those Laws especially by which they are to act; I
am ready to with-draw my Pen and desist, out of a modest fear,
least it should be thought presumption in me, to offer Advice to
them, who are so much better able to give it. But when, on the
other hand, I call to mind, that many great and very wise men,
have not disdained to hear, what some, as mean, it may be, as my
self, have had to say, I am thence again emboldned to go on, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
that what is so well intended, will not be ill taken. They
that have suffered by this Act, and are still liable to suffer more,
may be allowed to have looked <hi>more narrowly</hi> into it, than others,
who are not under its lash. And if upon a thorow search, any thing
can be found in the Act it self, which may fairly be made use of to
abate, in any measure, the force of the blow which we lie under,
I hope none will blame us, for modestly representing it to those, by
whose hands the stroke is appointed to be given. And in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
I proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Observ.</hi> 1. Since the Title of the Act; (which is not unaptly called
the <hi>Key,</hi> because it opens the Intention and purpose of the Law-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
therein) and the Preamble of the Act also, describes the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
and Meetings designed by this Act to be suppressed, to be <hi>Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
Conventicles,</hi> and the persons against whom this Act was made,
to be <hi>Seditious and disloyal Persons, who under pretence of tender Cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nces,
have or may at their Meetings contrive Insurrections;</hi> it seems
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65536:6"/>
but reasonable that a Justice of the Peace, when Informers come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, to inform against any person for being at a Conventicle or
Meeting, may examine them, severally and apart, <hi>what Token of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they saw or heard in that Assembly,</hi> which they inform against? If
there were any Sedition there, it must appear in word of Action :
and of that it may be expected the Informers should give Account.
If there were <hi>no Seditious words spoken, no Seditious Cestures</hi> used, why
should it be taken for a <hi>Seditious</hi> Meeting, and the persons punisht for
what they are not, nay, for what they most abhor to be? Besides it
rarely happens but the Justice him self both knows, what sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
they are that are informed against, and is more or less acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with some of them. Now if he be so, and upon his own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Persons or their Principles, be perswaded and satisfied
in his own Conscience, that <hi>they are not Seditious or disloyal Persons,</hi>
that <hi>they never have contrived Insurrections at their Meetings; nor is it
consistent with their Principle so to do;</hi> hath he not good cause then to
<hi>reject such Information,</hi> and <hi>let such peaceable Meetings and Meeters
alone,</hi> as not coming within the Intention of the Act?</p>
            <p>2. Since that which the Act calls an Offence, is by the express
words of the Act declared to be, <hi>Any persons, of the Age of 16 years,
and more in number than four besides the Family, being present at any
Assembly, &amp;c. under Colour or Pretence of any Exercise of Religion,
in other manner than according to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church
of England;</hi> and directs that this Offence must be proved to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
either <hi>by Confession of the Party, or Oath of two Witnesses, or by
notorious Evidence and Circumstance of the Fact:</hi> It seems reasonable
that the Justice may put the Informers to prove <hi>every part</hi> of this Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
For the Offence consists of <hi>many Particulars.</hi> The Offender
must be 16 <hi>years old;</hi> He must be a <hi>Subject of this Realm;</hi> (whence
<hi>quere</hi> whether Scottish and Irishmen, though living in England, are
not exempt) He must be one <hi>above four</hi> besides the Family; He must
be met <hi>under Colour or Pretence of some Exercise of Religion,</hi> and that
Exercise of Religion must be <hi>in other manner than according to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy
and Practice of the Church of England.</hi> All these must go to the
making up of the Offence, and the Offence so made up must be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
and if <hi>any of these</hi> be wanting, or the Proof fail <hi>in any of these,</hi>
it is then no Offence within this Statute. Now the <hi>Onus Probandi,</hi> the
Burden of proving, this <hi>lies upon the Informers,</hi> and that with great
Reason and Justice, according to the known Maxim, <hi>Affirmanti in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbit
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65536:6"/>
Probatio;</hi> He that affirms must prove: And he must prove <hi>all</hi>
that he affirms. But the Informers must affirm <hi>every one of these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi>
in order to make it an Offence within the Act, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they must prove <hi>every one</hi> of them also. 'Tis true, the Party
informed against may be Confession convict himself, if he please;
but it is at his own pleasure whether he will or no: And if he do not,
the next way of Proof is the Oath of two Witnesses. And I conceive
that if the Party should confess he was at a Meeting, and that there
were more there present than four besides the Family, yet this would
not subject him to the Penalties of the Act: for this he might be <hi>justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiably
enough,</hi> unless he would also confess the others parts, <hi>essential</hi> to
an Offence within the Act, <hi>viz.</hi> that he met there <hi>under Colour or
Pretence of some Exercise of Religion,</hi> and that it was <hi>in other manner
than according to the Liturgy,</hi> &amp;c. Now as the Parties Confessing
some parts only, and not every part of the Offence, would <hi>not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict</hi>
him of the Offence, nor Subject him to the Penalties of the Act:
so neither will the Informers Swearing <hi>some parts only,</hi> and not <hi>every</hi>
part of the Offence, convict the Party against whom they so swear,
or subject him to the Penalties of the Act. As therefore it is but
reasonable that the Justice should see due and full Proof made against
the Party, in <hi>every particular Branch</hi> of the Offence, before he makes
Record of it as an Offence, in order to convict the Party thereof: so
it may reasonablely be supposed, that if the Justices would hold the
Informers <hi>closely</hi> to their Evidence, and examin them strictly and
punctually concerning <hi>their</hi> knowledge, in <hi>every particular of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi>
they complain of, they might ease themselves of a great deal
of trouble, and their honest Neighbours of a great deal of wrong.
For how could Informers dare to Swear, that the Parties informed
against, did meet under <hi>Colour of Pretence</hi> of some Exercise of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and not <hi>really</hi> and <hi>sincerely</hi> in the Exercise of Religion? Or
how could Informers take upon them to Swear, that that Exercise of
Religion was <hi>in other manner</hi> than according to the Liturgy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
unless they were <hi>present</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> time of the Meeting, from the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
beginning</hi> to the <hi>very end</hi> thereof (which they rarely, if ever, are)
and heard and saw <hi>whatsoever</hi> was said or done there? And unless
they themselves also better understood, than they commonly do,
what is according to the Liturgy, what not?</p>
            <p>3. Since by the Stat. 18. Eliz. 5. it is provided, that Informers
for certain Offences therein exprest, shall not only <hi>stand on the Pillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65536:7"/>
and be for ever disabled from being Informers more,</hi> but also, in
some Cases shall <hi>pay unto the Defendant</hi> his Costs, Charges and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages,
and in other Cases shall <hi>forfeit the Sum of</hi> 10 l. It seems rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that a Justice may demand an Account of the <hi>Habitation</hi>
and <hi>Ability</hi> of any Person, that offers himself as an Informer; that
so he may be satisfied of the Informer's <hi>Sufficientcy</hi> to answer the Law,
in such respects. And if the Informer cannot give the Justice a good
and satisfactory Account of himself, there is no reason sure that the
Justice should be obliged to take his Information. And since that
Act of the Queen is still in force, (being made perpetual by 27 Eliz.
10.) I humbly offer it to the Justices Consideration, whether they
ought not so far to take notice thereof, as <hi>not to admit every idle Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond,
and beggarly Runnagate</hi> to be an Informer, who is so far from
having 10 l. that some of them have scarce a pair of whole Ears, to
answer the Law withal.</p>
            <p>4. It seems very strange to some, that they should be convicted and
never convened, be fined and not know of it (unless casually by
report) till the Officers come to distrine for the Fine. This being a
course so directly contrary to all Legal Procedures in all Ages, and
condemned by the Practice not only of Christians and Jews, but of
very Heathens also; gives the greater cause of wonder and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that it should be used by any now. The practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom
in this Case is well known. Among the Jews the Witnesses
were not only to be present, but to lay their hands on the head of the
Party whom they witnessed against, while Sentence was given against
him, as <hi>Godwyn</hi> shews in his <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron, l. 5. c.</hi> 6. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
Christ, when the Scribes and Pharisees brought a Woman unto
him, whom they accused of Adultery, and then slipt away them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
took that occasion to dismiss the Woman, saying, <hi>Woman,
where are those thine Accusers?</hi> John 8. 10. <hi>Doth our Law judg any
man before it hear him, and know what he doth,</hi> said <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee,
<hi>Iohn 7. 51?</hi> For Instances are among the Heathens, not to
search prophane Authors, the Scriptures tells us, That the Roman
<hi>Claudius Lysius,</hi> when he sent <hi>Paul</hi> Prisoner to <hi>Felix, gave command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to his Accusers to go also, and say before</hi> Felix <hi>what they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him,</hi> Acts 23. 30. And <hi>Felix</hi> having received the Prisoner,
told him, I <hi>will hear thee when thy Accusers are also come, ver.</hi> 35. And
accordingly, when his Accusers were come, he brought them <hi>Face</hi>
to <hi>Face,</hi> Chap. 24. 2. &amp; ver. 8. 19. And indeed, <hi>Paul</hi> seems to claim
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65536:7"/>
it as his Right, when speaking of certain Jews of <hi>Asia,</hi> (that were
the first Occasion of his Trouble, Chap. 21. 27.) he saies, <hi>who ought
to have been before thee, and object, if they had ought against me,</hi> Chap.
24. 18. 19. And he might well claim it as his Right, since it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Roman Law, as <hi>Festus</hi> answered the Jews; <hi>It is not the
manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he which is
accused, have the Accuser face to face, and have Licence to answer
for himself concerning the Crime laid against him,</hi> Chap. 25. 16. And
surely our Laws in general require the same. Nay, in this Act it
seems to be plainly intended, that the Party accused or informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
should be <hi>first summoned</hi> to appear before the Justice to whom
the Information is given, to be examined by the Justice concerning
the Offence charged against him, and to make answer for himself.
For the <hi>first</hi> way of Proof appointed by the Act for the Conviction
of the Party charged, is <hi>his own Confession;</hi> and that must be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Justice: For the Words of the Act expresly are, [<hi>upon proof to
him made of such offence, either by confession of the Party,</hi> or <hi>Oath,</hi> &amp;c.]
So that the Party ought <hi>first</hi> to be convened before the Justice, and
examined touching the alleadged Offence, in order to his Conviction.
And this seems regularly to be the <hi>first step</hi> towards the Conviction. If
the Party accused confess the Offence, there needs no other Proof;
that is sufficient. If he deny it, or do not confess it, in whole, or in
part, then (and not till then) is other Proof needful: Then the Oath
of two Witnesses is required. Moreover, in that part of the Act
which directs the Preachers Fine, in some Cases, to be laid upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
it is said, <hi>If he be a Stranger, or is fled and cannot be found;</hi>
which implies he ought to be sought after, and found (if it may be)
before any Fine on him, or on others for him, be set. Again, (saies
the Act) <hi>Or if in the judgment of the Iustice, before whom he shall be
Convicted, he shall be thought unable to pay,</hi> &amp;c. This again implies he
should be <hi>brought before the Iustice:</hi> for how should the Justice be able
to judg of the ability of one he never spake with nor saw? So that by
many strong Implications it appears, that by this Act, as well as by the
general course of all Laws, the Party accused ought to be sent for before
the Magistrate to whom he is accused, that he may know his Accusers,
and have liberty to make his defence, before any penalty be inflicted
on him. And if upon his being summoned before the Justice, and
denying, or not confessing the Charge, the proof must be made by the
Oath of two Witness: surely, methinks both Law and Reason will
perswade, that <hi>those Witnesses: ought to depose their Evidence in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:65536:8"/>
of him,</hi> against whom they bear Witness. For besides that it
would be an <hi>awe</hi> upon the Witnesses, to be the more wary what they
swear, and more careful to speak the truth, when they see him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
who they know can contradict them, if they speak not the truth;
The Law, as I take it, gives liberty of exception (upon sufficient
ground) against a Witness; which liberty I am deprived of, if the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Depositions be taken in private, and I not suffered to be present to
hear what it is that is deposed against me, or see who they are that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it. Had I been present, I might haply have assigned such <hi>lawful
exception</hi> against the Witness, as might have taken off the Evidence,
and acquitted me: or if not so, yet who knows but my presence
might have prevented the Witnesses from <hi>forswearing themselves</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
me. However, I had then had my Remedy against them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
my Damages of them, if they were able, or at least for their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
to have utterly disabled them from such undertakings for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But by the Evidence being taken in <hi>private,</hi> and the Informers
<hi>concealed,</hi> I am deprived of these Benefits and <hi>Legal Priviledges:</hi> and by
such means may the most <hi>innocent</hi> man be <hi>ruined.</hi> He that never went
to such a Meeting in his Life, may by this means be made to suffer
for being at such a Meeting, if a couple of graceless Informers, either
out of malice, revenge, advantage or mistake (and <hi>hope of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi>
shall swear against <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and he has no remedy: for if his Fine
do not exceed 10 s. he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> the priviledg of an Appeal, but must
sit down by the loss. And though 10 s. seems but a little, yet 10 s.
a week is 26 l. a year; and that perhaps by that time it is levied, may
be more than—100 l. damage to him from whom it is taken. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
be the suffering greater or less, the <hi>wrong</hi> is the same. I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
the Justices therefore to take this Matter (of <hi>concealing Informers,</hi>
and receiving the Depositions of Witnesses against men <hi>in private,</hi> and
condemning and sentencing Persons unheard) into their serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and do herein as they would be done unto. It was a true
saying, though spoken by an Heathen,
<q>
                  <l>Qui statuit aliquid parte inaudita altera,</l>

5. What hath been said of Informers swearing, hath been spoken
with respect to <hi>present practice only:</hi> for otherwise it is the opinion of
able Counsel, that <hi>no Informer's Oath ought to be taken in this case.</hi> And
therefore, since the Act directs, that if the Party accused do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Charge, he is to be convicted by the <hi>Oath of two Witnesses,</hi>
it may not be unworthy the Justices consideration, what persons in
this Case are <hi>fair and legal Witnesses,</hi> what not. In which Inquiry I
will not insist on that general qualification of a Witness, <hi>viz.</hi> that he
must be <hi>Probus &amp; legalis Homo:</hi> (for little <hi>Probity</hi> to be sure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Legality</hi> in that large Sense, is to be looked for in that sort of
men, who commonly turn Informers.) But I will propose the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<hi>whether any man can be a fair and lawful Witness, who Swears
on his own behalf, and for his own advantage?</hi> If he cannot (which I
suppose will be granted) then is the Informer excluded from being a
Witness, since if he Swear, <hi>he Swares clearly</hi> (no man more) <hi>for his
advantage:</hi> And he is not put upon Swearing, but puts himself upon
it, meerly for advantage-sake to himself. If it be said, <hi>he Swares for
the King;</hi> the Answer is, <hi>and for himself too:</hi> He swears no more
for the King, than he doth for himself; the King is to have but a
third part of the Fines, and the Informer himself as much. If in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
at Law, no man is admitted for a Witness who is <hi>interessed in the
Cause,</hi> and is to <hi>reap advantage by it;</hi> there is then great reason sure,
that the Informers should be set aside, in point of Evidence: Since
he is not only <hi>interessed in the Cause,</hi> and to <hi>reap advantage by it;</hi> but
is Spurr'd on to the undertaking merely by the hope, and desire he
hath of gaining thereby. If in a Tryal it should be proved, that a
Witness was promised to have so much mony given him, in case by
his Evidence the Cause should be gained: Would it not be a fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
against that Witness, and a just ground to set him aside?
The <hi>Informer</hi> is the <hi>Accuser:</hi> and is it reasonable that he should be
both <hi>Accuser</hi> and <hi>Witness</hi> too? 'Tis he that makes the <hi>Complaint:</hi>
and shall he be admitted to prove <hi>his own</hi> Complaint by <hi>his own</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
only! If he hath ought to charge any man with, let him in
this, as in all other Cases, make good his Charge by the Evidence
of such Witnesses, as are <hi>uninteressed</hi> in the Cause, and of <hi>unsuspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted</hi>
Credit. But this Exception lies not against Informers only, but
against all others also who are to <hi>reap benifit to themselves,</hi> by the
Conviction. Such I take to be, The <hi>Poor of that Parish</hi> where the
Offence is alleadged to have been committed: for if the Party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65536:9"/>
be convicted, <hi>they are to have a third part of the Fine;</hi> so that
they, like the Informers, Sweat for <hi>their own immediate Advantage;</hi>
and therefore, by a Parity of Reason, are equally to be excluded
from giving Evidence in such a Case. To these may be added all
such as are Rated to the Relief of the Poor in <hi>that Parish,</hi> where such
Offence is alleadged to have been committed. For though these do
not, as the former, swear for their own immediate advantage; yet
the Evidence of these doth <hi>mediately,</hi> and in the <hi>Consequences</hi> of it,
tend to their own advantage, in <hi>easing themselves thereby of the Charge
of maintaining their Poor,</hi> in whole or in part. I could instance a
Parish, in which the Overseers of the Poor do at this present forbear
making a Rate for the Relief of the Poor, upon a Prospect they have,
and a declared expectation, of Monies likely to come in by Fines
and Forfeitures upon this Act; by which they hope and propose to
ease the Parish of that Charge. Now is not every Contributer to the
Poors Rate in that Parish, justly to excepted against as an Evidence
in this Case, when their Evidence so plainly tends to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
and interest? If a man offer to swear for the enlarging <hi>his
own</hi> Parish-Bounds, he is not allowed for a good Witness, nor will
his Evidence be taken in that Case. The Reason is, because by
the enlarging his Parish-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it is supposed some <hi>profit or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
may accrew to him</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> be so in <hi>that</hi> Case, why should it not
rather be so in <hi>this;</hi> the same reason in <hi>this</hi> Case being <hi>no less forcible,</hi>
and <hi>more obvious</hi> than in <hi>that?</hi> Nor are the Constables and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
free from being <hi>excepted against</hi> as Witnesses in this Case. For
the Act giving a third part of the Penalties to the Informers, and <hi>to
such Person and Persons as the Iustice shall appoint, having regard to
their diligence and industry in discovering, dispersing and punishing of the
said Conventicles;</hi> it cannot well be understood that this is meant
of any other Persons than the Constables, and those other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
mentioned in the Act, because none but they are authorized to
disperse and punish the Conventicles. And therfore, since they are by
this Clause of the Act <hi>put into a capacity of sharing with the Informers;</hi>
(at the Justice's direction) and consequently may be <hi>tempted with hopes
of advantage;</hi> it seems but reasonable that they also should be set aside,
in point of Evidence, and that the proof should be made by Persons
of other Parishes, to whom no <hi>profit</hi> can accrew thereby, and against
whom <hi>no</hi> colour of exception may lie.</p>
            <p>

6. Although the Act doth require every Justice of the Peace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Proof made to him, to make a Record of the Offence proved,
and thereupon to impose upon the Offender so convicted, for the
first Offence 5 s. aud for every after, 10 s. yet <hi>it doth not injoyn the
Iustice to prosecute.</hi> He is not by the letter of the Act expresly injoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
so much as to <hi>issue out a Warrant</hi> for the Levying the fine;
much less is he obliged to <hi>drive on</hi> the Officers to take distress. Nay,
it is doubtful to some profest Lawyers, whether a Justice of the Peace
may grant such a Warrant, or not; in as much as in this particular
he is not expressly required or authorized so to do, as in other parts
of the Act he is. But however, this seems clear, that inasmuch as
there is a <hi>reasonable ground of Doubt,</hi> the Justice doth not incur the
forfeiture of 100 l. in case he do refuse to grant such Warrant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
he ground his Refusal upon that doubt, and declare that to be
the reason of his refusal at the time when he so refuses: for then he
cannot be convicted of <hi>wilfully and wittingly</hi> omitting the performance
of his Duty, as the words of the Act are in relation to that forfeiture,
and which must be proved in order to the Recovery of it</p>
            <p>7. The Act doth not inflict the Penalty of 20 l. or 40 l. upon any
Person for <hi>Praying,</hi> as it doth for Preach or Teaching.</p>
            <p>The Words of the Act are, [<hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Person who shall take

                  </gap>

                  </gap>uch Meeting</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and
shall thereof be convicted as aforesaid; shall forfeit for every
such first offence the sum of</hi> 20 l.—<hi>And if such Offender,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>shall at any time again commit the like Offence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he
thereof convicted;</hi> &amp;c. <hi>than such Offender so convicted of such
like Offence or Offences, shall for every such offence, incur the
penalty of</hi> 40 l.] Here the Penalties of 20 l. and 40 l. are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to Preaching and Teaching; <hi>Not a Word of Praying.</hi> Now
Praying is neither Preaching nor Teaching: for Preaching and
Teaching are directed to Men, but Prayer is directed to God, whom
no man can Teach. If therefore any man shall be informed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
for Preaching, and upon Examination it appear that <hi>he
was only heard to Pray,</hi> he cannot be thereby Legally Convicted
of being a Preacher, or incur the Fines imposed by the Act on
such as Preach or Teach. This has been tried upon an Appeal,
and Judgment given for the Appellant.</p>

8. This Act doth <hi>not forbid Women to Preach or Teach:</hi> For
though it seems at first to speak indefinitely of every person,
yet it immediately <hi>restrains it to the Male Sex,</hi> by using the
<hi>Masculine Gender only,</hi> [Him and His.] The Words of the Act
are, <hi>That every person who shall take upon him to preach</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>shall forfeit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be levied upon his Goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and if
the said Preacher or Teacher be a stranger, and his name not
known,</hi> &amp;c.] It is not said, who shall take upon <hi>him or her,</hi> &amp;c.
or to be levied upon <hi>his</hi> or <hi>her</hi> Goods, &amp;c. Or if <hi>his</hi> or <hi>her</hi> name be not
known, &amp;c. as in the next Paragraph of the Act, relating to the
Meeting-Places, it is. For there it is said [<hi>That person who shall</hi>
wittingly or willingly, <hi>suffer any such Conventicle,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to be held
in his or her house,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>shall forfeit 20. <hi>l.</hi> to be levied upon his
or her Goods,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or in case of his or her poverty,</hi> &amp;c.] Here
the Gender is very carefully varied. And as this variation of
Gender from <hi>him</hi> to <hi>her</hi> doth clearly subject Women to the
Fines for suffering such Conventicles, mentioned in the Act,
at their Houses: So the omi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sion of that variation, and using
only the Masculine Gender, <hi>Him and His, not Her at all,</hi> doth as
clearly <hi>exempt Women</hi> from being fined for Preaching. This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
hath been tried upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> an Appeal, and judgment thereupon
given for the Apellant.</p>
            <p>9. If above the number of four persons, besides the Family,
be met together, <hi>and sit in silence,</hi> so that the Informers are not
able to prove that there was <hi>any words</hi> spoken among them,
and so no overt act of religious Exercise. <hi>Such</hi> a Meeting
hath been adjudged <hi>not to come within this Act,</hi> nor the Persons
so met to be justly liable to any of those Fines, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mposeable by
this Act. For they who are finable by this Act must be such,
as are Convicted of having been at a Meeting where was <hi>some
Exercise of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gion, in other manner than according to the Liturgy,</hi>
&amp;c. But what Exercise of Religion can those persons be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of, who only sit still<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>neither say a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y thing, nor do
any thing?</hi> If their minds and spirits be inwardly gathered into
a spiritual Exercise towards God, who is the Father of Spirits;
That methinks should not <hi>be in other manner</hi> than according
to the Liturgy and Practice of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
that falls not under the Cognizance of <hi>outward</hi> Evidence.
But that which the Justices may well hold the Informers and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65536:10"/>
their Witnesses to is, <hi>what Exercise of Religion they saw there?</hi>
And if they are not able to give account of <hi>some Exercise</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
there used, and that <hi>in other manner</hi> than according to
the Liturgy, &amp;c. the Justice hath very good ground to <hi>reject
their Information.</hi> In this Case also upon a Tryal, the Persons
so met have been acquitted.</p>
            <p>11. And lastly, concerning the House or Place where the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is held, there seems to be a great mistake. For some eager
Prosecutors of this Act, for <hi>every time</hi> that proof hath been made
to them, of a Meeting being held at such or such an House, have
imposed a <hi>fresh</hi> Fine for the House, which in my apprehension,
(with submission notwithstanding to more able judgment) the Act
affords no colour for. The words are these [<hi>And be it further enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Authority aforesaid, that every Person who shall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly
and willingly suffer any such Conventicle, Meeting or unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Assembly aforesaid, to be held in his or her house, out-house,
Barn, Yard or Back-side, and be convicted thereof in manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
shall forfeit the sum of</hi> 20 l. <hi>to be levied in manner afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
upon his or her Goods and Chattels; or in case of his or
her poverty or inability as aforesaid, upon the Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
of such persons who shall be convicted in manner aforesaid,
of being present at the same Conventicle; and the Money so levied
to be disposed of in manner aforesaid.</hi>] This is the whole of that
matter <hi>verba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>im:</hi> In which there is no mention of any more or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than <hi>one</hi> Fine, and that of 20 <hi>l.</hi> No iteration or repeating of
the Fine, for <hi>every such Meeting;</hi> as in other parts of this Act,
where the Fine is to be repeated, It is expresly said. For instance,
In the case of the Hearer, there is not only the Fine of 5 <hi>s.</hi> set for
the first Offence; but a double Fine afterwards for <hi>every such Offence,</hi>
expresly. Again, In the case of the Preacher, There is not only
the Fine of 20 <hi>l.</hi> for the first Offence; but a double Fine afterwards
for <hi>every such Offence,</hi> expresly. Again, In the Case of a Constables
wilfully and wittingly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mitting the performance of his duty, it is said
expresly, He shall forfeit <hi>for every such Offence</hi> the sum of 5 <hi>l.</hi> But
in this Case of the Meeting-House, there is <hi>no such</hi> Expression u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
no such Provision made, no such Direction given, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
such</hi> Course required. Nay, here is not so much as an
Implication of a <hi>Second;</hi> for the Word <hi>[First]</hi> is not here
used, as in the other Cases, of Preacher and Hearer, it is. Now
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65536:11"/>
since in all places of the Act, where the Penalty is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
or <hi>more than once</hi> inflicted; it is expresly said <hi>[for every
such Offence]</hi> which Sentence in this Place is <hi>wholly omitted,</hi>
take it for a very perswasive Argument, That it was never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any more than <hi>one</hi> Fine should be set for <hi>one</hi> Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-House,
how oft foever met in. But if any apprehend o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
and should think the Intention of the Law-makers
reacht further; yet since the <hi>Letter of the Law extends no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
since also the Clemency of English Natures hath resolved
it into an Axiom, <hi>That poenal Laws are to be taken, in mitiori Sens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in the more mild and favourable Sense:</hi> there seems to be here at least
<hi>fair Scope</hi> for all (who would not be Severer than Severity, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
exceed <hi>Summum Jus</hi>) to exercise some degree of <hi>Compassion</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the afflicted. To which Christian Temper; and tends
frame of Spirit, what words can be more moving and apt to
dispose, than those of our blessed Saviour, in his Sermon in
the Mount, <hi>viz. Blessed are the Merciful; for they shall obtain
