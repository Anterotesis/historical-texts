            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You may well think I did what I was able to have saved him; but it was his destiny! Yet he had the comfort, which no other Usurrer ever had, to have his Gold go with him.</p>

                  <p>No, Neighbour, you misconceive that Child, for he is stol'n poor fool, some Knave or other has ticed him away with a baked Pair, and my Gossip hear's this Ship is bound for the <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudos,</hi> and suspects he may be spirited into it, truly Neighbours consider soberly, and 'tis a very hard case, when we cannot get Children our selves, but are forc't to allow wages to Seamen, and labouring younger brothers to do it for us, and as soon as ever we have 'em they must be stollen, there's all our charges meerly throne away.</p>

                  <p>Yes, familiarly when they have poor folks bratts, the Church-wardens wink at such small faults; nay, and some think (under the Rose neighbours) 'tis done by their own Journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>

                  <p>Sir, he must be contended; He has been above seven years away beyond Sea, and has never Writ her word he was alive; so that in Law the Marriage is void.</p>

                  <p>And what is more, by mine. This way my honours safe, but by the other nothing but discontents and endless quarrels could have insu'd. I hope Sir, you will not judge the worse of my Vertue by what has past between us.</p>

                  <p>I was in fault not you, but 'twas a fault, so fortunate, that I can ne'r repent it; pardon me for what is past, and for the future all my wild follies and debaucheries I'le leave and place my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness alone in you.</p>

            <l>When we're so moderate to desire but Three.</l>
            <l>Cou'd you deny the Dear that thus shou'd woo</l>

            <l>We keep our Loving kindness for the last.</l>
            <l>When we grow eager 'twould show rude to scoff,</l>
            <l>And to shrink from us with a dry come off.</l>
            <l>You see what shift we make to meet again,</l>
            <l>To Act with raw Boyes, is Loving without Men.</l>
            <l>What will not poor forsaken Women try,</l>
            <l>When Man's not near, the <hi>Signior</hi> must supply.</l>
            <l>Excuse our <hi>Play</hi>; we dare not hope its taking,</l>
            <l>We're told of a fine House, and Clothes a making.</l>
            <l>And these hir'd <hi>Signiors</hi> when we meet together,</l>
            <l>May then wear <hi>Sattin,</hi> though they now wear <hi>Leather.</hi>
