            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Directions for Prayer, for the
Diocess of Bath and Wells.</head>
            <head type="sub">Price stitcht 1d.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dearly beloved in our Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THe Catechism truly teaches all Christians, that
they are <hi>not able of themselves to do those
things</hi> they have vow'd in their Baptism to do,
namely, <hi>To walk in the Commandments of God,
and to serve him, without his special Grace,</hi> or favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Assistance, and this <hi>then are to learn at all times to
call upon</hi> God <hi>for, by diligent Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How good and seasonable this advice is, you will all see,
if you consider what helpless and needy Creatures the very
best of Men are. Alas! our weakness is very great, our
wants are very many, our dependance on God for all
things, all our lives long, is entire, and absolute, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary,
and there is no way in the World to gain help and
supplies from God, but by Prayer; so that it is as easie,
and as possible to preserve a natural Life without daily
Bread, as a Christian Life without daily Prayer.</p>
            <p>It was for this reason, that our Saviour himself took a
particular care, to teach <hi>his Disciples to pray, [<hi>Luke</hi> 11. 1]</hi>
and it is for the same reason, and in imitation of our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Master, that I have joyn'd these directions for Prayer
to the Catechism.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, the Zeal I ought to have for your Salvation,
can suggest to me nothing more conducing to the good
of your Souls, than to exhort and beseech you all, of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Sex, to learn how to Pray.</p>
            <p>This is the first general Request I shall make to you, and
I am the more earnest in it, because my own sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33583:2"/>
has taught me, how strangely ignorant common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
usually are of this duty; insomuch, that some never
Pray at all, pretending they were never taught, or that
their memories are bad, or that they are not Book-learn'd,
or that they want mony to buy a Book; and by this means
they live, and die rather like Beasts than Men; nay, their
condition is much worse than that of Beasts, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery
of a Beast doth end at death, but the misery of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man does then begin, and will endure to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>To prevent then as much as lies in me, the damnation
of those Souls which God has committed to my care, and
to cure that lamentable ignorance and forgetfulness of God,
which is the cause of the damnation of so very many, I do
not only incessantly pray for you my self, but I beg of
you all to pray for your selves, and I beseech you to read
the following Instructions; or if you cannot read your
selves, to get some honest charitable Neighbors to read
them often to you, that you may remember them, and
God of his great mercy reward the Charity of such Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors.</p>
            <p>If any of you, either by your own negligence, or by
the negligence of your Parents, or for want of Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
in your Parish, are wholly ignorant of your duty;
though it be a most shameful and dangerous thing, for one
who calls himself a Christian, to know nothing of Christ
or Christianity, yet if you are willing to learn, and beg
pardon of God for your wilful ignorance hitherto, and
will sincerely do your endeavor to get saving Knowledge,
and heartily pray to God to assist you, you shall find, that
the very <hi>entrance of-Gods word giveth light, that it giveth
understanding unto the simple.</hi> [Psal. 119. 130.]</p>
            <p>I must warn you before-hand, that corrupt Nature will
be very busie in hindering the learning of your duty, and
thoughts will arise in your mind that the task will be
too hard and too tedious for you to undertake; but I faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
promise you, to impose no hard or tedious task on
you, but such as you your selves shall confess, to be very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33583:2"/>
complying with your Infirmities; for our most compassion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
Saviour teaches me to say no more to you, than <hi>you can
bear. [Iohn</hi> 16. 11.]</p>
            <p>All I shall exhort you to, is to learn your Catechism,
which you may do by degrees: If you learn but a line or
two in a day, you will, by Gods blessing, in a very short
time learn it all over, and you will rejoice, and thank
God, for the sudden and happy progress you have made.</p>
            <p>God forbid you should ever think your selves too old to
learn to serve God, and to be saved, both which are
taught in the Catechism, and therefore the Catechism is
of necessity to be learned: For how can you go to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
if you never learn'd the way thither? How can you
be sav'd, if you do not know your Saviour?</p>
            <p>'Tis a great Error, to think that the Catechism was
made for Children only, for all Christians are equally
concern'd in those saving Truths which are there taught;
and the Doctrine delivered in the Catechism, is as proper
for the study and as necessary for the salvation of a great
Doctor, as of a weak Christian, or a young Child.</p>
            <p>But you will be the more encouraged to learn your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism,
when you see how excellent a help it will be to
Prayer, for it will at the same time further your Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and your Devotion both together; and the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
I intend to commend to you, are chiefly the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
in the Catechism, which being daily repeated, will
be the better fix'd in your memory, and you cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
any advice for Prayer can be more easie and familiar,
than that which directs you to turn your very Catechism
into Prayers.</p>
            <p>You are by this time I hope satisfied, that the Duty to
which I exhort you, is no hard task; and yet I will endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
by Gods assistance, to make it more easie, by putting
you into an easie method to attain it.</p>
            <p>If you are wholly ignorant of your Catechism, let it be
your first care to learn such Ejaculations, such short Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as these, and say them often, and heartily.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:33583:3"/>Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>Christ have mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>Lord pardon all my wilful ignorance, and gross
carelessness of my duty, for the sake of Iesus my
Saviour. <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O my God assist me in the learning of my Duty.</p>
            <p>Lord help me to know, and to love thee.</p>
            <p>Lord pity me, Lord save me, Father forgive me.</p>
            <p>Glory be to thee, O Lord, who hast hitherto spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me.</p>
            <p>O that I might at last learn to glorifie, and love,
and serve thee!</p>
            <p>Such short Prayers as these, you may easily get by
heart, and the method in which I advise you to proceed,
is, that in which Children are commonly taught, in regard
I am now to look on you as a Child: For there are two
sorts of Children; there are Children in age, and <hi>Children
in understanding, [1 Cor. 14. 20.]</hi> and in this latter respect
you are Children, and the same method for the most part
is proper for you, which is proper for those that are Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
in Age.</p>
            <p>I must therefore feed you <hi>with Milk,</hi> before you can be
capable of <hi>strong Meat,</hi> [Heb. 5. 13.] and I must look on
you as <hi>Lambs</hi> of my Flock, which I am to use tenderly,
and these following Directions which I give to Parents,
for the training up their Children in Piety, I do equally
design for the training up of you. God of his Infinite
Goodness, bless them to you both.</p>
            <p>I exhort all you who are Parents, to instil good things
into your Children as soon as ever they begin to speak;
let the first words they utter, if it be possible, be these, <hi>Glory
be to God:</hi> Accustom them to repeat these words on their
knees, as soon as they rise, and when they go to bed, and
ofttimes in the day, and let them not eat or drink, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
saying, <hi>Glory be to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:33583:3"/>As their speech grows more plain and easie to them, teach
them who Made, and Redeem'd and Sanctified them, and
for what end, namely to glorifie and to love God; and
withal, teach them some of the shortest Ejaculations you
can, such as these;</p>
            <p>Lord help me. Lord save me.</p>
            <p>Lord have mercy upon me.</p>
            <p>All love, all glory be to God who first lov'd me.</p>
            <p>Lord keep me in thy love.</p>
            <p>Within a little time you may teach them the Lords Prayer,
and hear them say it every day, morning &amp; evening on their
knees; with some one or more of the fore-going Ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
and by degrees as they grow up, they will learn the
Creed, and the whole Catechism.</p>
            <p>Be sure to teach your Children with all the sweetness and
gentleness you can, lest if you should be severe, or should
over-task them, Religion should seem to them rather a
burden than a Blessing.</p>
            <p>As their Knowledge increases, so let their Prayers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
also, and teach them as they go to turn their Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism
into Prayers, after the manner which I shall shew
you, and to confirm and improve their knowledge, bring
them duly to the Church to be Catechised by the Parish
Priest, that by his familiar and devout Explications of the
Catechism, they may learn to understand it, and may be
capable of reading the Exposition on it, and other Books
of Piety.</p>
            <p>Take conscientious care to season your Children as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as you can, with the love of God, which is <hi>the first and
great Commandment, [Matth.</hi> 22. 38.] and with <hi>the fear of
God, which is the beginning of Wisdom, [Psal.</hi> 111. 10.] for
the awful love, and the filial fear of God, must always go
together.</p>
            <p>The same method you observe in teaching your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
the same you may observe in teaching your Servants,
according as you see they want teaching, and you your
selves will reap the benefit of it, as well as your Servants;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33583:4"/>
for the more devout servants they are of God, the more
faithful Servants will they be to you.</p>
            <p>Remember, you must teach both your Children and
Servants by your Example, as well as by your Instruction,
for they learn best by Example; and if they see you give
an example of fraud or lying, of revenge or calumny,
of uncleanness or drunkenness, of cursing and swearing,
and irreligion; instead of teaching them to obey God, you
teach them to provoke him; instead of teaching them to
honor God, you teach them to blaspheme him; instead
of leading them the way to Heaven, you lead them the
way to Hell; and you will increase your own damnation, by
furthering theirs, which God forbid you should ever do.</p>
            <p>Now that you may the better give a good Example to
your Family, I will by Gods help give you a method of dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Devotion, taken for the most part out of the Catechism,
which will be suitable to all Christians, be they never so
well instructed, and which you may by little and little
teach your Children; and which those who have been bred
up in ignorance, and are Children in understanding, and
are yet willing to be taught, may learn to say also, as the
capacities of either do increase; for a Christian must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
stand at a stay, but must be always <hi>growing in Grace,
and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ,
[2 Pet.</hi> 3. 18.]</p>

evermore: All love, all praise be to thee.</p>

the Lord sustained me: All love, all glory be to God.

               <p>Our Father which art in Heaven, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Instead of these two last Prayers, you may sometimes say the Ten
Commandments, which you may turn into a very good Prayer, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after every one,</p>
               <p>Lord have mercy upon me, and incline my heart to keep this
Low.</p>
               <p>Where you not only beg pardon for the sins you have committed
against each Commandment, but you also beg Grace to keep it.</p>
               <p>At the end of them you may say,</p>
               <p>Lord have mercy upon me, and write all these thy Laws in my
heart, A beseech thee.</p>
               <p>And so conclude with the Lords Prayer.</p>
               <p>Do not think that this Practice of Prayer will be too hard, or too
long for young persons, or for labouring people; for if you cannot say
them all, say as much as you can; or if you are at Day Labour, or have
not time or convenience to say them, offer up to God two or three
hearty Ejaculations in their place: but if you can get time and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
say them all, and I dare assure you, that all the three Forms of
Prayer which I commend to you, will not in all take up a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an hour; and certainly that Person has very little sense of his Duty,
very little concern for his immortal Soul, very little Honour for God, or
value for Heaven, who will not spend one quarter of an hour in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33583:7"/>
space of four and twenty hours, in the Service of God, and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own Soul.</p>
               <p>I do by all means exhort you to give your Servants a few Minutes
leisure at Noon, to pray after your Example, and to use your Children
to do the same, for they will soon be able to say the Lords Prayer, and
two or three Ejaculations, and teach them to say these at Noon, as well
as at Morning and at Night, and 'tis incredible to think how much good
this Practice will do them, and what great comfort you your selves will
reap from the early Devotion of your Children.</p>
               <p>To further this Devotion in your Children, instead of Idle Tales and
Songs, which pollute their Souls, and when they come to be serious, will
cost them great pains to unlearn: You must teach them short Psalms
by heart, which will exercise their Memories and Piety both together;
and as you teach the Psalms to your Children, I exhort you to learn them
your selves.</p>
               <p>You cannot imagine the great benefit of learning Psalms by heart;
for when you are under any Temptation, or are in any affliction, or
when you lye waking in the Night, or when you are Sick, these Psalms
will come into your mind, and the Devout repeating them will yield
you most seasonable Consolations.</p>
               <p>The very Common People, in the first and purest Ages of the Church,
were so sensible of the Spiritual advantages of learning Psalms, that they
learn'd the whole Psalter by heart, and sang or said the Psalms in their
Shops, and at the Plow, insomuch that St. <hi>Iames</hi> makes it the proper
expression of Christian mirth, <hi>[Iames 5. 13.] If any be merry, let him
sing Psalms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the way to store your own and your Childrens minds with Eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
or short Prayers for all Occasions, which I advise both Old and
Young to accustom themselves to, because it is the true way of Praying
without ceasing, and it is a kind of Prayer most easie, and may be used
at any time of the day, or in any place, and is one of the most efficacious
means in the World to keep us in Gods favour, which is of all things
most desirable.</p>
