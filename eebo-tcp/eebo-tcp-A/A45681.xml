            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To all into whoſe hands this may fall; eſpecially thoſe who ſit under my Miniſtry.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Friends,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THERE are two things which do moſt evidently prove man by nature a loſt Creature.</p>
            <p>The one is the exceeding propenſity and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heart of every man to actual ſin, <hi>Pſal. 58.3. Job 15.16.</hi> Though every man is not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty of every ſin, yet is there not a ſin in the world, but is ſeminally and vertually in every one's Nature.</p>
            <p>The other is that ſtrange infatuation the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding lieth under, and its proneneſs to miſtake darkneſs for light; damnable and deformed Errors for beautiful and ſaving Truths: And that which is ſaddeſt of all, a tenacious adherence to, and a reſolved perſeverance in, theſe by-paths of Error, is very oft a mournful conſequence that follows them.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe two things do ſhew the fearful ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ines and miſerable condition of all by Nature: So there are two things which all Goſpel-miniſters ſhould vehemently urge upon their people as effectual remedies againſt ſo dangerous and pernicious a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady.</p>
            <p>The one is the abſolute and indiſpenſible neceſſity of the new birth; <hi>Joh. 3.3. Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> This new birth is no leſs than a renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Powers and Faculties of the Soul, a
<pb facs="tcp:49497:3"/>
putting off the old man, and a putting on Chriſt; a changing that heart into a new gracious tender heart, that was by nature an old unbelieving ſtony heart; any thing that perſons reſt in ſhort of this new birth, is ſhort of Salvation.</p>
            <p>The other is, ſoundneſs of judgment in the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt; it is not like that the Life ſhould be holy, if the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding be corrupt; there are damnable Principles as well as damnable Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, <hi>2 Pet. 2.1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed all Erroneous Opinions are not alike dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; ſuch as ſtrike at the fundamental Articles of Chriſtianity are moſt deadly; ſuch as err in leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Points, are not in ſo much danger.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as the more fundamental and noble a Doctrine is, the more earneſtly ſhould we contend for it; ſo the more directly any Erroneous Opinion ſubverts ſame fundamental Truth, the more zeal and indignation we ſhould ſhew againſt it; as alſo the greater care to antidote our ſelves and others againſt it.</p>
            <p>Now amongſt thoſe Erroneous Doctrines that have been like pricking Briars, and wounding Thorns, ever ſince the beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the Proteſtant Churches, thoſe wild and Erroneous Doctrines that have been broached by the <hi>Antipedo</hi> Baptiſts, on Anabaptiſts, have not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the leaſt trouble to the Church of Chriſt, but have been a perpetual vexation and trouble to all our godly Reformers, as is evident by the ſad complaints of thoſe godly men in their Books, as who will but read the Works or Lives of <hi>Calvin, Luther, Zuinglius, Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton,
<pb facs="tcp:49497:3"/>
Oeculampadius, Muſculus,</hi> &amp;c. and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Divines, may be abundantly ſatisfied. The danger many of you were in of being ſucked in among the Anabaptiſts, or at leaſt to join with them in excluding your Infants from Baptiſm, the Seal of the Covenant, was that which firſt put me upon preaching upon this Subject; and it is the earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of ſeveral of you, that makes me conſent to the Printing of it. The Sermons you have lately heard upon this Text, have been (glory to Free Grace) of admirable uſe to eſtabliſh and ſettle thoſe of you that were ſtaggering in this Doctrine; that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there was many ſcruples in many perſons about <hi>Infant Baptiſm,</hi> yet now there are very few, if any, of thoſe that conſtantly frequent this Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, but have attained great ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>As God that knows my heart, can teſtify for me, that it is not yours, but you, that I ſeek, your preſent holineſs and eternal happineſs; ſo my great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt joy amongſt you will be to find that my labour is not in vain; that you are gained to Chriſt, and joined to him by ſo firm a faith as the gates of Hell may never prevail againſt.</p>
            <p>I bleſs God for that encouragement I have had amongſt you, many of you that ſprung from Parents of the oppoſite Perſuaſion, having ſo chearfully liſted your ſelves in Chriſt's Service, and by receiving Chriſt's Preſs-money, have more ſolemnly engaged your ſelves to be his Servants for ever. And that ſo many of you, and many even of adult age, have thought it their honour to be catechiſed in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregation, which, I hope, will be followed by many others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49497:4"/>In ſhort, Your exceeding willingnſs to wait on the Miniſtry with thoſe ſaving impreſſions which, I hope, God hath made on many of your hearts, are to me a ground of hope, that what is ſo hopefully begun amongſt you, will be as comfortably finiſhed in the glory of God, and your Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>If any demand a reaſon, why one who willingly acknowledges himſelf to be the unfitteſt of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, hath attempted this work, which hath been ſo well performed by ſeveral abler Pens? I only an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That what others have done, being either too voluminous, or Anſwers to other Books, were therefore not ſo proper: Beſides, they that know my Circumſtances, the confident repeated Challenges, the reſtleſs Inſinuations of the Anabaptiſts, together with the various Attempts that the Perſons of that Perſuaſion have made to enſnare and draw away my Hearers (though I bleſs God with no ſucceſs) to their own way; will ſee that I lay under a kind of neceſſity for what I have done.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian, ſtudy thy own heart, love all that fear God, though differently perſuaded in ſome leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer things. And pray for him who deſires to ſerve thee in our common Saviour,</p>

            <p>GOD having in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Abraham, that in him all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> comes now in this 17th Chapter in a more expreſs and formal manner to eſtabliſh his Covenant with <hi>Abraham:</hi> In which obſerve three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſons covenanting.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Ex parte Dei;</hi> God ſtands on the one ſide of the Covenant: O the Infinite Condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of the Great God, to take any notice of loſt Sinners! that when we had broken
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49497:5"/>
the Firſt Covenant, that he ſhould condeſcend to make a Second Covenant, a Covenant of Grace with loſt Sinners!</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Ex parte Abrahami; Abraham</hi> and his Seed ſtand on the other ſide of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; <hi>with thee and thy ſeed after thee:</hi> This Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> is to be limited according to Scripture; not in <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> nor his Seed by <hi>Ketura, but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called,</hi> Gen. 21.12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had a two-fold Seed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Natural Seed by Generation, which are <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed by promiſe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.7, 8. Neither becauſe they are the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> are they all Children, <hi>but in Iſaac ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A Spiritual Seed; and theſe were ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Proſelited <hi>Gentiles</hi> under the Law, who did believe in, and worſhipped the God of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and ſo were by Circumciſion, the then Seal of the Covenant, taken into <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s Family; or elſe all Believers under the Goſpel; who though they are not of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Poſterity, are yet <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Spiritual Seed; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of faith, that the promiſe might be ſure to all the ſeed, not only that which is of the law</hi> (viz. <hi>the Jews</hi>) <hi>but to that alſo which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all; i. e.</hi> the <hi>Gentile</hi> Believers. So <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. By both which places the Apoſtle aſſureth the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> That if they are by faith tranſplanted into Chriſt, <hi>then were they Abraham's ſeed,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49497:5"/>
might claim all the Promiſes and Priviledges of the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as if they had been <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Natural Seed by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from <hi>Iſaac.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Here is the duration of this Covenant; an everlaſting, a perpetual, or an eternal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; a Covenant to laſt for evermore; ſo the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. Here are the Conditions of this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; on God's part, <hi>I will be to thee a God,</hi> which carries in it all manner of Temporal, Spiritual, and Eternal Bleſſings; as Pardon, Sanctification, and Eternal Life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.14, 15.</p>
            <p>And on <hi>Abraham</hi>'s part; he and his Seed were to be the Lord's peculiar People, to walk before God in holineſs, and ſincere obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1.17.8, 9, 10.</p>

            <p n="5">5. That all the Infants of Believing Parents are in this Covenant, and have as much a right to the now Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm, as the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> had to the then Seal of the Covenant, which was Circumciſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
            <p>The Covenant of Grace is God's gracious Promiſe of delivering from a ſtate of Sin and Death, and bringing into a ſtate of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, all that by faith fly to, and lay hold on him.</p>
            <p>In which Covenant we may take notice,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Parties in covenant; God is on the one part of the Covenant, and Believers and their Children on the other part, as has been proved.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That on our part Chriſt is the principal Head and Repreſentative in this Covenant; for this Covenant was made with Chriſt as the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him with all the Elect, as his Seed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. to the end. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediator of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Herein God promiſes Life and Salvation to all Believers, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49497:6"/>5. The Condition of the Covenant on our part is Faith, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Herein the Holy Spirit is abſolutely promiſed to work Faith and all other Graces in us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. and the firſt graces of Converſion is abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us without any reſpect to the will of man, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26.</p>
            <p>This Covenant God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> was a Covenant of Grace; it muſt either be a Covenant of Works, or a Covenant of Grace; but a Covenant of Works it is not, for that requires perſonal perfect Obedience from all; and in caſe of ſin lays the Sinner under an curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5.</p>
            <p>It is a Covenant of Grace, as is evident.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Phraſe, <hi>I will be thy God, and you ſhall be my people,</hi> is never found but in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Covenant of Grace; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.1. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.45. <hi>Jer.</hi> 24.7.31.33.32.37, 38, 39. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.18, 19, 20.34.22, 23, 24, 25.37.23. <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It was the Covenant of Grace; for it's an Everlaſting Covenant, which is a property of the Covenant of Grace, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It's a Covenant of Grace; for we find that in all After-diſcoveries and Repetitions of the Covenant of Grace, the Spirit of God hath reſpect to this; as <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.42. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was a Covenant of Grace; for Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the Seal of it, was a Goſpel-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49497:7"/>
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. it was a Sign and Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, <hi>i. e.</hi> of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It's a Covenant of Grace; for that Phraſe, <hi>I will be to thee a God,</hi> contains all Goſpel-bleſſings in it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.9, 10, 13, 14. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.18.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Many Scriptures teſtify it was ſo; <hi>Micha</hi> 7.19, 20. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.72, 73, 74.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Circumciſion then was, and Baptiſm now is, the Seal of this Covenant: That Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion then was a Seal, is evident, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Whoever would be a viſible Church-member muſt be circumciſed.</p>
            <p>Circumciſion is now aboliſhed by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.19</p>
            <p>And Baptiſm now ſerves to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; whoever will be a Member of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, muſt be baptiſed; there's no change in the Covenant, only the Rite of admitting Members is changed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All Believers are in this Covenant; this is abundantly evident, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29. The Covenant was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> as a Believer, and with all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as well as him. Perſons may be ſaid to be in covenant in a twofold reſpect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Internally and inviſibly; as united to Chriſt, living Branches, knit to Chriſt by a vital union; and thus only the Elect are in covenant: The Covenant thus conſidered is not the ground of Baptiſm; if we muſt bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49497:7"/>
none but ſuch as are vitally in Chriſt, then muſt we baptize none; becauſe tho we ſee the outward profeſſion, we do not know who belong to the Election of Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Perſons are externally and viſibly in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. Thus all who profeſs Chriſt, Tares and Wheat, wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and fooliſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.1, 2, 3, 4. This is the ground of Baptiſm; we do not baptize perſons as the Elect of God, or Infants as the Infants of the Elect, but as making a viſible and credible profeſſion of Religion; ſo the Apoſtles did preſently baptize ſuch as did profeſs repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> in barely profeſſing to believe in Chriſt, was baptiſed.</p>
            <p>Thus all thoſe who viſibly profeſs Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and are baptiſed in the name of Chriſt, and do not ſcandalous Sins, notoriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their Profeſſion, are to be accounted Believers in Covenant, and their Children to be baptiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all Infants of ſuch believing Parents are in the Covenant of Grace, and have as much a right to Baptiſm, the now Seal of the Covenant, as the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> had to Circumciſion, the then Seal of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
            <p>This is the principal thing deſigned from this Text.</p>
            <p>There are, you know, a ſort of reſtleſs people amongſt us, who are perpetually let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49497:8"/>
fly, and with great indignation ſpurning at Infant Baptiſm; telling you, your Infants have no right to the Seal of the Covenant, and thereby tempt you to be cruel to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of your own Bowels, ſetting them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Pagans and Infidels.</p>
            <p>Therefore I hope it will be an acceptable ſervice to plead the Cauſe of your poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, who cannot yet ſpeak a word for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; to aſſert and prove their right to the Covenant, and the initiating Seal thereof, which is Baptiſm. I hope to find very few amongſt you who will join with the Enemy of Infants, but rather put to a helping hand to reſtore them thoſe Priviledges God allows them. In ſpeaking to this, I ſhall</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Containing five Introductory Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, very needful for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the Controverſy of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm.</head>
               <p n="1">1. COnſider, that a Doctrine or Practice may be proved to be of God two ways.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the expreſs words of Scripture; as the Reſurrection of the dead may be proved from ſuch a Text as cannot be denied by any that own the Scripture to be God's Word; as <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>All that are in the grave ſhall come forth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Or from Evident Conſequences drawn from Scripture; then have we the mind of Chriſt, when we have the right meaning of Scripture; thus Chriſt proves the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> Luke 20.37, 38. <hi>Now that the dead are raiſed, even Moſes ſhewed at the buſh, when he calleth the Lord, The God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this Scripture doth not prove the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in direct terms, but remotely, and by conſequence. How little ſatisfaction would this Text have given our Modern Anabaptiſts, if they had been preſent at the Diſpute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and the <hi>Sadduces;</hi> would they not
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49497:9"/>
have reprov'd Chriſt for his Impertinence? We will not believe the dead will riſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we have a plain Text; would not theſe men have reported abroad that Chriſt could could not prove the Reſurrection?</p>
               <p>Thus they deal with us at this day; <hi>We challenge you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to prove Infant Baptiſm to be God's Ordinance; bring us a plain Text, and we will believe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now if we prove Infant Baptiſm as plainly as Chriſt proved the Reſurrection, then it is certainly God's Ordinance; and we are bound to own it.</p>
               <p>Moſt we believe nothing but what we have <hi>totidem verbis,</hi> in juſt ſo many words in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? then how ſhall we prove the firſt day of the Week to be the Chriſtian Sabbath? That a Woman may come to the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? That a Chriſtian may be a Magiſtrate?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve, That a mind prepoſſeſſed with Error and Prejudice, that is, not ſeeking Truth, but only ſomething to defend their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Embraced Opinions, will not be ſatisfied, let the Text be never ſo clear, or the Argument never ſo firmly built upon Scripture; but will ſtill be inventing ſome ſhift or other to ward off the force of any Text or Argument.</p>
               <p>This is evident in the Example of the <hi>Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces</hi> beforementioned; we find indeed Chriſt ſilenced them, but we do not find ſo much as one of them convinced, and brought off to a ſound mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49497:9"/>Men are generally ſo fond of their Errors, that when they are beaten out of one hold, they fly to another.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe Doctrines which were clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and fully confirmed in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though little or nothing be ſaid of them in the New Teſtament, and were never repealed, are yet to be owned, received and believed, as if much had been ſaid of them in the New Teſtament; the whole Scripture is God's Word, and what need of proving the ſame thing twice, unleſs the Authority of the Old Teſtament were queſtioned? this is evident in the lawfulneſs of a Chriſtian Magiſtracy, in an Oath before a Magiſtrate, and making war upon a juſt occaſion: There is ſo little ſaid of theſe things in the New Teſtament, many of the Anabaptiſts have denied them; yet theſe being fully ſetled and confirmed by God in the Old Teſtament, are to be owned, though little be ſaid of them in the New.</p>
               <p>Now this is the caſe of Infant Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion is not by what Sign, but at what Age, perſons are to be admitted into the viſible Church?</p>
               <p>Now this was fully determined in the Old Teſtament, That Infants at eight days old were to be admitted Members of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church; and ſuppoſe little be ſaid of it in the New Teſtament, it is becauſe there was no need of it; this truth having been once ſetled in the Old Teſtament, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49497:10"/>4. Thoſe Doctrines which were once throughly ſetled in the Old Teſtament, and never called in queſtion by any in the New, there was no occaſion given to ſpeak of them again.</p>
               <p>We find, that what was but darkly hinted in the Old Teſtament, and much queſtioned in the New, is fully cleared; and much is ſaid of it, as that glorious Doctrine of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the imputation of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt: This was very darkly hinted in the Old Teſtament, and very much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Legal Preachers in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, therefore much is ſaid in the New Teſtament to clear it.</p>
               <p>But Infants right to the Covenant, or to Church-memberſhip, there was much ſaid of it in the Old Teſtament, and it was neve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> denied or called in queſtion by any in the Apoſtles days; they were ſetled, and had had peaceable poſſeſſion of their Priviledges ever ſince <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time.</p>
               <p>Had any in the Apoſtles days ſcrupled in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Right, very much would have been ſaid of it; for the <hi>Jews,</hi> who tenaciouſly adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their old Priviledges, would never ſo ſilently have ſuffered their Children to be caſt out of covenant, without taking notice of it.</p>
               <p>A Doctrine may be very clear, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures brought to prove, and the Argument thence deduced clear and convincing; and yet it may remain dark to one that is unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſcerning it. An Object may be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49497:10"/>
very obvious, and yet not well diſcerned, by reaſon the Eye is clouded. How plain are the Doctrines of the Trinity; the Divine Nature of Chriſt; Juſtification by Imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet many are ſo blind as not to ſee theſe things?</p>
               <p>So the matter in debate, <hi>viz.</hi> That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of believing Parents have a right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is as clear to me as the other, yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will not ſee it. The generality of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are but Babes in knowledge, have but dark and confuſed apprehenſions of the cleareſt Truths in Religion, and muſt needs be much more at a loſs in what hath not that clearneſs and perſpicuity in it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. II</hi> Containing the Firſt Argument for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm.</head>
               <p>IF God doth own the Infant Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as his, then they ought to receive the Token of his ſo owning of them.</p>
               <p>But God doth own the Infant Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers as his, therefore they ought to receive the Token of his ſo owning of them, which is Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Now that God doth own the Infant Seed of Believers as his, I prove by theſe Four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:49497:11"/>1. If the Children of believing Parents are God's Children, their Sons and Daughters his Sons and Daughters, then God owns them.</p>
               <p>But the Children of believing Parents are God's Children, as is evident, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. <hi>Moreover, thou haſt taken thy ſons and thy daughters, whom thou haſt born unto me, and theſe haſt thou ſacrificed to be devoured: Thou haſt ſlain my children and delivered them to paſs through the fire for them.</hi> Theſe Idolatrous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were at this time much degenerated, but yet God had not given them a bill of Divorce, the Covenant was not diſſolved; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe Children born within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, were God's Children; and his, not merely by right of Creation, ſo all are his but by right of Covenant. There was little reaſon to believe the Parents were gracious; but however, being viſibly in covenant, God claims their Children as his own, as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Church and Family by a Covenant-Right.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Children of ſuch Parents, who are one or both of them Believers, are fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derally holy, then God owns them: but the former is true, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 7.14. therefore the latter, <hi>elſe were your children unclean; but now are they holy;</hi> the queſtion was, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when the Husband was a Believer, and the Wife an Unbeliever; or the Wife a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and the Husband a Pagan, they might yet continue to live with the Unbeliever:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49497:11"/>
To this the Apoſtle anſwers, they might, and gives this reaſon for it, <hi>viz. The unbeliever is ſanctified by the believer:</hi> Sanctified in Scripture uſually ſignifies either</p>
               <p n="1">1. Savingly ſanctified by Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Life infuſed into the Soul by the Spirit of God: or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. Setting Perſons apart for ſome holy Uſe or Office; as the Prieſts, Sabbath, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, and all the Utenſils thereof, and all the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were circumciſed; but the unbelieving Husband or Wiſe here were ſanctified in neither of theſe reſpects; therefore it's otherwiſe to be underſtood. <hi>Candidatus eſt fidei,</hi> ſay ſome, they are in a fair way of being won over to the Faith of Chriſt, or prepared by God for ſuch a uſe; ſo ſanctified ſignifies in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13.3. but the meaning is plainly this: That in regard that all the Faithful are Heirs of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee, in their generations, for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> Acts 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children:</hi> This Promiſe being to believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and their Infants, this Covenant the unbelieving Party cannot undo by his or her unbelief; hence their Children were holy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not merely legitimate; for ſo they would have been, had both the Parents been Pagans; to ſay as the Anabaptiſts do, they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49497:12"/>
are not Baſtards; <hi>is,</hi> ſaith Doctor <hi>Featly, a Baſtard Expoſition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor can it be meant, that they are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, juſtified and ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, (though if that were the ſenſe, it would not contradict but confirm the Doctrine of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm; for whoever hath Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Sanctification, the thing ſignified by Baptiſm, hath undoubtedly a right to the Sign and Seal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Then by holy muſt unavoidably be meant federally holy; <hi>i. e.</hi> within the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; as the Infants of the <hi>Jews</hi> were a holy Seed, and had a right to Circumciſion; ſo the Infants of Chriſtian Parents, though but one of them a Believer, had a federal holineſs and a right to be baptiſed, as if both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had been Believers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to little Children, then Chriſt owns them; but the Kingdom of Heaven doth belong to them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.13, 14. <hi>Then were there brought little children unto him, that he ſhould put his hands on them, and pray, and the diſciples rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them; But Jeſus ſaid, Suffer little children, and forbid them not to come unto me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Here Chriſt declares the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to them. By the Kingdom of Heaven is meant, either the Kingdom of Glory in the next World, or the Kingdom of Grace here; the latter is moſt probable, for ſo the Church is called, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.1, 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:49497:12"/>Now be it the one, or the other, its evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Chriſt owned them as his.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If the promiſe of the Covenant of Grace may be made to the Infant Seed of Believers, then Chriſt owneth them; but the promiſe of the Covenant of Grace is to the Infant Seed of Believers, as well as to their believing Parents; <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>I will eſtabliſh my covenant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations for an everlaſting covenant, to be a God unto thee, and thy ſeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee.</hi> And this Promiſe the Apoſtle recites as belonging to all Believers, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from all it's abundantly evident, that God doth own the Children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents as his: Therefore they ought to receive the Token of his ſo owning them, which is Baptiſm. The concluſion is unavoidably; If it be evident God owns a Perſon, that Perſon ought to be baptized; let him ſhew, that can, any reaſon why a Perſon ſo owned by God ſhould not be admitted into the Church by Baptiſm.</p>

               <p>IF the Infants of believing Parents ought to be received and admitted viſible Church-members, then ſuch Infants ought to be baptized; but the Infants of believing Parents ought to be received and admitted viſible Church-members, therefore they ought to be baptized.</p>
               <p>Now that ſuch Infants ought to be received into the viſible Church as viſible Church-members, I prove by theſe Arguments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 1. If by the merciful Gift and Appointment of God, not yet repealed, ſome Infants were once to be admitted Members of the viſible Church by vertue of the Covenant of Grace; then 'tis certain ſome Infants are ſtill to be ſo admitted: but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
               <p>Two things muſt here be done to ſhew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome Infants were once admitted Members of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That this Church-memberſhip was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repealed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some Infants were once ſo admitted by vertue of the Covenant of Grace. If any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny this, thus it is proved.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:49497:13"/>1. Infants were part of them that entered into covenant with the Lord God, and into his Oath, that he might take them to be a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar People to himſelf; <hi>Deut</hi> 29.10 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Ye ſtand this day all of you before the Lord your God; your captains of your tribes, your elders with your officers, with all the men of Iſrael.</hi> 11. <hi>Your little ones, your wives,</hi> &amp;c. 12. <hi>That thou ſhouldeſt enter into covenant with the Lord thy God, and into his oath which the Lord thy God maketh with thee this day.</hi> 13. <hi>That he eſtabliſh thee to day for a people unto himſelf; and that be may be unto thee a God, as he hath ſaid unto thee; and as he hath ſworn unto thy fathers, to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, to Iſaac, and to Jacob.</hi> 14. <hi>Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and this oath; but</hi> v. 15. <hi>with him that ſtandeth here with us this day before the Lord your God; but with him that is not here with us this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was not a new Covenant, but a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>v.</hi> 13. Into this Covenant their little ones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent were taken, and their little ones yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Infants were engaged to God by the Seal of the Covenant, which was Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.10. Circumciſion was not a meer politick Rite, as ſome Frantick Anabaptiſts have dreamed; but a Seal of the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. He received the Sign of Circumciſion as a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith: That is, Circumciſion was 1. a Sign; of what? of the Circumciſion of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49497:14"/>
heart by the Spirit of Chriſt; of the mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and killing the old man; of the ſad effects of Sin, both original and actual; and the way of recovery by Jeſus Chriſt. 2. It's a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith; that is, of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to the Believer, and received by faith; this is a Periphraſis of the Covenant of Grace, wherein righteouſneſs is promiſed, and made over to us in a way of believing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Infants were baptized to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Sea, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. And <hi>Stephen</hi> calls that Aſſembly, whereof they were Members, the Church in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>From hence it is evident beyond rational contradiction, that Infants were ſometimes taken into the viſible Church, as viſible Church-members, by vertue of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That this Infant Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip was never repealed.</p>
               <p>For if Infant Church-memberſhip be repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then that repeal muſt be either in Mercy or Judgment; but it was in neither, therefore it was never repealed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Infant Church-memberſhip was never repealed in Judgment; for God never revokes his Covenant to any People, till firſt that People break covenant with him, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants never did; therefore being once taken into covenant, 'tis certain God did never caſt them out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49497:14"/>Now it was a mercy to have Infants taken into covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. therefore if this Privilege be revok'd, it muſt be in Judgment; for as it is a great Mercy to be in the viſible Church, ſo 'tis a ſore Judgment to be out of it, to be caſt out of covenant.</p>
               <p>Now if Infant Church-memberſhip be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd, then the Infants of Believers under the Goſpel are in a much worſe condition than before Chriſt's Incarnation; certainly Chriſt did not come to make our Children miſerable, or to put them into a worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than they were in before; this would make Chriſt a Deſtroyer, who is the only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p>But certainly the Church is now in a much better condition, and her Privileges more ample and larger than they were before; ſhe hath loſt none of her Privileges, but gained many more, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. <hi>A more excellent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, better promiſes,</hi> Rom. 5.15, 16, 17. 'Tis certain Infants are not thrown out of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for that would much darken the Grace of God received in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor is Infant Church-memberſhip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd in Mercy; for it can be no Mercy to take away a Mercy, unleſs it means to give a greater Mercy in the room of it. Now let the Anabaptiſts ſhew what greater Mercy God hath given in the room of Infant Church-memberſhip; there is none: Therefore it was never repealed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49497:15"/>2. If that Covenant, by vertue whereof Infants were received into the viſible Church, was the Covenant of Grace, then 'tis certain it was never repeal'd.</p>
               <p>But that Covenant, by vertue whereof they were taken in, was the Covenant of Grace, therefore it was never repealed. But that Covenant, by vertue whereof they were taken into the viſible Church, was the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, as is moſt evident, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12. And ſo the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereof Circumciſion was a Seal, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7, 10. as the Apoſtle clearly proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. Now the Covenant of Grace is an everlaſting Covenant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.5. never was, nor ever will be repeal'd.</p>
               <p>Infant Church-memberſhip was no Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, neither was it any part of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law; if any ſay it was, let them ſhew what it typified under the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>If it were a Ceremony, then the Materials of the Church would be a Ceremony, and ſo the Church it ſelf, which would be very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurb to affirm.</p>
               <p>Neither was it part of the Moral Law, the Covenant of Works, whatever pains ſome of the oppoſite Perſuaſion have taken to prove it; for the Covenant of Works knows no Mercy; neither was it any part of the Judicial Law, for Church-memberſhip was not a piece of meer Policy; the Church is one thing, and the Commonwealth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49497:15"/>3. If there be no mention or record of the Repeal of Infant Church-memberſhip in any part of the New Teſtament, then it is moſt certain it was never repealed. But there is no record of any ſuch Repeal in any part of the New Teſtament, therefore it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repealed; if any ſay it was, let them ſhew where that Repeal is recorded. 'Tis true Circumciſion is ceaſed, becauſe it was a Ceremonial Type; but Infant Church-memberſhip being no Type or Ceremony, is not ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. If an Infant was Head of the viſible Church, then an Infant may be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the viſible Church. But an Infant was Head of the viſible Church; for who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that Jeſus Chriſt was Head of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church in his infancy? what honour was done to Chriſt in his infancy both by Angels and men? Hence it appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Nonage of Infants doth not make them uncapable of being Church-members, ſuppoſing God's will.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It ſhews, that it is the will of God that it ſhould be ſo; becauſe Chriſt paſſed through each Age to ſanctify it to us. Thus <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who lived about an hundred and fifty years after Chriſt, theſe are his words; <hi>Ideo per omnem venit etatem, &amp; infantibus Infans factus, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore Chriſt paſſed through every Age; for Infants he was made an Infant,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49497:16"/>
ſanctifying Infants; in little Children, being a little Child, ſanctifying them that have that very Age; here's clear proof from Antiquity of Infant Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 3. If Infants are federally holy, then they have a right to viſible Church-memberſhip; but Infants are federally holy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. as we have before ſhewed, and all ſound Interpreters tell us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 4. If Infants belong to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, then they belong to, and are Members of the viſible Church; but Infants do belong to the Kingdom of Heaven, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they belong to the viſible Church. Now ſome Infants do belong to the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi> By the Kingdom of Heaven here, muſt needs be meant, either the Kingdom of Grace, that is, the Goſpel-Church here; and then the meaning is, That the Goſpel Church, which is Chriſt's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on Earth, is made up of Infants, as well as adult perſons; and this is moſt likely to be the meaning: And ſo the thing in queſtion is clearly proved. Or elſe by the Kingdom of Heaven muſt be meant the Kingdom of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: That is, Children ſhall go to Heaven as well as grown Perſons. If ſo, ſtill the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is clear; if Infants are Members of the inviſible Church, then have they an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49497:16"/>
right to be Members of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>I grant a Perſon may be a Member of the inviſible Church, and yet no Member of the Viſible: Yet whoever is a Member of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Church, hath a right to viſible Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 5. If Infants are to be received in Chriſt's name, then they do undoubtedly belong to Chriſt's Church: But we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to receive Infants in Chriſt's name, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.36, 37. —<hi>He that receiveth one ſuch child in my name, receiveth me,</hi> &amp;c. Doth Chriſt take them into his Arms, and would he have them caſt out of his Church? Are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them in Chriſt's name, and do they not belong to Chriſt, nor to his Church? See <hi>Mark</hi> 10.13, 14, 15. Did Chriſt ſay all this to deceive us? certainly they are viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the viſible Church.</p>
               <p>Now if this be ſo, that ſome Infants were ſometimes admitted by God's own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that by vertue of the Covenant of Grace, viſible Church-members;</p>
               <p>Then undoubtedly they ought to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed; for Baptiſm is the only Rite that Jeſus Chriſt, who is Head of the Church, hath appointed for the admitting Members into his Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. All that are, or will be Chriſt's Diſciples, muſt be baptized in his name; if any know any other, let them ſhew it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49497:17"/>Now theſe two Arguments are abundantly ſufficient to prove the Infants right to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and it is needleſs to name any other: But yet becauſe ſome think a thing never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unleſs much be ſaid, and many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be brought; I ſhall therefore add ſome other Arguments; though I ſhall not dwell, nor enlarge on them, becauſe the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of theſe already mentioned, will give light to what remains.</p>

                  <p>If it hath been the conſtant cuſtom of the Church of Chriſt all along from the Apoſtles days to baptize Infants, none never denying It till ſome hundreds of years after; Then we may rationally conclude it was the practice of the Apoſtles to baptize Infants; but the former is true, therefore the latter.</p>
                  <p>Now that Infant Baptiſm was practiſed in the Primitive Times by the whole Univerſal Catholick Church, is evident.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> who had ſeen <hi>Policarpus,</hi> St. <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciple, and therefore lived very near the Apoſtles days, ſaith, <hi>Chriſt came to ſave and ſanctify all ſorts; Qui per eum venaſcuntur in Deum Infantes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All that are born to God, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, little ones, and Children</hi>— Born to God in the Eccleſiaſtical Phraſe, is but the ſame with Infant Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who lived about the Year of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption 200. moved ſome Scruples about Baptiſm, yet never denied the lawfulneſs of it: And in caſe that the Infant was in danger of death, did vehemently urge it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:49497:18"/>
                     <hi>Origen,</hi> who lived but little after him, ſpeaks again and again of the baptizing little Children, and ſaith, <hi>They received it by Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About 150 years after the death of St. <hi>John,</hi> there was one <hi>Fidus,</hi> who raiſed a doubt, Whether Infants might be baptized before they were eight days old, becauſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was not to be adminiſtred till then. Therefore <hi>Cyprian,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and 66 more, met to conſider this Caſe; and agreed, That Infants, <hi>recens nati, new born,</hi> might be baptized.</p>
                  <p>And thus we might cite Teſtimonies of <hi>Athanaſius, Chryſoſtom, Auguſtin,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it was the conſtant cuſtom of the Church to baptize Infants.</p>
                  <p>Which Cuſtom is ſtill continued in all the Churches of Chriſt all the world over; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all the Confeſſions of all the Proteſtant Churches: As <hi>Helvetia, Bohemia, Belgia, Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purg, Saxony, Wittenberg, Swedeland, France</hi> and <hi>Peidmont;</hi> and Hiſtories tell us 'tis pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed by the <hi>Ruſſians, Muſcovites,</hi> and all the Chriſtians in <hi>India, Syria, Cyprus, Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, Babylon, Palaſtine;</hi> and in every part of the world where there be any Chriſtian Churches planted.</p>

                  <head>ARGUMENT V.</head>
                  <p>The Fifth Argument for Infant Baptiſm is this:</p>
                  <p>If the Infants of believing Parents be in the Covenant of Grace, and the Promiſe of the Covenant do belong to them; then they may, and ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch Infants are in covenant, and the Promiſe of the Covenant doth belong to them, therefore they ought to be baptized.</p>
                  <p>That they are in covenant as well as their Parents, is undeniably evident from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of that Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was a Goſpel-covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7 as we have abundantly proved; and that the Promiſe of the Covenant is to them, is as evident, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you, and to your children;</hi> he means the Promiſe of God to <hi>Abraham;</hi> the Promiſe of Salvation by Chriſt, which was promiſed both to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> but to the <hi>Jews</hi> in the firſt place: Or ſuppoſe the Apoſtle hath reſpect unto <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34. or to <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not the caſe, for thoſe were all branches of the Covenant of Grace, and Explications of what was virtually contained in that firſt Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7.</p>

                  <p>The Sixth Argument for Infant Baptiſm is this:</p>
                  <p>If the Infants of one or both of the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Parents be federally holy, then they ought to be baptized; but the former is true, therefore the latter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. By the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of Children there, is not meant Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy; <hi>i.e.</hi> not Baſtards; ſo they would have been, if both the Parents had been Pagans.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it meant that they are ſavingly ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, but federally holy; that is, in the Covenant of Grace; and ſo had an undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able right to the Seal of the Covenant, which is Baptiſm.</p>

                  <head>ARGUMENT VII.</head>
                  <p>The Seventh Argument for Infant-Baptiſm is this:</p>
                  <p>If the Kingdom of Heaven belong to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, then they ought to be baptized; but the Kingdom of Heaven doth belong to ſome Infants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Suffer little children to come to me, for of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Suppoſe by the Kingdom of Heaven, is meant the Kingdom of Glory; little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they die ſhall go to Heaven; this ſenſe the Anabaptiſts cannot diſallow; for they ſay, all Children dying in infancy, are
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49497:19"/>
ſaved; the Infants of Turks, Pagans, Infidels, Papiſts, all ſorts: Then if they are Heirs of Glory, this muſt be by vertue of their intereſt in, and union with Chriſt; for there's no other way to Heaven, but by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life; no coming unto the father but by me:</hi> There's no Name under Heaven, whereby we can be ſaved, but only Jeſus Chriſt. Now if Infants have a right to Glory by vertue of their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with, and intereſt in Chriſt, then have they a right to be baptized; if they have a right to Heaven by Chriſt, then to receive the Badge of a Diſciple of Chriſt, which is Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; no perſon can have any plea for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that had not a right to be baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. <hi>The Lord added to the Church ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> This adding to the Church was by Baptiſm, <hi>v.</hi> 41. And let them ſhew that can, what right thoſe have to Heaven, that are not, or at leaſt have not a right to be ſo added to the viſible Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But by the Kingdom of Heaven is oft underſtood the Goſpel-Church: So <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1.13.47.8.20, 21.11.12 and in moſt of our Saviour's Parables: And this is moſt likely to be the meaning of this Text, <hi>of ſuch is the kingdom of heaven;</hi> that is, the Goſpel-Church takes Infants as well as adult perſons to be viſible Members in it: And then the conſequence is unavoidable, The viſible Church and Kingdom of Chriſt is made up of Infants as well as adult perſons; Baptiſm
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49497:20"/>
is the Door into the viſible Church, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muſt needs be baptized.</p>

                  <p>The Eighth Argument for Infant Baptiſm is this:</p>
                  <p>If Infants are to be received in the name of Chriſt, they are to be baptized in the name of Chriſt; but Infants are to be received in the name of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.36. <hi>Whoſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth one ſuch child in my name, receiveth me;</hi> to receive them in the name of Chriſt, is to receive them as the Diſciples of Chriſt; or, becauſe they belong to Chriſt: And if they ought to be thus received in Chriſt's Name, as the Friends and Diſciples of Chriſt, then they ought to receive the Badge of a Diſciple, to have the name of Chriſt named over them in Baptiſm.</p>

                  <p>If in our Saviour's time the Head and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of a Family was never baptized, but his whole Family was baptized with him, then Children and Infants ought to be baptized, for they are a conſiderable part of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
                  <p>But we never read of any Head or Maſter of a Family baptized, but his or their whole Houſhold were baptized with them; as is evident in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. and

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Shewing that the Doctrine of the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, in excluding Infants from Baptiſm, and ſhutting them out of the viſible Church, makes all Infants to be of the viſible Kingdom of Satan, and ſo leaves us no well-grounded hope of the ſalvation of any dying in infancy; and is therefore to be juſtly abhorred as falſe Doctrine.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argum.</hi> 1. THat Doctrine that makes all Infants to be of the viſible Kingdom of the Devil, is falſe Doctrine.</p>
               <p>But to deny Infants Baptiſm, is to deny them to be of the viſible Church of Chriſt; and if they are not viſibly in the Church of Chriſt, they are viſibly out of it, and of the Kingdom of the Devil; there is no third or middle ſtate on Earth between the viſible Kingdom of Chriſt, which is his Church, and the Kingdom of the Devil; and all men and women, and Infants too, are viſible Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the one or the other. If any know of any middle ſtate, let them ſhow it; Chriſt and Satan ſhare the whole world between them; and if Infants are not viſibly in the Kingdom of Chriſt, they are viſibly in the Kingdom of the Devil; the conſequence is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49497:21"/>
unavoidable: what barbarous uſage is this to our poor Infants! Chriſt commands us to bring them to him, and tells us, <hi>of ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> and the Anabaptiſts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſely thruſt them away from Chriſt, and from the Church of Chriſt, ſet them among Pagans and Infidels, who are of the Viſible Kingdom of the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Argument</hi> 2. That Doctrine that leaves us no well-grounded hope of the Salvation of any Infants dying in Infancy, is certainly falſe Doctrine: But the Anabaptiſts in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Infant Baptiſm to the Seed of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, leave us no well-grounded hope of the Salvation of any ſuch dying in Infancy.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay, That the Anabaptiſts do po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively aſſert the Damnation of all Infants dying in Infancy, for they do the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, aſſert the certain Salvation of all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, even Turks, Pagans, and Jews.</p>
               <p>But I ſay, they leave us no well-grounded hope of the Salvation of any ſuch; for if Infants ought not to be Baptized, then are they out of the Viſible Church; all who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Viſible Church, have a right to Baptiſm; therefore in denying Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, they throw them out of the Viſible Church: And let him ſhew, that can tell how, what grounds there are to hope, or expect, the Salvation of any out of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:49497:22"/>I grant a perſon may want the engaging Sign, and yet have a right to Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, yea, to Salvation; ſo an Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant dying unbaptized is ſaved; though it have not the Sign, yet it had a right to it.</p>
               <p>Now without a promiſe we can neither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nor hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4, 13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.5, 23, 27. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19.</p>
               <p>Again, ſuch as God intends to ſave, he adds to the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.47. 'tis the Viſible Church there ſpoken of; and ſuch who are not ſo added, or have not a right to be ſo added, let them ſhew, that can, what ground there is to hope for their Salvation. And thus all well-grounded hope of the Salvation of any Infant dying in Infancy, is taken away by the Anabaptiſts.</p>
               <p>For thus they argue from <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19. None but thoſe who are Taught, are Diſciples; Infants cannot be Taught, therefore are not Diſciples; and that this is the only way to make Church-members; and may we not on the ſame ground ſay, they cannot be ſaved becauſe they cannot believe? <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that believes not, ſhall be damned.</hi> I appeal to all unbiaſſed perſons, whether there is not on their own bottom, the ſame reaſon to ſay, they are uncapable of Salvation, as of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; but there is great reaſon to believe and hope for the Salvation of ſome Infants; for as we have ſhewed they are in the Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. they are to be joined in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49497:22"/>
ſtanding Church-ordinances, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.16. From all which, and much more might be ſaid, it's evident ſome Infants are Saved, though the Anabaptiſts by their erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrine take away all well-grounded hope of the Salvation of any Infants dying in Infancy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. IF it be God's Will Infants ſhould be baptized, Why is there no Command for it, as there was for their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The general Command includes Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, therefore there was no need of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular mentioning of them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The promiſe is as expreſs to Children, as to Parents, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>The promiſe is to you and to your Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It had been abſurd to have given a new Command for Children, ſeeing they were in the actual poſſeſſion of their Priviledg, and had been ſo ever ſince <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, none had ever queſtioned their right and title to the Covenant. There was no Anabaptiſts in the Apoſtles days, nor of many hundred years after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:49497:23"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. But that Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. was a Covenant of Works.</p>
               <p>Indeed ſome weak Anabaptiſts have ſaid ſo.</p>
               <p>But it was not a Covenant of Works, for that knows no Mercy to fallen Sinners; but there is Mercy in that Covenant, that God will be a God to his People, and to their Seed: It was a Covenant of Grace, and that the Apoſtle proves, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. as hath been abundantly proved before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Though Infants were then Church-members, it doth not follow they are ſo now; the Church is now built on another foundation. Thus a Preacher among the Anabaptiſts lately urged to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. If this be true, then the Church of Chriſt under the Old Teſtament, had a different foundation from the Church now under the New Teſtament: The Foundation is now Jeſus Chriſt; but what was it then? What will not Proud and Ignorant men ſay to maintain an Errour!</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Foundation of the Church then was Chriſt, and the Covenant of Grace was the ſame then as now; only then was but the dawning of the day, the darker appearances of the Son of Righteouſneſs; but now the Sun ſhines in his full ſtrength. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:49497:23"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. But though Infants were then Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church-members, and had a right to the Sign of the Covenant, God has now caſt off the Jews, and ſo Infant Church-memberſhip is ceaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Apoſtle aſſures us, That Church-memberſhip, and all other Priviledges, are as ſure and ample now to the Believing Gentiles, as they were before to the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. <hi>And if ſome of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild Olive tree, wert grafted in amongſt them, and with them partakeſt of the root and fatneſs of the Olive tree.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 5. But Circumciſion is aboliſhed, therefore Infant Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Circumciſion and Infant Church-memberſhip, were two things; Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was but the Rite of admitting Viſible Members; the Rite is changed, but not Church-memberſhip; Baptiſm comes in the room of Circumciſion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 6. Infants are not capable of the ends of Baptiſm, for it's an engaging Sign, and ſignifies the waſhing away ſin, both guilt and ſtain; Infants being uncapable of the uſe of Reaſon, muſt be ſo of Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Baptiſm hath more ends than one:</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:49497:24"/>1. It's Chriſt's liſting Sign for admitting Soldiers into his Service, or Diſciples into his School, or Subjects into his Kingdom; and this is what Infants are capable of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It's an engaging Sign, wherein they are by Parents, or other, engaged to God, and this they are capable of alſo.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The inward Grace thereby ſignified, as Pardon, Juſtification, Sanctification, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, theſe Infants are capable of, otherwiſe they could not be Saved, and if theſe are not, the Sacrament may be without them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A leaſe for years, with a Covenant to a Child that underſtands it not, may be of great uſe: So Baptiſm, though at preſent the Child underſtands nothing of it, yet it may be, and to converted Believers is of great uſe afterwards, and Godly Parents at preſent have the comfort: For God herein hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the comfort of Parents.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A Perſon may be Baptized that is not capable of all the ends of Baptiſm; one end of Baptiſm is to waſh away Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this was an end Jeſus Chriſt was not capable of, and yet he was Baptized.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Thoſe Infants Chriſt took into his Arms and Bleſſed, and thoſe Circumciſed at Eight days old, knew no more of the benefits they received, than ours do now; they were no more capable of Faith and Repentance, than ours are; and yet they entered into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49497:24"/>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 7. But we have no expreſs Command in the New Teſtament to Baptize Infants.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I have ſhewn there needed none; their Priviledg had been ſetled many Ages before, and never queſtioned by any, nor repealed by Chriſt; their former Right continuing firm, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. the general Command includes them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 8. But if they had a Right, we might expect to find ſome Examples of their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis manifeſt that Believers houſholds were Baptized with them, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15, 16, 33. and if no Infants are mentioned, ſo neither any Children of Believing Parents Baptized at Age; and we have much more reaſon to believe there were Infants in all, or ſome of thoſe Families, than any have to think there was none.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 9. The Baptiſm of Believers is come in the room of Infant Church-memberſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> it hath been abundantly proved, that Infant Church-memberſhip was no Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or Type; if any ſay it was, let them prove it: Therefore as it was never aboliſhed, nor Infants never unchurched, nothing can be ſaid to come in the room of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:49497:25"/>2. That Baptizing Adult Believers ſhould exclude Infants, is as if the receiving and Circumciſing the Gentile Proſelytes into the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> had been a means to have unchurched their Infants, which for any to affirm, would be extremely ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 10. How can Infants covenant with God, or be engaged by this Sign? or where doth God engage Parents to promiſe any thing for their Children?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Parents may, and ought to covenant for their Children, plainly appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1: From Nature, <hi>Lex naturae eſt, Lex Dei;</hi> may not Parents take a Leaſe for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? who buyeth Lands, and not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and Heirs? are not Children bound by thoſe Ties? and then much more to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From Scripture, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. here you may ſee the Parents Covenant, not only for their Children then preſent, but unborn, and they were by Circumciſion to enter them into Covenant, ſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. and hath the Goſpel taken away the Parent's Right in his Child?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> We promiſe what we cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49497:25"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We promiſe to educate this Child for God, to inſtruct him in Goſpel truths; leaving the renovation and ſanctification of the Heart to God, who works when, on whom, and by what means he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p>May not a man covenant for himſelf and Heirs to pay a yearly Rent? and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in caſe it be not paid, but forfeiture of his Leaſe, and that from the perſon that ſhould have paid it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 11. If Infants muſt be baptized, why may they not as well receive the Lord's Supper?</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there were that Scripture-proof to adminiſter the Lord's Supper to Infants, as there is for baptizing them, we would do it, when they have as clearly proved the one, as we have the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Baptiſm is the initiating Seal of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Church, which Infants being Diſciples of Chriſt, are capable of; the Lord's Supper is the confirming Seal to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred only to grown Chriſtians; therefore Infants have a right to the one, but not to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 12. If Infants ought to be baptized, why is it left ſo dark in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:49497:26"/>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It's not dark, which admits of ſuch clear proof as you ſee this doth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all Chriſt's Diſciples ought to be baptized, is not dark, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. Infants are Diſciples; therefore 'tis plain they ought to be baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 13. The baptizing perſons before they know, occaſions much groſs Ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Chriſt is the occaſion of the ruin and damnation of thouſands, for he was ſet for the fall, as well as the riſing of many in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Luke 2.3, 4. but had it been better the world had had no Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Goſpel is the ſavour of death to many; had it been better then we had had no Goſpel? What will not the wicked take hurt by?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them ſhew what in Baptiſm tends to breed Ignorance; Is the entring a Boy's name in the School the way to breed him in ignorance? if a Child's name be put into a Leaſe, is this like to hurt him? what harm is it to be in Chriſt's Family from our youth?</p>
               <p>Nay, the contrary is the way to breed Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and Prophaneneſs; for how many ſad Examples have we among the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, who refuſing to dedicate their Infants to Chriſt, they are ignorantly and bruitiſhly brought up, live and die like Pagans.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:49497:26"/>Thus it hath been proved abundantly, that Infant Baptiſm is God's Ordinance; that the Infant Seed of Believers were once taken into the Church as viſible Church-members; that Chriſt owns them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be baptized; that it's a falſe and dangerous Doctrine to deny them Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Enough hath been ſaid for the ſatisfaction of thoſe who are ſeeking Truth; ſuch who wilfully ſhut their Eyes, it's in vain to ſet light before them, becauſe <hi>ſeeing they ſee, but do not underſtand; and hearing they hear, but do not perceive.</hi>
               </p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Shewing that Waſhing, Pouring, or otherwiſe applying Water to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, is the right way of Baptizing; and not Dipping, as now uſed by the Anabaptiſts.</head>
               <p>WHEN the Anabaptiſts ſpeak of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, as 'tis now done generally by all the Reformed Churches, they do it with much ſcorn and contempt, and can ſcarcely do it in any other terms, than Sprinkling; They ſay we may as well ſprinkle a Lamb, nay a Dog, or a Cat, as an Infant; what Chriſtian Ear doth not abhor ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage!</p>
               <p>Our Proteſtant Divines uſually define Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm thus; it is a waſhing in, or of water, or an applying water to the Baptized: Or by ſprinkling the Baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. None, ſay the Anabaptiſts, are rightly baptized, but ſuch as are dipped or plunged over head in the water.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is a plain breach of the Sixth Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> is no Ordinance of God, but a moſt heinous Sin; but dipping over-head in cold water
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:49497:27"/>
in theſe cold Countreys, is a plain breach of the Sixth Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> which forbids the taking away of our own Life, or the Life of our Neighbour unjuſtly, or any thing that tends thereunto: Now dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in cold water tends to the taking away Life, as many have found by experience, who have contracted ſuch Diſtempers in dipping as have haſtened their Deaths: Therefore the ſo doing is a great Sin.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, though it be derived from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to dip or plunge, yet it's taken for any kind of waſhing or cleanſing, where there is no dipping, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.4. and it ſometimes ſignifies ſprinkling, yea to baptize by ſprinkling, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. <hi>They were all baptized unto Moſes by the cloud in the ſea;</hi> all the world knows a Cloud doth but ſprinkle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.10. divers Waſhings or Baptiſms, 'tis evident the Apoſtle means the ſprinkling of Blood, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.20, 21. and the Law of cleanſing the Leper, <hi>Lev.</hi> 14.4, to 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Waſhing, ſprinkling, or pouring water upon the Body , aptly repreſents the thing ſignified, and the Sign need not exceed the thing ſignified. The waſhing away Sin by the Blood of Chriſt is the thing ſignified in Baptiſm, and this the Holy Ghoſt delights to expreſs by waſhing, ſprinkling, or pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out water, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25. <hi>Zec.</hi> 12.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. and 12.24.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:49497:28"/>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But did not the Apoſtles baptize by dipping? did not <hi>Philip</hi> and the Eunuch go down into the water?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It was never yet proved that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were then dipped. As for <hi>Philip</hi>'s Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. the particular manner is not expreſt, neither can it be collected; neither doth the <hi>Greek</hi> Prepoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, neceſſarily ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify going into, but rather unto the water, as it's frequently rendered in other places, <hi>Matt.</hi> 15.24. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>unto the loſt ſheep:</hi> So in all theſe and many other places, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.10. <hi>John</hi> 6.9.13.1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. So that into, and out of the water, ſeems to be no more than unto, and from the water. Travellers tell us it was in the Village <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſara,</hi> where was a very ſmall Fountain, not ſufficient to dip in.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Multitude <hi>John</hi> and the Apoſtles baptized, it's highly probable it was never done by dipping, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. nay almoſt impoſſible it ſhould, for theſe two Reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The extream ſcarcity of water; water was extream ſcarce in thoſe hot Countreys, that there was not water to dip ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes in; <hi>Enon,</hi> where <hi>John</hi> was baptizing, there was not much water; <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is but <hi>Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> an Eye, a very little Fountain; none in probability to dip a multitude in. And ſo likewiſe <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. when Three thouſand
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49497:28"/>
perſons were baptized; St. <hi>Peter</hi> began to preach about the third Hour of the day, which was about Nine of the Clock; theſe Three thouſand were converted by this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and were all baptized the ſame day; it muſt needs be for on before they began to baptize, and there was no River near <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> but the Brook <hi>Cedron,</hi> which Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers tell us, was in Summer but a dry Ditch, therefore 'tis highly improbable that either <hi>John</hi> or the Apoſtles baptized by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the multitude of people that were baptized: We do not find <hi>John</hi> had any to help him to baptize, and is it likely he could dip ſuch multitudes? and is it to be imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Three thouſand perſons could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; prepared for, and be baptized, by dipping, in a few hours.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If they were dipped, it muſt be either naked, or in their Cloaths.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It's very unlikely they were dipped na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, for this would be very immodeſt for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to baptize Women and Maids naked; a means to ſtir up luſt and unclean Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſo a breach of the Seventh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> which forbids all unchaſt thoughts, words and actions; now to look on a Woman's nakedneſs is an unchaſt action, expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.17. and for this reaſon God
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49497:29"/>
would not have the Prieſt go up to the Altar by ſteps, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.42.</p>
               <p>Beſides, there was a mixt multitude of men and women baptized together; and if they were naked, they muſt ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's nakedneſs, which would have been an horrible reproach to Religion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If they were dipped in their Cloaths, it was either in all their Cloaths, or ſome provided for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If in all their Cloaths, is it at all likely that they ſhould go up and down in the wet Cloaths; and that would not be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, to ſpeak properly, but ſoaking.</p>
               <p>Or was it in ſome Cloaths only? as ſome light Under garment, or ſomething provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the purpoſe? there would be much immodeſty in it, and it would be little better than naked: Beſides, Where muſt this mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude have Cloaths for the purpoſe? muſt they go home and fetch them, and provide them? for they deſigned no ſuch thing when they came together, nay, many of them lived at a very great diſtance.</p>
               <p>Let mens Imaginations work which way ſoever, it will appear extreamly unlikely that there was any dipping in their bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing; that which is moſt probable, is, That <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and the Apoſtle, went unto the water, or it may be, into it, with their Feet, wearing nothing but Sandals, and ſo with their Hands did take up water and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49497:29"/>
ſprinkle, or pour on the perſons to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>And how much leſs probability is there, that in the baptizing of Houſholds, as the Jailor's in the night, <hi>Lydia, Cornelius,</hi> and others, that there was any dipping?</p>
               <p n="4">4. If it were clearly demonſtrated, which never was yet done, that perſons were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by dipping; yet would it be proved but occaſional in thoſe hot Countreys.</p>
               <p>There is no Precept or Command for it; and therefore it would be no way binding to us, no more than our Lord's adminiſtring his Laſt Supper in an Inn, and in an upper Room, in the Evening, to none but men and Miniſters, doth oblige us to do ſo; Chriſt having no-where appointed the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Water in Baptiſm, no more than the quantity of Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper. 'Tis neither the quantity of Water in the one, nor of Bread and Wine in the other, that gives efficacy to the Ordinance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if it be God's way, we muſt do it, whatever be ſaid againſt it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is but to beg the queſtion; moreover, we have proved it is not God's way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But ſay they, The ſignificancy is not ſufficiently expreſt, unleſs we are dipped in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49497:30"/>
the water, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. <hi>We are buried with him by baptiſm into death;</hi> which place the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts produce to prove Baptiſm by dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, as alſo the neceſſity of it; whereas nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can be hence proved.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle's deſign there, is to engage Chriſtians to forſake and put off Sin, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, v. 1. the argument he uſes to enforce this is, <hi>That in their baptiſm they were baptized into Chriſt, into the likeneſs of his death, and were ſo buried with him in baptiſm,</hi> v. 3, 4. ſo that as Chriſt dyed for ſin, by their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-engagement they were to dye to ſin, and riſe to newneſs of life: So that what the Apoſtle here argues from, is our Baptiſmal Covenanting with God, which doth not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſuppoſe Dipping.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But the Apoſtle alludes to the Cuſtom of going under the Water.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> How doth that appear? they muſt prove the Cuſtom, before they can prove this is an alluſion to the Cuſtom; ſo that this Text doth not prove the Cuſtom; and the Apoſtle's diſcourſe may be well underſtood without it: And if the Cuſtom be owned, yet the neceſſity of Dipping doth not thence follow.</p>
               <p>Other Scriptures allude to Sprinkling; we may as well thence infer, the abſolute neceſſity of the Cuſtom of Sprinkling, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.2. where it's ſaid, That the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:49497:30"/>
of <hi>Iſrael were all baptized unto Moſes in the cloud, and in the ſea,</hi> or as the words may be read together, <hi>with Moſes by the cloud in the ſea,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſometimes being ſo rendered, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, by the Spirit; ſo they were Baptized by Sprinkling (for a Cloud doth but ſprinkle); <hi>by the cloud,</hi> i. e. by Chriſt who was this Cloud, or elſe appeared in this Cloud, as is evident from <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.21, 22. this was at leaſt a figure and type of Baptiſm; and in ſeveral other Texts.</p>
               <div type="application">
                  <head>APPLICATION.</head>
                  <p>IS this ſo, That that Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> whereof Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion then was, and Baptiſm now is the Seal, is a Covenant which comprehends all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and all their Children?</p>
                  <p>Here is then a Fourfould uſe to be made of it:
<list>
                        <item>1. Of Information.</item>
                        <item>2. Examination.</item>
                        <item>3. Exhortation.</item>
                        <item>4. Conſolation.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Uſe ſhall be of Information in three things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This informs us of the infinite Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention and Goodneſs of God, that when the firſt Covenant of Works was violated, and the way to Heaven for ever barr'd up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Sinner, there being no poſſibility
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49497:31"/>
of ever getting to Heaven that way, it ſhould pleaſe the Lord to make a new Covenant, a Covenant of Grace, a new and living way to the Father: O what love and grace is this! <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. Now the infinite Grace of God in this ſecond Covenant, appears in theſe two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That herein God doth not ſtand on the old terms, <hi>do this and live;</hi> the Law required perfect perſonal Obedience; but now in this new Covenant God is pleaſed to accept of the Obedience and Righteouſneſs of another in our ſtead, even Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. <hi>He hath made him to be ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That God doth not only command few and eaſie things, as the condition of this New Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. but doth freely promiſe his holy Spirit to work theſe and all other Covenant-qualifications in us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This informs us of the infinite Mercy of God to us, that we live under the New Covenant, that God ſhould offer Chriſt and Salvation in a Covenant-way to us: O let us admire Grace! What are we that God ſhould Reveal himſelf to us, and not to the world! <hi>Matt.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, — that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:49497:31"/>
prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes: even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. This informs us what a fearful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation will befall thoſe who refuſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of Chriſt and Salvation on Covenant-terms, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 29. <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes law, dyed without mercy; of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the ſpirit of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Uſe of Examination, Is there a Covenant of Grace? Then examine your ſelves what intereſt you have in it; if you are in this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, you are a happy People; then every Promiſe in the Covenant belongs to you; but if you are out of this Covenant, your caſe is dreadful.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> How may I know whether I am in Covenant or no?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Have you done all thoſe things that are neceſſary to an external viſible Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting with Jeſus Chriſt? And theſe are</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Knowledg in, and acquaintance with the Goſpel-covenant; you can never Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Jeſus Chriſt, until you know the terms, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:49497:32"/>2. Have you entered your ſelves into this Covenant by Baptiſm? Have you put your hand to the plow, and owned Chriſt in that Seal of the Covenant?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do you live in an awful diſcharge of ſuch external and viſible Duties the Covenant requires, ſuch as Prayer, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18. Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Lord's day, Attendance on God in all Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Have you thoſe internal Graces, and do you perform thoſe internal inviſible Duties the Covenant requires? If you have, then you are certainly in Covenant, and all the Promiſes in the Covenant belong to you, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.15. <hi>To this man will I look, which is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, and trembles at my word.</hi> John 3.16. Matt. 11.28. <hi>Come to me you that labour and are heavy laden.</hi> Have you that new heart, promiſed <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. thoſe Graces mentioned <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5, 6. if you have theſe in truth, then are you in Covenant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Uſe of Exhortation, Is there a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace in which Believers and their Chidren are comprehended? then be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To bleſs and admire Free-grace that hath given you ſuch a Covenant; O what Mercy is this to us and our Children! that God will call our Children his Children; and our Sons and Daughters, his Sons and Daughters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:49497:32"/>2. Live and act as thoſe who are in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Only let your converſation be as becomes the Goſpel of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Secure your intereſt in it, and be often calling your ſelves to an account whether or no you have an intereſt in it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Learn to live upon this Covenant; fetch all your Comforts and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from it in all diſtreſſes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as you have, for he hath ſaid, I will not leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Are your Children in Covenant? then dedicate them to Chriſt in the Covenant, has God taken them in? <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.29. then do not you caſt them out, but do as <hi>Hannah</hi> did, firſt beg a Child from the Lord, and Vow a Vow to dedicate this Child to God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.10, 11. God calls them his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 21. And will you dare to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from God his own? How will you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it at his Tribunal another day?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. O Pray down Covenant-mercy on your Children as <hi>Hannah</hi> did, and as <hi>Monica, Auſtin</hi>'s Mother did: O Pray hard for your Children.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Uſe of Conſolation; is there a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-grace which comprehends all Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and all their Actions; O Soul! art thou in this Covenant? then for thy eternal Comfort be it ſpoken,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Thou ſhalt never want any Temporal good thing, there is Food and and Raiment,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:49497:33"/>
Proviſion and Protection in the Covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Be content with ſuch things as you have, for he hath ſaid, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou ſhalt never finally loſe thy Grace, or be caſt out of Covenant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.18. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>And I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good, but I will put my fear into their hearts, that they may not depart from me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Heaven and eternal Glory is thine as ſure by this Covenant, as if thou waſt alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>This is the promiſe he hath promiſed us, eternal life.</hi>
