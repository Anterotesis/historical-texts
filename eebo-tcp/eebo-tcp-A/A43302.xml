         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <date>JULY 1. 1691.</date> By Virtue of a Patent granted by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. for a New Invention of LAMPS with Convex Glaſſes.</head>
            <p>THE PROPRIETORS in the ſaid Patent have hitherto undertaken to Light the City of <hi>London</hi> and Suburbs, on the Terms following:</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>I.</hi> Each Houſe to pay Five Shillings at ſetting up the Lamps, as a Fine for Five Years (being inſtead of the Charge of providing their own Lanthorn), and the Undertakers to keep the ſaid Lamps in repair for Five Years at their own proper Coſts and Charges.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>II.</hi> Each Houſe to pay one Half-penny for every Dark Night the Lamps ſhall be Lighted, and the Undertakers to keep them burning from Six to Twelve at Night.</item>
            </list>
            <p>NOW, the ſaid PROPRIETORS having conſidered the taking of Five Shillings Fine in hand for Five Years, doth not ſo well anſwer their Intentions for the Good of the Inhabitants, becauſe many may die, and many others may have occaſion to remove, before the Five Years are expired, and ſo loſe the benefit of their Fines.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, for the greater Eaſe and Accommodation of the Inhabitants, the ſaid PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PRIETORS do Propoſe and Undertake henceforward to Light the Inhabitants of <hi>London, Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Surrey,</hi> from <hi>Michaelmas</hi> to <hi>Lady-day,</hi> every Dark Night, on the Terms following:</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That upon ſetting up and lighting every Lamp, the Inhabitants ſhall each of them pay Six-pence as a Fine, and Two Shillings and Six-pence Rent, for Lighting the firſt Quarter, end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; and at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> ſhall pay Six-pence for a Fine, and Two Shillings and Six-pence Rent, for Lighting the ſecond Quarter, ending at <hi>Lady day,</hi> (which is a Half-penny <hi>per</hi> Night for Lighting every Dark Night, and one Shilling Fine for that Year.)</item>
               <item>II. That for every Year of the four following Years, the Inhabitants are to pay Six-pence Fine at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> upon the firſt Lighting, with Two Shillings and Six-pence for the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Rent due at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> following; and at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> other Six-pence Fine, with Two Shillings and Six-pence for the ſecond Quarters Rent, due at <hi>Lady day.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>III. The PROPRIETORS do not require any Perſon to take Leaſes of them, but only to ſubſcribe their Names to their Propoſals.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> In Squares, and places where the Houſes are very large, there the PROPRIETORS are to be at liberty to agree with the Inhabitants upon reaſonable Terms, proportionable to their Houſes.</p>
            <list>
               <head>Reaſons offered to all Gentlemen and Others, for the Encouragement of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful Invention.</head>
               <item>I. IF the Inhabitants were to keep the Streets Light from Six to Twelve, with Candles, it would coſt each Houſe One Penny a Night, which is performed by the Undertakers for a Half-penny.</item>
               <item>II. Light is moſt wanting after Nine a Clock at Night, all Shops then are uſually ſhut up, and Candles in Lanthorns commonly are burnt out; and for want of a more durable Light, many abuſes are committed.</item>
               <item>III. Such Shops as keep open late, have moſt reaſon to comply, and pay to theſe Lights, it accommodating Trade much better than before.</item>
               <item>IV. All ſuch as do agree with the Undertakers, are freed from all trouble which they had before by Officers; and ſuch as do not, muſt put out their own Lanthorns, and be liable to the Officers as before.</item>
            </list>
            <p>All Perſons that deſire, may be accommodated with the aforeſaid Lights by the PATENTEES at <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners-Hall</hi> within <hi>Ludgate,</hi> every <hi>Tueſday</hi> and <hi>Friday</hi> at Six a Clock in the Afternoon, and by Mr. <hi>John Stubbs</hi> their Clerk, at the <hi>Inſurance-Office,</hi> on the <hi>Weſt-ſide</hi> of the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> any day at Exchange time.</p>
