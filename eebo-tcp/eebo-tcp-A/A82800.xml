            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

MAIESTIES
Anſwer and Propoſitions
to the Lords and Commons in
PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F His Maieſty had not given up all the faculties
of His ſoule to an earneſt endeavour of a peace,
and reconciliation with His people; Or if He
would ſuffer himſelfe by any provocation to be
drawne to a ſharpneſſe of language at a time
when there ſéemes ſomewhat like an overture
of Accomodation; He could not but reſent the heavy charges
upon Him in the preamble of theſe Propoſitions; And would
not ſuffer himſelfe to be reproached with protecting of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
by force from Iuſtice (His Maieſties deſire having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
béen, that all men ſhould be tryed by the knowne Laws,
and having béen refuſed it) with raiſing an Army againſt His
Parliament; And to be told that Armes have béen taken up
againſt Him for defence of Religion, Laws, Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171286:6"/>
of Parliament, &amp; for ſitting of the Parliament in ſafety,
with many other particulars in that preamble, ſo often and ſo
fully anſwered by His Maieſty, without remembring the
World of the time and circumſtances of raiſing theſe Armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, when His Maieſty was ſo farre from being in a
condition to invade other mens Rights, that He was not able
to maintaine and defend His owne from violence; And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
telling His good Subiects, that their Religion (the true
Proteſtant Religion, in which His Maieſty was borne, hath
faithfully lived, and to which He will die a willing ſacrifice)
Their Lawes, Liberties, Priviledges, and ſafety of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were ſo amply ſetled, and eſtabliſhed, or offered to be ſo by
His Maieſty, before any Army was raiſed againſt him,
and long before any raiſed by him for his defence; That if
nothing had béen deſired, but that peace and protection which
His Subiects and their Anceſtors had in the beſt times enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under His Maieſty, or His Royall Predeceſſors, this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding,
and diſtance betwéene His Maieſty and His
People, and this generall miſery and diſtraction upon the
face of the whole Kingdome had not now béene the diſcourſe
of Chriſtendome. But His Maieſty will forbeare any expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of bitterneſſe, or of a ſence of His owne ſufferings, that
if it be poſſible the memory thereof may be loſt to the World;
And therefore, though many of the Propoſitions preſented to
His Maieſty by both Houſes appeare to Him very derogatory
from and deſtructive to His Iuſt Power and Prerogative,
and no way beneficiall to His Subiects, few of them being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
due to them by the Laws eſtabliſhed (and how un-Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
it is by Armes to require new Laws, all the world
may Iudge) yet becauſe theſe may be waved or mollified, and
many that are now darke or doubtfull in them cleared and
explained upon debate) his Maieſty is pleaſed (ſuch is his ſence
of the miſeries this Kingdom ſuffers by this unnaturall War,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171286:6"/>
and His earneſt deſire to remove them by a happy peace) that
a ſpeedy Time and Place be agréed upon for the méeting of
ſuch perſons as His Maieſty, and both Houſes ſhall appoint to
diſcuſſe theſe Propoſitions, and ſuch others here following as
His Maieſty doth propoſe to them.</p>
            <p>1. That His Maieſties owne Revenue, Magazines,
Townes, Forts, and Ships, which have béene taken or kept
from Him by force, be forthwith reſtored unto Him.</p>
            <p>2. That whatſoever hath béen done or publiſhed, contrary
to the knowne Lawes of the Land, and derogatory to His
Maieſties legall and knowne Power and Rights, be renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
and recalled, that no ſéed may remaine for the like to ſpring
out of for the future.</p>
            <p>3. That whatſoever illegall power hath beene claimed,
and exerciſed by or over his Subiects, as impriſoning their
perſons without Law, ſtopping their <hi>Habeas Corpuſſes;</hi> And
impoſing upon their Eſtates, without Act of Parliament, &amp;c.
either by both or either Houſe, or any Committée by both or
either, or by any perſons appointed by any of them be diſclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
and all ſuch perſons ſo committed, forthwith diſcharged.</p>
            <p>4. That as His Maieſty will readily conſent (having done
ſo heretofore) to the execution of all Lawes already made,
and to any good Acts to be made for the ſuppreſſing of Popery,
and for the firme ſetling of the Proteſtant Religion now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Law; So he deſires that a good Bill may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for the better preſerving of the Book of Common-Prayer
from the ſcorne and violence of Browniſts, Anabaptiſts, and
other Sectaries, with ſuch clauſes for the eaſe of tender con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,
as his Maieſty hath formerly offered:</p>
            <p>5. That all ſuch perſons as upon the Treaty ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
out of the generall pardon, ſhall be tryed <hi>per Pares</hi>
according to the uſuall courſe and knowne Law of the Land,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171286:7"/>
and that it be left to that either to acquit or condemne them.</p>
            <p>6. And to the intent this Treaty may not ſuffer interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by any intervening Accidents, That a ceſſation of Armes,
and frée Trade for all his Maieſties Subiects may be firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed
upon.</p>
            <p>This offer and deſire of his Maieſty he hopes will be ſo
chéerefully entertained, That a ſpéedy and bleſſed peace may
be accompliſhed: if it ſhall be reiected, or by inſiſting upon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
circumſtances, be made impoſſible, which he hopes
(God in his mercy to this Nation will not ſuffer) The guilt
of the blood which will be ſhed and the deſolation, which muſt
follow will lie upon the heads of the refuſers; however, his
Maieſtie is reſolved through what accidents ſoever he ſhall
be compelled to recover his rights, and with what proſperous
ſucceſſes ſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſſe him, That by his
earneſt conſtant endeavours to Propagate and promote the
true proteſtant Religion, And by his governing according to
the known Lawes of the Land, and upholding the Iuſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of Parliament, according to his frequent Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
made before Almighty God, which be will alwaies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably
obſerve, The World ſhall ſée that he hath undergone
all theſe difficulties and hazzards for the defence and mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of theſe, The zealous preſervation of which his Maieſty
well knowes is the onely foundation and meanes for the true
happineſſe of him and his People.</p>
