            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>George Whitehead's <hi>PROTESTATION against</hi> Francis Bugg's <hi>PERSECUTION and Abuse of the People call'd</hi> Quakers, <hi>his</hi> (Quondum) <hi>Beloved Friends;</hi> occasioned by his late scandalous Paper, stiled, <hi>Some Reasons,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>Memorandum,</opener>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> THat the said <hi>Francis Bugg,</hi> to his perpetual Infamy, invented and divulged in print a famous Piece of scandalous <hi>Forgery,</hi> in his extra judical Judicature, Trial and Condemnation of divers Honest Men of Good Reputation in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> as <hi>Perjured</hi> Persons, for their Testimony against some of his notorious Falshoods and Perversions, staging them as set in a <hi>Pillory,</hi> Pictured, under the Title <hi>Perjury,</hi> with the first Letters of their Names over their Heads; as the notorious shew thereof, may be seen at large in the said <hi>Bugg</hi>'s <hi>New Rome Arraigned,</hi> Anno 1693. And the Persons thus defamed, their patiently forbearing, hitherto to enter their particular Actions of Defamation against him, he has ungratefully requited, by his persisting to accumulate Calumnies, and repeat Reproaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the said People, to render them obnoxious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> 
               <hi rend="margQuotes">The said <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> has also been detected for his presumptuous <hi>Impiety</hi> and Piece of insolent <hi>Forgery,</hi> in his diabolically inventing, forming and divulging a Sermon in <hi>George Whitehead</hi>'s Name, stiling the same <hi>G. Whitehead</hi>'s <hi>Sermon,</hi> to ridicule, defame and scandalize him and the said People, and their Annual Meeting, which he terms their Convocation; in which notorious Piece of <hi>Forgery</hi> and profane <hi>Romance,</hi> he the said <hi>F. B.</hi> useth the Sacred Name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Christ, the Light within,</hi> &amp;c. adding there unto, another Piece of abominable Forgery and Impiety, in <hi>William Bingley</hi>'s Name, as if he preached in Confirmation of the other.</hi> This prophane impious Romance, may be seen at large, in <hi>Francis Bugg</hi>'s Book, stiled, <hi>The Pilgrim's Progress from Quakerism to Christianity;</hi> and answered by <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in his Book Entituled, <hi>The Rambling Pilgrim, or Prophane Apostate Exposed,</hi> Anno 1700.</p>
            <p>To his often repeated false Story against <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> viz. <hi>That he put in his Answer upon Oath,</hi> i. e. <hi>To a Bill exhibited in the Lord Mayor's Court,</hi> April 9. 1695. And not only so, but <hi>that they</hi> (i. e. <hi>the Quakers) can take a Legal Oath to serve their private Interest; and that there are many Instances thereof in the Courts of Chancery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> I who was Defendant, as I did (in my former Answer to <hi>F. B.)</hi> deny that I put in my Answer upon <hi>Oath,</hi> so (in good Conscience) I do still; for neither did I take an Oath, or Swear at all; for I openly signified, that <hi>for Conscience sake I could not Swear;</hi> and it was made appear that the Suit was vexatious; for I produced an effectual Release from the Plantiffs, under their own Hands and Seals, pleaded by Counsel in Court in barr of their unjust Claim; and my Answer was accepted only in these Words, <hi>viz. I verily believe my Answer is a True Answer:</hi> And if <hi>Jurat</hi> was Recorded or Endorsed, that was none of my Act; for it has been a known Form, that some Clerks have used and entred <hi>Jurat,</hi> or <hi>Juratus,</hi> when no <hi>Oath, Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi> of an <hi>Oath</hi> has been taken or used by the Persons concerned; and I am not of Opinion that <hi>Verily</hi> is an Oath, as some are.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>F. B</hi>'s. old refuted unjust Imputations against the said People, <hi>viz. That they are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Enemies to the Christian Religion, denying Jesus Christ of</hi> Nazareth <hi>to be the Christ, the Son of God, vilifying and contemning the Holy Scriptures, Contempt of Authority,</hi> &amp;c. with many more injurious Aspersions of the like Nature, often repeated by him; unto which our plain Answers have long been extant; being printed and sold by <hi>T. Sowle</hi> in <hi>White-Hart-Court</hi> in <hi>Gracious-Street.</hi> But this implacable Adversary will Not be answered; he'll take no Answers, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat accumulate, and multiply his refuted Calumnies over, and over; turn and modelize them into several Shapes; sometime into History, sometime into Dialogue, sometime into Catechism, sometime into a Sermon, Prophane Romance, Scandalous Trial, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and all or mostly but the same Scurrilous Rubbish, like a mercenary Agent, he will be at work to defame and scandilize the People called <hi>Quakers:</hi> And when he hears of any of them attending the Parliament, he goes about peeping and prying, like a busie Body, in other Mens Matters; and if he hears <hi>Relief</hi> in any Case is proposed, or requested by them; then he rakes up some of his old repeated Calumnies and Slanders (which he can easily do out of his old Books and Pamphlets stuff'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with) to asperse and persecute them with lying Papers, thereby imposing on (and abusing) Authority; which has been his Practice for many Years since he left the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and turned Persecutor against them. It has been manifest of old, that invidious and perfidious Apostates, are the worst sort of Persecutors.</p>
            <p>It appears, this Adversary <hi>would have no Favour shewn the said People,</hi> which is an Indication of his <hi>Persecuting Spirit,</hi> and <hi>Implacable</hi> Envy. Thus he treats the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> since he was above 20 Years in Communion with them, and they esteemed his <hi>Beloved Friends; his Dear Friends,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Friend <hi>F. Bugg</hi> I wish thou mayest yet find a Place of <hi>Repentance</hi> before thy approaching <hi>Judgment</hi> comes inevitably upon thee.</p>
            <p>However know this, That thy Reverend <hi>Abetters</hi> will never gain Honour or Credit to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by thy irreverend Actions, nor be thy Advocates before the Barr of Divine Justice, (where you must all be accountable) nor will all their <hi>Bounty</hi> toward thee, excuse thy <hi>presumptuous Impiety</hi> before the <hi>Righteous Judge</hi> of all.</p>
