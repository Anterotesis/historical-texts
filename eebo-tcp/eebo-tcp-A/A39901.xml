            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THough I may ſeem to incurr the Cenſure of Vanity and Oſtentation, by pretending to advance any thing New, on a Theme that hath already em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd ſo many able Pens: Yet on an Impartial Peruſal of all that is extant on this Subject, I doubt not but there will be found ſuch ample Scope for ſo many Conſiderable Alterations and Additions as will render this</hi> Further Attempt <hi>not only Excuſable but Neceſſary: Great part of what hath been hitherto done of this Nature, not having been performed with that Candour and Impartiality, nor with all that Accuracy and Exactneſs as were to be wiſh'd, in an Affair of ſuch grand Importance and Difficulty. And how Deficient ſoever I may be, as to the latter of theſe Qualifications, yet I dare aſſure my Readers, they ſhall not have any just Cauſe of Complaint of my Failure in the former and more Eſſential Point of an unbiaſſed Integrity. The Conſciouſneſs of which Sincerity of Intention, flatters
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61632:3"/>
me with ſome Hopes of theſe Endeavours meeting with a Favourable Reception; wherein, if I ſhould be deceived, yet ſhould I be ſenſible of no other Diſpleaſure thereat, than any Lover of his Country may be ſuppoſed to have, for the Miſcarriage of a Deſign he conceives might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Promotion of the Publick Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not waſt any Time in an unprofitable Inquiry into the ſeveral Means and Degrees whereby our Coin hath been reduced to its preſent ill Condition, but forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with apply my ſelf to the Search of the propereſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Reſtoring it unto a good one. The only effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Expedient for which purpoſe, is agreed on all hands to be the Re-coining of all the old clipped and Counterfeit Coin, into good new and mill'd Money: So that there is an univerſal Conſent, as to the Matter it ſelf, that it is neceſſary to be done, but as to the Manner of performing it; there are almoſt as many different Perſwaſions as Perſons, out of which variety of Methods, to ſelect thoſe which ſeem moſt Rational and Practicable, is the Deſign and Scope of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, which ſhall conſiſt of an Inquiry into the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heads, which will comprehend all that is neceſſary to be ſaid on this ſubject. <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether it be moſt for the Intereſt of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to Reduce the price or value of an Ounce of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver unto Sixty two Pence, or to advance it propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the preſent Scarcity and Want thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> By whom ſhall the Loſs that will enſue on the Re-coining the Clipp'd and Counterfeit Money be ſuſtain'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> By what Means may the Mint be ſupplied with a ſufficient Quantity of Silver Bullion, to make near as much good Money in Tale, as there is at this time of good and bad together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61632:3"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What Methods are proper to be inſiſted on, to prevent the ſtop of Commerce during the Re-coinage.</p>
            <p>The firſt, and indeed moſt material Point that offers it ſelf to our Conſideration, is the Value that ought to be fixed on the Ounce of Silver; or whether it be more for the Publick Intereſt to have it reduced unto Sixty two Pence, or to have it advanced proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable to the preſent Scarcity and Want thereof. The latter of which two Opinions, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is moſt for the Intereſt of the Nation to advance the Price of our Silver, ſeems moſt Rational in it ſelf, and Beneficial to the Kingdom in its preſent Circumſtances, and that for ſeveral Cogent, and (if I miſtake not) unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reaſons; whereof the following are ſome of the principal, which when I can find ſatisfactorily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I ingage to change my Opinion; until which be done, I hope thoſe of the contrary Perſwaſion will alter theirs. Theſe Reaſons I ſhall diſpoſe under two Heads.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall Enumerate ſome of the grand Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies that will attend the Non-advancement of Silver.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall repreſent ſome of the Advantages that will accrue to the Nation by raiſing the Price thereof. And</p>
            <p>To begin with an Enumeration of the Evil Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences that will attend the low Valuation of Silver, ſome of the principal whereof are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Want of a ſufficient Quantity of Money for Payment of the Taxes and Rents, and carrying on of the Trade of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Now if I can but prove, that ſuch an Exceſſive Want and Scarcity of Money will be the certain and fatal Conſequence of fixing ſo low a Rate on Silver.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61632:4"/>
I think this ſingle Conſideration were ſufficient to diſſwade the Practice of it. For certainly ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of regulating the Coin, as carries with it ſuch fatal and pernicious Conſequences, as the occaſioning ſo great a Scarcity of Money, as to render us inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of paying our Taxes and Rents, and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Trades; and that will Impoveriſh the Nation to that Degree, as to Incapacitate us for the Continuance of the War; and thereby oblige us, and conſequently the reſt of <hi>Europe,</hi> to truckle to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and Power of <hi>France.</hi> I ſay, ſuch a Method, that draws with it ſuch Conſequences as theſe, muſt be acknowledged of all hands, to be very unfit to be purſued. Now that the low Valuation of Silver would cauſe ſo great a Scarcity of Money, as would in a great meaſure produce ſuch fatal Effects, may I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive be evinced from the enſuing Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the fixing a low Rate on Silver, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an Exceſſive Scarcity of Money, may partly be evinced, if we conſider, That what Silver ſhall be Recoin'd, together with what mill'd and unclipp'd Money is ſtill remaining, will not go ſo far by near a Million of Pounds Sterling, if it be Re-coin'd at a low Rate, as it will if the Value be augmented; which will be evident, if we compare what quantity of Money in Tale, may be Recoin'd out of the Clipp'd Money, reckoning the Silver at 62 Pence <hi>per</hi> Ounce, with the Quantity that may be made out of the ſame Silver, reckoned at a fourth part more, <hi>viz.</hi> at 6 <hi>s. 5 d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi> Ounce. There may be (as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the Judicious Mr. <hi>Lowndes)</hi> about 5600000 <hi>l.</hi> of Sterling Money left in the Kingdom, whereof he ſuppoſes about 1600000 <hi>l.</hi> may be in mill'd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipp'd
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61632:4"/>
Money, and the other Four Millions in clipp'd Money; which one with another (as appears by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bags weigh'd at the Exchequer) is diminiſhed full one half of its weight. So that the ſaid four Millions, Re-coin'd according to the preſent Eſtabliſhment, will not make above two Millions of mill'd Money, which, with the 1600000 <hi>l.</hi> ſuppoſed to be remaining in mill'd and unclipp'd Money, and making in all 3600000 <hi>l.</hi> will be all the Silver Money we are like to have in the Kingdom, in lieu of about eight Millions of good and bad Silver together, which are ſuppoſed to be now therein.</p>
            <p>Now he that can inform me, how we may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of paying every Year between five or ſix Millions of Pounds for defraying the Charge of the War, a great part of which Sum muſt alſo be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for the uſe of the Land-Forces; and how at the ſame time we may pay our Rents, and manage our Domeſtick and Forreign Trades, on account of which latter alſo there muſt be great Sums yearly tranſported, to make good the Ballance of what the Goods we Export fall ſhort of thoſe we Import. I ſay, He that can propoſe the means of performing all this out of 3600000 <hi>l.</hi> of Silver, and our ſmall quantity of Gold Coin (which by the way will be very inconſiderable, when it is fallen to the Rate theſe Gentlemen would have Silver fixed at,)
<q>
                  <l>—erit mihi Magnus Apollo,</l>
               </q>
I'll erect Altars to his Praiſe, and Sacrifice to his Memory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61632:5"/>
But on the other hand, if Silver be advanced a fourth part, <hi>viz.</hi> from 5 <hi>s. 2 d.</hi> unto 6 <hi>s. 5 d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi> Ounce (as it ought to be in proportion to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Scarcity thereof, of which more in the ſequel of this Diſcourſe) then the ſame quantity of Silver will furniſh us with a fourth part more Money than it would if it were coin'd at the rate of the preſent Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. So that inſtead of but 3600000 <hi>l.</hi> we ſhall by this propoſed Advancement of Silver, have 4500000 <hi>l.</hi> in the Nation, which is Nine hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds more, and is no inconſiderable Addition to our Coin at ſuch a Juncture as this. And beſides this Augmentation of our Silver Coin, the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Silver will raiſe our Gold proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally full a fourth part: So that ſuppoſing there may be about two Millions of Pounds Sterling in all ſorts of Gold Coins in the Nation; which if Silver be raiſed to the propoſed Value, will paſs for a full fourth part, or 500000 <hi>l.</hi> more than they otherwiſe would: Which advance of the Gold, added to that of the Silver, demonſtrates there will be 1400000 <hi>l.</hi> more in tale in the Kingdom, by the fixing a higher Rate on Silver, than there would be by ſetting a lower Valuation thereon.</p>
            <p>But before I can paſs to the next Reaſon, to prove that ſuch an exceſſive and fatal Want of Money, will be a conſequence of reducing Silver to a low Value, I muſt obviate one grand Objection, which I foreſee will be urged againſt what I have already advanced, and which is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> That though it be granted, that the ſame quantity of Silver or Gold, will make more Money in Tale, by advancing the Value of the Bullion, than
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61632:5"/>
it will if debaſed to a lower value; yet though the Money coin'd at ſuch a low rate will not go ſo far in Tale, yet it will purchaſe as much Goods as if it did. The Real and Intrinſick, not the Nominal and Imaginary Value being that which is regarded by thoſe who ſell their Commodities.—To which I anſwer,</p>
            <p>That though it be in ſome meaſure true, that the Price of Goods bears ſome proportion to the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Badneſs of the Coin wherewith they are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. Yet is not this proportion ſo exact as fully to ballance them: For I dare undertake to purchaſe more Goods with a Coin in quantity of Silver coin'd into Money ſet at a pretty high rate, than with the ſame weight of Silver coin'd into Money, and fixed at a lower rate. For though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Real and Intrinſick Value is principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, yet not ſo, as totally to exclude all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Extrinſick Value and Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is put upon it; to which alſo all Perſons, eſpecially the Subjects of the Prince, whoſe Money it is, bear ſome reſpect unto, and will accept it in Payment for ſomething more than the bare Intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Value: As will be further evident, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,</p>
            <p>That though I think its granted, that our Coin is, if taken altogether full 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> or one half leſs worth at this time, than the firſt Intrinſick Value. And therefore that according to the rule of Goods riſing or falling fully ſo much as to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the ſeveral degrees of the Goodneſs of Money, all our Inland and Foreign Commodities ſhould have advanc'd full one half above their former Price,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61632:6"/>
and the exchange for our Money have fallen one half from its former Rate. Neither of which we find to have happen'd, not even when our Money was reduc'd to its worſt eſtate, and e're it was certain whether it would be reform'd or not.</p>
            <p>For if we examine the Price-current of all Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, 'twill be found they are not advanc'd near 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> one with another; and ſo much as they are riſen, is not only on account of the Badneſs of our Coin, but is in great meaſure occaſioned by the extraordinary Demand there is for many of them both here and beyond-Sea; and by the great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and hazard of Importing them during the War.</p>
            <p>And then as to the courſe of Exchange, that alſo never fell ſo much from its former Rate, as our Money is from its former Intrinſick Value. For I think, when our Coin was in its perfection of Weight and Purity, the courſe of Exchange at <hi>Roterdam, Amſterdam,</hi> &amp;c. ſeldom exceeded 37 Dutch Shillings for a Pound ſterling. And when our Coin was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas'd to its worſt eſtate, the Exchange at the ſame places was ſeldom lower than 26 or 27 of the ſame Shillings for a Pound ſterling, which is not above 30 <hi>per Cent.</hi> difference from what it was when our Coin was in its beſt condition; though (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) our Money is become generally 50 <hi>per Cent.</hi> worſe than its firſt Intrinſick Value.</p>
            <p>So that I think it's evident, that neither do Goods advance, nor the Exchange ſink ſo, as fully to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance the Baſeneſs and Lightneſs of our Coin.</p>
            <p>Whence it follows, that the ſame weight of Gold and Silver valu'd at a higher rate, will go further in purchaſing Commodities, as well as in Tale, than
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61632:6"/>
the ſame weight, if a lower Value be fixed; ſince our Clipt and Counterfeit Money buyes more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of any ſort in proportion to its real and intrinſick Value, than our Money, when in its beſt eſtate, ever did in proportion to the real and intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Value thereof at that time. And therefore our quantity of Silver valued at 4500000 Pound, will go ſomething farther in the purchaſe of even foreign Commodities, as well as in Tale, than the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity valued at but 3600000 Pound will do; which was the Point I deſigned to prove.</p>
            <p>And if this hold in ſome meaſure even as to our Foreign Traffick, it's much more certain, that with relation to our In-land Trade, the Advancement of the Price of Money will not only make it go further in Tale, but alſo in Purchaſe, and furniſh us with a larger Stock to traffick with among our ſelves; the extrinſick Value and Denomination of our Coin being regarded, as well as the real and intrinſick one in our Dealings one with another: ſo that the encreaſe of the Extrinſick Value or Denomination of our Money will cauſe it to go further in Payments, and purchaſe more Goods than it would otherwiſe do.</p>
            <p>And in every regulation of the Coin, there ought to be had an equal, if not ſuperior regard to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of our Domeſtick, as well as Foreign Commerce. For the ſervice of which former, Money ſeems to have been principally intended, as being deſigned to anſwer ſuch things as could not be eaſily reckon'd, or equally divided, and made to anſwer one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>But a due conſideration of the Intereſt of our In-land Traffick in the Regulation of our Money, ſeems to be wholly neglected by the great Sticklers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61632:7"/>
for a low Valuation of our Money, whoſe meaſures ſeem chiefly calculated for the Meridian of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Trade, and their own particular Intereſts; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as I hope it will be judged no breach of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to conjecture, that the true Motive by which ſome of that Party are acted in this Affair, is, that many of them being Foreigners, and trading in Commodities coming from <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Sound, Streights,</hi> &amp;c. may, inſtead of making their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in Goods, remit our Money thither in <hi>Specie,</hi> by the extraordinary goodneſs whereof they propoſe to gain 20 or 25 <hi>per Cent.</hi> in the exchange; which they know cannot be done, if our Money be fix'd at a pretty high rate.</p>
            <p>But tho' this may be true as to ſome of them, yet I doubt not but there are many Perſons of the ſame opinion, whoſe Intentions are undoubtedly generous and honeſt, but have been wheedled by ſome deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſelf-intereſted Perſons, to think and act otherwiſe in this Affair, than they would have done, if left to have purſu'd the Dictates of their own better and more impartial Judgments.</p>
            <p>Having, as I hope, ſufficiently enervated the force of this grand <hi>Objection,</hi> in which I have been the more prolix, becauſe it is one of the moſt plauſible the Cauſe will afford; I proceed to the mention of a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reaſon, to prove, That an exceſſive Scarcity of Money, will be a conſequence of the Non-advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Silver: Which is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Reduction of Silver to ſo low a Rate; will not only prevent its going ſo far in Tale and Purchaſe, as it otherwiſe would; but will alſo be ſuch a great diſcouragement to the Importation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61632:7"/>
of Gold and Silver into the Kingdom, and carrying of it into the Mint, as will thereby cut off all hopes of procuring Bullion to increaſe the Coin.</p>
            <p>I need not prove that Increaſe of our Money at a Juncture, when by Melting, Clipping, and other indirect means it is reduced to ſo ſmall a Quantity, muſt be concluded to be for the Publick Good; and conſequently any Propoſal that tends to deprive the Nation of ſuch an Advantage, as the augmentation of our Coin is univerſally acknowledged to be, muſt neceſſarily be judged Repugnant to the publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>And that a low Valuation of Silver tends to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Increaſe of our Money, will be evident, if we conſider, that no Perſons will carry any Silver into the Mint at 5 <hi>s. 2 d. per</hi> Ounce, when beſides that, it is likely they gave conſiderably more for it themſelves. It will yield a better Price elſewhere. So that the fixing ſo low a ſtate on Gold and Silver would be as effectual a Prohibition of the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it into the Kingdom, and carrying of it unto the Mint, as any Law that could be Enacted for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A Third Reaſon to evince that ſuch an exceſſive want of Money will enſue on the non advancement of Gold and Silver, is, That fixing ſo low a Value on Silver, will not only ſo diſcourage the Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it into the Kingdom, and carrying of it into the Mint, as will cut off all hopes of increaſing the Quantity of our Coin, but alſo will be ſuch a Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to perſons to melt and Tranſport it, as will render it impoſſible for us to preſerve even the little we ſhall have left, from being conveyed out of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61632:8"/>
Nation. So that ſuppoſing the Government ſhould impoſe the hard terms of carrying in our Plate to be coined, at 1 <hi>s.</hi> or 1 <hi>s. 6 d. per</hi> Ounce leſs than it coſt, and thereby the quantity of our Money ſhould be for the preſent augmented. Nay, imagining we had double the Quantity of money that is poſſible for us to have: Yet if the Value were ſetled at the Rate of the preſent Eſtabliſhment, or 5 <hi>s. 2 d. per</hi> Ounce, in the proceſs of a few Years it would be inſenſibly melted and Tranſported, until there would not remain a ſufficient Quantity for the ſupplying our moſt urgent Occaſions, but the Nation would be involved in a greater Exigency and Diſtreſs than it ever did (or I hope ever will) Experience. Now, that what I have here urged is not a meer Scare-Crow to Terrifie Children and Fools withal, I Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to our own ſad Experience, which never ſpake clearer in any Caſe than it doth in this. Doth not this Inform us in General, that though there ſhould be Enacted the Severeſt Laws, back'd with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the moſt Rigorous Penalties, againſt the Commiſſion of a Crime, by which there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of certain Gain, yet that there will never be wanting Perſons who for the ſake thereof will hazard the enduring the greateſt Puniſhments. And doth not Experience further teach us in general, that few Laws are obeyed, the Violation whereof is more gainful than the Obſervation, and where the Profit of breaking them is great and certain, but the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty dubious, or eaſily avoidable? But doth not even our own preſent Experience furniſh us with preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Inſtances in relation to this particular Subject of the Coin, ſince of above Fifteen Millions of Silver Money, which as appears by the Regiſter of the Mint,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61632:8"/>
have been coined ſince the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, not above one Third part are computed to be remaining in Specie, but all the reſt either melted down, or Tranſported? So that we may rationally judge of the future by what is already paſt. Nay, rather we may conclude that Silver and Gold being ſcarcer and dearer now on many Accounts than for ſeveral Years paſt, ſhould they be ſetled at ſo low a Rate, the Encouragement to melt and Tranſport it being greater than ever, their Induſtry therein would conſequently be more than ordinary; for we have no reaſon to imagine that when the Reaſon and Temptation of doing it will be ſo much augmented, that their Diligence will be leſſened. For if Perſons will not ſtick at the commiſſion of a Crime for the obtaining of a leſs Advantage, they will not ſcruple it for the procuring of a greater.</p>
            <p>And this Reaſon will appear yet more unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, if beſides the Clandeſtine and Illegal convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Silver out of the Land, which I have proved will be an inevitable Conſequence of the Scarcity and Goodneſs of our Money, there will alſo thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue this further Inconvenience, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſupplying us with more Goods than we do them, we thereby become their Debtors, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently muſt pay what we owe them in ſuch as they will pleaſe to accept; and we may be certain they will chooſe to have their Returns in that whereby they ſhall gain moſt. So that if our Silver be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a low value, they will chooſe to have their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns in as much of it as they can, whereby we ſhall be at length ſo drain'd of our Money, as to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuch a Scarcity and want of Money, as I affirmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I think, have proved, will be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61632:9"/>
of the non-advancement of Silver, and the cauſe of ſuch a Poverty as will diſable us to pay our Taxes and Rents, and manage our Trades. Which though it be but a ſingle Inſtance of the Miſchievous Effects of ſetting a low Valuation on Silver, yet is one of ſo black and extenſive a Nature, and draws ſuch a Numerous and Diſmal Train of Ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences along with it, as will ſpare me the Labour of adding much more to prove the Diſadvantage of ſuch a Practice. However I ſhall mention a ſecond grand Inconvenience that will attend the non-advancement of Silver, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the making our Money of a great Weight and a low Value, will mightily obſtruct the Sale of our Manufactures and In-land Commodities, both to our Neighbours abroad, and amongſt our ſelves at home. For as to our Neighbours, if our Money be made of ſo extraordinary Goodneſs, they will (as I ſaid before) chooſe to have their Returns made in that, and in as few of our Goods as poſſible. Which will cauſe our Commodities to fall very much on our hands for want of Buyers. In the mean time our Neighbours taking as much Money, and as few Goods from us as poſſible, will thereby (together with the concurrence of ſome other cauſes mentioned in the foregoing Head) occaſion ſuch a want of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, as will mightily obſtruct the Vent of our In-land Commodities, even among our ſelves, and ſo very much prejudice our Domeſtick as well as Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Commerce. For a great ſcarcity of Money will oblige Perſons to retrench their uſual Expences, and employ their Money in ſuch things only as are of pure Neceſſity. So that moſt of the Trades that ſubſiſt by furniſhing things for the Pleaſure and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61632:9"/>
of Humane Life (of which kind the Greater part of the Trades of the Nations ſubſiſt) muſt neceſſarily droop and decline; for Perſons not having Money ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to gratifie both their Neceſſities and their Pleaſures, will be obliged to baulk the latter to ſerve the former, or at leaſt to diſappoint one of the two; and then amongſt other Commodities, that will fall ſo much by reaſon of the Scarcity of Money. We may be certain that Corn, Cattel, and the other Products of Land will bear a Proportion; And if a Tenant cannot make ſo much of the Product of his Farm, as he uſed to do, then it will be impoſſible for him to pay his Landlord the uſual Rent: So that all the Lands and Tenements muſt of neceſſity ſink, conſiderably below their preſent yearly Rents: Which will not be the only Diskindneſs that this hopeful Project, of Reducing the Silver to ſo low a Rate as 5 <hi>s. 2 d. per</hi> Ounce, (if it ſucceed) will procure to the Gentlemens and Landlords Eſtates in <hi>England.</hi> For this low Rate of Silver cauſing a Scarcity of Money, and this Scarcity of Money naturally cauſing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Intereſt thereof, to perhaps double the preſent Rate, and the Advancement of the Intereſt of Money will certainly lower the Purchaſe of Lands by ſeveral Years; for that when the Increaſe of Money was high, Lands yielded but a few Years Purchaſe. But on the contrary, When the Intereſt of Money was loweſt, then Lands ſold for the moſt Years Purchaſe; as will be evident, if we compare the Purchaſe of Lands in King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Time, when Intereſt of Money was at 12 or 14 <hi>l. per Cent. per Annum,</hi> with the Purchaſe of the ſame Lands now, when Intereſt is not above a third part of what it was at that time: It being always obſerved, That as the Price of Money was advanced, and thereby the Species increaſed, that the Intereſt thereof fell and grew leſs; and according as the Intereſt of Money fell, ſo Land advanced ſeveral years Purchaſe; as will
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61632:10"/>
be manifeſt, if we obſerve how much the Land of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> hath been improved ſince the aforeſaid time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, when Intereſt of Money was ſo very high. So that upon the whole, we may ſee how much the Gentlemen and Landlords of <hi>England</hi> are obliged to theſe Perſons, for propoſing ſuch a Method of Regulating the Coin, that will not only, by introducing a Scarcity of Money, cauſe all the Products, and conſequently the yearly Rents of Lands, to fall conſiderably; but alſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Intereſt of Money, and thereby lower the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Lands by ſeveral years.</p>
            <p>And I conceive I have by this time ſo throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the fatal Conſequences that will enſue on the fixing Silver at a low Rate, that the Impartial Reader by this time cannot but be ſenſible, how deſtructive that courſe would be to the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>I ſhould now (as I propoſed) enforce my Reaſons for advancing the Price of Silver, by repreſenting the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that would accrue to the Nation by doing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. But theſe being in ſome meaſure handled under the former Head, when I enumerated the ill Conſequences of the contrary courſe. And theſe Advantages of raiſing Silver, being but, as it were, the Reverſe of, and directly oppoſite unto the Diſadvantages of fixing a low Value thereon. The good Effects of the one, are beſt ſeen by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to the bad ones of the other Method, which I ſhall do very briefly, if the ſetting a low Valuation on Silver will cauſe, that it will paſs but a little way in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the contrary method will make it go as far as poſſible. If the former be ſuch a Diſcouragement to the bringing in of Silver to be coin'd, as cuts off all hopes of increaſing the Quantity of our Money, the latter affords all imaginable Incouragement both to the Importation of it into the Kingdom, and to the carrying it into the Mint to be coin'd: By which means we may hope to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61632:10"/>
have as great a Plenty of good Money, as ever was yet in the Nation. Again, If the ſetting too low a Valuation on Silver, be a Temptation to convey it out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the fixing a high Rate thereon, will be a means of preſerving the Coin intire and unmelted: And if the low Rate of Silver will obſtruct the Exportation of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, becauſe our Neighbours will chooſe our Money before our Goods: On the contrary, The advancing Silver to a pretty high Rate, will induce them to chooſe our Commodities rather than our Money, and thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage our Trade and Manufactures, and preſerve our Money in the Kingdom to manage our Inland Trade. In ſhort, If the low Rate of Silver will cauſe ſuch a Scarcity of Money, as will oblige Perſons to retrench their uſual pleaſurable Expences, and thereby occaſion the Decay of a great many Trades depending thereon; but the ſetting a high Price on Silver, thereby cauſing a Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof in the Nation, will enable Perſons to ſpend freely to the Advantage of Trade. Again, If the one will produce ſuch a Scarcity of Silver, as will cauſe all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and among the reſt, all the Products of Land to fall conſiderably, and conſequently all Lands to ſink ſomething in their yearly Rent. The other, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by advancing Silver, would keep Commodities up at ſuch a tolerable Price, as would preſerve the preſent yearly Rent of Land. Finally, If fixing Silver at a low Rate, will cauſe ſuch a Scarcity, as muſt of neceſſity advance the Intereſt of Money, and thereby cauſe Land to fall ſeveral years Purchaſe. On the contrary, The Advancement of Silver, cauſing, as I have proved, a Plenty of Money, which Plenty muſt conſequently lower the Intereſt thereof. And the Leſſening of the Intereſt of Money, will, as Experience evinces, advance Land ſeveral years Purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Having, as I Hope, ſufficiently evinced the Neceſſity and Advantage of raiſing the Price of Silver, I come now
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61632:11"/>
to fix the particular Rate, to which I humbly conceive it is requiſite to be advanced, which, with the Judicious Mr. <hi>Lowndes</hi> (who ſeems to have underſtood this matter better than moſt who have treated of it beſides) I judge to be one fourth part above the preſent Eſtabliſhment; ſo that the Ounce of Silver muſt conſequently be raiſed from 5 <hi>s. 2 d.</hi> unto 6 <hi>s. 5 d.</hi> ½ <hi>per</hi> Ounce, which may be done two ways, either by Retaining of the ſame Weight and Fineneſs as before, with the addition of a fourth part of Extrinſick Value; and ſo every mill'd Crown muſt be ordered to paſs at 6 <hi>s. 3 d.</hi> and the other pieces propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. The other Method of advancing the Silver, is by Coining it of a leſs weight than before, but ſtill affixing the ſame Value; by which Regulation, the Standard of one of the new Crown pieces to paſs at 5 <hi>s.</hi> will conſiſt of 15 penny-weights and an half within an inconſiderable Fraction, and the other Pieces proportionable. Both which methods come to one and the ſame effect; only if it ſhall be thought fit to make uſe of the latter method of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing the weight, but retaining the extrinſick va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue. Then the better to make the New Crowns anſwer to ſuch as ſhall be left of the old Eſtabliſhment, it will be requiſite that beſides Half Crowns, there ſhould be alſo Coined Quarter Crowns, or pieces of 15 <hi>d.</hi> one whereof added to a New Crown, will make it exactly anſwer the Old Mill'd Crown pieces that ſhall remain of the former Standard.</p>
            <p>This Rate ſetled on our Silver Coins, will ſoon reduce our Gold to the ſame proportion, according to which a Guinea is worth 25 <hi>s.</hi> at which rate I humbly conceive it is for the Publick Intereſt to have them fix'd by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And moreover to prevent the extraordinary Loſs that will fall ſo heavy on ſome particular perſons by their falling 5 <hi>s. per</hi> piece, <hi>viz.</hi> from 30 <hi>s.</hi> unto 25 <hi>s.</hi> at one inſtant, as they are like to do if left to take their courſe; I judge it would prevent that Inconvenience, if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61632:11"/>
the Loſs that will enſue upon them, be equally born by the Nation, which may be effected by Ordering them to fall 6 <hi>d per</hi> piece ever month for the firſt ſix months next enſuing the date of an Order to be publiſh'd for that effect; and to fall 4 <hi>d. per</hi> piece every month for the next ſix months, to commence from the Expiration of the firſt ſix months; and all Perſons ſhall be commanded to take them at the Rates they ſhall be currant in each reſpective month, under the Penalty of forfeiting the value of the money they ſhall ſo refuſe: And all other Gold Coins to fall by the ſame proportion. Whereby in 12 months time we ſhould have our Gold Coin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to their true value, with a Trouble and Loſs, that being thus divided among the Nation in general, would be very inconſiderable, and almoſt inſenſible. But were it to be born by each particular perſon, would very much impoveriſh ſome Families, whilſt the reſt eſcape Scot-free; for all perſons that ſhall be thus obliged to take Guinea's for their Goods, would reimburſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſome meaſure by making a better price of their Commodities, and be likewiſe in hopes of paying their Guinea's away again before a month is expired: So as I am perſwaded that ſuch an Ordinance would be received with almoſt an Univerſal Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>Thus have I gone through the Firſt and indeed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Point I intended in this Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall be more brief in what remains. The Second Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head I propoſed to enquire into, is, <hi>By whom ſhall the Loſs that will enſue on the Re-coining the Clipt and Counterfeit Money be ſuſtained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto that part of the <hi>Query</hi> that relates to the Clipt Silver Money, the Reſolution of Parliament, That the Loſs thereof ſhall be made good by the Publick, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Reply. But it being yet undetermined, By whom the Loſs occaſion'd by the Counterſeit Money ſhould be ſuſtained; I hope I may be permitted to communicate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61632:12"/>
my Opinion: Which is, That the Loſs thereof be born, one part by the Publick, and the other by the ſeveral Proprietors, in the ſollowing Proportion, <hi>viz.</hi> That for all ſuch Counterfeit-Money as hath any Mixture or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation of Silver in it, and is not intirely Braſs, Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, Iron, or ſome ſuch Metal, the Owner ſhall, upon their carrying it into the Mint, be allowed for ſo much as the ſaid Money ſhall weigh, after the rate of 5 <hi>s. per Ounce, Troy-weight,</hi> to be paid them, partly out of ſuch Silver as ſhall be found in the ſaid Money that is Carried in, after the Melting and Separation thereof, and the reſidue out of ſuch a Tax as the Parliament ſhall think fit to lay for that purpoſe. Until which Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney can be rais'd, they ſhall have Notes given them, entitling themſelves or the Bearers thereof unto ſo much Sterling Money as the ſaid Counterfeit-Money they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in amounted unto by weight, at 5 <hi>s. per Ounce,</hi> to be paid as before, and to have an Allowance of 5 <hi>per Cent. per Ann.</hi> for the ſaid Value of their Counterfeit-Money, until the time of Payment. By which Method the Poorer ſort of People, in whoſe hands great part of the Bad Money is lodg'd, would be extremely eas'd, and with no great burden to the Nation. For ſuppoſing there ſhould be about 2500000 <hi>l.</hi> Bad Money in the Kingdom, whereof we may ſuppoſe at leaſt 500000 <hi>l.</hi> entirely Braſs, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Loſs is to fall wholly on the Proprietors. And the Two Millions that may be ſuppos'd to be Mix'd Metal, would hardly weigh One Million; the Bad Money being generally leſs and lighter than the Clipp'd Silver. So that the Loſs of another Million at leaſt will by the lightneſs of the Money fall alſo on the Proprietor. So that the Publick will only have the Loſs of about a Million of Pounds Sterling in weight, or about Four Millions of Ounces of mix'd and courſe Silver to make good: which ſaid Metal may one with another be worth about 3 <hi>s.</hi> an Ounce, according to the advanc'd Price of Silver. So that the Loſs on the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61632:12"/>
part of the Publick would not exceed 4 or 500000 <hi>l.</hi> which yet would be a great Eaſe to the Poor, who muſt otherwiſe be oblig'd to diſpoſe of their Bad Money at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable low rates to the Goldſmiths, or others that will buy it of them. And I think there can be hardly be any good reaſon given wherefore the Publick ſhould ſuſtain the loſs of the Clipt Silver: which will not be of equal force to prove that the Nation is as much obliged to ſuſtain at leaſt ſome part of the loſs of the Counterfeit Money. Which ſhall ſuffice for an Anſwer to the Second General Enquiry, By whom the loſs of the Clipt and Counterfeit Money ought to be ſuſtain'd.</p>
            <p>The Third Head I propos'd to enquire into, is, <hi>By what means may the Mint be ſupplied with a ſufficient quantity of Bullion, to make near as much good Money in Tale, as there is at this time of Good and Bad together?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I anſwer briefly in general, That the only effectual means of accompliſhing this, is what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſo ſtrongly urg'd, <hi>viz.</hi> the Advancement of the Price of Silver, which will be the only Encouragement to the Importation of Silver into the Kingdom, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of it into the Mint. But to propoſe ſome more particular Means of effecting this, I would humbly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vize, That all the Gold and Silver Plate throughout the Kingdom (excepting ſuch Quantities and ſorts of each as ſhall be judg'd fit to be reſerved according to Perſons ſeveral Degrees and Eſtates, be order'd to be brought into the Mint, and coin'd into Money at the rate of 6 <hi>s. 5 d.</hi> ½. <hi>per</hi> Ounce, anſwerable to the other Silver; whereby, notwithſtanding the Reſervation of ſuch a certain Quantity as ſhould be judg'd fit, there would be near Two Millions of good Sterling Mnney added to the Coin of the Nation, without oppreſſing any particular Perſons, who can have no cauſe of Complaint, when they are allow'd ſo good a Price for their Plate: Which will be more beneficial to the Owners, as well as the Publick, after it is coin'd into Money, than it was before, when it ſerv'd more for Oſtentation, than for Uſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61632:13"/>
I am come at length to the Fourth and Laſt General Head of Enquiry, <hi>viz. What Methods are proper to be made uſe of to prevent the ſtop of Commerce, during the Re-coinage?</hi> To which I will make as brief and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory an Anſwer as I can in the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it will be requiſite that all the Mill'd and Unclipt Money that is remaining, be immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to paſs, the Crown-piece at 6 <hi>s. 3 d.</hi> and the other Pieces proportionably, the propos'd Advancement of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one fourth part above the preſent Value.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Price of Guinea's ought to be fix'd, and they ordered to fall gradually ſo much <hi>per Menſem,</hi> as was before propoſed, that Perſons may not, by the uncertainty of their Price, be deterred from accepting them in Payment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the clipp'd Silver ſhall be carried in to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coined; There ſhall be Notes, given out, intituling the Bearer, to the Value of ſo much clipp'd Silver as he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in, to be paid in mill'd Money as ſoon as coin'd, with Intereſt at 5 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> until the reſpective Bills ſhall come to their courſe of being paid. And theſe Notes ſhall be order'd to paſs in Payments as Money, and made transferrable from one Perſon to another, the Bearer being entituled to the Receipt of the Money when it 'comes due. And theſe Notes, by reaſon of the 5 <hi>per Cent.</hi> annex'd to them, will be judg'd preferable to any Goldſmith's or Bank Bills; which, together with the remainder of the mill'd and unclipt Money, which upon the Advancement of the Value would preſently come abroad; and will with the aſſiſtance of the Gold, ſo well ſupply the place of our Clipt and Counterfeit Money, that we need not apprehend any conſiderable Stop of Commerce during the Re-coinage.</p>
