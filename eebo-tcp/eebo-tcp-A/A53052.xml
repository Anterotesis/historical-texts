         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

upon TRADE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly offered to the Parliament.</head>
            <p>IT was ſaid of Old, and grounded upon good Reaſon,
<hi>That</hi> England <hi>was a mighty Animal that would never die, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it deſtroy it ſelf;</hi> and nothing is conſider'd with greater
regret and reluctancy, than the fall of that Perſon who
was his own Executioner. How far too many of our own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
are at preſent engaged againſt the true Intereſt of their
Native Mother, carried on in a neceſſitous purſuit of Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
on the one Hand, and ſiniſter and private Gain on the
other, is lamentable to conſider, whilſt both are but ſerving
a Foreign Intereſt, and nothing can attend the ſucceſs of either
Party but falling into the Hands of the Common Enemy.
Providence hath been miraculouſly proſpicious unto us in our
happy Revolution, thereby enabling us by a frequent Meeting
of our Great Council (which Bleſſing was denied us in our
two laſt Reigns) to eſtabliſh the Intereſt of <hi>England</hi> once more
upon its true Baſis, by diſcouraging that courſe of Trade
which exhauſted our Bullion to ſupport our Pride and Luxury,
and by making up thoſe Mounds which were carefully erected
by our Anceſtors to ſecure the Merchandize of our Native
Commodities, to our own Subjects; which were ſuffered to be
pull'd down in our laſt Reigns only to enſlave us, Poverty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the proper Shoo-horn to Slavery; Pride and Luxury was
the only means, upon one Hand, to impoveriſh our Nobility
and Gentry, and thereby bring them into a dependence upon
the Court for Preferment, which was the beſt Inducement to
make Laws to anſwer their own Neceſſities; and the more our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97722:3"/>
middle and lower ſort of People are impoveriſh'd, the likelier
they were to ſubmit to Wooden Shoos. Our <hi>East-India</hi> and
<hi>Turky</hi> Trade hath been the Darlings of our late Reigns, which
had their chiefeſt influence from our extravagant Expence in
a Foreign Conſumption; and it is not the leaſt of our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
in the preſent juncture of our Affairs, that the private
Intereſt of ſo many of our moſt conſiderable Traders, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere
with the preſent Neceſſities of the publick; this makes
a Civil War in our own Bowels, moſt Advices tending to the
center of private Intereſt; and if any thing is touch'd upon
that doth interfere, <hi>Great is Diana of the Epheſians!</hi> whilſt our
Golden Fleece, the only ſpring of our Riches, hath been laid
open to all Nations, without ſo much as the guard of Alien's
Duties. It is now above forty Years ſince all Government in
Trade hath been laid aſide, and every private Man's Rule
(both Foreigner and Engliſh) freely become his own choice;
and could the cunning of <hi>France</hi> (in whoſe Favour theſe Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
were chiefly made) but have found out a way to reap
theſe Benefits in Trade, ſecluding the Induſtry of <hi>Holland</hi> from
getting a like ſhare, our Circumſtances, I doubt, would have
been worſe than they are at preſent.</p>
            <p>This hath carried the ballance of Trade ſo much againſt us,
that our Neceſſities preſs us upon an Inquiry after the true
Cauſes thereof: And I ſhall make no Apology for this Eſſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Engliſh-man, it being clear to my Apprehenſion, that
ſhould we new model our Coin, and not our Trade, we ſhall
only make a bad Matter worſe.</p>
            <p>I will make it my Task to conſider firſt the Strength of our
Trade, in thoſe Advantages which Providence hath afforded
us.</p>
            <p>In the next place, how it ſtands in the preſent management,
in point of Profit and Loſs to the publick.</p>
            <p>And then caſt in my Mite towards its amendment.</p>
            <p>That our Golden Fleece is the ſpring of our Riches was never
yet denied; and <hi>England</hi> bore no ſmall Figure in the World
before the Days of <hi>Edward</hi> III. when we parted with our
Wooll to other Nations, as Nature gave it us; and the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it to be a Manufacture in <hi>England,</hi> hath as evidently been
the Increaſe of our Riches; in which particular I may truly ſay,
that we are now come to a very great Improvement, not only
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97722:3"/>
in reſpect of our Old Drapery, but more particularly in our
New Drapery and Art of Dying, which hath been obtained
theſe late Years. And we are now able to gratifie our Fancies,
with our own Growth, in a great variety of flowered and ſtrip'd
Cloth, and the intermixture of a Harmony of Colours in our
<hi>Norwich</hi> Stuffs, as well as adminiſter to the Neceſſities of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p>This was accompliſhed with no ſmall Difficulty, the <hi>Hanſe</hi>-Towns
of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> being very loth to part with
ſo great a Benefit as the Manufacture of our Wooll: And <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
III. obtain'd this Point upon them by main force, in a
total ſtop of the Exportation of our Wooll for a ſhort time,
upon the ſtricteſt Penalty; which was a very bold Attack when
our Nation was wholly unskilful in the Manufacture; but good
ſucceſs crown'd his noble Attempt, and when he had got a
good Footing he gave a liberty to Export our Wooll again, but
took care to collect a good Duty out of it. And
one thing he did to favour his Deſign, which I
think deſerves our notice at preſent, he put an
effectual ſtop to the wearing of Furrs<note n="‖" place="margin">Decimo quarto, <hi>E. 3.</hi> cap. 4.</note>, our Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
very much increas'd, and in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> IV.
we were able to furniſh other Parts as well as our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and he eſtabliſhed the Company of Merchant-Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers
to Trade to <hi>Zeland, Brabant</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> who were ſo
ſucceſsful in thoſe Parts, that the Duke of <hi>Burgoine,</hi> in the
Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. makes a Law totally to Prohibit our Cloth
in his Dominions: Upon which <hi>Henry</hi> VI. makes a Law to
Prohibit all Merchandize growing or wrought
in the ſaid Duke's Dominions,<note place="margin">Viceſimo octavo, Hen. 6. Cap 1.</note> from coming
into <hi>England,</hi> upon Forfeiture, until he revoke
the ſaid Order: And the Duke of <hi>Burgoine</hi> being ſtiff in this
Matter, the Year following <hi>Henry</hi> VI. confirms the ſaid Act
for ſeven Years, which ſoon obliged him to a compliance.
There was likewiſe ſome ſtruggle of this nature between the
Hanſe-Towns and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was accommodated
very much to the Engliſh Intereſt, as appears by the many
and large Priviledges granted to our Engliſh Merchants at
<hi>Hamborough, Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Dort,</hi> from which I may draw this
natural Deduction, That we are able to give Rules in Trade
to any part of the World, our Woollen Manufactures being
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97722:4"/>
certainly the commanding Commodity in Trade, and our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of Foreign Commodities the moſt conſiderable of any
one part of the World. Our New Drapery hath given us a
very great advantage, being ſo agreeable to <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
And altho' our Nation is at preſent become the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem
of Poverty, yet the Handle of the Riches of all <hi>Europe</hi> is
in our Hands; and its lamentable to conſider, that the blind
Zeal of our Diviſions ſhould hinder us from making a right uſe
of it; the long Wooll of <hi>England</hi> is the Foundation of the
Spaniſh Trade, which theſe late Years hath Inrich'd both
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am now to ſhew how our Trade ſtands at preſent in point
of Profit and Loſs to the Publick: And I will herein confine
my ſelf to the four chief Branches thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Trade;
our <hi>Straits</hi> Trade to <hi>Turkey</hi> and <hi>Leghorn;</hi> our Trade
to <hi>Holland, Flanders, Germany</hi> and <hi>Hamborough;</hi> and our
Trade to <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> the two former of theſe
are chiefly managed by our own Subjects, and the two latter
lie open to the wide World, and are chiefly in the Hands of the
Dutch.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Trade is chiefly carried on with Gold and
Silver ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and taken in at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> when this
Company lately enlarged themſelves, by throwing open their
Books for a ſhort time (which I ſuppoſe was no voluntary
Kindneſs to the publick, but rather a touch of their Neceſſity)
the Mony then brought in (I ſuppoſe the lighteſt of it) paid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Two hundred thouſand Pounds in Bills, that were drawn
upon them from <hi>Cadiz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commodities that we chiefly receive from the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
are Callicoes, Muſlins, <hi>Indian</hi> wrought Silks, Peper,
Salt-Petre, Indigo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The advantage of this Company is
chiefly in their Muſlins and <hi>Indian</hi> Silks (a great value in theſe
Commodities being comprehended in a ſmall Bulk) in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
become the general Wear in <hi>England;</hi> and this depends
upon the cheap Workmanſhip of the <hi>Indians,</hi> being inſtructed
to humour our Engliſh Fancies, by Artificers of all kinds ſent
from <hi>England;</hi> and this Trade being managed by a Joint-Stock,
that can make what Preſents they pleaſe (as appear'd
by a large Article in their Accounts) theſe Commodities are
always the high Mode of <hi>England;</hi> a Dreſs that came under
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97722:4"/>
the Satyr of <hi>Juvenal</hi> when <hi>Rome</hi> was a parallel of our great
City; exactly deſcribed,</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Tot premit ordinibus, tot adhuc compagibus altum,</l>
               <l>Ædificat caput, Andromachen a fronte ridebis,</l>
               <l>Post minor eſt—</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And I think that once in fifteen hundred Years is enough for any
ſuch Mode to appear in the World.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>-Trade hath been chiefly managed by a few
Hands that have reaped the Benefit thereof; and being a Joint-Stock,
managed with a great deal of Secreſie, it gives no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the younger Sons of our Nobility and Gentry, and
the hotneſs of the Climate hath waſted a multitude of our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
Subjects. Papers are always ſtuck upon all Pillars of the
Exchange, offering great Rewards to Seamen that will come
in to this Company's Service. This Company laid the firſt
Foundation to Stock-Jobbing, which of late Years hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ſo many new Additions, that it is now become a volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
Employment.</p>
            <p>The extravagant Expence of our Nation in Apparel, hath
evidently been encouraged by the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade; and which
adds to our loſs, their Commodities are fully Manufactured
abroad: Many ancient Entails that were carefully contrived by
our fore-Fathers, for the advantage of their Poſterity, and to
keep up the Monarchy of our Engliſh Nation, hath been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
cut off with <hi>Indian</hi> Silk: And it ſeems plain to me,
that our Nation was plagued with their Commodities in the
beginning of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> when there was
this good Law made to ſecure our Gentlemens Eſtates againſt
the <hi>Syrenian</hi> Charms of theſe bewitching Commodities, that
might aſſault their tender part. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall
Sell,<note place="margin">Anno Quinto, <hi>Eliz.</hi> Cap. 6.</note> or Deliver to any Perſon (having not in Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
Lands or Fees, to the clear yearly value of
3000 l.) any Foreign Wares, not first Grown, or firſt wrought
within the Queen's Dominions, appertaining to the Cloathing or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorning
of the Body; for which Wares, or the Workmanſhip thereof,
the Seller ſhall not receive the whole Mony, or ſatisfaction in hand,
or within Eight and twenty days after the making or delivering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the Seller, Maker,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be without all remedy by order of
any Law, Cuſtom, or Decree, to recover any recompence for ſuch
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:97722:5"/>
Wares, or the Workmanſhip, whatſoever aſſurance he ſhall have by
Bond, Surety, Promiſe, or Pawn of the Party, or any other; and
all Aſſurances or Bonds in that caſe ſhall be Void.</hi> Which was a
temporary Act, and it Expired.</p>
            <p>And I hope, I am now addreſſing my ſelf to many
Country Gentlemen, who can yet remember how much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it was in the Country, when the Kitchin was kept hot in
a good hoſpitable Expence, and the Wooll yielded a good
Price, than it hath been ſince our Grandeur hath only appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the curioſity of a Parlour dreſt up in <hi>Indian</hi> Silks and
Muzlins, like Flower-pots, for a ſhow.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Turky,</hi> or <hi>Straits</hi> Trade, is carried on partly with our Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
Manufactures, and partly with Silver ſent from <hi>England,</hi> and
taken in at <hi>Cadiz;</hi> and it gives us in return Raw Silks of divers
ſorts, and a very good Staple, <hi>Grogerom</hi> Yarn, Druggs in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance;
(the vent of which hath a great dependence upon
our Taverns) Gauls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which are Commodities that are not
fully Manufactured; and I think that this Trade deſerves the
favour of our Nation when it is in a flouriſhing Condition:
But at preſent our Coin being low, and the ballance of Trade
ſo much againſt us, a Cloth Cloak ſeems as proper for our
Wear as one of Camlet, ſince we run ſo great a hazard to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the Latter; and our <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants Eſtates being brought
home at a great Expence to our Nation, it appears to me to
be of great moment, to conſider whether this Straits Trade
does not yield too great an advantage to the <hi>Turks,</hi> in taking
from them their Silks, <hi>Grogerom</hi> Yarn, Druggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for our
Mony and Cloth (that are both advantagious Commodities
to encourage a War) when they are virtually our Enemies,
as they act againſt the Emperor, and are encouraged by the
King of <hi>France,</hi> whilſt our Nation is only Impoveriſh'd with
their Commodities, and we have quick vent for our Cloth
to <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> for the uſe of our own Army; and
to procure Linnens from thoſe parts that our Nation is in
need of at home, to be at charge to impoveriſh our ſelves, is
but Tapping our Veſſel at both ends; which may ſerve in an
Election, but not in a War: Whilſt it is evident that the good
ſucceſs of the War that we are at preſent engag'd in, doth
very much depend upon the ſtrength of that ſide that is like
to ſupport it longeſt. Our Expences in the way of living and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97722:5"/>
carrying on our War, hath drained our Treaſure (in ocular
Demonſtration) to a very low Ebb: And thoſe Streams that
brought in our Treaſure from <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> are
evidently diverted into another Channel: So that without
conſideration, we muſt inevitably fall. It is not an <hi>Indian</hi>
Dreſs ſet forth with Scarlet Ribbons, kept warm with a Sable-Tippet,
or the eaſie Victories that we obtain over a Glaſs of
Red; nor indeed our Paper Credit, that will put the French
King upon advantagious Offers of Peace; but indeed the quite
contrary. And this leads me to the conſideration of the
profitable part of our Trade, which is in the hands of other
Nations.</p>
            <p>Our Trade to <hi>Holland, Flanders, Germany,</hi> and <hi>Hamborough,</hi>
is carried on with the Native Commodities of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and we are furniſhed from thence with Linnens of all
kinds, agreeable to all ranks of People, Whalebone, Wire, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Spicery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the ballance of Trade in theſe parts
in former days, was always upon our ſide: They have taken
from us Eighty Thouſand Broad-Cloths a Year; and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of Fifty Thouſand in Cottons and Kerſies (as Sir <hi>Walter
Raleigh</hi> tells us:) But then our general Wear in <hi>England</hi> in
fine Linnens, was Hollands, Cambricks, Sileſia Lawns, and
other fine Flaxen Linnens from <hi>Flanders;</hi> and I think we
knew no Muſlins untill about Five and twenty years ſince;
ever ſince we got the Manufacture of our Wooll from the
<hi>Flemings,</hi> as oft as any good opportunity hath been offer'd, it hath
always been improv'd to draw it thither again; and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
the benefit being ſo great. And ſince we have obtained
upon them beyond their power in that particular, a farther
Conteſt hath oft times aroſe about the Merchandize of our
Woollen Manufacture; whether they ſhould fix a Factory in
<hi>England,</hi> (or employ Engliſh Factors, which is the ſame)
to buy our Woollen Manufactures, and ſell their Linnens at
the utmoſt advantage of our Markets? or, Whether we ſhould
have the Merchandize of our Native Commodities fix a
Factory in thoſe parts, and buy their Commodities at the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of their Markets? That ſide which prevails in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
doth gain the Merchandize, the Freight, the management
of the Exchange, and the Government of Trade; a matter
worth contending for. From <hi>Henry</hi> IV. to <hi>Edward</hi> VI.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97722:6"/>
the Merchandize of our Woollen Manufactures, was divided
between our Merchant Adventurers and the Foreign Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
of the Still-yard, but for the encouragement of our
Engliſh Merchants, Aliens Duties were always paid by the Still-yard
Merchants, notwithſtanding Naturalization, untill the
Twenty ſecond year of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. at which time there was
an Act made, that Denizens ſhould pay the ſame Duties that
Aliens did. But the Merchants of the Stil-yard by their
Mony, got themſelves exempt, under the title of Merchants
of the Houſe of <hi>Almain,</hi> or <hi>Tutonicorum:</hi> And I dread no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more at this time than Foreign Merchants under the
title <hi>Tutonicorum:</hi> For theſe Merchants got their firſt footing
in <hi>England</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. by lending him Mony
to carry on his Wars abroad. This was a great point gain'd
up on the Engliſh Merchants. And in the 32 <hi>Henry.</hi> VIII. <hi>cap.</hi>
16. it appears, that Aliens Duties in the general was taken
off by the King's Proclamation. This advantage prevailed
ſo far upon the Foreign Merchants ſide, that in the year 1552, the
Fifth year of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. they Shipp'd off Forty four thouſand
Cloths, and our Engliſh Merchants not Four thouſand; and
all was Exported and Imported in Foreign Bottoms, as appears
by the Journals of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. The Engliſh Merchants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at this low Ebb, put in their Complaint to the King and
Council againſt theſe Merchants <hi>Tutonicorum;</hi> and they gave
in their Anſwer to the ſaid Complaint, upon the Eighteenth
day of <hi>January;</hi> and upon the Twenty fifth their Anſwer
was delivered to ſome Learned Counſel, to peruſe it, upon
the Eighteenth day of <hi>February.</hi> The Merchant Adventurers
put in their Replication to the ſaid Anſwer: And upon the
Twenty third a Decree was made by the Board, <hi>That upon
knowledge and information of their Charters, they had found</hi> Firſt,
<hi>That they were no ſufficient Corporation.</hi> Secondly, <hi>That their
Names, Numbers and Nations were unknown.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>When</hi>
Edward IV. <hi>did reſtore them to their Privileges, it was upon the
condition, that they ſhould cover no Foreigners Goods, which they
had done.</hi> For theſe Conſiderations, Sentence was given,
<hi>That they had forfeited their Liberties, and were to be no more than
Strangers.</hi> Upon the 28<hi>th.</hi> day came Ambaſſadors from <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,
Lubeck,</hi> and the Regent of <hi>Flanders</hi> to ſpeak upon the
behalf of theſe Merchants <hi>Tutonicorum.</hi> And upon the 2<hi>d.</hi> of
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97722:6"/>
               <hi>March,</hi> the Anſwer for the Ambaſſadors was committed to
the Lord Chancellor, the two Secretaries, Sir <hi>Robert Bowes,</hi>
and Sir <hi>John Baker,</hi> Judge <hi>Mountague Griffith;</hi> Sollicitors
<hi>Goſnald, Goodrick</hi> and <hi>Brooks.</hi> It remain'd under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
until the firſt day of <hi>May,</hi> and then the Merchants
<hi>Tutonicorum,</hi> received their full Anſwer, confirming the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Judgment of the Counſel. This gave encouragement
to a great many Engliſh Merchants to come into this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.
And in <hi>October</hi> the Third following, Three hundred
Merchants of this Company of Merchant Adventurers, met
together, and lent <hi>Edward</hi> VI. Forty thouſand Pounds to
be paid in <hi>Flanders:</hi> And they Ship'd off Forty thouſand
Cloaths. And the Merchandize to theſe parts, remained in
Engliſh hands from this time till the year 1663. And now
it is reduced to the ſame low ebb again, Aliens Duties ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been taken off ever ſince the <hi>25th. of Charles</hi> II. and
the ſame inconveniences attended our Nation at that time
as we labour under at preſent. In point of Gold, it is thus
expreſt in a Statute made the ſame year, <hi>Divers
Covetous Perſons of their own Authority,<note place="margin">Anno Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Edw. VI. Cap. 19.</note> have of
late taken upon them to make Exchanges as well of
Coined Gold as Coined Silver; receiving and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore more in value than hath been declared by the King's
Proclamation to be current for, to the great hindrance of the
Common-wealth.</hi> Before I part with this conſiderable branch
of our Trade, I cannot but take notice of a very great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
that was put upon <hi>Flanders</hi> in the 12<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Car.</hi> II.
in the ſettling of our Books of Rates; as if we had been at
that time in a Confederacy with the King of <hi>France,</hi> we were
to put a ſtop to their Trade, that he might buy the better
Penniworths in their Towns; each Ell of <hi>Flanders</hi> Linnens is
charged at five Shillings to pay Cuſtom; which was four
times the Cuſtom of any Linnens from <hi>France</hi> at that time.</p>
            <p>I come now to conſider our new Drapery in our Trade
to <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> which is the greateſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that <hi>England</hi> ever made: This brings home our Silver,
Spaniſh Wool, Cochineal, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated
for ſome time, in the beginning of the Reign of
<hi>James</hi> I. But we knew no ſuch thing as our new Drapery
in thoſe days.</p>
            <pb n="10" facs="tcp:97722:7"/>
            <p>Our Nation hath loſt Five hundred thouſand Pounds <hi>per
Annum,</hi> by not Incorporating our <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade. This New
Drapery of ours hath ſet up <hi>France</hi> in Merchandize, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
<hi>Holland.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> turned their Claret, Brandy,
Alamodes and Luteſtrings, into <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Bays, Serges, and
Perpetuana's, and ſent them to <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi>
and had in return to <hi>France</hi> pieces of Eight, Spaniſh Wool,
Cochineal, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and by this means made themſelves
Maſters of a third part of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade. This Trade
at preſent is almoſt wholly centred in the hands of the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> which makes them Maſters of the Silver, which is
brought into <hi>Holland</hi> to ſerve our occaſions as well as their
own; and by Bills ſent into <hi>England,</hi> they have gain'd 25 <hi>l.
per. Cent.</hi> to buy our Bays and Serges for <hi>Spain,</hi> to fetch
home more Silver; which muſt be a very gainful Trade to
them. And this open Trade to <hi>Holland</hi> in the Channel
now it is in, muſt unavoidably deſtroy our Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in the general. The chief Branch of this <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Trade that we are intereſſed in, is with the <hi>Portugues</hi> for
Wine, who have laid a very high Duty upon our Woollen
Manufactures, almoſt to a Prohibition. So this muſt be the
purchaſe of our Mony from <hi>Cadiz.</hi> So that in the <hi>Weſt</hi> as
well as the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> the impoveriſhing part of Trade
falls to our lot, and the profitable part of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> And
the moſt encouraging thought that offers to my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
in this whole matter, is, that what we have loſt ſince the
Wars, hath chiefly fallen into the hands of our Allies, who
are engaged with us in the War, and neareſt the Danger,
who in Gratitude will bear a greater ſhare if need require,
being as well able to do that as lend us Mony. Charity
ſeems now to begin at home, and ſhould we Mortgage and
Borrow much longer, <hi>Vul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing-herbs
did appear: This was but a melancholy Anſwer; but
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97722:7"/>
it had been overwhelming, had there been no certainty of
the Spring. And we find a careful Shepherd upon the firſt
notice that a Sheep is ſeized with Worms, inſtantly beſtirs
himſelf to a Cure, knowing that they will not only eat on,
but ingender; which is neareſt my Simile, being upon the
Golden Fleece. I have now gone through the eaſie part of
my Task, and yet the nature of our Diſtemper beſpeaks its
own Cure. There appears to me but one way to bring the
Ballance of Trade upon our ſide, which if dextrouſly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd,
would ſoon effect it. We have many conſiderable
Traders at preſent employed in bringing home ſuperfluous
Commodities, that are purchaſed with our Bullion, to the
hindrance of our own Native Commodities. Another ſort
of People that are droniſhly employed in Clubbing their
Stocks to ingroſs Commodities, under pretence of Banks for
the good of the Publick, whereby our Nation is Exciſed at
a very ill time. A third ſort, of no inconſiderable number,
that like <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Fleas, ſhelter themſelves in the Fleece,
and Charity muſt be very high, to judge ſome of them by
their Actions, to be in any other way for Heaven; and theſe
like a dead weight hang upon the Maſter-wheel of our Trade,
which gives motion to all the reſt; theſe live ſplendidly in a
needleſs Imployment, between the Maker of our Woollen
Manufacture and the Buyer, when at the ſame we as much want
Hands and Stock to Export our Native Commodities to <hi>Spain,
Flanders, Germany</hi> and <hi>Hamborough,</hi> thereby to bring home a
real profit to our Nation in a fair way of Trade; and to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
theſe Hands from the one, and ingage upon the other, is
what I chiefly offer at, which I humbly conceive muſt be done
by ſharpneſs upon one Hand, and incouragement upon the
other. Corruption hath ſo far prevail'd among us, that no
Law can be effectual to prevent the Exportation of our Mony
when there is a profit to be made thereby; and the higher Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
are ſet upon Commodities that are any way handy, the
leſs Mony is brought in to the King. The K of <hi>France</hi> made a
Market of us by the prohibition of his Alamodes and Lute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrings,
they were always plenty and the Cuſtom ſaved; and
Faſhion is truly termed a Witch, the dearer and ſcacrer any
Commodity, the more the Mode; 30 <hi>s.</hi> a yard for Muſlins,
and only the ſhadow of a Commodity, when procured. This
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97722:8"/>
muſt be effected, on this ſide, by Acts of Parliament, whoſe
Penalties muſt force their own Execution, ſtrictly prohibiting
the Conſumption of theſe ſuperfluous Commodities that drain
our Treaſure. And I am confirmed in this Opinion by the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of former Days, when the ſame neceſſity required it.
In the 5th Year of <hi>Richard</hi> II. we have this account of the
ſtate of the Nation at that time, and what was
done.<note place="margin">Anno quinto Rich. 2. cap. 2.</note> 
               <hi>For the great miſchief which the Realm ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth,
and long hath done, for that Gold and Silver,
as well in Mony, Veſſels, Plate and Jewels, as otherwiſe, by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes
made in divers manners, is carried out of the Realm, ſo
that in effect there is none thereof left; which thing, if it ſhould lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
be ſuffered, would ſhortly be the deſtruction of the ſame Realm
(which God prohibit) it is aſſerted and recorded, and the King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joineth
all manner of People,</hi> &amp;c. The ſubſtance of this Act was
to prohibit the Exportation of our Mony, particularly level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at the Cuſtom-houſe Officers in an extraordinary Reward
to be given by the King, if any of them was found tardy in
this Affair: And that which was the chiefeſt care at this time,
was the ſetting the price of Wine to be ſold in Groſs or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail,
and the forfeiture of them that ſell them dearer; and a
Power given to the chief Officer of a City or Borough to ſell
them at the ſame Prices if the Owner would not; and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidy
granted to the King, ſo that the Mony that comes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
may be wholly imploy'd upon the keeping of the Sea. I
cann't but here obſerve the good Genius of this
time,<note place="margin">Anno ſexto Rich. 2. c. 3.</note> in ſo ingenuous and frank a Confeſſion of the
Truth, whilſt, like the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> we are Rich in
Fancy or Deſign,<note place="margin">In <hi>H—d.</hi>
               </note> a multitude of weighty Mony hoarded up
—which will be brought out—</p>
            <p>The next parallel that I obſerve of this nature,<note place="margin">If you will ſell your Liberties.</note> is <hi>anno
quinto &amp; ſexto Edw. 6. cap. 19.</hi> where it is thus expreſt, <hi>That
divers covetous Perſons of their own Authorities have of late taken
upon them to make Exchanges as well of coined Gold as coined Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
receiving and paying therefore more in value than hath been
declared by the Kings Proclamation to be current for, within his
Realm and other his Dominions, to the great hinderance of the
Commonwealth of this Realm,</hi> it was then Enacted, <hi>That no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
or Perſons ſhould receive or pay away any Gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>at any
other price than the ſame is or ſhall be declared by the Kings Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97722:8"/>
to be current for:</hi> Which ſeems to imply, that the
advance price of Gold was then brought down, and gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſettled by the King's Proclamation, which deſerves our
preſent Conſideration. But the next Year the price of Wine
was likewiſe ſettled at two Pence a Quart, and the number
of Taverns reduc'd to forty in the City of <hi>London.</hi> But
that which is moſt conſiderable to my preſent purpoſe, is the
Statute made the firſt Year of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary,</hi> cap 2. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall wear Silk in or upon his Hat, Bonet, Scabbord, Hoſe,
Shooes or Spur-leather, ſhall be three Months Impriſoned, and
pay 10 l. except Mayors, Aldermen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If any Perſon knowing
his Servant to offend, doth not put him forth of his Service within
fourteen Days, or do retain him again, he ſhall forfeit</hi> 100 l.
This Statute was kept on foot the whole Reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and Repeal'd in expreſs Words the firſt Year of
King <hi>James</hi> I. I ſhall only add in this Matter, that I think
our <hi>Indian</hi> Silks and Muſlins, which are fully Manufactured
abroad, do our Nation the greateſt miſchief at preſent,
and a ſtop of the conſumption of theſe will eaſe us of our
Scottiſh Fears. This I muſt confeſs was a ſharp Statute againſt
our Straits Trade, but the more we conſume of our own
Commodities, the better price we ſhall get for thoſe we ſell;
and the more the Linnens of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in <hi>England,</hi> the better able will they be to give us a
good price; and in point of Policy, more to be incouraged
at this time than <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> But a Silk-Weaver is
not out of his way when turned to Worſted, Druggets,
<hi>Norwich</hi>-Stuffs, &amp;c. What I further propoſe, is an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
ſtop to Ingroſſing of Commodities, and the preſerving
the Sale of Goods in the publick Market, which will bring in
a good Stock into the advantage of the publick; and none ſo
fit to make Merchants to Export our Woollen Manufactures,
as thoſe Perſons that underſtand them; hereby our Cloth-factors
may be capable to pay that Debt which they owe to
the publick. Should we New-Coin our Mony to its full
Weight, and not remove this Temptation of Exporting it,
it will be but a Compliment to us, and ſoon make its <hi>Exit.</hi>
A multitude of Paper hath been ſpent upon the ſubject of our
Coin, moſt of which I take to be no other than the Cry of a
Lapwing, when his Neſts is like to be diſturbed; and the great
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97722:9"/>
alteration of Exchanges, the ſame with the Scholar, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured,
in his Declamation, to poſſeſs his Auditors with
the Belief of a dimneſs that had befallen the World, by the
unhappy Accident of an Aſs that drank up the Moon. If we
are honeſt and keep our Mony at home, as Law requires, it is
the ſame thing whether an Ounce of Silver is order'd to go for
5 <hi>s.</hi> or 5 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> if it anſwer the end that it was deſigned for
in the accommodation of Trade; that in one Commodity that
I have an overplus, I ſhall receive another that my need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires;
and good care hath been ſucceſſively taken that no
Foreign Merchant ſhould ſell any Foreign Commodities, but
he ſhould lay out his Mony in <hi>England;</hi> for we are able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
Commodities for any Commodity that our Occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and let Foreign Bullion take its own courſe, whilſt
the Government of the Mint is in the King's Hand.</p>
            <p>And in this Counter-Scuffle about our Coin, to my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
there appear'd a Jackdaw amongſt the Rooks,
in his artificial diſtinction of the Extrinſic, Intrinſic and
Real Value of our Coin, adherent to the <hi>Species,</hi> when a
Dog won't eat it; and I always thought that the real Value
was in the Commodities exchange, one for the other, and
but virtually in the Mony.</p>
            <p>But I proceed to my Deſign in Hand, the Incouragement
of our Trade, by ſuch good Laws that were recommended
by His Majeſty's moſt Gracious Speech, which will give
Incouragement to all our Subjects in general to fall in to the
Exportation of our Native Commodities, which can alone
relieve us. And this can be done but by theſe two ways:
Firſt, by Incorporating thoſe Places that are moſt proper
for our Old and New Drapery, and then making thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
ſo Extenſive (each Perſon Trading with his own
Stock) that it may be ſecure from Monopoly. In the next
place, by Repealing the Statute of the 25 <hi>Car.</hi> II. that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
Aliens Duties, which in the firſt Year of Queen
<hi>Eliz.</hi> were call'd the ancient Revenues of the Crown. And
nothing hath conduced ſo much to our preſent Calamity, as
the colouring Foreigners Goods; our Nation hath hereby
been ſurprized, and our Intereſt ſupplanted, and Poverty is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
the Daughter of Perjury, and this hath been the Ruin
of our Seamen, which hath been twice recommended by His
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97722:9"/>
Majeſty's Speech. By this Statute of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> all Engliſh
Merchants were obliged to Ship their Goods up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Engliſh Ships, or pay Aliens Duties; inſtead<note place="margin">Primo Eliz. cap. 13.</note>
of ten Groats for a Cloth to pay a Noble. And
it is a vain thing to expect that a <hi>German</hi> Merchant ſhall
ſend for an Engliſh Ship to <hi>Bremen,</hi> to carry his Linnens
for <hi>England?</hi> Or, that he ſhould order his Factor here to
ſend his Cloth in any other than upon his own bottom, when
he is likely to be concerned in the Shipping? The Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
and Freight will be one good ſtep towards the bringing
the ballance upon our ſide.</p>
            <p>The loſs of the Manufacture of ſo great a part of our Wool
which is Exported, and the Exportation of ſo great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of our Woollen Manufacture, not fully Manufactured,
is at preſent a very impoveriſhing conſequence to us; we
loſe <hi>cent. per cent.</hi> in the firſt, and twenty <hi>per cent</hi> in the latter.</p>
            <p>Application hath been made by the Clothiers in the firſt of
theſe, and by the Diers in the latter: But it hath not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
been worth our Notice; and the preſent Bill to
prevent the Exportation of Wool as it is Drawn, is
certainly an incouragement to Exportation: The turning
of Felony into a Premunire is in this caſe the ſame thing,
it being the ſame benefit to the Informer; and the keeping
of the Statute a foot of the firſt of King <hi>William</hi> and Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> is giving an allowance to Export 3300 Todd of
Wool to the Iſland of <hi>Jerſie</hi> and <hi>Gernſie,</hi> more than was
allowed by the Statute of the 12 <hi>Car.</hi> II. and under the
ſhelter of 6600 there may be 60000, and <hi>Southampton</hi> is the
only place in <hi>England</hi> to wound us in this Particular: It
commands the beſt Wool in <hi>England</hi> in its kind, in a place
that is remote from our chiefeſt places of its Manufacture;
and how eaſie is it for <hi>French</hi> Lute-Strings, Alamodes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
to be Imported upon us in the ſame Channel. In the 27
Year of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> III. it was made Felony to
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Men to Export Wool upon the pain of Life and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,

writ of Eſcheat in the caſe. They then found this Felony
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97722:10"/>
to be a ſnare in the matter, and in the 38 of the ſame Reign
they repeal'd the Felony, and continued the other forfeiture;
and why we may not at this time Colect a moderate Duty
out of all our Woollen Manufacture Exported, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fully Manufactured, as well as our Fore-Fathers did ſo
conſiderable a Duty out of our Wool that was Exported
when it is growing ſo faſt upon us, is beyond my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.
The Duty ariſing out of Wool from the Staple
at <hi>Callis,</hi> was 38000 Pounds a year, which may be computed
at 100000 at this time; whilſt theſe Commodities Died
in <hi>Holland,</hi> are Exported to <hi>Spain, Germany,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies;</hi>
to which places we are able to ſend. It was
Enacted in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. that no Cloth ſhould be
Exported until it was Barbed, Rowed, Shorn; and the full
art of Dying was not obtained until of late years, but of
very great concern to us to ſecure it as far as we can: Dying
Wares are very bulky, and affects our Shipping, brings a
Duty to the King. Many Commodities are of our own
growth, as Allom, Coperas, Wooll, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it imploys
variety of Artificers in Dying, Preſſing, Liſting, Tillet-Painting,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt thing that I humbly recommend for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our Trade in Foreign parts, is the redreſſing the
cheating abuſes in Trade, by falſifying and ſtraining our
Manufactures; and giving all encouragement to true making:
A piece of Engliſh Cloth brought to its Perfection, is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Commodity: And by ſlight making and falſifying it, we
give an advantage to Foreign Nations to gain upon us, with
Commodities of a worſe quality, but better made; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
give away thoſe advantages which Providence hath given
us: And the Name of God is hereby Blaſphemed among the
<hi>Turks,</hi> through us Chriſtians, which is like the Whoredoms
of <hi>Jezabel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Common-wealth is at this time very much oppreſt by
Ingroſſing. An Exciſe for the Common good was not thought
adviſable, whilſt in the mean while we are brought into it
by private hands. One hundred thouſand Chaldron of Coals
it's believed hath been bought up by Perſons that deſigned
to make a Market of them; and the fit diſtance between
a <hi>Lady-day</hi> and <hi>Michaelmas</hi> that the Act was to commence
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97722:10"/>
with a conſiderable Duty, gave good encouragement: The
mildneſs of the Winter, through God's Providence, hath
hitherto prevented the ſharpneſs of their Deſigns; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which, Coals are now worth Six and forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
a Chaldron. By a Statute now in force, which was
made in the 7th year of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. it was Enacted, <hi>That
no Perſon, or Perſons, ſhall buy any Wood, Coals, or Fuel, but only
ſuch that will burn or conſume the ſame,<note place="margin">Homo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Lupus.</note> or ſuch Perſon that will
ſell the ſame by Retail to ſuch as will burn and conſume the ſame
by their own occupying, without fraud or covin, upon forfeiture of
treble the value of the Coals, one half to the King, and one half
to the Informer.</hi> If Fifty thouſand Chaldron of theſe forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Coals were applied to the King's uſe upon a treble forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
at forty Shillings a Chaldron, it would advance Three
hundred thouſand Pounds; which would help well at this
time. Spaniſh and Engliſh Wooll is Engroſs'd, Oil, Cochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal,
all Commodities where Engroſſing is practicable; and
a very great Complaint upon our Engliſh Wooll from all
parts of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the 4th year of <hi>Edward</hi> IV. it was Enacted, <hi>That no
Perſon for three years ſhould buy any Wooll, unleſs he made it into
Yarn, or ſome ſort of Manufacture.</hi> This Act was continued
in the 4th Year of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. for 10 Years longer, limited
to 28 Counties. The ſame Act was continued for 10 Years
more, in the 22d Year of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. And in the 5th and
6th Years of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. it was made general, but with that
great caution, that the King by his Proclamation ſhould
diſſolve the ſaid Act; notwithſtanding which it remained in
force 70 Years, and was repealed the 21ſt Year of <hi>James</hi> Iſt.
and the reviving of this Act would be a double advantage
to Trade, in preventing the Exportation of Wooll, and in
enhanſing the Price of it. Preſidents are ſafe Rules to walk
by, the Intereſt being ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>At a common heap of Loſſes in <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s time, he tells us
of one <hi>Codrus</hi> that brought a good burthen to the heap in a
great zeal, <hi>Nihil habuit Codrus; quis enim negat? Et tamen
infelix perdidit totum nihil.</hi> Our Loſſes are not come upon us
upon a ſudden; we have many <hi>Codrus's</hi> that have loſt French
Commiſſions, which were carried on under Engliſh Colours
for two or three <hi>per Cent.</hi> whilſt the French Merchant ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97722:11"/>
thereby five, or ſix <hi>per. Cent.</hi> in his Cuſtoms; French
Wines being charged 30 <hi>s. per</hi> Tun upon Aliens accounts,
whilſt theſe Men would be thought to have loſt their Eſtates
too, tho they had none. And were all the Commiſſions
known that are at this time managed for Foreigners under
Engligh Colours, this ſhort account would anſwer its Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles;
and no wonder, when our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſhall
carry on a Trade for the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and ſell their Goods for a
Commiſſion, or Permiſſion, as they call it; which is plain
demonſtration to me, That if <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> was a better
Market for <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities then <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Calendar</hi>
the <hi>Perſian</hi> would find out a way to carry them thither,
and not pay 18 <hi>per cent.</hi> to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, to ſell
them in <hi>England;</hi> and how great their ſhare was in the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Ships is not mentioned; ſo that to pretend that our
<hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade do as well bring in Money as ſend it out,
is at this time but impoſing upon the Publick; and ſo long
as we have a Mint going in the <hi>Indies,</hi> as their Papers tell
us, to Coin Silver, I doubt we ſhall want it at home; but
after all, nothing can keep us poor but our own Diviſions.
And how little is that Merchant to be pitied, who, when ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
from the imminent danger of <hi>Caribdis,</hi> by the haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardous
interpoſition of a Friend, and adviſed to ſtear a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
courſe, ſhould yet contrary to ſuch advice, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and practiſed Rules of Navigation ſplit his Ship upon
<hi>Scilla.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now gon through that Task to the beſt of my
judgment, which my Native Intereſt engaged me in, and
ſubmit the whole to the Conſideration of this Auguſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
