            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi>'s Council prayed that the return might be Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
and it was so, and <hi>Friday</hi> following appointed for debating the suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency
of the return, and in the mean time directions were given to his
Council to attend the Judges and Attorney General, with their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the return, and my Lord was remanded till that day, and it was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101256:3"/>
said that though the return was filed, the Court could remand or Commit
him to the <hi>Marshalsea</hi> at their Election.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> the Earl was brought into Court again, and his Council
argued the insufficiency of the return.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Williams</hi> said, That the Cause was of great consequence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that the King was touched in his Prerogative; the Subject was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
in his Liberty, and this Court in its Jurisdiction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>1st.</hi> The Cause of Commitment which is returned, is not sufficient
for the general Allegations of high Contempts is too uncertain, for the
Court cannot judge of the Contempt, if it doth not appear in what act it
consists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly.</hi> It is not known where the Contempts were committed, and in
favour of liberty, it shall be intended they were committed out of the
House of Peers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly.</hi> The time is uncertain, so that, peradventure, it was before the
last Act of General Pardon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>4thly,</hi> It does not appear whether the Commitment were on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
or accusation only.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, but that the return of such a Commitment, by
any other Court, would be too general and uncertain, <hi>More. 893, Ast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish</hi>
was Bailed on a return, <hi>quod commissus fuit per mandatum.</hi> N. <hi>Milit.
Dni. Custod. Magn. Sigil Angliae virtute cujusdem contemptus in curia facti,</hi> and in
that Book, that divers other persons were bailed on such general returns,
and the Cases have been lately affirmed in <hi>Bushels</hi> Case, reported by the
late Lord Chief Justice <hi>Vaughan,</hi> where it is expresly said that such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
and return being too general and uncertain, the Court can't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
in an implicite manner, that in truth the Commitment, was for
causes particular and sufficient.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vaughan</hi>'s Reports, 140. <hi>Accord. 2. Inst. 52, 53. &amp; 55.</hi> and the 1. <hi>Rolls.
218.</hi> and though the Commitment of the Jurors was for acquitting <hi>Pen</hi>
and <hi>Mead, contra plenam &amp; manifestam evidentiam:</hi> it was resolved to be too
general, for the evidence ought to appear as certainly to the Judge of the
return, as it appears before the Judge authorised to Commit. <hi>Rush. Case.
137.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Commitment being by the House of Peers will make no diff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence;
for in all Cases where a matter comes in Judgment before this
Court, let the question be of what nature it will, the Court is obliged to
declare the Law, and that without distinction, whether the question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
in Parliament or no. In the Case of <hi>Geo. Binion</hi> in <hi>C. B.</hi> there was
a long Debate, <hi>Whether an Original Writ might be Filed against a Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
during the time of Priviledge;</hi> and it was urged, <hi>that it being during
the Session of Parliament, the termination of the Question did belong to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:101256:3"/>
but it was resolved that an Original might be filed, and <hi>Bridgman</hi>
then Chief Justice, said that the Court was obliged to declare the Law in
all Cases that came in Judgment before them. <hi>H. 4. Ed. 4. Rut. 4. 7. 10.</hi>

which was cited in the Case of the Earl of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and is entred in
the Lords Journal.</p>
            <p>An Accord of wast, depended between them in the Common-Please,
and the Court was divided and the Record was Certified into the House
of Lords, and they gave direction that the Judgment should be Entred,
for the Plantiff afterwards on a Writ of Error, brought in this Court
that Judgment was Reversed: Notwithstanding the Objection, that it
was given by order of the House of Lords; for the Court was Obliged
to proceed according to the Law in a matter that was before them in
point of Judgment. Not long since the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> Exhibited an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
against the Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> to the House of Lords, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
divers matters whereof some did arise out of Parliament, and it
was referred to the Judges to consider whether that procedure was Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
and the 4th. <hi>July 1663.</hi> it was resolved by the Judges that the
Lords ought not to proceed only upon an Impeachment by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
when the matters arise out of the House.</p>
            <p>The Construction of all Acts of Parliament, are given to the Courts
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and accordingly they have Judges of Validity of Acts
of Parliament, they have searched the Rolls of Parliament, <hi>Hub.
109.</hi> Lord <hi>Hunsdons</hi> Case, they have determined whether the Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
be a Record: <hi>Hub. 110:</hi> When a point comes before them in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
they are not fore closed by any Act of the Lords, but ought to
Judge according to the Law, by which the Realm is Governed and not
by the Lords: if it appears that an Act of Parliament be made by the
King and the Lords without the Commons, that Act is <hi>Felo-de-se,</hi> and
the Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi> ought to judge it voide, 4. <hi>H. 7. 18. Hub.</hi> 111.
and accordingly they ought to do, if this return contain in it that which is
fatal to it self, it hath been a question often resolved in this Court when a
Writ of Error in Parliament, shall be a supersedias, and this Court hath
determined that shall be said to be a Session of Parliament, 1. <hi>Rolls.</hi> 29.
and if the Law were otherwise there would be a failure of Justice if the
Parliament were Desolved, there would be no question but the Prisoner
should be discharged on a <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> and yet then the Court must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101256:4"/>
the cause of Commitment, and by Consequence a matter Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary,
and the Court may now have Cognissance of the matter, as
clearly as when the Parliament is Desolved, the Party would be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remedy for his Liberty, if he could not find it here, for it is not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for him to procure the Lords to determine their pleasure for his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,
for before his Enlargement he must have the Pleasures of the
King to be determined, and that ought to be in this Court, and therefore
the Prisoner ought first to resort hither.</p>
            <p>Let us suppose (for it does not appear in the return, and the Court
ought not to Enquire of any matter out of it,) that the supposed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
was a thing done out of the House; it would be hard for this
Court to remand him: Suppose he were removed to a Forraign Prison,
during the Pleasure of the Lords: No doubt, but that would have been
an Illegal Commitment against <hi>Magna Charta</hi> and the Petition; there the
Commitment would have been Expresly Illegal, and it may be this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
may be no less; for if it had been Expresly shewn, and if he be
remanded, he is Committed by this Court who are to answer for his
Imprisonment.</p>
            <p>But 2, the limitation of the Imprisonment during the Pleasures of the
King and the House is Illegal and uncertain; for since it ought to determin
in two Courts, it can have no certain Period, a Commitment until he
shall be Discharged by Kings Bench and Common Pleas is Illegal; for
the Prisoner can't apply himself in such a manner as to obtain his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.
If a Man be Committed to further order <hi>Cook</hi> saith, he is Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
presently, for that Imports till he shall be delivered in good course
of Law, and if this Commitment have not that Sence, it is Illegal, for
the pleasure of the King is that which shall be determined according to
Law in his Courts, as where the Stat. of <hi>Westminster, 1 Chap. 15.</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
that he is not reprovable, who is taken by Command of the King,
who ought not to extend to an Extra judicial Command but in his Courts
of Justice, to which all matters of Judicature are deligated and distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.
<hi>2 Inst.</hi> 186. and 187.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wollop,</hi> To the same purpose, cited <hi>Bushels</hi> case, <hi>Vaughan, 137.</hi> that
the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> return for high Contempts was not sufficient, and the
Court that made the Commitment in this Case makes no difference, in
the Case for otherwise one may be Imprisoned by the House of Peers Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly,
for a matter relevable here and yet shall be without any manner
of relief, by such a return, for on Supposition that this Court ought not
to meddle where the person is Committed by the Peers, any person at
any time and for any Cause may be subject to a perpetual Imprisonment
at the Pleasure of the Lords.</p>
            <p>And the Law is otherwise for the House of Lords is the Supream
Court yet their Jurisdiction is limited by the Common and Statute-Law,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101256:4"/>
and their Excises are examinable in this Court, for there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the Errors and Excise in and of a Court between an Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
proceeding without Jurisdidiction, which is void and a meer Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<hi>4. H. 7. 18. 6.</hi> in the Parliament the King would have one attain it
of Treason, and lose his Lands, and the Lords assented but nothing was
said of the Commons, wherefore all the Justices held clearly that it was
no Act, and he was restored to his Land, and without doubt in the same
case if the Party had been Imprisoned, the Justices might have made
the like resolution that he ought to have been discharged.</p>
            <p>It is a solaecisme that a Man shall be Imprisoned by a limited Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and it shall not be examinable, whether the cause were within their
Jurisdiction or not, if the Lords without the Commons should grant a
Tax, and one that refused to pay it should be Imprisoned, the Tax is
void, but by a general Commitment the Party shall be remedyless if so be
the Lords should award a <hi>Capias</hi> for Treason or Fellony.</p>
            <p>By these Instances it appears that their Jurisdiction was restrained by
the Common Law, and it is also restrained by divers Acts of Parliament,
<hi>1 Hen. 4. Chap. 14.</hi> no Appeals shall be made, or any ways pursued or
where a Statute is made a Power is Implicitly given to this Court by the
Fundamental Institution, which makes the Judges Expositors of Acts of
Parliament; and peradventure if all this case appeared upon the return
this might be a Case in which they were restrained by the Stat. 4. <hi>Hen. 8.

to be Communed or Treated of, shall be utterly void and of no
Effect, now it does not appear, but this is a Correction and Punishment
Imposed upon the Earl, contrary to the Statute, there is no question now
made of the Power of the Lords, but it is only urged that it is necessary
for them to declare by Vertue what Power they proceed otherwise the
Liberty of every <hi>English</hi> Man shall be subject to the Lords, whereof they
may deprive any of them against an Act of Parliament, but no usage
can justify such a proceeding. <hi>Elsmores</hi> Case of the Post, <hi>Nati. 19.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was Impeached by the Commons of High Treason, and
Misdemeanors, the Lords were in doubt whether they should proceed
upon such a general Impeachment to Imprison the Duke, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
of the Judges being demanded, and their Resolution given in the
Negative the Lords were satisfied. This Case is mentioned with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
to shew the respect given to the Judges, and that the Judges have
determined the highest matters in Parliament. At a Conference held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Lords and the Commons, 3d. <hi>April. 4. Car.</hi> concerning the
right and Priviledge of the Subject, it was declared and agreed, that no
Freeman ought to be Committed or restrained by Commitment of the
King or Privy Councel, or any other (in which the House of Peers is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101256:5"/>
included,) unless some cause of Commitment, Restraint, or Detainor,
be set forth for which by Law he ought to be Committed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the King who is the head of the Parliament, nor the Privy
Councel who is a Court of State, to which secrecy is so necessary may
not Imprison without shewing cause <hi>a fortiori:</hi> The Lords in Parliament
can't, which are a Court of Law as well as a Court of State, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ought not to proceed in an Illegal manner, tis true in 1. <hi>Rolls. 192.
Rushworths</hi> Case, <hi>Cook</hi> is of Opinion that the Privy Councel may Commit
without shewing cause, but in his more Mature Age, he was of another
Opinion and accordingly the Law is declared in the Petition of
Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Smith</hi> argued to the same purpose, and said a Judge cannot make a
Judgment unless the Fact appears to him and on an <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> the
Judge can only take notice of the Fact returned, it is lawful for any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
that finds himself agrieved by any Sentence or Judgment to Petition
the King in an humble manner for redress and where the Subject is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
of his liberty the proper place for him to apply himself unto is
this Court which hath the Supream Power as to this purpose, over all
Courts and on an <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Ishuing hence, the King ought to have
an Account of his Subject <hi>Rolls. Hab. Corp. 64. Witherlies</hi> Case, and though
the Commitment be by the Lords, yet if it be Illegal, this Court is O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
to discharge the Prisoner, as well as if he had been Illegally Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned
by any other Court; the House of Peers is a high Court but the
<hi>Kings Bench</hi> hath ever been Instructed with the Liberty of the Subject,
and if it were otherwise in case of Imprisonment by the Peers, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the King was less absolute than the Power of the Lords.</p>
            <p>It does not appear but that this Commitment was for Breach of the
Priviledge, but nevertheless if it were, this Court might give relief as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
in Sr. <hi>George Bigmores</hi> Case before cited and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

20.</hi> for the Court which has Power to judge what is Priviledge has also
Power to judge what is Contempt of Priviledge if the Judges may judge
of an Act of Parliament, <hi>A fortiori,</hi> they may judge of an order of the
Lords, 20. <hi>Ed. Butchers</hi> case, where he in Revertion brought an Action
of Wast, and dyed before Judgment, and his Heir brought an Action
for the same Wast, and the King and the Lords determined that it did lie,
and commanded the Judges to give Judgment accordingly for the time
to come, but by <hi>Ryley. 39.</hi> it appears that it is only an Order of the King
and the Lords, and that was the cause the Judges conceived that they
were not bound by it, but 39. 3. 13. and ever since have Judged the
contrary if it be admitted. for that for Breach of Priviledge may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
yet it ought to appear on the Commitment that that was the Cause,
for otherwise that may be called a Breach, which is only a refusal to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to a matter whereof the House of Lords is restrained to hold Plea by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101256:5"/>
the Stat. of the 1st. of <hi>Hen. 4.</hi> and for a Contempt Committed out of the
House they cannot Commit, for the Word Appeal in the Statute extends
to all Misdemeanors, as it was resolved by the Judges in the Earl of <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon's</hi>
Case, <hi>July. 1663.</hi> If the Imprisonment be not lawful the Court
cannot remand him to his wrongful Imprisonment, for that would be an
Act of Injustice, to Imprison him, <hi>De nono Vaughan. 156.</hi> It does not
appear whether the Contempt was a Voluntary Act, or an Opinion, or
an Inadvertency, and he has now suffered five Months Imprisonment al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
false Imprisonment is not only where the Commitment is unjust,
but where the Petition is too long. 2 <hi>Inst.</hi> 53. In this Case if this Court
cannot give Remedy, peradventure the Imprisonment shall be perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

10 or 20 Years.</p>
            <p>But all this is said on Supposition that this Session has Continuance, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the Kings giving his Royal Assent to several Laws which has
been Enacted, the Session is determined, and then their order for the Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment
is also determined <hi>Brook</hi> Parliament. 86. Every Session in which
the King Signs Bills is a day of it self, a Session of it self, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 7. A Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Act is made, the giving the Royal Assent to several Bills, shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
the Session. ('Tis true, tis there said to be made for the avoiding
all Doubts.) In the Stat. 16. <hi>Car.</hi> 1. There is a Promise to the same purpose,
and also 12. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. 1. and 22. and 23. <hi>Car. 2. 2. 1. 11. Ro. 2. No.</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>By the Opinion of <hi>Cook. 4. Inst. 27.</hi> the Royal Assent does not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
but the Authorities on which he relies, don't Warrant his Opinion,
for first in the Parliament, <hi>Roll. 1. H. 7.</hi> It appears that the Royal Assent
was given to the Act, for the reversal of the Attainder of the Members
of Parliament; the same day it was given to the other Bills, and the same
Year the same Parliament Assembled again, and then tis Probable, that
the Members which had been attained were present and not before, 8 <hi>R.
2. No.</hi> 13. is only a Judgment in Case of Treason, by Vertue of a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
reserved to them on the Statute 25. <hi>Ed. 3. Rot.</hi> Parliament. 7. <hi>H. 4.
No.</hi> 29. is not an Act of Parliament, 14. <hi>Ed. 3. N.</hi> 789. The Act is
first entred on the Roll, but on Condition the King will grant their other
Petitions, the Inference my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> makes, that the Act for the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder
of Queen <hi>Katherine, 33. H. 8.</hi> was passed before the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Session, yet it was on a Judgment given against by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
of Oyer and Terminer, and the Subsequent Act is only an Act of
Confirmation; but <hi>Cook</hi> ought to be Excused for all his Notes and Papers
were taken from him, so that this Book did not recieve his last hand, but

               </gap>is observable he was one of the Members of the Parliament, 1 <hi>Car.</hi> 1.
When the special Act before mentioned, and was made, and no Instance
can be given where an Act was passed; and afterwards the Parliament
did proceed in that Session only where there was a Precedent Agreement
between the King and the Houses, so I conclude that the order is Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101256:6"/>
with the Session, and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> ought to be Discharged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ayres</hi> to the same effect argued, That the Warrant is not sufficient;
for it does not appear that it was made by the <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> is desired in the
House of Peers; for that is <hi>corain Rege in Parliamento,</hi> so that the King and
the Commons are present in supposition of Law, and the <hi>Writ of Error</hi>
in Parliament is <hi>Inspecto Recordo nos consilio &amp; advisamento Spiritualium &amp;
Temporalium, &amp; Communitatum in Parliamento praedict' existent',</hi> &amp;c. it would
not be difficult to prove that anciently the Commons did assist there, and
now it shall be intended that they were present; for there can be no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment
against the Record. The Lords do several Acts as a distinct
House, as the <hi>Debating Bills,</hi> the <hi>Enquiring of Breaches of Priviledges,</hi> and
the Warrant in this Case being by the <hi>Lords Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> cannot
be intended otherwise, but that it was done by them in their distinct ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
and then the commitment being during the Pleasure of the King
and the House of Peers, it is manifest that the King is Principal, and His
Pleasure ought to be determined in this Court.</p>
            <p>If the Lords should commit a great Minister of State, whose Advice is
necessary for the King and the Realm, it cannot be imagined that the
King shall be without remedy for his Subject, but that he may have him
Discharged by his Writ out of this Court.</p>
            <p>This present Recess is not ordinary Adjournment; for it is entred in
the Journal that the Parliament shall not be Assembled at the Day of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment,
but Adjourned or Prorogued to another Day, if the King do
not signifie his Pleasure by Proclamation.</p>
            <p>Some other Exceptions were made to the Return.</p>
            <p>1. That no Commitment is returned, but only a Warrant to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
to receive him.</p>
            <p>2. The Return does not answer the Mandate of the Writ; for that
it is to have the Body of <hi>A. E.</hi> of <hi>S.</hi> and the return of Warrant for the
Imprisonment of <hi>A. Ashley</hi> E. of <hi>S.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Serjeant</hi> Maynard <hi>argued to maintain the Return;</hi> The House of Lords
is the Supream Court of the Realm; 'tis true this Court is superior to all Courts of
ordinary Jurisdiction, If this Commitment had been by any Inferior Court, it could
not have been maintained; But the Commitment is by a Court that is not under the
Controul of this Court; and that Court is in Law sitting at this time, and therefore
the expressing the Contempt particularly is a Matter that coutinues in the Deliberation
of that Court: 'Tis true, this Court ought to determine what the Law is in every
Case that comes before them, and in this <hi>Case</hi> the Question is only whether <hi>this
Court</hi> can judge of a <hi>Contempt</hi> committed in Parliament during the same Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Parliament, and discharge one committed for such <hi>Contempt,</hi> when

                  </gap>
               </hi>
may determine it; but now the Question is, Whether the Lords have capacity to de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>termine
their own Priviledges, and whether this <hi>Court</hi> can controul their Determi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nation,
and Discharge during their Session a Peer committed for <hi>contempt.</hi> Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:101256:6"/>
Judges have often demanded what the Law is, and how a Statute should be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of the Lords in Parliament as on the Statute of <hi>Amendments,</hi> 40 Ed. 3. 34.
6, 8. <hi>Co. 157 &amp; 158. a fortiori.</hi> The <hi>Court</hi> ought to demand their Opinion
when a Doubt ariseth on an Order made by the House of Lords now sitting.</p>
            <p>As to the Determination of the <hi>Imprisonment,</hi> doubtless the Pleasure of
the King is to be determined in the same Court where the Judgment was
given.</p>
            <p>As to the Determination of the Session the Opinion of <hi>Cooke</hi> is good Law,
and the Addition of Promises of many Acts is only <hi>in Majorem cautelam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Attorney Gen.</hi> To the same Effect, as to the uncertainty of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment,
it is to be considered that this Case differs from all other Cases
in two circumstances: 1. The Person which is committed is a Member
of the House by which he is committed (I do not take upon me to say
that the Case would be different if the person commited were not a
Peer. 2. The Court that does commit is Superior to this Court, and
therefore if the contempt had been particularly shewn of what Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
soever this Court should have been as to the contempt, yet they
would not have discharged the Earl, and thereby take upon them a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over the House of Peers.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Judges</hi> in no Age have taken upon them the Judgment of what
is <hi>Lex &amp; consuetudo Parliamenti;</hi> but here the Attempt is to engage the
<hi>Judges</hi> to give their Opinion in a matter whereof they might have
refused to have given it. If it had been demanded in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
'tis true, if a Writ be brought where Priviledge is pleaded, the
Court ought to judge of it as an Incident to the Suit whereof the Court
was possess'd; but this will be no warrant for this Court to assume a
<hi>Judgment</hi> of an original Matter arising in Parliament, and that which is
said of the <hi>Judges</hi> power to expound Statutes, cannot be denied.</p>
            <p>But it is not applicable to this Case by the same reason that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
is questioned, every commitment of the House of Commons
may be likewise questioned in this Court. It is objected, that there
would be a failure of <hi>Justice</hi> if the Earl should not be discharged; but the
contrary is true; for if he be discharged, there would be a failure of
<hi>Justice</hi> for Offences in Parliament, and therefore the Earl would be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from all manner of punishment for his Offence, if he be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
(for he must be discharged or remanded; for the Court cannot Bail
but where they have a <hi>Jurisdiction</hi> of the Matter) and so delivered out of
the Hands of the Lords, who only have power to punish him.</p>
            <p>It is objected that the contempt is not said to be committed in the
House of Peers, but it may well be intended to be committed there; for
it appears he is a Member of that House, and that the contempt was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the House; and besides there are contempts whereof they have
Cognisance though they are Committed out of the House, it is Objected
that tis possible this Contempt was Committed before the General Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101256:7"/>
but surely such Injustice shall not be supposed in the Supream Court, and it
may well be supposed to be Committed, during the Session in which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
of Prison was.</p>
            <p>It would be great difficulty for the Lords to make their Commitments so exact
and particular when they are Imployed in the <hi>Arduous</hi> Affairs of the Realm, and
it has been adjudged on a return out of <hi>Chantery,</hi> of a Commitment for a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
against a Decree that it was good, and yet the Decree was not shown.</p>
            <p>The Linnitation of the Imprisonment is well, for if the King or the House de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
their Pleasure, he shall be discharged, for then tis not the pleasure of both,
that he should be detained, and the Addition of those words during the pleasure,
is no more then was before Implied by the Law, for if those words had been O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
yet the King might have pardoned the Contempt if he had but Exprest
his pleasure under the Broad Seal. If a Judgment be given in this Court, that
one shall be Imprisoned during the Kings pleasure; his pleasure ought to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
by Pardon, and not by any Act of this Court, so that the King would
have no prejudice by the Imprisonment of a great Minister, because he could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
him by a Pardon the double Limitation is for the Benefit of the Prisoner
who ought not to complain of the duration of his Imprisonment, since he has neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
to make Application for his Discharge in an orderly way.</p>
            <p>I Confess by the Determination of the Session, the orders made the same Session
are Discharged, but I shall not affirm whether this present Order will be Discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or no, because it is a Judgment. But this is not the present Case, for the Session
continues notwithstanding the Royal Assent given to several Bills, according to the
Opinion of <hi>Cook</hi> and all the Judges. <hi>Hutton. 61.</hi> and 62. Every Proviso in an Act
of Parliament is not a Determination of what was the Law before; for they are
often added for the Satisfaction of those that are Ignorant of the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solicitor Gen.</hi> To the same effect, in the great Case of Mr. <hi>Selden, 5 Car. 1:</hi>
the warrant was for notable Contempts committed against us and our Government,
and stirring up Sedition; and although that be almost as general as that in our
Case, yet no Objection was made to it for that cause in any of the Arguments,
<hi>Rushworth's Collections 18</hi> &amp; 19. in the Appendix. But I agree that this Return
could not have been maintained if it were out of an inferiour Court, but du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the Session this Court can take no Cognizance of the Matter, and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
would be great if the Law were taken otherwise; for this Court might
Judge one way, and the House of Peers another: which doubtless would not be
for the Advantage and Benefit of the Subject. For the avoiding of this Mischief,
It was agreed by the whole Court in the Case of <hi>Barnardiston</hi> and <hi>Somes,</hi> that the
Accord for the double Return could not be brought in this Court until the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
had determined the Right of Election, lest there should be a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Judgments of the Courts.</p>
            <p>When a Judgment of the Lords comes to this Court, though it be of a Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
of a Judgment of this Court, the Court is obliged to execute it, but their
Judgment was never examined or corrected here. In the Case of the Lord <hi>Hollis,</hi>
it was Resolved that this Court had no Jurisdiction of a Misdemeanor commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in <hi>Parliament,</hi> when the <hi>Parliament</hi> is determined, the Judges are the Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of the Acts, and are intrusted with the Lives, Liberties and Fortunes of the
Subject, and if the Session were Determined, the Earl might apply himself to
this Court for the Subject shall not be without a place where he may resort for
the Recovery of his Liberty, but this Session is not Determined for the most part
the Royal Assent is given the last day, as saith <hi>Plouden, Partridges</hi> Case, yet the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Royal Assent, does not make it the last day of Parliament without a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
Resolution or Prerogative, and the Court Judicially takes notice of Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
and Adjournments of Parliament. <hi>Cro. Jac. 111. Ford. Versus Hunten,</hi> and
by Consequence no order is discontinued but remains as if the Parliament were
actually Assembled. <hi>Cro. Jac. 342.</hi> Sr. <hi>Chr. Haudens</hi> Case, so that the Earl ought

It ought to be observed, That this attempt is <hi>Primae Impressionis,</hi>
and though Imprisonment upon Contempt hath been frequent by
the one and the other House, till now no person ever sought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement
here: The Court was obliged in Justice to grant the
<hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> but upon the whole matter being disclosed, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
upon the Return, that the Cause belongs <hi>ad aliud examen;</hi>
they ought to remand the Party.</p>
            <p>As to the Limitation of the Imprisonment, the King may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin
his Pleasure by a Pardon under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi>
as in the Case of <hi>Reinger</hi> and <hi>Flagossa, Plowden 20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Exception that no Commitment is returned, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
can only shew what concerns himself, which is the Warrant
to him directed; and the Writ does not require him to return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing else.</p>
            <p>As to your Exception, that he is otherwise named in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment

was greater then the House of Peers, which I dare to appeal to
your Lordships and the whole Court, that it was never spoken by
them, I am sure was not by any directions of mine. What is
done by my Counsel and by me, is, That this is the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Court to resort unto where the Liberty of the Subject is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.
The Lords House is the Supream House of Judicature
in the Kingdom; but yet there is a Jurisdiction that the Lords
House does not meddle with. The King's Counsel hath menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
as a wonder, That a Member of the Lords House should
come hither to diminish the Jurisdiction of the Lords. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
them to be Superiour to this, or any other Court, to
whom all Appeals and Writs of Error are brought; and yet there
are Jurisdictions that they do not challenge, and which are not
natural to them, or proper for them. They claim not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in Original Causes, and so I might mention in other things;
and I do not think it a kindness to any Power or Body of men,
to give them some power that are not natural or proper to their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101256:8"/>
Constitution. I do not think it a kindness to the Lords to make
them absolute and above the Law, for so I humbly conceive this
must do, if it be adjudged that they by a general Warrant, or
without any particular Cause assigned, do commit me, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
man, to a perpetual and indefinite Imprisonment: And, my
Lords, I am not so Inconsiderable a person, but what you do in
my Case, must be Law for every man in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Mr. Attorney is pleased to say I am a Member of the Lords
House, and to lay weight on the word <hi>Member.</hi> It is very true,
I am one of them, and no man hath a greater Reverence or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
for the Lords then my self; but, my Lords, I hope my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Peer, or a Member of either House, shall not loose my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an English man, or make me to have less title to <hi>Magna Charta</hi>
and the other Laws of English Liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Opinion is not with one of my Counsel, who argued very
learnedly, That the passing an Act by the King's Royal Assent can
make a Sessions, because the usual Promise was not in it. It was
without any Instruction of mine to mention that point.</p>
                        <p>The King's Counsel tells your Lordships of the Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms
of Parliament; and if this was so, I should submit; but this
Case of mine is <hi>Primae Impressionis,</hi> and is a new way, such as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Mr. Attorney nor Mr. Solicitor can shew any President of, and
I have no other remedy nor place to apply to then the way I take.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Attorney confesseth that the King's pleasure may please me
without the Lords. If so, this Court is <hi>Coram Rege.</hi> This Court
is the proper place to determine the King's pleasure. This Court
will and ought to judge of an Act of Parliament void, if it be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> much more may judge an Order of the House,
that is put in Execution to deprive any Subject of his Liberty.
And if this Order of Commitment be a Judgment, as the King's
Counsel affirms, then it is out of the Lords hands, and properly
before your Lordships, as much as the Acts which were lately
passed, which I presume you will not refuse to judge of, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
that the King's Attorney General saith that this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is still in being: I take it something ill that Mr. Attorney tells
me I might have applied elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, I have not omitted what became my Duty towards
the King; for besides the Oath of Allegiance I took as a Peer, or an
English man, there is something in my Breast that will never suffer
me to depart from the Duty and Respect that I owe him; but I
am here before him, he is always supposed to be here present, and
he alloweth his Subjects the Law.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, they speak much of the Custom of Parliament; but
I do affirm to you, there is no Custom of Parliament that ever
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101256:8"/>
their Members were put out of their own Power; and the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
of it will be endless.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Attorney was pleased easily to answer the Objection of one
of my Counsel; If a great Minister should be so Committed, he
hath the Cure of a Pardon, the Prorogation, or a Dissolution: but
if the Case should be put, why forty Members, or a greater number,
may not as well be taken away without remedy in any of the King's
Courts, he will not so easily answer; and if in this Case there can
be no relief, no man can foresee what will be hereafter.</p>
                        <p>I desire your Lordship well to consider what rule you make in
my Case, for it will be a President that in future Ages may concern
every man in <hi>England.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Lord, Mr. Attorney saith you can either release or remand
me; I differ from him in that Opinion. I do not insist upon a
Release: I have been a Prisoner above five Months already, and
come hither of Necessity, having no other way to get my Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and therefore am very willing to tender your Lordship Bayl,
which are in or near the Court, good as any are in <hi>England,</hi> either
for their Quality or Estate, and I am ready to give any Sum or
Number.</p>
                        <p>My Lord, this Court being possest of this business, I am
now your Prisoner.</p>

            <p>The Court delivered their Opinion <hi>Seriatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Justice <hi>Jones.</hi> Such a Return made by an Ordinary Court of
Justice, would have been ill and uncertain; but the Cause is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
when it comes before this High Court, to which so much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
has been paid by our Predecessors, that they have deferred
the Determination of Doubts conceived on an Act of Parliament,
until they have received the Advice of the Lords: and now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
thereof, it is demanded of us to controll the Judgment of all
the Peers, and given on a Member of their own House, and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the continuance of the same Session. The Cases where the
Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi> have taken Cognizance of Priviledge, differ
from this Case: for in those it was only an Incident to the Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them, which was of their Cognizance; but the direct point
of the Matter is now the Judgment of the Lords.</p>
            <p>The course of all Courts ought to be considered, for that is the
Law of the Court, <hi>Lane</hi>'s <hi>Case 2. Rest.</hi> and it has not been affirmed,
That the Usage of the House of Lords has used to express the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
more particularly on Commitments for Contempts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I shall take it to be according to the course of Parliament. 4.
<hi>Inst. 50.</hi> It is said that the Judges are Assistants to the Lords, to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
them of Common Law; but they ought not to Judge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Law, Custom, or Usage of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:101256:9"/>
The Objection as to the continuance of the Imprisonment, has
received a plain Answer, for it shall be determined by the Pleasure
of the King, or of the Lords: and if it were otherwise, yet the
King could pardon the Contempt under the Great Seal, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Imprisonment under the Privy Seal.</p>
            <p>I shall not say what would be the consequence (as to this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment)
if the Session were determined, for that is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Case; but as the case is, the Court can neither Bayl nor Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
the Earl.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wild</hi> Justice. The Return no doubt is illegal; but the question
is of a Point of Jurisdiction, Whether it may be examined here?
This Court can't meddle with the Transactions of the most High
Court of Peers in Parliament, during the Session, which is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined;
and therefore the certainty or uncertainty of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
is not material, for it is not examinable here: but if the Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
had been determined, my Opinion would be, that he ought
to be discharged.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rainsford</hi> Chief Justice. This Court has no Jurisdiction of the
Cause, and therefore the Form of the Return is not considerable.
We ought not to extend our Jurisdiction beyond its due limits,
and the actions of our Ancestors will not warrant us in such an
Attempt.</p>
            <p>The Consequence would be very mischievous if this Court
should deliver a Member of the House of Peers and Commons
who are committed, for thereby the business of Parliament may
be retarded: for it may be the Commitment was for evil behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
or undecent reflections on other Members, to the disturbance
of the Affairs of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Commitment in this case is not for safe Custody, but he is in
execution of the Judgment given by the Lords for the Contempt;
and therefore if he should be bayled, he would be delivered out
of execution; for a Contempt <hi>in facie Curiae</hi> there is no other
Judgment or Execution.</p>
            <p>This Court has no Jurisdiction, and therefore he ought to be
remanded. I deliver no Opinion whether it would be otherwise
in case of a Prorogation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twisden</hi> Justice was absent, but he desired Justice <hi>Jones</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that his Opinion was, That the Party ought to be Remanded<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And so he was remanded by the Court.</p>
