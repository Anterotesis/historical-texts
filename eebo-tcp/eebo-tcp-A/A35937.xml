            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A SALUTATION OF LOVE TO THE SEED of GOD Every where.</head>
            <p>DEar Friends, You who are born of the Incorruptible Word of Life, and have been quickened by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Power of Chriſt, and received Gifts to Serve him, and one another, and all the Creation of God: All keep low in the pure Fear of the Lord, waiting to feel the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Divine Spirit, to guide you in your ſeveral Gifts and Services, that thereby as living Members of the Compleat Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, you may be all preſerved in your places, where the Body will Edifie it ſelf in Love, and all will be Comforted in the Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> your Heavenly <hi>Head,</hi> and dwell under his Peaceable <hi>Government,</hi> where his pure <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Life</hi> will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound amongſt you, and in it your Hearts will be kept open to God, and one to another; and in his Divine Light you will all come to ſee your ſervices and places in the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and every one will be concerned to keep in the Heavenly Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Order of the Goſpel, to keep their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ranks in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45494:2"/>
where his holy Banner of Love will be over you, and it will be your Delight to keep under it, where the Rayes of his Glory hath many times Covered you, and you have ſeen his Beauty, and have often been Raviſhed there with, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon thereby to ſerve the Lord and one another; that nothing hath been too near and dear to part with, to anſwer his pure Requirings; becauſe of the ſweet Recompence of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, you have received from his Bountiful Hand, and the Glory that hath been ſet before you, which hath wrought a willingneſs in you to take up the Croſs, and deſpiſe the Shame; following your bleſſed Lord and Heavenly Example, through the many Tribulations, and have waſhed your Garments in the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> that they have been made white and clean. I ſay unto you all, Keep Low and Humble in the pure Fear, with your Eyes ſingle to the Honour of the Giver, where you will feel his Power with you, and to aſſiſt you every Day in your Services; and then the Life will Speak through you, and here you will be Inſtrumental in the <hi>Lord</hi>'s Hand for the Building up one another in the moſt holy Faith, which worketh in the Heart by <hi>Love,</hi> where the Unity of the Spirit will be kept, and the Bond of Peace will be Witneſſed, which will keep you all near the Lord, and near one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, where all will be tender of Gods Glory, and tender one over another, Travelling and Breathing to the Lord one for another's Growth and Preſervation in your Several Gifts and Services, that as fixed Stars in the Firmament of Gods Power, you may be all ſhewing forth the Power of him which maketh the Stars to differ as pleaſeth him, and giveth <hi>Light</hi> unto them, ſome more and ſome leſs, Yet all ſhew forth his great Power and Divine Wiſdom: As they keep their places, and are Governed by his Heavenly Power, and kept by him from the reach of the Dragons Tail, which draws down all to the Earth, whoſe care is not to keep to the Power of the Immortal Word by which they have been Quickened and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely opened, and have had Gifts given unto them: Thoſe that do not keep low in the pure Fear and Humility, and are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45494:2"/>
thereby kept tender of Gods Glory, and alſo tender over the Bleſſed Unity of the Church of Chriſt; thoſe the Dragon hath prevailed and will prevail over, and draw down to the Earth again, and their Habitation will be there where the Wo will be their Portion: Therefore let all be careful and keep upon their Watch, that they may ſee the many Snares of the Old Crooked <hi>Serpent,</hi> and eſcape them, by keeping to the Power of Chriſt, which will keep all Humble and Low, in the true dread before the Lord; what-ever their Gifts or Services be, let none look at the Gift more then the Giver: But let all be careful to Honour the Giver in their Gift, ſo will the Lord take Delight in you, and make you worthy of double Honour, as he hath done many Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies whom he hath upheld Faithful unto him in their Gifts, diſcharging their duty to him and to the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe Memory lives, and ſhall live for ever; for their names are written in Heaven, and is very ſweet and pleaſant to all who are kept Faithful to the Lord, and who are Ingaged in the ſame warfare they were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in: For <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> Great is the Lords Work which he hath begun, and he will carry it on by his own Arm of Power, which is Manifeſted to many, and thoſe that he makes uſe of, muſt be ſubject to his Meek Lowly Spirit, and wait to be thus guided by it, in all their Services, where ſelf is had in no reputation; but that is daily deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all its appearances whatſoever, and had great need to be Careful to watch in the Light, that none be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed from the Simplicity of the Goſpel, and ſo be puf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed up above the pure Fear of God, and let up a wrong Mind, to look out at their Gifts, or Attainments, or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they have paſſed through, and thereby beget a ſlight eſteem of their fellow Servants, and to ſet up themſelves, and not to have a true regard to the Honour of God, nor the Peace and Proſperity of his Church and People: Where ſuch a Mind is given way to, it hurts the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and brings Trouble and Exerciſe on the General.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45494:3"/>
But Oh my Friends, God hath Called you to Peace, and to Walk together in his Peaceable Spirit, in which ye have all Life, and Peace, and Salvation, by which ye are Supported and born up in your ſeveral Services, and all ſhew forth the great Power of him that hath called you to ſerve him and one another. And in all your Mens and Womens <hi>Monthly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meetings,</hi> let a Care be upon all, that this Peaceable Spirit be kept in, and your Spirits be kept in Subjection under it; ſo will you be all kept in the Love which Edifies and Builds up in the holy Faith, and ſettles and confirms in that holy Goſpel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, the Lord hath brought you into, in which he hath owned you, and ſtood by you, through many Exerciſes, and will never leave you, nor forſake you; except you forſake him, and truſt in your own Strength. My Soul is under a deep Travail that you may be kept, by his great Power, faithful unto him, and in ſweet Fellowſhip one with another, where your Joy may be full in the Lord, and his Communion pleaſant in his holy Covenant of <hi>Light,</hi> in which my Soul Dearly Salutes you all, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines your Friend and Brother.</p>
