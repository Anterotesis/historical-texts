            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>TO go about to excuse halfe the Defects this Abortive Brat is come into the World with, wou'd be to provoke the Town with a long useless Preface, when 'tis, I doubt, sufficiently sower'd already, by a tedious Play.</p>
            <p>I do therefore (with all the Humility of a Repenting Sinner) confess, it wants every thing— but length; and in that, I hope the severest Critique, will be pleas'd to acknowledge, I have not been wanting. But my Modesty will sure attone for every thing, when the World shall know it is so great, I am even to this day insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of those two shining Graces in the Play (which some part of the Town is pleas'd to Compliment me with) Blasphemy and Bawdy.</p>
            <p>For my part, I cannot find 'em out. If there was any obscene Expressions upon the Stage, here they are in the Print; for I have dealt fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I have not sunk a Sylable, that cou'd (tho' by racking of Mysteries) be rang'd under that head; and yet I believe with a steady Faith, there is not one Woman of a real Reputation in Town, but when she has read it impartially over in her Closet, will find it so innocent, she'll think it
<pb facs="tcp:40122:3"/>
no affront to her Prayer-Book, to lay it upon the same Shelf. So to them, (with all manner of Deference,) I intirely refer my Cause, and I'm confident they'll justify me, against those pretenders to good Manners, who at the same time, have so little respect for the Ladies, they wou'd extract a Bawdy Jest from an Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to put 'em out of countenance. But I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to have these well-bred Persons always my Enemies, since I'm sure I shall never write any thing lewd enough, to make 'em my Friends.</p>
            <p>As for the Saints (your thorough-pac'd ones I mean) with screw'd Faces and wry Mouths) I despair of them, for they are Friends to no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. They love nothing, but their Altars and Themselves. They have too much Zeal to have any Charity: they make Debauches in Piety, as Sinners do in Wine; and are as quarrelsome in their Religion, as other People are in their Drink: so I hope no body will mind what they say. But if any Man (with flat plod Shooes, a little Band, Greazy Hair, and a dirty Face, who is wiser than I, at the expence of being Forty years older) happens to be offended at a story of a Cock and a Bull, and a Priest and a Bull-Dog: I beg his Pardon with all my heart, which I hope I shall obtain, by eating my words, and making this publick Recantation. I do therefore for his satisfaction, acknowledge, I
<pb facs="tcp:40122:3"/>
Ly'd, when I said, they never quit their hold; for in that little time I have liv'd in the World, I thank God I have seen 'em forc'd to't, more than once; but next time I'll speak with more Caution and Truth; and only say, they have very good Teeth.</p>
            <p>If I have offended any honest Gentlemen of the Town, whose Friendship or good Word is worth the having, I am very sorry for it; I hope they'll correct me as gently as they can, when they consider I have had no other design, in running a very great Risque, than to divert (if possible) some part of their Spleen, in spight of their Wives and their Taxes.</p>
            <p>One word more about the Bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happen'd, but 'twas not my fault.</p>
            <p>The fine Gentleman of the Play, drinking his Mistresses Health in <hi>Nants</hi> Brandy, from six in the Morning, to the time he wadled on upon the Stage in the Evening, had toasted himself up, to such a pitch of Vigor, I confess I once gave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda</hi>
for gone, and I am since (with all due Respect to Mrs <hi>Rogers</hi>) very sorry she scap't); for I am confident a certain Lady, (let no one take it to her self that's handsome) who highly blames the Play, for the barrenness of the conclusion wou'd then have allow'd it, a very natural Close.</p>

            </head>
            <l>LAdys, this Play in too much haste was writ,</l>
            <l>To be o'er-charg'd with either Plot or Wit;</l>
            <l>'Twas Got, Conceiv'd, and Born in six Weeks space,</l>
            <l>And Wit, you know, 's as slow in growth — as Grace.</l>
            <l>Sure it can ne'r be ripen'd to your Taste,</l>
            <l>I doubt 'twill prove, our Author bred too fast.</l>
            <l>For mark'em well, who with the Muses Marry,</l>
            <l>They rarely do Conceive, but they Miscarry.</l>
            <l>'Tis the hard Fate of those wh' are big with Rhime,</l>
            <l>Still to be brought to Bed before their time.</l>
            <l>Of our late Poets, Nature few has made,</l>
            <l>The greatest part—are only so by Trade.</l>
            <l>Still want of something, brings the scribling Fit,</l>
            <l>For want of Money, some of 'em have Writ,</l>
            <l>And others do't you see—for want of Wit.</l>
            <l>Honour, they fancy, summons 'em to Write,</l>
            <l>So out they lug in wresty Nature's Spight,</l>
            <l>As some of you spruce <hi>Beaux</hi> do—when you Fight.</l>
            <l>Yet let the ebb of Wit be ne'r so low,</l>
            <l>Some glimpse of it, a Man may hope to shew,</l>
            <l>Upon a Theme, so ample—as a <hi>Beau.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>So, howsoe're true Courage may decay,</l>
            <l>Perhaps there's not one Smock-Face here to day,</l>
            <l>But's bold as <hi>Caesar</hi> — to attack a Play.</l>
            <l>Nay, what's yet more, with an undaunted Face</l>
            <l>To do the thing with more Heroick Grace,</l>

            <l>E'n give the Hero, and the Critique o'er,</l>

               <l>This is an Age, where all things we improve,</l>

               <l>In former days, Women were only won,</l>
               <l>By Merit, Truth, and constant Service done,</l>
               <l>But Lovers now, are much more expert grown.</l>
               <l>They seldom wait, t'approach, by tedious Form,</l>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aman.</speaker>
                     <p>Well, I must own I think Books the best Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the World.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. <hi>Fop.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>I am so much of your Ladyship's mind, Madam; That I have a private Gallery (where I walk sometimes) is furnish'd with nothing but Books and Looking-glasses. Madam, I have guilded 'em, and rang'd 'em so prettily, before Gad, it is the most entertaining thing in the World to walk and look upon 'em.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Aman.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay, I love a neat Library too; but 'tis I think the Inside of the Book, shou'd recommend it most to us.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>L. <hi>Fop.</hi>
                     </speaker>
                     <p>That I must confess I am nat altogether so fand of. Far to mind the inside of a Book, is to entertain ones self with the forc'd Product of another Man's Brain. Naw I think a Man of Quality and Breeding, may be much better diverted with the Natural Sprauts of his own. But to say the Truth, Madam, let a Man love reading never so well, when once he comes to know this Tawn, he finds so many better ways of passing the Four and twenty hours, that 'twere Ten thousand pities he shou'd consume his time in that. Far Example, Madam, my Life: My Life, Madam, is a perpetual Stream of Pleasure, that glides through such a Variety of Entertainments, I believe the wisest of our Ancestors never had the least Conception of any of 'em.</p>
                     <p>I rise, Madam, about Ten a-Clock. I don't rise sooner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis the worst thing in the World for the Complexion; nat that I pretend to be a Beau: But a Man must endeavour to look wholesome, lest he make so nauseous a Figure in the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40122:19"/>
Side-Bax, the Ladies shou'd be compell'd to turn their Eyes upon the Play. So at Ten a-Clack I say I rise. Naw if I find 'tis a good day, I resalve to take a turn in the Park, and see the Fine Women: So huddle on my Cloaths, and get drest by One. If it be nasty Weather, I take a turn in the Chocolate-hause; where, as you walk Madam, you have the prettiest Prospect in the World; you have Looking-glasses all round you.—But I'm afraid I tire the Company?</p>

                     <p>Why then, Ladies, from thence I go to Dinner at <hi>Lacket</hi>'s; where you are so nicely and delicately serv'd, that, stap my Vitals, they shall compose you a Dish no bigger than a Saucer, shall come to Fifty shillings.</p>
                     <p>Between eating my Dinner, (and washing my Mauth, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) I spend my time, 'till I go to the Play; where, 'till Nine a-Clack, I entertain my self with looking upon the Company; and usually dispose of One hour more in leading 'em aut. So there's Twelve of the Four and twenty pretty well over.</p>
                     <p>The other Twelve, Madam, are dispos'd of in Two Articles: In the first Four, I toast my self drunk, and in t'other Eight, I sleep my self sober again. Thus, Ladies, you see my Life is an eternal raund O of Delights.</p>

Why, Madam—as to time for my Intrigues, I usually make Detachments of it from my other Pleasures, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigency: Far your Ladyship may please to take notice, that those who intrigue with Women of Quality, have rarely occasion far above half an hour at a time: People of that Rank being under those Decorums, they can seldom give you a langer View than will just serve to shoot 'em flying. So that the Course of my other Pleasures, is not very much interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted by my Amours.</p>

                     <p>This is the first I have heard on't. So I suppose 'tis his Quality more than his Love, has brought him into this Adventure. He thinks his Title an authentick Passport to every Woman's Heart, below the degree of a Peeress.</p>

                     <p>But the Women of the Town are of another Mind: For by this means a Lady may (with the Expence of a few Coquet Glances) lead twenty Fools about in a String, for two or three Years together. Whereas, if she shou'd allow 'em greater Favours, and oblige 'em to Secresie, she wou'd not keep one of 'em a Fortnight.</p>

                     <p>There's something indeed in that to satisfie the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Woman, but I can't comprehend how the Men find their account in it.</p>

                     <p>Their entertainment I must confess is a Riddle to me. For there's very few of 'em ever get farther, than a Bow and an Ogle. I have half a Score for my share, who follow me all over the Town; and at the Play, the Park, and the Church, do (with their Eyes) say the violent'st things to me—But I never hear any more of 'em.</p>

                     <p>One reason is, they don't know how to go farther. They have had so little Practice they don't understand the Trade. But besides their Ignorance, you must know there is not one of my half Score Lovers but what follows half a Score Mistresses. Now their Affections being divided amongst so

                     <p>As for the Lord, he's eminently so: And for the other I can assure you, there's not a Man in Town who has a better Interest with the Women, that are worth having an Interest with. But 'tis all private: He's like a Back-stair Minister at Court, who, whilst the reputed Favorites are sauntering in the Bed-Chamber, is ruling the roast in the Closet.</p>

I must acquaint you with a Secret Couzen. 'Tis not that Fool alone, has talk'd to me of Love. <hi>Worthy</hi>
has been tampering too: 'Tis true, he has don't in vain: Not all his Charms or Art have Power to shake me: My Love, my Duty, and my Vertue, are such faithful Guards, I need not fear my Heart shou'd e'er betray me. But what I wonder at is this.</p>
                     <p>I find I did not start at his Proposal; as when it came from one whom I contemn'd. I therefore mention his Attempt, that I may learn from you, whence it proceeds; That Vice (which cannot change its Nature) shou'd so far change at least its shape, as that the self-same Crime propos'd from one shall seem a Monster gaping at your ruine; when from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it shall look so kind; as tho' it were your Friend, and never meant to harm you.</p>
                     <p>Whence think you can this difference proceed, for 'tis not Love, Heaven knows.</p>

                  <p>Why then (that I may not be the Author of so great a Misfortune) my Case in a Word is this.</p>
                  <p>The necessary Expences of my Travels have so much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the wretched Income of my Annuity, that I have been forc'd to Mortgage it for Five Hundred Pounds, which is spent; so that unless you are so kind to assist me in redeeming it, I know no Remedy, but to go take a Purse.</p>

                     <p>Now Friendship's said to be a Plant of tedious growth; its Root compos'd of tender Fibers, nice in their Taste, cautious in spreading, check'd with the least Corruption in the Soil; long e'er it take, and longer still e'er it appear to do so: Whilst mine is in a moment shot so high, and fix'd so fast, it seems beyond the Power of Storms to shake it. I doubt it thrives too fast.

                     <p>I'm satisfy'd. Now hear my Symptoms, and give me your Advice. The first were these:</p>
                     <l>When 'twas my Chance to see you at the Play,</l>
                     <l>A randome Glance you threw, at first alarm'd me,</l>
                     <l>I cou'd not turn my eyes from whence the danger came:</l>
                     <l>I gaz'd upon you, 'till you shot again,</l>
                     <l>And then my Fears came on me.</l>
                     <l>My heart began to pant, my limbs to tremble,</l>
                     <l>My Blood grew thin; my Pulse beat quick,</l>
                     <l>My Eyes grew hot and dim, and all the frame of Nature</l>
                     <l>Shook with Apprehension.</l>
                     <l>'Tis true, some small Recruits of Resolution,</l>
                     <l>My Manhood brought to my Assistance,</l>
                     <l>And by their help I made a stand a while,</l>
                     <l>But found at last your Arrows flew so thick,</l>
                     <l>They cou'd not fail to pierce me;</l>
                     <l>So left the Field,</l>
                     <l>And fled for Shelter to <hi>Amanda</hi>'s Arms.</l>

But when I saw you, out it burst again, and rag'd with greater fury than before. Nay, since you now appear, 'tis so encreas'd, that in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if you do not help me, I shall, whilst you look on, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to Ashes.

Nay, I don't know but I might be quite so, had I made one short Campaign with <hi>Amanda.</hi> Therefore if you find 'twou'd tickle your Vanity, to bring me down once more to your Lure, e'en help me quickly to dispatch her business, that I may have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to do, but to apply my self to yours.</p>

                     <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                     <p>I think you are so much a deeper Politician in these Affairs than I am; that I ought to have a very great regard to your Advice.</p>

                     <speaker>Wor.</speaker>
                     <p>Then give me leave to put you in mind, that the most easie, safe, and pleasant Situation for your own Amour, is the House in which you now are; provided you keep <hi>Aman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
from any sort of Suspicion.</p>
                     <p>That the way to do that is to engage her in an Intrigue of her own, making your self her Confident.</p>
                     <p>And the way to bring her to Intrigue, is to make her Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of her Husband in a wrong place; which the more you foment, the less you'll be suspected.</p>
                     <p>This is my Scheme, in short; which if you follow as you shou'd do (my dear <hi>Berinthia</hi>) we may all four pass the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very pleasantly.</p>

                     <speaker>Wor.</speaker>
                     <p>Right as you say, where there is a necessity, a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian is bound to help his Neighbour. So good <hi>Berinthia,</hi> lose no time, but let us begin the Dance as fast as we can.</p>

                     <p>Not till the Fiddles are in Tune, pray Sir.</p>
                     <p>Your Ladies strings will be very apt to fly, I can tell you that, if they are wound up too hastily. But if you'll have patience to screw 'em to their pitch by degrees, I don't doubt but she may endure to be play'd upon.</p>

                     <p>Ay, and will make admirable Musick too, or I'm mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken; but have you had no private Closet Discourse with her yet about Males and Females, and so forth, which may give you hopes in her Constitution; for I know her Morals are the Devil against us.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                     <p>I have had so much Discourse with her, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve were she once cur'd of her Fondness to her Husband, the Fortress of her Vertue wou'd not be so impregnable as she Fancies.</p>

                     <speaker>Wor.</speaker>
                     <p>What? She runs I'll warrant you into that common mistake of Fond Wives, who conclude themselves Vertuous, because they can refuse a Man they don't like, when they have got one they do.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                     <p>True, and therefore I think 'tis a presumptuous thing in a Woman, to assume the Name of Vertuous; till she has heartily hated her Husband, and been soundly in Love with somebody else. Whom, if she has withstood —then— much good may it do her.</p>

                     <p>Well, so much for her Vertue. Now, one word of her Inclinations, and every one to their Post. What Opinion do you find she has of me?</p>

Thus he Preach'd for an hour, but when he came to use an Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he observ'd that all these without a Gallant were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing—Now consider of what has been said, and Heaven give you grace to put it in practice.</p>

                     <p>Why then I understand my Trade so well, that when ever I am told of a Man I like, I cry psha; but that I may spare you the pains of putting me a second time in mind to commend him, I'll proceed, and give you this account of him; that though 'tis possible he may have had Women with as good faces as your Ladyship's (no discredit to it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) yet you must know your cautious Behaviour, with that reserve in your Humour, has given him his Death's wound; he mortally hates a Coquett, he says 'tis impossible to Love where we cannot esteem; and that no Woman can be esteem'd by a Man who has sense, if she makes her self cheap in the eye of a Fool. That Pride to a Woman, is as necessary as Humility to a Divine; and that far fetch'd, and dear bought, is meat for Gentlemen, as well as for Ladies—in short, that every Woman who has Beauty, may set a price upon her self, and that by under-selling the Market, they ruine the Trade. This is his Doctrine, how do you like it?</p>

                     <p>Nay that's my business to speak to, Nurse; I do confess, to take two Husbands for the satisfaction of the Flesh, is to commit the Sin of Exorbitancy, but to do it for the Peace of the Spirit, is no more than to be drunk by way of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick; besides, to prevent a Parent's wrath, is to avoid the Sin of Disobedience; for when the Parent's angry, the Child is froward.

                     <p>—Faith I'll do't, and thus the Execution of it shall be. We are all Invited to my Lord <hi>Foppington</hi>'s to Night to Supper, he's come to Town with his Bride, and makes a Ball with an Entertainment of Musick. Now you must know, my undoer here, <hi>Lovelace,</hi> says he must needs meet me about some private business (I don't know what 'tis) before we go
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40122:49"/>
to the Company. To which end, he has told his Wife one Lye, and I have told her another. But to make her amends, I'll go immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and tell her a solemn Truth.</p>

                     <p>Why, I'll tell her; that to my certain knowledge, her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band has a Rendez-vous with his Mistress this Afternoon; and that if she'll give me her word, she'll be satisfied with the discovery, without making any violent Inquiry after the Woman, I'll direct her to a place, where she shall see 'em meet.</p>
                     <p>Now, Friend; this I fancy may help you to a Critical Minute. For Home she must go again to dress. You (with your good breeding) come to wait upon us to the Ball. Find her all alone: Her Spirit en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flam'd against her Husband for his Treason; and her Flesh in a heat from some Contemplations upon the Treachery: Her Blood on a Fire; her Conscience in Ice; a Lover to draw, and the Devil to drive— Ah poor <hi>Amanda.</hi>

consider what they and we are compos'd of. For Nature has made them Children, and us Babies. Now, <hi>Amanda</hi>; how we us'd our Babyes, you may remember.

                     <speaker>Aman.</speaker>
                     <p>Suppose he does? That's no demonstration he wou'd be Constant to me.</p>

                     <speaker>Ber.</speaker>
                     <p>No, that I'll grant you: But there are other Reasons to expect it: For you must know after all, <hi>Amanda</hi>; the Inconstancy we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly see in Men of Brains, does not so much proceed from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty of their temper, as from the Misfortunes of their Love. A Man sees perhaps a hundred Women he likes well enough for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and away. But possibly, through the whole Course of his Life, does not find above one, who is exactly what he could wish her; now her, 'tis a thousand to one, he never gets. Either she is not to be had at all, (tho' that seldom happens you'l say) or he wants those oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities that are necessary to gain her. Either she likes some body else much better than him, or uses him like a Dog, because he likes no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy so well as her: Still something or other Fate claps in the way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Woman they are capable of being fond of: And this makes them wander about, from Mistress to Mistress, like a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim from Town to Town, who every Night must have a fresh Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and's in haste to be gone in the Morning.</p>

                     <speaker>Aman.</speaker>
                     <p>'Tis possible there may be something in what you say; but what do you infer from it, as to the Man we were talking of?</p>

Don't you think she's a Woman to be fobb'd off so. Come, I'm too much your Friend, to suffer you should be thus grosly impos'd upon, by a Man who does not deserve the least part about you, unless he knew how to set a greater value upon it. Therefore in one word, to my certain knowledge, he is to meet her; now within a quarter of an Hour, somewhere about that <hi>Babylon</hi> of Wickedness, <hi>White-Hall.</hi> And if you'l give me your word, that you'l be content with seeing har Mask'd in his Hand, without pulling her Headcloaths off, I'll step immediately to the Person, from whom I have my Intelligence, and send you word where abouts you may stand to see 'em meet. My Friend and I'll watch 'em from another place, and dodge 'em to their private Lodging: But don't you offer to follow 'em, lest you do it awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly, and spoil all. I'll come home to you again, as soon as I have earth 'em, and give you an account, in what Corner of the House, the Scene of their Lewdness lies.</p>
