            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HORACE the POET teſtifieth (right Honourable and vertuous Ladie) that Poets in times paſt, haue beene addicted either to profit and pleaſure them ſelues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, either elſe in commune to write both ſweet and neceſſary things, for the life of their poſteritie.

And when I had reformed and repoliſhed ſo well as I could, the ſeuerall hiſtories, &amp; corrected the application of the Moralitie in many places, I thought beſt to adde therevnto (not impertinent for better light and farther intelligence of the Readers capacitie) a forme of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument

The knight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſayd, I am of thempyre of <hi>Rome,</hi> and now am come late from the holy land and am ready to doe your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſuch as I can. And as they rode talking by the way, it béegan to rayne ſo faſt, that all the kings apparell was almoſt ſpoyled. Then ſaide the knight. My lord, quod hée, yée haue done fooliſhly, for as much as yée brought not with you your houſe. Then ſayd the king why ſpeakeſt thou ſo, my houſe is large and broad &amp; made of ſtones &amp; morter, how ſhould I then beare with mée my houſe, thou ſpeakeſt to mée like a foole. When this was laid they rod farther till they came to a great water and a déepe, the king ſmote his horſe with his ſpurres and leapt into the water, ſo that hée was almoſt drowned. Then the knight ſaw this, &amp; was ouer on that other ſide of the water without perill, hee ſayd to the king. Yée were in perill, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore yee did fooliſhly bicauſe yée brought not with you your bridge. Then ſaide the king, thou ſpeakeſt meruaylouſly,
<pb facs="tcp:12573:42"/>
my bridge is made of lime &amp; ſtone, and containeth in quantity more then halfe a myle, how ſhould I then beare with mee my bridge, therefore thou ſpeakeſt fooliſhly. Well ſaid the knight my foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe may turne thée to wiſdome.</p>
               <p>When the king had ridden a little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he aſked the knght what time of daye it was.

Then ſayde the king, I will gladly eate with thee, They ſate both downe in a vyne garden, and all that were with the King and with the knight dined. And when dinner was done, and that the king had waſhen, the knight ſaide to the King. My Lord quod hée, yee haue done fooliſhly, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> yee lead not with you your father and your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

therefore to thee I ſay the truth, a foli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher man then thou art ſaw I neuer. Then ſaid the Knight, euery worke is praiſed at the ende. When the Knight had ridden a little farther and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When this poore <hi>Guy</hi> heard that it was the voyce of a man, he meruayled greatly, and ſtoode ſtill on the Pittes brinck and ſayde Loe good friend I am come for thou haſt called mée.

Than the ſteward made a great oath and ſayde, that hée would promote him &amp; all his, to great riches. Then ſayde <hi>Guy,</hi> if you will fulfill your promiſe, I ſhall doe that you byd mée. And with that went againe to the Citie and brought with him a long rope and came to the pit and ſayd. Sir ſteward, lo, I let downe a rope to thée,

binde thy ſelfe about the middle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, that I may pul thée vp. Than was the ſteward glad, and ſaide. Good friend let down the rope. And with that he caſt the ende of the rope downe into the pit. And when the Lyon ſaw that, he caught the rope &amp; hild it faſt and <hi>Guy</hi> drew the Lyon vp, wening to him he had drawen vp the ſteward, and when he had ſo done the Lyon thanked him in his maner, and ranne to the wood. The ſecond time that <hi>Guy</hi> let downe the rope, the Ape lept to it and caught it faſt, &amp; when he was drawen vp, he thanked <hi>Guy</hi> as he could, and ranne to the wood. The third tyme he let downe the rope and drew vp the Serpent, which thanked him, and went to the wood. The ſteward cryed with an high voice. O déere friend now I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered of thrée venimous beaſtes, now let downe the corde to mée, that I may come vp. And this poore <hi>Guy</hi> let downe the rope, and the ſteward bound himſelf faſt about the middle, and anone <hi>Guy</hi> drew him vp. And when he was thus holpe out of this déepe pitte, hée ſaide to <hi>Guy</hi> as followeth.</p>

               <p>And then went he in and told the ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of the comming of this poore man. When the ſteward heard that, he went out and all to beate this ſilly <hi>Guy,</hi> and

               <p>Not long after it béefell that this <hi>Guy</hi> by the vertue of this ſtone was made paſſing riche and bought greate poſſeſſions and liuelode, wherefore with in a while he was made knight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:12573:95"/>It was not long after the Emperour had knowledge how ſir <hi>Guy,</hi> had a ſtone of ſuch vertue, wherefore hée ſent for ſir <hi>Guy,</hi> commaunding him to come to him in all haſt, and ſo hee did. And when ſir <hi>Guy</hi> was come to the Emperour, the Emperour ſayde to him. My friend, I haue heard ſaye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſometime thou werte in great pouertie, and now thou arte made rich by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vertue of a little ſtone, therefore I pray thée that thou ſell mée that ſtone. Syr <hi>Guy</hi> anſwered and ſayd, that may I not doe, for ſo long as I haue that ſtone, I am ſure of thrée things, that is to ſaye, of ioy without ſorrow, plenty without want, and light without darkeneſſe. When the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour heard this hée had greater deſire to buy that ſtone then hée had beefore, and ſaid to him, Sir <hi>Guy,</hi> of two things thou muſt chooſe one, that is, chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wilt forſake this Empyre and all thy kindered, or elſe ſel me thy ſtone.</p>
               <p>Then ſayde Syr <hi>Guy.</hi>

               <p>Then went foorth ſir <hi>Guy</hi> againe to the Emperour and ſayde to him. My Lord yeſterday I ſolde you a ſtone the which if it pleaſe you I would faine ſée. The Emperour went for the ſtone to his treaſure and found it not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hée was right ſorowfull, and came againe and told Syr Guy how it was loſt.

               <p>Then ſayde ſir <hi>Guy,</hi> By my faith that I owe to you, I ſhall tell you the very troth as touching this ſtone.</p>
               <p>Your ſteward that is promoted vp of nought, let make many déepe pittes in your Forreſt, and it fortuned not long after, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hée fell downe into one of them himſelfe, and might not ryſe againe for déepeneſſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pit, it fortuned alſo the ſame day, that a Lyon, an Ape, &amp; a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent fell into the Pitte with him, at which time I was a verie poore man, &amp; tooke great pains for my liuing, &amp; as I walked into the forreſt w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mine Aſſe for

               <p>And than came ther diuers byrds that ſoung ſo ſwéetly &amp; pleaſantly that the Emperour awaked. In the morning earely this <hi>Anſelme</hi> remembred his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and wondred much what it might ſignifie, wherefore he called to him his Philoſophers, and alſo the ſtates of his Empyre, and tolde them his dreame, charging them to tell him the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof vpon paine of death, &amp; if they tolde him the true interpretation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he promiſed them great reward.</p>
               <p>Then ſayde they. Déere Lorde tell vs your dreame, and wée ſhall declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you what it betokeneth.</p>
               <p>Than the Emperour tolde them from the beginning to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ending as it is afore ſayd. When y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Philoſophers heard this, with glad cheere they anſwered &amp; ſayd. Lord, the dreame that ye ſaw, betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth good, for the Empyre ſhall be more clearer than it is.</p>

               <p>Lo this is the verye interpretation of your dreame. When the Emperour heard this, he was right ioyfull. Soone after that the Empreſſe trauailed in childe byrth &amp; was deliuered of a fayre ſonne, in whoſe byrth was great ioye made without ende.</p>
               <p>When the king of <hi>Ampluy</hi> heard this, he thought in himſelfe thus. Loe, I haue warred againſt the Emperour

When the Emperour ſaw that the king of <hi>Ampluy</hi> wrote to him more for feare then for loue, hée wrote againe to him, that if he would finde good and ſufficient ſuertie to kéepe the peace, and bynde himſelfe all the dayes of his lyfe to doe him ſeruice &amp; homage, and to giue him yéerely a certaine try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, he would receiue him to the peace.</p>
               <p>When the king had read the tenour of the Emperours letters, he called his Counſayle, praying them to giue him counſayle how he might beſt doe as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this matter. Then ſaid they. It is good that ye obey the Emperours will and commaundement in all things.</p>

Than was the king right glad, for his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a cleane virgin.</p>
               <p>Therefore whan the letters of couena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; compact were ſealed, the king furniſht a faire ſhip, wherein he might ſend his Daughter with many noble knightes, Ladies, and great riches vnto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for to haue his ſon in marriage.

And when he came to twenty yéeres of age, he deſired his Fathers heritage, ſaying. Déere father, ye are an olde man &amp; may not gouerne your Empyre, therefore if it pleaſe you to giue it mée, it ſhall be to your profit. Then aunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered the Emperour and ſayde. Déere ſonne, I dread mée ſore that when the Empyre is in thy power thou wilt not fulfill my will ne my deſire.</p>
               <p>Then aunſwered the Empreſſe (for ſo much as ſhe loued hir ſonne better than hir huſband) and ſayd. My Lord quod

               <p>This when his ſonne heard hée wept ſore and might not be comforted for the vnkindneſſe of his father.</p>

And when this was ſo done, the Emperour called vnto him his Steward and ſayd.</p>
               <p>How may I ryd this varlet from the world, that thus hath defamed mée? My moſt déere Lord quod the ſteward, right well you ſhall haue your intent.</p>
               <p>For héere béeſide, within theſe thrée miles yée haue brickmakers, which daily
<pb facs="tcp:12573:145"/>
make great fires for to burne brick, &amp; alſo they make lyme, therfore my Lord ſend to them this night, &amp; charge them vppon paine of death, that whoſoeuer commeth to them firſt on the morrow, ſaying to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thus: My Lord commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth you to fulfil his will, that they take him and caſt him into the Forncis with the ſtones, and this night commaunde you this <hi>Fulgentious</hi> that he goe earely in the morning to your workmen, and that hee aſke them whether they haue fulfilled your wil which they were com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded, or not, and then ſhall they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your commaundement, caſt him in the Fyre, and thus ſhall hee dye an euill death.</p>
               <p>Surely quod y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell is good, therfore call to me that var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let <hi>Fulgentious.</hi> And when this young man was come to the Emperours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, hée ſayde to him thus: I charge thée vpon paine of death, that thou riſe early in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning &amp; goe to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brenners of lyme &amp; brick, and that thou bee with them earely before the ſunne ryſe thrée
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:12573:145"/>
myles from this houſe, and charge them in my behalfe that they fullfil my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, or elſe they ſhall dye a moſt ſhamefull death.</p>
               <p>Then ſpake this <hi>Fulgentious.</hi> My Lord, if God ſend mée my lyfe, I ſhall fulfill your will, were it that I ſhould goe to the worlds ende.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Fulgentious</hi> had this charge, he could not ſléepe for thought, but that hée muſt ariſe earely for to fulfil his Lords commandement. The Emperour about midnight ſent a meſſenger on horſeback vnto his bricke makers, commaunding them vppon paine of death, that who ſo euer came to them firſt in the morning ſaying vnto them, the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, (which is before rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed) that they ſhould take and bynd him and caſt him into the fire, &amp; burne him to the bare bones.</p>
               <p>The Bryck makers anſwered and ſayde, it ſhould bée done. And then the meſſenger returned home againe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, and told the Emperour that his commandement ſhould bée diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:12573:146"/>Earely in the morning following, <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentious</hi> aroſe &amp; prepared him towards his way, &amp; as hée went, hée heard a bell ring to ſeruice, wherefore hee went to that Church for to heare Seruice, and after the ende of ſeruice he fell a ſléepe, and ther hée ſlept a long while, ſo that the prieſt ne none other might a wake him.</p>
               <p>The ſteward deſiring inwardly to heare of his death as he did hope, about one of the clock he went vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſaide vnto them thus, Syrs quod hée, haue yée done the Emperours commaundement or no.</p>
               <p>The Brickmakers anſwered him againe and ſaide. Nay ſurely wée haue not yet done his commaundement, but anone it ſhall bée done, &amp; with that they layde handes on him. Then cried the ſteward with an high voice, and ſaide. Good ſirs ſaue my Lyfe, ſor the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Fulgentious</hi> ſhould bée put to death. Then ſaide they, the meſſenger told not vs ſo, but hée bad vs that whoſoeuer came firſt to vs in the morning, ſaying as ye before rehearſed,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:12573:146"/>
that wée ſhould take him and caſt him into the Fornace &amp; bourne him to aſhes. And with that word they threw him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire.</p>
               <p>And when he was bournt, <hi>Fulgentious</hi> came to them, and ſaid. Good ſirs haue you done my Lords commaundement, yea, ſoothly ſaid they, and therefore go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Wée had in commaundement ſaide they vpon paine of death, that who ſo euer came to vs firſt in the morninge, and ſaide like as thou haſt ſaide, that wée ſhould take him and caſt him into the Fornace. But béefore thée, came the Steward, and therefore haue wee ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled on him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doment, and now is hee bournt to the bare bones.</p>
               <p>And when <hi>Fulgentious</hi> heard this, hée thanked God that hée had ſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him from death, wherfore hée tooke his leaue of the workmen and went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the Pallaice.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour perceiued him,
<pb facs="tcp:12573:147"/>
hée was almoſt diſtract of his wittes for anger, and thus hee ſayde: Haſt thou beene with the Bryckmaker and fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my commaundement? Soothly my gracious Lord I haue béene there, but or I came there, your commaundement was fulfilled. How may that bee true, quod the Emperour?</p>
               <p>Forſooth ſaid <hi>Fulgencious,</hi> the ſteward came to them afore mee, and ſayd that I ſhould haue ſayde: and when they heard that, they tooke him and threw him into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> forneis, and if I had comen any rather, ſo would they haue done to me, and therfore I thanck God that hath preſerued me from death.</p>
               <p>Then ſayd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour, tell mée the trueth of ſuch queſtions as I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of thee. Then ſaide <hi>Fulgentious</hi> vnto the Emperour. As I béeleue you neuer ſound in mee any falſehoode, and therfore I wondred greatly why ye had ordained ſuch a death for mee, for well ye know that I am your own brothers ſonne. Then ſaide y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperour to <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentious:</hi> It is no wonder, for that death I ordained to thee through counſell of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:12573:147"/>
the ſteward, bicauſe thou didſt defame mée throughout all my Empyre, ſaying, that my breath did ſtinck ſo grieuouſly, that it was death to thée, and in token hereof, thou turnedſt away thy face whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou ſeruedſt mée of my cuppe, and that ſaw I with mine eyes, and for this cauſe I ordained for thée ſuch a death, and yet thou ſhalt dye except I heare a better excuſe.</p>
               <p>Then anſwered <hi>Fulgentious</hi> and ſayd, A my moſt deere Lord, if it might pleaſe your highneſſe for to heare mée, I ſhall ſhew you a ſubtill and a deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full imagination. Say on quod the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.

When the Emperour heard this, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued him &amp; ſaid. O my neuew, now I ſee through the right wiſe iudgement of God the ſteward is brent, and his owne wickedneſſe and enuie is fallen on him

<pb facs="tcp:12573:149"/>
hunting in the Forreſt, ſodainly he rode out of his way, and loſt his men, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was greatly diſcomforted, for he wiſt not whether he rode, ne in what place he was, till at the laſt when he had rydden thus all the day alone, in the euening he ſaw a houſe, and thether hée rode a great pace, &amp; knocked at the gate.</p>
               <p>Immediately the good manne of the houſe heard him and aſked the cauſe of his knocking, and what he would haue. Deere friend quod the Emperour, lo it is night as ye may ſe, therfore I deſire you of lodging for the loue of God. When he had thus ſayd, the goodman of the houſe vnware that he was the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, aunſwered thus and ſayd Good friend quod he, I am the Emperours Foſter, and haue plenty of veniſon and other vittailes for you.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour hearde this, he was right glad in his mind, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he told him not that he was the Emperour. And the Foſter opened the gate, and receiued him as worſhipfully as hée could, and ſet him to his ſupper, and ſerued him honeſtly.</p>

               <p>And as the Emperour lay in his bed ſléeping, him ſéemed he heard a voice ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing to him thriſe, theſe words. Take, take, take.

               <p>And right now I heard another voice that ſayde, yeld, yeld, yeld, what ſhoulde I yelde.</p>
               <p>And as he laye thus thinking to him

               <p>This hearing, the foſter fell downe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both his knées at his féete, &amp; beſought him of mercy, if that he had offended his hightneſſe in any thing, praying him of forgiueneſſe.

And ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye fulfill my commaundement, yée ſhall dye the moſt fouleſt death that can be thought. Anone his ſeruaunts went to the forreſt, and receiued the Foſters ſonne and brought him with them, and when they were come néere vnto the pallaice, one of them ſaid. How ſhall wée doe, that we may fulfill our Lords com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement in diſtroying of this child. Some aunſwered and ſaide, that the child ſhould bée ſlaine, and ſome would haue ſaued his lyfe, &amp; while they ſtroue thus among themſelues, one of them that was moſt mercifull ſaide vnto the other. O my good friendes, heare my counſayle, and ye ſhall not forethinke it. If ye murther this innocent childe, wée ſhall greatly offend almightie god, and therefore héere bée young Pigges,

               <p>And when hée had thus ſaid, they did gladly after his counſaile in all things, and killed the Pigge, and went theyr way and carried home with them the Pigges hart to the Emperour, ſaying vnto him thus: Loe, gracious Lord, wée haue deſtroyed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Child as ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vs, and with that they ſhewed him the Pigges heart.

               <p>Loe, that is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart of him which ſhould haue ben Emperour after me. Lo, what it is to beeléeue in dreames &amp; viſions,
<pb facs="tcp:12573:152"/>
which be nought elſe but fantaſies and vaine thinges. The ſecond day after that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Childe was put into the hollow tree, there came an earle for to hunt in the forreſt, and as his houndes chaſed an harte, they came to this hollow trée where the Childe laye, and whan they felt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſauour of the Childe, they would goe no farther.</p>
               <p>The Earle ſéeing this, maruailed greatly why his houndes abode there, and ſmote his horſe with his ſpures and rode a great pace till he came to them. And when he came vnto the trée wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Childe was laide, he looked in at an hole &amp; ſaw there the childe lying, and then was hée right glad, &amp; tooke vp the Childe in his armes full louingly, and bare him home vnto his Caſtle, ſaying vnto the Counteſſe his wiſe. Loe, my deere wiſe, this day by fortune I haue found a very faire Childe in an holow trée as I hunted in the forreſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I am right glad.</p>
               <p>And beecauſe that I neuer begat ſon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ne daughter on thee, ne thou neuer yet conceiued a childe, therfore I exhort thée
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:12573:152"/>
that y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> wilt faine they ſelfe trauailing with childe, and ſay that thou haſt borne this childe. The Counteſſe fulfilled right gladly the earles will and deſire, and ſaid. My moſt déere Lord, your will in this thing ſhall bee done.</p>
               <p>Not long after this, newes went throughout all the country, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſe was deliuered of a fayre Sonne, wherfore euery man reioyſed much.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:12573:153"/>
and ſaide vnto the Earle in this wiſe. Whoſe Sonne is this, certes ſaid the Earle, hee is my ſonne. Than ſaide the Emperour. By the ſaith and trouth that thou oweſt vnto mée, tell mee the trouth.</p>
               <p>The earle ſéeing that hée might not excuſe himſelfe by no manner wiſe, but that néeeds hee muſt tell him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouth, than told hée him altogether, how hée had found him in the forreſt in an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low tree. This hearing, the Emperour was almoſt diſtracte of his wittes for anger, &amp; called vnto him his ſeruants, which he had ſent before to deſtroy the Childe.</p>
               <p>And when they came béefore him, hée made them to ſware vpon a booke that they ſhould tell him the trouth what they had done with the Childe.</p>
               <p>Gracious Lord ſaide they, wée yéelde vs vnto your grace &amp; goodnes, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt pitie ſo moued vs, that wée might not deſtroy him, and then wée put him in an hollow trée, but what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward befell of him, certainely we know

not, and in his ſteade we kilde a Pyg and brought you the hart thereof.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour had heard the very trueth of this matter, hee ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the earle.

               <p>And when the feaſt was ended, euery man tooke his leaue of the Emperour, &amp; went whereas they liſt.</p>
               <p>And at that time it fortuned that the Empriſſe and hir daughter ſoiourned in a great countrie, far fro thence by the commaundement of the Emperour.

               <p>Immediately the Emperour lette write letters, whereof his intent was this. That the Empriſſe ſhould take the bearer of theſe letters, and let him bée drawen at the horſe taile, and after

               <p>The knight ſeeing and beeholding the good fauour of this young ſquier, grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him lodginge, and made him good cheere and well to fare, and afterward brought him vnto his chamber, &amp; when hée was there, hee went to bed: And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fell on ſléepe, for hée was full wery of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When the knight ſaw the bore, hee opened it, and ſound the letters ſealed with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Emperours ſigne manuel, &amp; was greatly tempted to open them, &amp; at the

laſt, hée opened them full ſubtylly, and than hee redde how the Empreſſe vpon paine of death ſhoulde put the bearer of them to death, and then he was right ſorrowfull, and ſaide within himſelfe, Alas (quod hee,) it is great pitie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy ſuch a fayre young man, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I may, it ſhall not bée ſo.</p>
               <p>And immediatly after, the knight ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced out that writtinge, and wrote in the ſame paper a letter, ſaying theſe words. Upon paine of death I commaund thée that thou take the young Squire bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of theſe letters, and let him be wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded without any delaie vnto my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and yours, with all the honour and ſolempnitie that can bée thought, and whan they bée marryed that yée take him as your owne ſonne, and that hée keepe my roome till I come vnto you my<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Whan y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knight had thus written, hée cloſed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letters ſubtylly and put them into the bore againe.</p>
               <p>Early in the morning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> young Squire aroſe and very haſtely made him redie,
<pb facs="tcp:12573:155"/>
and toke his leaue of the knight, &amp; rode foorth on his iourney, and the third daie after, he came vnto the Empriſſe, and ſaluted hir right worſhipfully in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours beehalfe, and toke hir the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. And when the Empreſſe had redde them, anone ſhe ſent foorth hir meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers through the countrie, commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſtates and gentilmen to come vnto hir daughters wedding, at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daie aſſigned.</p>

               <p>Not long after it befell, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour came into that Countrie, and when the Empreſſe heard of hir Lords comming, ſhee toke with hir, hir ſonne in law, with much other people, and went towardes the Emperour, for to welcome him.</p>

               <p>A my déere Lord (quod ſhée,) all that ye commaunded mee to doe I haue full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. Nay curſſed woman ſayde the Emperour, it is not ſo, for I wrote to thée that thou ſholdeſt put him to death, and now I ſee him aliue.</p>
               <p>My Lord quod the Empriſſe, ſaueing your grace, you wrote to mee y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I ſhould giue him your dauhter to wyfe, and that on payn of death, in witneſſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of loe here your letters with your owne ſeale manuell.</p>
               <p>When the Emperour heard, this, hée wondred greatly and ſayd. Is he eſpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then to my daughter. Yea ſoothly ſayd the Empreſſe, long agoe with much ſolempnitie and great worſhippe, and as I perceiue your Daughter is with childe.</p>
