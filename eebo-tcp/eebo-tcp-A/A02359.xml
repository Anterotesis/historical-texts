         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Doubt not but your
Honoures knowe,
that when the most
ancient treuth of the
ancient of dayes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
in his holie
word, and left vnto
vs to be the onlie rule of our fayth,
doeth fayle our Adversaries of the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3686:3"/>
               <hi>Romish</hi> Church, that then their next
refuge is, after that they haue loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
sacred Scripture with odious
imputations of obscuritie, imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and sweying everie way, in
their severall conflictes, to fill the
eares of each one with their clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
vp-brayding of Antiquitie,
and humane authoritie, when di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
hath forsaken them; like <hi>Saul,</hi>
who when God would not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
him, had his recourse to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.</hi>
Which notwithstanding how
little it maketh for them, &amp; how as
smallie it avayleth them, as <hi>Balaam</hi>
did <hi>Balak,</hi> when hee sent for him to
curse, where in the contrarie hee
blessed: or as <hi>Baal</hi> ayded his owne
priests, when hee was so earnestlie
in-called vpon by them to answere,
while in the meane time there was
no voyce heard; any one, who with
a single eye ever perused the same,
may easilie perceiue, and manifolde
experience hath oftentimes proven.</p>
            <p>And yet we see that this is their
great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> wherein they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3686:3"/>
glorie more than the <hi>Iewes,</hi> when
they cryed, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the
Temple of the Lord:</hi> and as <hi>Rahel</hi> hid
her fathers Idoles, with the Camels
furniture, and sate on the same, and
would not aryse; So with the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of venerable, but wrested and
wronged Antiquitie, they would
hyde their Errours, and cover the
Idolatrie of their whorish mother,
from whom they can not bee moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to depart, nor goe out of <hi>Babel,</hi>
or put away their strange gods, and
bee purged with <hi>Iaakobs</hi> godlie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie.</p>
            <p>So that their doing is like the
craftie dealing of the <hi>Gibeonite</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoures,<note place="margin">Ioshua, 9.</note>
who to make a League
with the Lordes People, pretended
that they had journeyed from a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
farre countrey, and were come
for the Name of the Lord: and this
their impudent lie (which yet they
would haue to bee believed as an
vndoubted trueth) they soothe vp
(forsooth) by demonstration of
Antiquitie; that therefore all which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3686:4"/>
they had was olde: and this was
their onlie proofe, whereby <hi>Ioshua,</hi>
and both Princes and People were
deceived: the reason whereof is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in Scripture, Because they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
not counsell at the mouth of
the Lord.</p>
            <p>Even so, that which our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries
bring, when they haue quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Scripture, to make their blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
lies to bee believed, as
sure &amp; sacred trueth, is that which
(as they pretende) is from a verie
farre, even the Apostles tymes, and
ancient holie Fathers of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
Church, glorious in sufferings,
and from their immediate succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours:
And all this they doe (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth)
but for the Name of the
Lord, having a religious pretence
(as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did) of clearing
trueth, &amp; convincing errour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
and so to make vnitie of fayth
in the Church of God.</p>
            <p>And to performe all this, all
which they would seeme to showe
or say, is all olde, drawne from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3686:4"/>
But beeing aware (by <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua's</hi>
example) will wee trye the
men, and their speaches, their furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and pretences, and all this by
the right rule, with the men of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
and as <hi>Israel</hi> should haue done
the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> asking counsell at the
mouth of the Lord, which hee hath
opened in holie Scripture, and
which wee are bidden search, not
believing rashlie everie doctrine, to
bee carried about there-with, but
trying the spirits, whether they bee
of God, or no: and then wee shall
easilie discerne and discover their
guyle, and knowe the Beast by his
Dragon mouth, to bee but a craftie
counterfet of the Lambe.</p>
            <p>And tho for a seducing ende
(as was that of the olde Prophets
of <hi>Bethel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 13.</note> pretending the word of
the Lord) that these ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

yet they are found rather to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue

violentlie drawne contrarie to their

celebrated without anie figure,<note place="margin">1. Argument, taken from the nature of a mysterie.</note> it is
not convenientlie called a mysterie;
seeing that cannot bee called a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
wherein there is no secret
thing, nothing removed from our
corporall senses, nothing hid with
some coverture or other: But that
bread which by the administration
of the Priest is made the Bodie of
Christ, showeth one thing to the
outward senses of men, and cryeth
another thing inwardlie to the
soules of the Faythfull: Outwardlie
the Bread is that selfe-same which it
was before; for wee see that same
shape, and colour, and that same sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
thereof is also perceived; but
inwardly a farre more different, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and excellent thing is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3686:16"/>
and exhibite, because it is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venlie
and divine; that is, the Bodie

change is either from that which is
not, into that which is, or from that
which is, into that which is not, or
from that which alreadie is, into
another which in like manner is.
But in this Sacrament, if the trueth
in simplicitie be onelie considered,
and none other thing bee believed
by the senses than that which they
see, there shall none alteration heere
bee seene to bee made.</p>
               <p>For neither is there a change
out of that which was not, into that
which is, which manner of change
is seene in things growing, seeing
they were not before, but that they
may haue a being, they are changed
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:3686:18"/>
from not being, into that which
hath a being: But this Bread and
Wine were, before they were tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into the bodie and blood of
Christ. Neither is there such a
mutation as of that which hath a
being, changing into that which
hath no being; which sort of altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is in thinges perishing by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying;
for whatsoever decayeth,
first of necessitie had some being;
neither can that suffer such an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
which never had a being.
Now that this sort of alteration, is
not in the Sacrament, is cleare lyke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse;
because according to the
trueth, the forme of the creature
which it had before, is knowne as
yet constantlie to remaine.</p>
               <p>Also, there is an alteration
which is of that which hath a being,
into that which lyke-wyse hath a
being; which sort is seene in things
suffering a change in their qualities
onelie, (the substance remaining)
as when that which was white, is
changed into that which is blacke:
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:3686:18"/>
but neither is this alteration known
to be made in this Sacrament; for
there is nothing found heere to bee
changed, neither in touching, nor
colour, nor favour. If therefore
there bee nothing heere changed,
the elements are none other, than
that they were before.</p>

                  </note> because the bread
is made to bee the bodie, and the
wine the blood of Christ; for so saith
he himselfe, <hi>Take, eate, this is my
bodie:</hi> and so of the Cup, <hi>Take drinke,
this is the blood of the new Testament,</hi>
&amp;c. Wee must then demande of
them, who will vnderstand nothing
heere figuratiuelie, but all things to
consist in verball simplicitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
this alteration is made? seeing
they are not nowe these thinges
which they were before, to wit,
bread and wine, but are the bodie
and blood of Christ; for according
to the forme and shape of visible
thinges, both these haue in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
(substantiallie) none altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3686:19"/>
and if they haue suffered no
alteration, they are nothing else but
that which they were before.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (Renowned Prince)
your Highnesse seeth to what point
these of the contrarie opinion are
driven; for they denye that which
they are thought to affirme, and
that which they belieue, they are
found to destroy.</p>
               <p>For they confesse truelie, that
it is the bodie and blood of Christ:
and when they say this, without
doubt they graunt, that the bread
and wine is not that nowe which
they were before: and if they bee
other than they were, then they are
changed, seeing that cannot bee
denyed. Let them therefore tell
wherein they are changed? for we
see nothing corporallie to be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in them: of necessitie then they
must confesse either that they are
changed in some other respect, (to
wit, in vse) and consequentlie not
to bee that which they otherwise
are seene to bee in veritie, but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3686:19"/>
thing which they are not seene
to be according to their owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and substantiall existence. Or
if they will not confesse this, they
shall bee constrayned to denye, that
they are the bodie and bloode of
Christ at all: which not onelie is
abhominable to say, but to thinke
onelie.</p>
               <p>But because they will confesse,
that they are the bodie and blood
of Christ, neither could they haue
beene so, except the change had
beene to the better; neither is that
change corporallie, but spirituallie
made, of necessitie the speach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is figuratiue; because vnder the
vaile or curtaine (as it were) of
corporall bread and wine, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyed
vnto the soule the spirituall
bodie and bloode of Christ: Not
that these are the existences of two
diverse things, to wit, as of a bodie
and a spirit, but one and that same
selfe thing, according to one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is a sort of bread and wine,
and according to another is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3686:20"/>
and blood of Christ: according
to that, as they are touched corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie,
they are kyndes of corporall
creatures; but according to that
power whereby they are made so
spirituallie, they are the mysteries
of the bodie and blood of Christ.</p>

except it contained the strength of

dead: not in the flesh, (I meane)
but in the soule. And yet if wee
consider, in that fountaine onelie
that which our bodilie eye percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
it is seene to bee a moyst ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

to wash away the filth of the bodie,
but also to purge, by a spirituall

               <p>Beholde then, in one, and that

               </p>
               <p>Wee perceiue then, that the
Sea, and the Cloude, did carrie a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of Baptisme, and that our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in the olde Testament haue
beene baptized in them. Now,
could the Sea, in that it was an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
haue in it the vertue of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme?
or could the Cloude, in that
respect it did kythe the thickest part
of the aire, sanctifie the people?
Neither can we say, that the Apostle
(speaking in Christ) hath sayde
vntruelie, that our Fathers were
baptized in the water, and in the
cloude. And albeit that Baptisme
did not represent the same forme of
Baptisme of Christ which is nowe
vsed in the Church daylie, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
no man, in his wits
can denye, but it was a sort of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,
and in it our Fathers to haue
beene baptized; except, madlie, he
presume to gaine-say the Apostles
wordes.</p>
               <p>Therefore the sea and the cloud,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3686:22"/>
in that they are naturall bodies, giue
not the cleannesse of sanctification,
but according to that they contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them invisiblie the sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the holie Spirit; for there
was in them a visible forme, which
might appeare to the corporall sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of all, not in similitude, but in
the veritie it selfe; and inwardlie a
spirituall power shyned, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
not to carnall eyes, but to
the eyes onelie of the soules of the
godlie.</p>
               <p>Like-wyse the heavenlie Foode
which rayned from Heaven, and
the water that gushed from the

That our Fathers did eate that same

did consequentlie adde, That they
dranke of that Spirituall Rocke

Christ in the Desart did consist in
that spirituall Rocke, and gaue to

that the bodie and blood of Christ;
the which while it is made of the
fruites of the earth, it is sanctified,
and so becommeth a Sacrament, by
the Spirite of God, working invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie.
The Sacrament of which Bread
also, and of which Cup, is in the
Greeke called <hi>Eucharict,</hi> which in
Latine being interpreted, signifieth
THANKS-GIVING.</p>
               <p>And what is better (I pray
you) than the bodie and blood of
Christ?<note place="margin">26. Argument, That which is compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bodie and bloode of Christ, is not the verie same.</note> and therefore that bread
and that wine are compared to the

celebrated in remembrance onlie of
the Lords suffering for vs. And so
by saying this, hee showeth, that
the Lords proper suffering was but
once, but that the daylie remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
thereof in our holie Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
is often to bee represented.
Whence it is, that the bread which
is offered, al-be-it it be taken of the
fruits of the earth, while it is sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
it is turned in the bodie of
Christ; and that wine which did
proceede from the Vine-grape, by
the sanctification of the holie my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
is made the blood of Christ:
not visiblie, (as is vsuall, is substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
conversions) but (as the same
Father sayeth) by the invisible ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the holie Ghost.</p>
               <p>And because they are a farre
more different thing,<note place="margin">29. Argument, whatsoever outwardlie is taken by the mouth, serveth for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshment of the bodie: but Christes bodie and blood ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth for the invisible and spirituall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the soules, and therefore it is so taken.</note> by the invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
power, than they appeare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie,
and are seene to bee, hee
distinguisheth them, while he saith,
that the bread and wine are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
compared to the bodie and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3686:31"/>
blood of Christ; because as the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the visible bread and wine
nowrisheth and cheareth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, so the worde of God,
which is the liuelie bread, by the
participation thereof, refresheth in
like manner the soules of the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>By saying of which things, hee
confesseth plainlie, that whatsoever
is taken outwardlie in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Bodie and Blood of our
Lord, it is meete for the refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the bodie onelie; but the
word of God, which is the invisible
bread, beeing invisiblie present in
that Sacrament, doeth feede the
soules of the faythfull invisiblie,
quickning them by the participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of himselfe.</p>
               <p>Hence it is, that the same divine
Doctor sayeth, that it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in anie celebration, when the
action is so performed, that some
thing is vnderstood to be signified,
which is to bee holielie taken. By
saying which, hee showeth, that all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:3686:32"/>
Sacramentes in holie matters, doe
containe some mysticall thing, and
that it is one thing which is seene
by our outward eyes, and another
thing which is inwardlie to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
by our mynds. And after
this hee showeth what Sacraments
are to bee celebrated by the fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
to wit, Baptisme, and that of
the Bodie and Blood of Christ.</p>
               <p>Which are called Sacramentes,<note place="margin">30. Argument, Those thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the divine vertue more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlie
worketh salvation: Whence
it is, that from their secret and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

And thereafter hee sayeth,
that in the Greeke they are called
MYSTERIES, because they
haue a secret and hid nature and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
with them.</p>
               <p>What then are we taught here?<note place="margin">31. Argument, Those thinges that are not perceived, nor taken, but by diverse instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, they are not the same, but the Bread and Wine, and the Bodie and Bloode of Christ, are not perceived, nor taken, by the same instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but by diverse: and therefore are not the same.</note>

to bee the bodie and blood of our

one thing they show outwardlie,

are also called Sacramentes, because
by the covering of corporall things,

               <p>Out of all then which hath bene

what hee doeth thinke concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this matter? for hee sayeth, in
his first Booke of the Sacramentes,
Surelie it is a wonderfull thing, that
God rained downe heavenlie Food
vnto our Fathers, and that they
were daylie nowrished vpon cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall
meat; whence it is sayde, that
Man did eate the bread of Angels:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3686:33"/>
and yet they who did eate that
bread, died all in the Desart. But
that meate which thou takest, and

from heaven, furnisheth the now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment
of everlasting lyfe: and

shall never die: and this bread is the

               <p>Looke then in what respect it
is, that this holie Doctor sayeth, that
Christes bodie is foode, which the
faythfull receiue in the Church; for
hee sayeth, that bread of lyfe which
came downe from heaven, furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
the nowrishment of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting lyfe.<note n="*" place="margin">

furnisheth that nowrishment, as it
is seene? or as it is taken corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie?
as it is chewed with the teeth?
swallowed with the mouth? and
received in the stomacke? Not.
For that way it should feed the flesh
onelie, which is mortall; neyther
giveth it anie immortalitie that way,
nor can it bee sayde, that who-so-ever
eateth this bread so, shall not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3686:34"/>

in that bread there is a lyfe,
which is not seene with these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

with sight of fayth, and that is that
heavenlie bread which came downe

which it is sayd, who-so-ever eateth
this bread, shall liue for ever, which
is the bodie of our Lord.</p>
               <p>Also in the wordes following,
when hee was speaking of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie
power of Christ, he sayeth
so, The word of God that might of
nothing make that which was not,
can Hee not change these thinges
which are, into that vvhich they
were not? For it is not a greater
matter to create new things, than to
change natures.</p>
               <p>Sainct <hi>Ambrose</hi> then sayeth, that
there is in the Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die

they beeing consecrated, are seene

by the mightie power of the

beholdeth, feedeth the soule onlie,
and furnisheth the nowrishment of

               <p>Also in the words following he

our Lord was borne of the Virgine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:3686:35"/>
                  <hi>Marie.</hi> But heere then aryseth the

neither that we must aske, how

How carefullie and wyselie, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,

so the Sacrament of his

in that respect that he sayeth, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the veritie of his flesh,

that hee was crucified, and buried:

for what-so-ever is seene, or tasted
in that foode corporallie, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,
that it is subject vnto corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Heere-to hee addeth; Because
it is the bodie of Christ (sayeth he)
thou wilt object, and say, Beholde,
manifestlie hee confesseth, that this
bread, and this wine, is the bodie
and bloode of Christ. But take
heede what is subjoyned: This is
not corporall foode, but spirituall.
Looke that thou conceiue not a
a carnall meaning heere-fore; for
there is no such thing heere. True
it is, that it is the bodie of Christ;
not corporall, but spirituall: the

spirituall. Therefore there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

               <p>Also in the wordes following,

that bodie, which is called <hi>The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

not onelie feedeth the Soule, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

               <p>Wherefore the Author him selfe

               <p>By which thinges it is showne
evidentlie vnto vs, that nothing is
vnderstood in that meat and drinke
corporallie, but all is to bee taken
spirituallie: for the soule of man,
which is signified by his heart, is
not fed with corporall foode, but is
nowrished and quickened by that
word of God. Which the same
Doctor showeth more manifestlie,
in his fift Booke of the Sacraments,
saying, It is not that bread wich en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
into the bodie, but that bread
of lyfe, which giveth quickning to
our soules.</p>
               <p>And that Sainct <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake
not this of the common bread, but
of the bread of the bodie of Christ,
the next words manifestlie declare,
for hee speaketh of the daylie bread,
which the faythfull desire to bee
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3686:39"/>
given them, and therefore hee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyneth
these wordes, If it bee our
daylie bread, why take yee it onelie
at the ende of a whole yeare? as the
<hi>Grecians</hi> in the East vsed to doe. Take
then that daylie, which will bee
profitable to thee daylie; and liue
so, that thou mayest bee worthie

               <p>It is manifest then concerning
what bread hee speaketh, to wit,
concerning the bodie and blood of
Christ, which nowrisheth not, in
that it goeth downe into the bodie,
but because it is the bread of everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

betweene the bodie of Christ which

foorth out of his syde on the
Crosse, and betweene this bodie
which is celebrated daylie by the

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3686:40"/>
seeing it is the mysterie onelie
of that blood, wher-with the whole

               <p>That bread and that drinke,
therefore, according to that they
are seene; are not the bodie and
blood of Christ, but according to
that they furnish the nowrishment
of lyfe spirituallie. But that bodie
of Christ, wherein he was crucified,
carried none other shape, or appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
than wherein it did consist
truelie: for it was truelie that bodie
which was seene, which was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
which was crucified, which
was buried; lyke-wyse that blood
which gushed foorth out of his side,
seemed not one thing outwardlie,
and mysticallie covered another
thing inwardlie; therefore it was
true blood which sprang from that
true bodie. But that blood of Christ,
which now the faythful drinke, and
the bodie which they eate, is one
thing according to their shape, and
another thing according to their
signification: for it is one way wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3686:40"/>
they feede the bodie with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall

they fill our soules with the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall

               <p>Concerning which thing Sainct
<hi>Ierome,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">9 Argument, From Sainct <hi>Ierome</hi> his testimonie.</note> in his Commentarie vpon

indeed, and My Blood is Drinke indeede:</hi>
or corporallie, according to that
flesh which was crucified, and that
blood which was shed by the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
Lance. It is not then by a
small difference that hee maketh
such a distinction of the bodie and
blood of Christ: for while he saith,
That this flesh or blood which is
taken by the faythfull, is spirituall,
but that flesh which was crucified,
and that blood which was shed by
the Souldiours Lance, is not spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall,
hee insinuateth thus much,

we must not onelie consider in that
bread, this bodie of Christ, but also
the bodie of the whole believers in
him must be represented, for which
cause it is made vp of manie graines

the Church is made vp of manie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,

so also in the same mysterie
the members of the Church are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented,
to bee one in Christ: and
as not corporallie, but spirituallie,
that bread is called the bodie of the

the water also which is mixed with

the bodie of Christ then, which hath

               <p>But if they bee not one, howe

the bodie of Christ, and that bee
sayde truelie, because it is so, then
in veritie it is his bodie: and if it be
in veritie his bodie, it is incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible,

of necessitie this bodie which is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated

incorruptible, and eternall. But it
can-not bee denyed, but that is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to corruption, which is divy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in partes, to bee taken; and
beeing brayed with the teeth, is sent
downe into the Bellie. Therefore
it is one thing that is seene outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and another thing which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
by fayth inwardlie. For as
it falleth vnder the sense of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
it is corruptible; but as fayth
believeth, it is incorruptible. That
which is seene then outwardlie, is

The wordes that I speake vnto you

as hee sayeth him selfe, The

               <p>Also these things that are a-like,

Nowe concerning the true

Yee may then say vnto

to the Heavens, and lifted vp his

to come, to judge the quicke and
the dead, &amp; there he is presentlie, at

howe then can this bee his bodie?
or this Cup, or that which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth,
his blood? Brethren, these
thinges are called Sacramentes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in them there is one thing
seene, and another thing is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
that which is seene, hath a
corporall shape; but that which is
vnderstood, hath a spirituall fruit.</p>
               <p>This Venerable Doctor then,
by saying this, teacheth vs, what
wee ought to thinke, concerning
the proper bodie of Christ, which
was borne of the Virgine, and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
nowe at the right Hand of the
Father, in which hee is to come
to judge the quicke and the dead:
and what wee ought to thinke of
that which is offered vpon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3686:51"/>
where-of the People are made
partakers. That bodie is whole;
neither is it divided by any cutting,
nor covered with anie figures: But
this which is set vpon the Table of
the Lord, is a resemblance of that,
because it is a Sacrament: And that
which is seene outwardlie, hath a

               <p>And holie <hi>Augustine,</hi> instructing
vs sufficientlie of the rest, sayeth,
That as in that bread which was
offered on the Altar, the bodie of
Christ was resembled, so also the
bodie of the people that did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue,
it was lyke-wyse represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
that so hee might showe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festlie,
that that is the proper bodie

was buried, rose againe, ascended
to the Heavens, and which present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
sitteth at the right Hand of his

But this which is set vpon

as the Apostle witnesseth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
For wee beeing many, are one
bread, and one bodie in Christ.</p>
               <p>Wherefore (most Noble Prince)

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> of the holie Fathers, That that

betweene the mysterie of his

suffered, was buried, and rose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
because this is the proper

desire the sight of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
hee is our head: and by the

one, not according to that that our

according to the fulnesse of the

is celebrated in a mysterie, is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance,
not onlie of the proper
bodie of Christ, but also of all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers

that Bread, and that Bloode, which

of the Lordes death and Passion,
that it may call to recent memorie
that which was done long a-goe:
where-by wee beeing remembered

thorowe which wee are delivered
from ever-lasting Death, and from

rightlie belieue in the true Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer

Christ, the Saviour.</p>
            <p>That Lambe was offered in the

            <p>Those <hi>Israelites</hi> did eate the

that Ever-lasting Lyfe, and I will
rayse him vp at the last Daye. I am

            <p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:3686:61"/>Hee blessed then Bread before
his suffering, and divided it vnto his
Disciples, thus saying, <hi>Eate of this
Bread, It is My Bodie:</hi> and <hi>doe this
in My rememberance.</hi> Also he bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Wine in one Cuppe, and sayde,
<hi>Drinke yee all of this: This is My
Blood, which is shedde for manie, in
forgiuenesse of sinnes.</hi> The Apostles
did also as Christ commanded: that
is, They blessed Bread and Wine, to
housell againe afterwardes in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberance.
Even so also their
Successoures, and all Priestes, by
Christes Commaundement, doe
blesse Bread and Wine, to housell
in his Name, with the Apostolicke
Blessing.</p>
            <p>Nowe men haue often searched,
and doe yet often search, howe
Bread, which is gathered of Corne,
and thorowe Fyres heate baked,
may bee turned to Christes bodie?
Or howe Wine, which is pressed
out of manie Grapes, is turned, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3686:62"/>
a blessing, to the Lordes
bloode?</p>
            <p>Nowe saye wee vnto such men,
That some thinges bee spoken of
Christ by signification, and some be
thinges certayne. True this is,
and certayne, That Christ was
borne of a Mayde, and suffered
death of his owne accorde, and
was buried, and on this Daye rose
agayne from Death. Hee is sayde
to bee Bread then by signification,
and a Lambe, and a Lyon, and a
Mountayne. Hee is called Bread,
because hee is our Lyfe, and Angels
lyfe. Hee is sayde to bee a Lambe,
for his innocencie. A Lyon, for
strength, where-with hee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the strong Devill. But Christ
is not so, not-with-standing, after
true nature, neyther Bread, nor a
Lambe, nor a Lyon.</p>
            <p>Why is then that holie Housell
called Christs bodie? or his blood,
if it bee not truelie that which it is
called? Truelie the bread and the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3686:62"/>
wine, which in the Supper by the
Priest is hallowed, showe one thing
with-out, vnto humane vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
and another thing with-in,
vnto believing mindes. With-out,
they are seene bread and wine, both
in figure, and taste: and they bee so
truelie after their hallowing: But
Christes bodie and blood, by ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
mysterie.</p>
            <p>An Heathen Chylde is christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
yet hee altereth not his shape
with-out, though hee bee chaunged
with-in. Hee is brought vnto the
Font-stone sinfull, thorowe <hi>Adams</hi>
disobedience: And how-be-it hee
is washed from all sinne with-in,
yet hee hath not changed his shape
with-out.</p>
            <p>Even so the holie Font water,
which is called the Well-spring of
Lyfe, is lyke in shape vnto other
water, and is subject to corruption:
but the holie Ghostes might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
to the corruptible water, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
the Priestes blessing: and it
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3686:63"/>
may after wash the bodie and soule
from all sinne, thorowe Ghostlie
might.</p>
            <p>Beholde, nowe wee see two
thinges in one creature, after true
nature, that water is corruptible
moysture, and after ghostlie my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
hath whole-some vertue. So
also, if wee beholde that holie Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
after bodilie vnderstanding,
then wee see that it is a creature,
corruptible, and mutable: but if
we acknowledge there-in ghostlie
might, then vnderstand wee that
life is there-in, and that it giveth
Immortalitie to them that eate it
with beliefe. Much is between the
invisible might of this holy Housel,
and the visible shape of its proper
nature. It is naturallie corruptible
bread and wine: and is by might
of Gods word, truelie Christes
bodie, and his blood: not so, not-with-standing,
bodylie, but ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie.</p>
            <p>Much is betweene the bodie
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:3686:63"/>
of Christ, which hee suffered in,
and the bodie which is hallowed to
housell. The bodie, truelie, that
Christ suffered in, was borne of the
flesh of <hi>Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ie,</hi> with blood and bone,
with skin and sinewes, in humane
limmes, with a reasonable soule,
living: But his ghostlie bodie,
which wee call the Housell, is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
of many Cornes, with-out
blood and bone, with-out limme,
with-out soule; and there-fore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is to be vnderstood there-in
bodilie, but all ghostlie. What-so-ever
was in that Housell, which
giveth substance of life, that is of
the ghostlie might, and invisible
doing.</p>
            <p>Therefore is that holie Housell
called a mysterie, because there is
one thing in it seene, and another
thing vnderstoode. That which is
there seene, hath bodilie shape; and
that which wee doe there vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
hath Ghostlie might.</p>
            <p>Certainlie, Christs bodie which
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:3686:64"/>
suffered death, and rose againe from
death, never dieth hence-foorth,
but is eternall, and impassible. That
Housell is temporall, not eternall;
corruptible, and dealed in-to sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie
partes; chewed betweene the
Teeth, and sent downe in-to the
bellie: how-be-it never-the-lesse
after Ghostlie might, it is all in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
part: Manie receiue that holie
bodie, and yet not-with-standing it
is so all in everie part, after Ghostlie
mysterie. Though some chewe
the lesse, yet there is no more might
not-with-standing, in the more
parte, than the lesse, because it is
whole in all men, after the invisible
might.</p>
            <p>This mysterie is a Pledge, and
a Figure. Christes bodie is Trueth
it selfe. This Pledge wee doe
keepe mysticallie, vntill that wee
bee come vnto the Trueth it selfe,
and then is this Pledge ended.
Truelie it is so as wee before haue
saide, Christes bodie, and his blood,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:3686:64"/>
not bodilie, but ghostlie.</p>
            <p>But now heare the Apostles
wordes about this mysterie. <hi>Paul</hi>
the Apostle speaketh of the olde <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
thus, writing in his Epistle
to faythfull men; <hi>All our Fore-fathers
were baptized in the Cloude, and in the
Sea; and all they did eate the same
ghostlie Meate, and dranke the same
ghostlie Drinke: They dranke truelie of
the Stone that followed them, and that
Stone was Christ.</hi> Neither was that
Stone then from which the Water
ranne, bodilie Christ; but it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Christ, who calleth thus to all
believing and faythfull men; <hi>Who-so-ever
thirsteth, let him come to Me, and
drinke, &amp; from his bowels shall flow liuely
water.</hi> This hee saide of the holie
Ghost, which they received, who
believed in him.</p>
            <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that the
<hi>Israelites</hi> did eate the same ghostlie
Meate, and dranke the same ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
Drinke, because that heavenlie
Meate that fed them fourtie yeares,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:3686:65"/>
and that water which from the
Stone did flow, had signification
of Christs bodie and his blood,
which now are offered daylie in
Gods Church. It was the same
which wee now offer, not bodilie,
but ghostlie.</p>
            <p>Wee saide vnto you ere-while,
that Christ hallowed bread and
Wine, to housell before his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and said, This is My Bodie,
and My Blood: yet he had not then
suffered, but so, not-with-standing
he turned, thorow invisible might,
that bread to his owne bodie, and
that wine to his owne blood, as hee
before did in the Wildernesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that he was borne to be a Man,
when hee turned that heavenlie
meat to his flesh, and the flowing
water from that Stone to his owne
blood.</p>
            <p>Verie manie did eate of that
heavenlie Meat in the Wildernesse,
and dranke that ghostlie Drinke,
and were never-the-lesse dead, as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3686:65"/>
Christ saide: and Christ meant not
that death which none can escape;
but that ever-lasting death, which
some of that folke deserved for their
vnbeliefe. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and
many others of that people which
pleased God, did eate that heavenlie
Bread, and they died not that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
death, tho they died the
common death. They saw that
that heavenlie Meate was visible
and corruptible, but they ghostlie
vnderstood, by that visible thing
another Meate, and ghostlie recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
it.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, saith, <hi>Hee that
eateth My Flesh, and drinketh My
Blood, hath ever-lasting Life.</hi> Now
hee bade them not eate that bodie
where-with hee was inclosed, nor
drinke that blood which he shed
for vs: but hee meant by these
words, that holie Housel, which
ghostlie is his bodie and his blood;
and hee that tasteth it with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
heart, hath that eternall life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:3686:66"/>In the olde Law faythfull men
offered to God diverse Sacrifices;
which had fore-signification of
Christs bodie, which for our sinnes
hee him selfe hath since offered to
his heavenlie Father for sacrifice.
Certainlie this Housell, which wee
hallow now at Gods Altar, is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of Christs bodie, which
hee offered for vs: and so him selfe
commanded, <hi>Doe this in My remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</hi>
Once suffered Christ by him
selfe; but yet never-the-lesse his
suffering is daylie renewed at this
Supper, thorow the mysterie of the
holie Housel.</p>
            <p>Therefore wee ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
diligentlie, how that this holie
Housel is both Christs bodie, and
the bodie of all faithfull men, after
ghostlie mysterie, as wyse <hi>Augustine</hi>
saith of it, If yee will vnderstand of
Christes bodie, heare the Apostle
<hi>Paul,</hi> thus speaking, Yee, truelie, be
Christs bodie, and his members.
Now is your mysterie set on Gods
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:3686:66"/>
Table, and yee receiue your my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
which mysterie yee your
selues bee. Bee that which you see
on the Altar, and receiue that which
yee your selues bee.</p>
            <p>Againe, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth,
<hi>Wee beeing manie, are one Bread,
and one Bodie.</hi> Vnder-stand now,
and rejoyce: Manie bee one Bread,
and one bodie in Christ: Hee is our
head, and wee are his limmes. And
as the Bread is not of one Corne,
but of manie; nor the Wyne of one
Grape, but of manie: So also wee all
should haue one vnitie in the Lord;
as it is written of the faythfull Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,
howe that they were in so
great an vnitie, as tho all of them
were one soule, and one heart. So
Christ hallowed on his Table, the
mysterie of our peace, and of our
vnitie. Hee which receiveth that
mysterie of vnitie, and keepeth not
the band of true peace, receiveth no
mystery for him selfe, but a witnesse
against him selfe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:3686:67"/>It is verie good for Christen
men, that they goe often to housell,
if they bring with them vnto the
Altar Vnguiltinesse, and innocencie
of heart: if they bee not oppressed
with sinne. To an evill man it
turneth to no good, but to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
if hee receiue vnworthilie
that holie Housell.</p>
            <p>Holie Bookes commaund, that
water bee mingled with that wine
which shall bee for housell; because
the water signifyeth the people,
and the wine Christes blood: And
there-fore the one, with-out the
other, shall not bee offered at the
holie Housell: that Christ may bee
with vs, and wee with Christ; the
head, with the limmes; and the
limmes with the head.</p>
            <p>Wee would before haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of the Lambe which the olde
<hi>Israelites</hi> offered at their Easter time,
but that we desired first to declare
vnto you of this mysterie, and after,
how wee should receiue it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:3686:67"/>I. That signifying-Lambe was
offered at the Easter: and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Sainct <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth, in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of this present day, that Christ
is our Easter, or Passe-over; who
was offered for vs, and this daye
rose agayne from death.</p>
            <p>II. The <hi>Israelites</hi> did eate the
Lambes flesh, even as GOD had
commaunded them, with vnleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
bread, and wilde Lettuice: So
should wee receiue that holie Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
of Christes bodie and bloode,
with-out the leaven of Sinne and
Iniquitie: For as Leaven turneth
the creatures from their nature, so
doeth Sinne also change the nature
of Man, from Innocencie, to Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse.
And the Apostle hath
taught, howe wee should feast, not
in the Leaven of Evilnesse, but in
the sweete Dough of Puritie and
Trueth.</p>
            <p>III. The Hearbe which they
shoulde eate with the vnleavened
bread, is called Lettuice, and is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:3686:68"/>
in taste: So wee shoulde with
bitternesse of vnfeigned repentance
purifie our myndes, if wee will
eate Christes bodie.</p>
            <p>IIII. Those <hi>Israelites</hi> were not
wont to eate rawe flesh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God bade them to eate it ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rawe, nor sodden in water, but
roasted with fyre. Hee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the bodie of God rawe, that
shall thinke, with-out reason, that
Christ was onelie Man, lyke vnto
vs, and was not God. And hee
that will, after mans wisedome,
search of the mysterie of Christes
Incarnation, doeth lyke to him that
seetheth Lambes flesh in water; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that water in this same place
signifyeth mans vnder-standing.
But wee should vnder-stand, that
all the mysterie of Christes huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
was ordered by the power of
the holie Ghost. And then eate
wee his bodie roasted with fyre,
because the holie Ghoste came in
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:3686:68"/>
fyerie lykenesse vnto the Apostles,
in diverse Tongues.</p>
            <p>V. The <hi>Israelites</hi> should eate the
Lambes head, and the feete, and the
purtenances; and no-thing must
there-of bee left over-night. If
anie thing there-of was left, they
did burne that in the fyre: And
they brake not the bones. After
ghostlie vnder-standing wee doe
then eate the Lambes head, when
wee take holde of Christes Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
in our Beliefe. Againe, when
wee take holde of his Humanitie
with loue, then eate we the Lambes
feete; because that Christ is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
and the Ende, GOD be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all Worlde, and Man in the
ende of this Worlde. What bee
the Lambes purtenances, but even
Christes secret Preceptes? And
these wee eate, when wee receiue
with griedinesse the Worde of
Lyfe. There must no-thing of the
Lambe bee left till the morning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
all Gods Sayinges are to bee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3686:69"/>
searched with carefulnesse, and
great diligence: so that all his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes
must bee knowne in vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
and deede, in the night of
this present lyfe, before the last day
of the vniversall Resurrection doe
appeare. And if wee can not
search out throughlie all the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
of Christes Incarnation, then
ought wee to betake the rest vnto
the might of the holie Ghost, with
true humilitie: and not to search
rashlie of that deepe secretnesse,
aboue the measure of our vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>
            <p>VI. They did eate the Lambes
flesh with their Loynes girded. In
the Loynes, is the lust of the bodie.
And hee that will receiue that holie
housell, shall cover and wrap in
that Concupiscence, and take with
Chastitie that holie Receit.</p>
            <p>VII. They were also shod. And
what bee Shooes, but of the hydes
of dead beastes? Wee bee truelie
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:3686:69"/>
shod then, if wee match in our steps
and deedes, the liues of men depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this lyfe, which pleased God
with keeping of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes.</p>
            <p>VIII. They had Staues in their
handes, when they did eate. This
staffe signifieth a care-fulnesse, and
a diligent over-seeing: and all they
that best knowe, and can, should
take care of other men, and stay
them vp with their helpe.</p>
            <p>IX. It was enjoyned to the
eaters, that they should eate the
Lambe in haste; for God abhorreth
sloath-fulnesse in his Servants: and
those hee loveth, which seeke the
joye of Ever-lasting Lyfe, with
quicknesse, and hastinesse of mynd.
Prolong not to turne vnto GOD,
left the tyme passe away, thorowe
thy slow tarrying.</p>
            <p>X. The eaters might not breake
the Lambes bones: No more might
the Souldioures, which did hang
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3686:70"/>
CHRIST, breake His Holie
Legges, as they did of the two
Thieues which hanged on eyther
syde of Him: And the LORD
arose from death sound and whole,
with-out all corruption: And at the
last Iudgement, they shall see Him,
Whome they did moste cruellie
wound on the Crosse.</p>
            <p>XI. This Tyme is called in the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue PASCHA, and in
<hi>Latine</hi> TRANSITVS, and in <hi>English a</hi>
PASSE-OVER; Because that
vpon this daye the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell</hi>
passed from the Lande of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
thorowe the redde Sea, from
the bondage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> towardes
the Land of Promise. So also did
our LORD, at this Tyme, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
(as sayeth Sainct IOHN the
EVANGELIST) from this Worlde,
to His heavenly Father. And even
so wee ought to follow our HEAD,
and to goe from the <hi>Devill,</hi> vnto
CHRIST: from this vnstable
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3686:70"/>
Worlde, vnto His stable KING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOME:
How-bee-it wee shoulde
first, in this present lyfe, departe
from Vyce, vnto holie VERTVE:
from evill manners, vnto good: if
vvee vvill, after this our lent lyfe,
goe to that Eternall Lyfe, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our resurrection, to CHRIST:
Hee bring vs vnto His Ever-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
Father, Who gaue Him vnto
Death for our Sinnes: To Him
bee Honour, and Prayse of
Well-doing, Wordle
with-out ende.</p>

A Professor long in the

            <p>OF the other two thinges,<note place="margin">Lib. 5. c. 11 De Seim. propriet.</note>
left vnto vs in Legacie,
that is, Of the Bodie and
Blood of the LORD, it may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
Why amongst all the Fruites
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3686:72"/>
of the Earth, chiefelie he did choose
Bread and Wine, to designe the
same, as if these did excell all other
Fruites of the Earth in woorth, and
were of greatest value? Which
Question wee thinke may bee thus
solved: Our LORD did choose,
that the Sacrament of his bodie
and blood should bee so received
by the mouth of the Faythfull, and
that the same should bee converted
to their nowrishment; that by the
visible worke, the invisible effect,
and working of the other, might
be showne, and made manifest.</p>
            <p>For as the materiall Foode out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlie
nowrisheth and feedeth the
bodie, so the Word of God inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
nowrisheth the Soule, &amp; streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theneth
the same: For it is not by
Bread onelie that Man liveth, but
by everie Word that procedeth out
of the Mouth of God: And the
Word is become Flesh, and hath
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:3686:72"/>
dwelt amongst vs (sayeth Trueth
it selfe.)</p>
            <p>And (as sayeth Christ himselfe)
<hi>My Flesh is Meat indeede, and My
Blood is Drinke indeede.</hi> Now the flesh
of Christ is Meate indeede, because
it feedeth truelie, and nowrisheth
man vnto eternall Life; (which is
onelie true Life) and his blood is
Drinke indeede, because truelie and
solidlie it satiateth and slockeneth
for ever the hungering and thirsting
soule after Righteousnesse. For as
for temporall life, men indeede may
haue the same with-out this meate
and drinke; but that Eternall they
cannot attaine vnto; because that
this Meate and Drinke signifieth
that eternall societie and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of the members vvith their
head, and their strait conjunction:
<hi>For</hi> (sayeth hee,) <hi>Hee that eateth
My Flesh, and drinketh My Blood,
abydeth in Mee, and I in him.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is needfull, that wee receiue
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:3686:73"/>
his bodie and blood, that wee may
abyde in Him, and become mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of His Bodie.</p>
            <p>And the Sacrament heere-of,
to wit, of our Becomming one
with CHRISTES bodie and
blood, it is taken off from the Table,
to some men, vnto destruction; but
the thing it selfe which is signified,
is taken by all men vnto lyfe, and
by none vnto destruction. For who-so-ever
is partaker of that, the same
man shall bee associate as a member
to CHRIST his head, into that
Heavenlie Kingdome.</p>
            <p>For it is another thing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
it selfe, and the vertue of
the Sacrament. The Sacrament it
selfe, is onelie taken by the mouth;
but by the vertue of the Sacrament,
the inward man is refreshed. The
Sacrament also is turned into the
food of the bodie; but by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:3686:73"/>
of the Sacrament, the dignitie
of eternall Lyfe is obtained. In the
Sacrament againe, all the faythfull
Communicantes make a paction of
mutuall fellow-ship, and brotherlie
peace amongst them selues heere;
but by the vertue of the Sacrament,
all the members, joyned and strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
coupled with their head in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Glorie, shall rejoyce for ever.</p>
            <p>Therefore, as the Sacrament it
selfe is turned in our substance,
when wee haue eaten and drunken
the same; so lyke-wyse shall wee be
turned into the bodie of Christ, if
wee obedientlie and holilie liue in
him.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, because Bread
strengtheneth the bodie, therefore
for the lyke operation towardes the
soule, it is called Christs bodie: and
because Wine furnisheth nutritiue
blood, and cheareth the bodie,
therefore is for that relation to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:3686:74"/>
Christes bloode, why it is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
there-vnto. And these visible
signes, when they are sanctified,
then by the holie Spirit they are
converted into the Sacrament of
the bodie of Christ.</p>
            <p>But it is onelie in the way of
this lyfe,<note place="margin">Cap. 10. de Euchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stia.</note> that wee are so sed, and
refreshed with the Sacrament of
the bodie and blood of Christ; that
so nowrished there-by, wee may
become one bodie: and by the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
of this heere, wee may bee
prepared for immortall and eternall
thinges heere-after.</p>
            <p>And in so farre as spirituallie
wee are quickened in him, being
sealed vp by Angels Foode vnto
that lyfe, that holie Spirite of his
worketh powerfullie in vs, by these
his holie Sacraments.</p>
            <p>And because according to the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:3686:74"/>
flesh it behoved him to pearce the
Heavens,<note place="margin">Cap. 41.</note> that these who by fayth
are renewed, and borne over againe
in him, might more confidentlie
and earnestlie long after him, hee
hath left vnto vs this Sacrament,
as a visible Figure, and Resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance;
