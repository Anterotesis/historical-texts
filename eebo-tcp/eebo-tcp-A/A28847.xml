         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THe Controverſie of <hi>Quietiſm,</hi> which
is the Subject of the following Book,
having made a great Noiſe in the World;
and taken up the Conclave of <hi>Rome</hi> for ſome
Months, and nothing having as yet appear'd
in Engliſh, but on the ſide of the Defendant,
the Arch biſhop of <hi>Cambray:</hi> It is not at
all doubted, but this Book, which is the Biſhop
of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Hiſtory of that Hereſie, and his
Anſwer to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
will meet with a good Reception from the
Publick.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hath all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
boaſted ſo much of her <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, muſt
of Neceſſity forbear now to urge that Plea
any more, when as it will appear by this
Book, ſhe is reduc'd to ſuch a ſtrait, that
either ſhe muſt condemn the Generality of
the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> or the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and divers Perſons whom
<pb facs="tcp:48044:3"/>
ſhe has Canonized for Saints. It will alſo
appear but too too evidently from this
Treatiſe, that <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> owes its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to that Anti-chriſtian Church, and
that their Opinions are much favoured
there at preſent, when ſuch horrid Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies
as thoſe the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>
charges upon M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> and her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,
the Arch biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> from
Letters and Manuſcripts under their own
Hands, continue ſo long without a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Cenſure, whilſt at the ſame time ſhe
foments a Raging Perſecution againſt the
Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> and hath rais'd a
New One againſt thoſe of <hi>Germany.</hi>

            <head>A
HISTORY
OF
Quietiſm.</head>
            <p>SEing my Lord Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
an anſwer to his demands ſo preciſely,
and that in this conjuncture, none of 'em
are more important than thoſe that regard our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
which he endeavours by all means poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
torender odious, whereas he himſelf pretends
always to abound with Charity aud Meekneſs
even to exceſs; If I ſhould delay to ſatisfie him,
he would reap too great an advantage from our
ſilence. What does he not inſinuate againſt us by
theſe words of his anſwer to our Declaration? The
proceedings of thoſe Prelates of whom I have juſt
cauſe to complain, have been ſuch, that I have
reaſon to think I ſhould not be believed if I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
them, and indeed it is fit to conceal the
knowledge thereof from the Publick. Nothing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48044:4"/>
can be imagined more vigorous and extream than
what is included in this diſcourſe, wherein by
feigning a deſire to keep ſilence, he ſays more
than if he ſpoke out. That he may juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be in the right, and make us appear to be
in the wrong, this Prelate in the firſt Edition of
his Anſwer lays down this important matter of
Fact: <hi>That he had got it</hi> to be propoſed to my
Lord of <hi>Chartres</hi> that we ſhould by conſent Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Pope to order a new Edition of his Book
to be regulated by his Divines at <hi>Rome;</hi> ſo that
we ſhould have nothing to do but to rely upon
thoſe Divines: And a little after, I demanded
a ſpeedy anſwer, but inſtead of that I received
the Printed Declaration againſt me. We know
nothing of this pretended matter of fact. My
Lord of <hi>Chartres</hi> will inform the Publick touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his concern: But without expecting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation
of a fact of ſuch importance: My Lord
of <hi>Cambray</hi> retracts it himſelf, ſeeing he would
have recalled that Edition, though publiſhed at
<hi>Rome</hi> by his own order; and that in the other
which he ſubſtitutes, in its place, he ſuppreſſes the
whole Article. We have in our hands both Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
the one wherein he alledges that matter of
fact, and the other where it is ſuppreſſed; and
the proof is demonſtrative, that that Prelate,
without remembring the facts he alledges, writes
the moſt odious things that can come into his
Head, and at the ſame time ſo falſe, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is obliged to retract and ſuppreſs them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48044:4"/>
2. <hi>This is enough to let the World ſee what
a fine gloſs he would put on his own Conduct;
and in what frighful Colours he would ſet off ours.
His chief aim is to defame me; and he is not ſatisfied
to accuſe me in all his Letters of</hi> a precipitant and
imbittered Zeal: <hi>It is to me that he writes thoſe
words:</hi> You never ceaſe tearing me in pieces; <hi>and
what is ſtill more injurious,</hi> You every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore
my Condition, and rend me pretending to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
me. <hi>He adds,</hi> What can any one think of
thoſe Tears that ſerve only to give more Authority
to the Accuſations? <hi>in the ſame Letters he ſays,</hi>
Paſſion hinders me from ſeeing what is before my
Eyes; and the exceſs of my prejudice bereaves me
of all exactneſs. <hi>I am, ſays he,</hi> the Author of the
Accuſation againſt his Book: I am that unmerciful
Man, who not being able to glut my fury by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct
and ambitious Cenſure contained in our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
redouble my blows upon him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
And adds, That when come to my ſelf again
<hi>I</hi> make uſe of ſmooth words to call him a ſecond Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linos;
<hi>an expreſſion that never came out of
my Mouth, this Prelate knows himſelf, that
I have always diſtinguiſhed betwixt him and</hi>
Molinos <hi>in their Conduct, and alſo in certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
though he has advanced all his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.
But here are more particular Accuſations:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. I do not comprehend at all, ſays he, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Monſieur de <hi>Meaux:</hi> On one hand he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlames
himſelf with indignation: (<hi>for to hear him
ſpeak I am never</hi> compos ment is) &amp;c. Inflames
himſelf, I ſay, with indignation, when any one
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48044:5"/>
ſeems but to doubt whether there may not be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of Evidence in Md. <hi>Guyons</hi> Syſtem: On the
other hand he gives her the Communion himſelf, he
authoriſes her in the daily uſe of the Sacraments,
and when ſhe leaves <hi>Meaux</hi> he gives her a full at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation,
without requiring any act from her
whereby ſhe may formally recant any Error: Whence
then can ſo much ſeverity and ſo much remiſneſs
proceed?</p>
            <p>4. Theſe are the reproaches we have under
the Hand of My Lord of <hi>Cambray,</hi> in a writing
ſtill extant. He knows well enough to whom
he directed it, and we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak
of it hereafter: Every thing is untrue in the
place juſt now mentioned: He would not be ſo
juſt as to ſay that I gave the Communion (once
only) to Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> and to obſerve in the
mean time that it was at <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe was
admitted to it by her Superiours: So that it was
not ſo much as in my power to exclude her from
the Sacred Table: They gave her the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
in conſideration of the frequent profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
ſhe made of an actual Submiſſion and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
At <hi>Meaux</hi> I appointed her a Confeſſor,
to whom I gave full permiſſion to give her the
Communion upon account of the intire Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhe expreſt both by word and writing in the
moſt expreſſive terms that could be conceived.
She ſubſcribed the Condemnation of her own
Book, as containing ill Doctrine: She alſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
our Cenſures, wherein her Printed Books and
her whole Doctrine are Condemned: And in the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48044:5"/>
laſt place ſhe rejected by a ſpecial writing on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
the Chief Propoſitions that formed her Syſtems.
I have all theſe acts under her Hand, and I gave
that Atteſtation which they call a full one, only
in reſpect of thoſe acts therein expreſly enumerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and with ſpecial prohibition that ſhe ſhould
not Direct, Teach or Dogmatiſe; which ſhe
agreed to under her Hand in that ſame atteſtation.
Thus that incomprehenſible mixture of remiſneſs
and rigour is cleared by thoſe Acts, and the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation
of my Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> manifeſtly proved
to be falſe: Who does not then perceive by this,
that no Credit ought to be given to the Facts
which that Prelate alledges againſt a Brother, and
intimate Friend ſuch as I was? I readily grant to
my Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> that if we
have done him any wrong, he ought, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peats
without ceaſing, to maintain the Honour of
his offended Miniſtry; let him do us the ſame
juſtice. I am then on the other hand bound to
make the truth appear, upon the complaints he
makes uſe of to exaſperate the Publick againſt me.
We muſt then find out the ſource, and what may
be the cauſes of thoſe deceitful Tears, and of
the Paſſion he accuſes me of: We muſt look
back as far as the Origine to ſee whether it be
Charity or Paſſion that has guided me in that Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair,
It has laſted above four years, and I am the
firſt that was drawn into it. The connexion of
the matters of fact does not allow me to ſeparate
them, and I am neceſſarily bound to relate all the
particulars of that unpleaſant Hiſtory when the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48044:6"/>
Conduct of my ſelf and of my Brethren cannot be
underſtood but by that means.</p>
            <p>5. It cannot chuſe but be very afflicting to ſee
Biſhops come to ſuch diſputes, even as to matters
of fact; it is a ſubject of Triumph for the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
and an occaſion of their accounting Piety
Hypocriſie, and of holding the aſtairs of the
Church in deriſion: But if People won't be ſo juſt
as to look to the Original, they muſt judge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon. My Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> boaſts of it
every where that he was not the firſt that wrote,
that he might thereby perſwade the World he has
right on his ſide, and lay us under an odium as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the unjuſt agreſſors: He directs thoſe words
to my ſelf: Who was it that writ firſt? Who was
it begun the Scandal? But is it lawful to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
certain and publick matters of fact? Who is it
really that appeared firſt in Print upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
I or my Lord of <hi>Cambray?</hi> Who was it
that frſt in an Advertiſement at the beginning of
an important work gave notice that he deſigned
only to explain more at large the Principles of
two Prelates, (my Lord of <hi>Paris</hi> and my ſelf)
which were made publick to the world in four and
twenty Propoſitions? Had we agreed together
that he ſhould explain our Principles? Had I
ſo much as ever heard of his Explanation?
My Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> ſays many things of my
Lord of <hi>Paris,</hi> which that Prelate hath confuted
by unqueſtionable facts, and with general ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.
But as to me, the excuſes my Lord of
<hi>Cambray</hi> makes have not the leaſt ground, ſeeing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48044:6"/>
it is certain that I never ſo much as heard of the
explanation he had a mind to publiſh of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principles. Did I deal with my Lord of
<hi>Cambray</hi> in this manner? And when I was about
to publiſh the Explanation I had promiſed of our
Doctrine, did not I at firſt put the Manuſcript
into the hands of my Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> in order
to examine it? Theſe are moſt certtain matters of
facts, and ſuch as are not to be denied. I am
then plainly innocent of the differences that have
happened between us; though I am accuſed as
the Author of all the miſchief: If inſtead of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planing
our principles, it appears that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
of Capital Errors: If he fill a whole Book
with the Notions of <hi>Molinos,</hi> and only gild them
over with ſpecious pretences, ought we to
ſuffer it? The only thing then we are to do, is
to examine whether the bottom of our cauſe be
as good as we have demoſtrated it elſe where:
But in the mean time it is clear in the face of the
Sun, and before God and Men that we are not
the Aggreſſors; that our defence was lawful in
as much as it was neceſſary, and that there was not
the leaſt ſhadow for controverting that part of the
proceeding which is the ground work of all
that followed.</p>
            <p>6. The reſt is no leſs evident: But in order to
acquaint the Publick therewith, ſeeing my Lord
of <hi>Cambray</hi> himſelf urges us thereto, and that he
has five hundred People at his beck all over Europe
to eccho his Complaints every where; what elſe
can we do, but repeat things again, from the very
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48044:7"/>
Original by a Narrative as plain on the one hand
as true on the other, and maintained by certain
Proofs.</p>
            <p>1. For a long time I heard it from Perſons
eminent for Piety and Prudence that the Abbot
of <hi>Fenclon</hi> was favourable to the new way of
Prayer, and I had proofs given me of it, that were
not altogether to be rejected. Being concern'd
for himſelf, for the Chruch, and for the Princes
of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Tutor he was, I often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed
him upon that Subject, and endeavour'd
to diſcover his Sentiments in hopes of bringing
him back to the Truth, if he ſhould a little
ſwerve from it. I could not perſuade my ſelf
that a Perſon of his Light, and of that docible
Temper I took him to be, could fall into theſe
Deluſions; or at leaſt continue in them, tho' he
might perhaps be dazzled by them. I have always
entertained a firm perſuaſion of the ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Truth upon thoſe that hearken to it, and
I never doubted but the Abbot of <hi>Fenclon</hi> was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to it. Yet I was ſomewhat uneaſie to find
he did not enter ſo frankly with me upon that
matter, as he did upon others that we treated of
ever day. At laſt God deliver'd me out of that
uneaſineſs: And a Friend to us both, a Perſon of
eminent Merit and Quality, came when I thought
leaſt on't, to declare to me that Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> and
her Friends were willing to refer her way of
Prayer and her Books to my Judgment. It was
about <hi>September,</hi> 1693. when this was propoſed
to me. Now to divine why they imparted that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48044:7"/>
Secret to me, whether it was one of thoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Truſt God puts, when he pleaſes, into
the Hearts of Men, to bring about his hidden
Deſigns, or whether they only thought that in
the preſent conjuncture, ſome protector or other,
muſt be look'd for amongſt the Biſhops: This, I
ſay is beyond my reach. I won't uſe Arguments, I
I deſign only to relate Matters of Fact, which, as
in the ſight of God, I have as freſh in my Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
as the firſt day, and know them alſo by the
Writings concerning them, I have in my Hands.</p>
            <p>I am naturally afraid to incumber my ſelf with
Buſineſs to which I have not a manifeſt Call;
What happens in the Flock committed to my
Charge, notwithſtanding my Unworthineſs, does
not give me much Trouble; I put confidence in the
Holy Miniſtry, and the Divine Vocation. As for
that time when they propoſed to me to examine
that Matter, they repeated ſo often, that it was
the Will of God, and that Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
nothing elſe but to be taught, a Biſhop in
whom ſhe truſted could not well refuſe her the
Inſtruction ſhe demanded with ſo much Humility,
that at laſt I yielded. I ſoon knew it was the
Abbot of <hi>Fenclon</hi> who had given that Counſel;
and I thought it a happineſs to find ſuch a natural
occaſion offer of explaining my ſelf with him:
God would have it ſo. I ſpoke to Madam <hi>Guyon;</hi>
all her Books were delivered to me, and not only
the Printed ones, but alſo the Manuſcripts, as her
Life, which ſhe had written in a great Volume,
ſome Commentaries upon <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Judges,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:48044:8"/>
the Goſpel, the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
and ſeveral other Books of Scripture. I took
them with me to my Dioceſs, whether I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going:
I read them with attention: I made large
Extracts of them as are uſually made of a Subject,
by one who is to judge of it; I wrote down at
length with my own Hand her very words; and
marked the pages, and in four or five months I
fitted my ſelf to pronounce the Judgment that was
demanded of me.</p>
            <p>2. I never would take upon me neither to hear
the Confeſſion of that Lady, nor to direct her
though ſhe propos'd it to me, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
my ſentiments of her of prayer, and of the
Doctrine of her Books, making uſe in the mean
time of the liberty ſhe gave me to command or
forbid her, in that matter, as God whoſe light I
continually begg'd, ſhould be pleas'd to inſpire
me.</p>
            <p>3. The firſt occaſion I had to make uſe of that
power was this: I met with an account in the
Life of that Lady, that God did give her ſuch
abundance of grace, that ſhe burſt out with it in
a Literal ſenſe, ſo that they were fain to unlace
her: She did not forget to take notice that a
Dutcheſs once on a time perform'd that Office
for her in that condition, they often laid her up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
her Bed; and many times if they did but ſtay
and sit by her, they receiv'd the grave of which
ſhe was full, and that was the only way to eaſe
her: She ſaid moreover in expreſs words, that
thoſe graces were not for her; that ſhe had no
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48044:8"/>
need of them, being full of grace otherwiſe, and
that this ſuperabundance was for others. I lookt
upon this immediately as haughty, new, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard
of, and therefore at leaſt very ſuſpicious,
and my heart that had a continual loathing of the
Doctrine of the Books I read, was not able to
brook that manner of giving grace. For if you
take it diſtinctly, it was neither by her prayers
nor admonitions ſhe gave it; there was no need
of any thing elſe but to ſit by her to receive an
immediate effuſion of that fulneſs of grace, being
struck with ſo amazing a thing, I wrote from
<hi>Meaux</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> to that Lady, forbidding her, as
God did by my mouth, to uſe that new way of
communicating graces, until ſhe were further ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd.
I was willing to proceed moderately in
every thing, and to connemn nothing abſolutely
before I had ſeen all.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>That part of the Life of Md.</hi> Guyon <hi>is of
too great conſequence to be leſt doubtful; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I ſhall give the explanation of it in her own
words.</hi> Thoſe, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> that the Lord has given
me; (<hi>this is the ſtile all over the Book</hi>) my true
Children have a tendency to keep ſilence by me. I
diſcover their need, and communicate to them in
God what they want; they feel very well what
they receive, and what is communicated to them
with fulneſs. <hi>A little after,</hi> There's no more to be
done but to ſit by me in ſilence; <hi>Therefore that
communication is called</hi> the communication in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<hi>without ſpeaking and writing; it is the
Language of the Angles, that of the Word which,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48044:9"/>
is but an eternal ſilence: Such as ſit thus by her</hi>
are nouriſhed, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> inwardly by the grace
which I communicate in fulneſs <hi>as they did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the grace around her,</hi> I felt my ſelf, <hi>ſays
ſhe,</hi> to empty and be eas'd by degrees; every one
receiv'd their grace according to their degree of
prayer, and fel by being near me that fulneſs of
grace brought by Jeſus Chriſt: It was like a Sluce
that over-runs with abundance: They did feel
themſelves filled, and for my part I felt my ſelf to
be emptied, and to be eas'd of my fulneſs: My Soul
was repreſented to me like one of thoſe torrents that
fall from the Mountains with unconceivable
ſwift.</p>
            <p>5. <hi>What ſhe tells with particular care is, as has
been ſaid, that there is nothing for her ſelf in that
fulneſs of grace; ſhe repeats every where that all
was full; there was nothing empty in her: She
was as a Nurſe that burſts out with Milk, but
takes none at all for her ſelf:</hi> I am, <hi>Says ſhe,</hi> for
theſe many years, in a ſtate that ſeems equally naked
and empty; and for all that I am very full: A
water that fills a Pool to the brink: as long as you
ſee it keep within bounds, it affords uothing by which
its fulneſs may be diſtinguiſhed; but if a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundance
be added, it muſt either diſcharge it
ſelf or burſt out: I never feel any thing for my
ſelf; but when they ſtir at any time that Fund
which is inwardly full and calm, that cauſes the
fulneſs to be felt with ſo much exceſs, that it guſhes
out upon the ſenſe: It is, <hi>continues ſhe,</hi> an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of the fulneſs, a guſhing out of a Well,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48044:9"/>
always full for ſuch Souls as have need to draw
the Waters of that fulneſs: It is the Divine Ciſtern
whence the Children of Wiſdom draw inceſſantly
what they ſtand in need of.</p>
            <p>Being at a time in one of thoſe exceſſes of fulneſs,
having ſome perſon about her, and a Woman
ſaid that <hi>ſhe was fuller than uſually; I told them,</hi>
ſaid ſhe, <hi>I ſhould die of fulneſs, and that my ſenſes
were ſo overwhelmed by it as I ſhould burſt:</hi> It
was upon this occaſion that the Dutcheſs ſhe
mentions, and whom I ſhall never diſcover, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leced
me,</hi> ſays ſhe, <hi>out of charity to eaſe me;</hi> which
<hi>was not able to prevent my body from burſting on
both ſides, through the violence of the fulneſs.</hi> She
eaſed her ſelf by communicating of her fulneſs to
a Confeſſor whom ſhe deſcribes, and to two other
perſons that I ſhall not name.</p>
            <p>It was after having ſeen thoſe things, and many
others of as great conſequence which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
that my Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> perſiſts in his
Defence of Madam <hi>Guyón</hi> in ſuch terms as will be
amazing, when we come to the Article where
I muſt quote them, as written with his own
hand. It will be then as clear as the Day; and by
what is already perceived, that Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> is
the ground of this buſineſs after all, and that his
deſire alone to maintain her, has ſeparated that
Prelate from his Brethren, ſeing he attacks me, as
has been ſeen, upon my procedure with Madam
<hi>Guyon,</hi> as well as with himſelf, and that too in
ſuch a manner as might render my Miniſtry and
my Conduct odious to the whole Church, he
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48044:10"/>
ſhould have foreſeen what his reproaches would
conſtrain me at laſt to diſcover: But a higher rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſtill compels me to ſpeak. We muſt forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
the minds of the Faithful againſt a ſeducing
Doctrine, which ſtill has a being: A Woman
that can deceive Souls by ſuch Deluſions ought to
be made known, eſpecially when ſhe meets with
Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rers and Defenders; and has a great party
for her with an expectation of new things as ſhall
be ſhewn hereafter. I confeſs this was really a
a work of Darkneſs which we ought to wiſh
might have been kept hidden, and I ſhould have
concealed it for ever, as I have done for above
three years with an unpenetrable ſilence; had
they not too exceſſively abus'd my diſcretion, and
had not the thing come to ſuch a point, that we
muſt for the Service of the Church plainly lay
open what ſhe had privily hatch'd in her boſom.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Madam</hi> Guyon <hi>perceiving preſently that I
found many extarordinary things in her Life, ſhe
therupon prevented me by a Letter written and
ſigned with her own Hand, thus,</hi> There are three
ſorts of extraordinary things that you may have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved:
The firſt which regards the inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
in ſilence; this may be eaſily atteſted
by a great number of perſons of Merit and probity
that have tried it: Thoſe perſons whom I ſhall have
the Honour to name, when I have that of ſeeing
you, are able to juſtifis it. As for the things that are
to come, it is a thing that I don't much care any
body ſhould mind: This is not the eſſential point:
<hi>But I have been obliged to write all.</hi> Our Friends
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48044:10"/>
may eaſily juſtifie that to you, either by ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
they have in their hands, written ten years
ago, or by ſeveral things they have been witneſſes
of, the Idea of which I eaſily loſe. As for the things
that have reſpect to Miracles, I have writ them in
the ſame plainneſs as the reſt. <hi>You ſee then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
that in her opinion ſhe communicates Grace
in that unheard of and prodigious manner juſt
now mentioned: And beſides, that ſhe is a great
Propheteſs and a Worker of Miracles; ſhe deſires
me thereupon to ſuſpend my Judgment till I had
ſeen and heard her; which I did as much as I
could upon the laſt Heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>9. <hi>I ſhall leave for a little while the Miracles
that I meet with in every page of her Life, and
her Predictions which are either wavering, falſe,
or a confuſed medley. As for the Communications
in ſilence, ſhe endeavours to juſtifie them by a
Writing ſhe ſubjoyns to this Letter with this
Title;</hi> The Lords Hand is not ſhortened: <hi>She
alledges</hi> the Example of the Celeſtial Hierarchies
which ſhe does alſo in ſeveral places in her Life;
that of the Saints who underſtand one another
without ſpeaking; that of Iron touched with the
Load ſtone; that of looſe Men who communicate
one to another a Spiirit of Debauchery, that of St.
<hi>Monica</hi> and of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the Tenth Book of the
the Confeſſions of that Father: <hi>Where 'tis true he
ſpeaks of the ſilence whereinto thoſe two Souls
were drawn, but without the leaſt mention of
thoſe prodigious Communications, of thoſe arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
fulneſſes, and of thoſe overflowings juſt now</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48044:11"/>
ſpoken of. I don't ſpeak of thoſe Experiences I
was referred to; nor yet of certain effects which
poſſeſſion, or if you will, a ſtrong fancy, may
operate. Theſe are nothing elſe than proofs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they are to be tried and examined according
to that principle of the Apoſtle, <hi>Try the Spirits
whether they be of God; trie all things:</hi> And again,
<hi>Hold faſt that which is good.</hi> When in order to
come to this Trial, I had begun by forbidding
thoſe abſurd Communications; Madam <hi>Guyon</hi>
endeavoured to excuſe one part of it, as the burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of her Cloaths in two places by that frightful
plenitude: I have her unſatisfactory Anſwer in
a Letter writ with her own Hand, which ſerves
to juſtifie the matter of fact. As for the examining
of ſo ſtrange a Communication, we may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it is to no purpoſe; All that was good in the
Anſwer was, that the Lady promiſed to obey
and to write to no body; which I had required,
to keep her from medling with directing of any
body, as ſhe uſed to do with an amazing Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
For amongſt other things in her Life, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
alſo by her Printed Expoſition upon the
<hi>Canticles,</hi> that by an Apoſtolical Power and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
wherewith ſhe was endowed, and to which
the Souls of ſuch a pitch are raiſed; ſhe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>ſaw clearly into the bottom of the Souls,</hi> but
like wiſe <hi>received a [marvelous] Authority upon
the Bodys and Souls of ſuch as our Lord had given
her.</hi> The inward ſtate, ſays ſhe, ſeems to be in
my hand, (by the flowing out, as has been ſaid, of
that Grace communicated out of her fulneſs)
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48044:11"/>
without their <hi>knowing how, nor wherefore they could
not forbear to call me their Mother; and when
they had taſted of my direction all other conduct was
burthenſome to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>10. Amidſt the precautions I made uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the courſe of thoſe Deluſions, I continued
my reading, and came to that place where ſhe
foretells the approaching Reign of the Holy Ghoſt
over all the Earth: A terrible perſecution againſt
her method of <hi>Prayer</hi> was to precede it; I ſaw,
ſays ſhe, <hi>The Devil unbound againſt the ſaid</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<hi>and againſt me: That he was a going to raiſe
a ſad Perſecution againſt the followers of that ſort of</hi>
Prayer: <hi>He was afraid to attack my ſelf: He
feared me too much: Sometimes I defied him:
He was afraid to appear: I was as terrible to him
as a Thunderbolt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>11. One Night (<hi>ſays ſhe to God</hi>) being throughly
awake, You ſhewed me unto my ſelf under the form of
that Woman in the <hi>Revelations:</hi> You ſhewed me
that Myſtery; you made me to comprehend that
Moon: My Soul was above viciſſitude and changes.
<hi>She remarks alſo her ſelf</hi> and the Sun of Juſtice
that ſurrounded her, and the Divine Vertues which
made as it were a Crown about her Head: She
was big with Fruit; that is, of that Spirit, Lord,
ſaid ſhe, that you were willing to communicate to
my Children: The Devil throws up a flood againſt
me: It is Columny: The Earth would not ſwallow
it up: It ſhould fall by little and little: I ſhould
have Millions of Children: <hi>After the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48044:12"/>
ſhe applies her ſelf to the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>12. <hi>Afterwards ſhe ſees the Victory of ſuch as
as ſhe calls the Martyrs of the Holy Ghoſt. O
God, ſays ſhe,</hi> As an inſpired Perſon, you do
hold your peace: You will not always be ſilent. <hi>After
this Enthuſiaſtick fit, ſhe ſhews the Conſummati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all things by the extent of that ſame Spirit
over all the Earth. A little after ſhe gives an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi>
that going to <hi>Verſailles</hi> ſhe ſaw the King a
Hunting afar off: That ſhe was taken up in a
Divine Rapture with ſo intire a Poſſeſſion that ſhe
was conſtrained to ſhut her Eyes: She had then an
aſſurance that His Majeſty would aſſiſt her in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
manner, &amp;c. Says ſhe, O that our Lord
would permit I ſhould ſpeak to him: I write, goes
ſhe on, in order to conceal nothing; the matter
finds little credit now becauſe ſhe is a cried down
Perſon. But ſhe had in the mean time an aſſurance
that ſhe ſhould be delivered from Reproaches by
means of a Female Protectreſs, <hi>who we know fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
her very little, tho' ſhe names her in two
parts of her Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>13. Every one may make their reflections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Prophecies of that Lady as they pleaſe;
as for me [I will inſiſt only on matters of Fact:]
This is a very conſiderable one; in one of her
Enthuſiaſtick fits upon the Wonders ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
God was about to work by her; it ſeems
to me ſays ſhe, as if God hath choſen me in this
Age to overthrow Humane Reaſon: To eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
the Wiſdom of God by overthrowing the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48044:12"/>
Wiſdom of the World: <hi>He will Eſtabliſh the
Cords of his Empire in me, and the Nations will
acknowledge his Power: His Spirit ſhall be [pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon all Fleſh:] They ſhall Sing the Song of the
Lamb, as a Virgin, and they that will Sing it
ſhall be utterly diſapropriated: What I bind ſhall be
bound, and what I looſe ſhall be unlooſed: I am
that Stone faſtned by the Holy Croſs, rejected by
the Builders;</hi> the reſt I have read my ſelf to the
Abbot of <hi>Fenelon:</hi> He knows well who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
at the Conference, and it was himſelf alone
whom I regarded, becauſe it was he who ought as
a Prieſt to teach others.</p>
            <p>14. <hi>Madam</hi> Guyon <hi>continues to aſſume to her
ſelf a Prophetick Air in her explanation of the
revelations from whence I have extracted theſe
words:</hi> The time is at hand; it is nearer than we
think; for God will chuſe two particular Witneſſes,
whether it be thoſe who are really living and are
to give Teſtimony; or thoſe juſt now ſpoken of
(<hi>which are Faith and pure Love:) And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi>
O Myſtery truer than the day that ſhines,
you are now lookt upon as a ſtory, as little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
Tales, as diabolical things: The time ſhall
come when all thoſe things ſhall be lookt upon with
reſpect, becauſe they ſhall ſee then that they come
from God; he himſelf will preſerve them until the
day he has appointed to have them declared.</p>
            <p>15. It is of her writings ſhe thus ſpake. She
inſinuates in every place of her Life that they are
inſpired: She brings as a remarkable proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
the wonderful ſwiftneſs of her hand, and omits
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48044:13"/>
nothing to ſhew that ſhe is the Pen of that ready
Writer ſpoken of by <hi>David.</hi> Her Diſciples have
boaſted of this to me an Hundred times: She her
ſelf boaſts that her Writings ſhall be preſerved by
Miracle; and one day it ſhall come to paſs, ſays
ſhe, again, in her Expoſition on the <hi>Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
that it is written here ſhall be no more Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
nor Foreign.</p>
            <p>16. Thus ſhe entertains her Hearers, with
hopes of wonderful things to come. I have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
with my own hand one of her Letters to
Father <hi>la Combe;</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak in its
place: I have given back the Original, which
was given me from a ſure hand, to take a Copy
of it. Not to inſiſt upon her Predictions, mixed
with truth and falſehood, which ſhe continually
ventures at; I ſhall only remark, that therein ſhe
confirms her empty Viſions upon the Woman Big
with Child in the <hi>Revelations;</hi> and it is perhaps
for this reaſon ſhe inſerts in her Life that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prophetical Letter.</p>
            <p>17. I Collected every thing I thought uſeful
to open the Eyes of the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon,</hi> whom
I thought uncapable of being deceived by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions
of ſuch a Propheteſs when I ſhould ſet them
before him; but here are other Remarks beſides
that I made, for the ſame end.</p>
            <p>18. I know not how I ſhall do to explain the
thing that offers firſt. For, ſays ſhe, <hi>That Dream
ſo ſeized me, and my Mind was ſo clean, that
there remained in me neither diſtinction nor thought
except what our Lord gave me.</hi> But what was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48044:13"/>
that Dream then? And who is it that this Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Woman ſaw therein? A Mountain where
ſhe was received by Jeſus Chriſt: A Room where
ſhe asks, for whom thoſe two Beds were that ſhe
ſaw: <hi>There's one for my Mother, and the other
for you my Spouſe:</hi> And a little after, I have
choſen you to be here with me. When I reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> for ſo ſtrange a Viſion: When
I repreſented to her that Bed for a Spouſe ſeparated
from the bed of the Mother, as if the Mother of God
in a Spiritual and Myſtical Sence, was not ſo to
ſpeak the Bride of all Brides: She always anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me: It is a Dream. But, ſaid I to her, it is
a Dream that you give us a great Myſtery, and
as the ground of your manner of <hi>Prayer, or rather
not of a Prayer, but of a State, of which nothing
can be ſaid becauſe of its great Purity.</hi> But to
paſs over this, and you, O Lord, if I durſt I
would beg of you one of your Seraphims with the
moſt burning of all its Coals to purifie my Lips
that are polluted by this Narrative though abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
neceſſary.</p>
            <p>19. I ſhall with leſs trouble ſpeak of another
effect of the Title of Bride, I meet with in the
Life of that Woman. It is thus; She came to a
State wherein ſhe could no more pray to the Saints
nor even to the Holy Virgin, That is already a
great evil to acknowledge ſuch a State, ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the Catholick Doctrine: But the reaſon ſhe
gives of it is far more ſtange: <hi>It is not, ſays ſhe,
for the Bride, but for the Domeſticks, to pray to
others to pray for them;</hi> as if every pure Soul was
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48044:14"/>
not a Bride: Or that ſhe were the only perfect
one: Or as if the Bleſſed Souls we were to pray
unto were not Brides more united to God than
whatſoever is moſt Holy, and moſt united to him
upon Earth.</p>
            <p>20. What we moſt frequently meet with in
that Book, and in all her other Books; is, that
this Lady was without Error. This is the mark
ſhe gives every where of her ſtate, intirely united
to God, and of her Apoſtleſhip; but though her
Errors were infinite, that which I took notice of
moſt, was, that which concerned the excluſion
of all deſires, and of all petitioning for ones ſelf
by reſigning up our ſelves to the Will of God
how ſecret ſoever it be; in reſpect either of
our Damnation or Salvation. This is the Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Doctrine in all that Ladies Printed Books
and Manuſcripts; and upon which I examined
her in a long Conference I had with her private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I ſhewed her in her Writings and cauſed it
to be repeated to her ſeveral times, <hi>That every
Petition for ones ſelf carried ſome intereſt along
with it contrary to pure Love, and conformity to
the will of God; and at laſt very preciſely that
ſhe could not ask any thing for her ſelf.</hi> What, ſaid
I to her, can't you ask nothing for your ſelf?
No, anſwered ſhe, I cannot. She was much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed
about the Petitions of the Lords Prayer:
I ſaid to her: What, cannot you beg of God the
remiſſion of your Sins? No, replied ſhe: Well,
ſaid I to her again immediately, I whom you make
the Judge of your way of Prayer; I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48044:14"/>
as God does by my Mouth, to ſay after me;
<hi>Lord I beſeech thee forgive me my Sins.</hi> I can,
ſaid ſhe, well enough repeat thoſe words; but
to make the ſentiment thereof enter into my
Heart is againſt my way of ſilent Prayer. It was
then that I declared to her that I could no more
allow her the uſe of the Holy Sacraments whilſt
ſhe entetained ſuch Doctrine; and that her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
was Heretical. She promiſed me four
or five times to receive inſtructions, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it; and this was the end of our Conference.
It was h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ld in the beginning of the year 1694, as
I can eaſily juſtifie by the Dates of the Letters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
thereunto.</p>
            <p>Soon after, this was followed by another more
important Conference with the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi>
in his Appartment at <hi>Verſailles;</hi> I entred into the
ſame full of confidence, that by ſhewing him in
Madam <hi>Guyons</hi> Books all the Errors and Exceſſes
juſt now mentioned, he would agree with me
that ſhe was deceived, and was in a ſtate of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
All the anſwer I had was, that ſeeing ſhe
had ſubmitted as to the Point of Doctrine, the
Perſon muſt not be condemned: As for all the
other Excuſes, thoſe prodigious communications
of grace, as for what ſhe ſaid of her ſelf, of the
height of her graces, of the ſtate of her eminent
ſanctity; that ſhe was the Woman with Child in
the <hi>Revelations,</hi> her to whom it was given to
bind and to unbind, the Corner Stone, and the
reſt of that Nature; he told me that it was the
practiſing what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays; <hi>Try the Spirits;</hi> as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48044:15"/>
for the great things, ſhe ſaid of her ſelf,—it was a
magnanimity in her not inferior to that of <hi>S. Paul</hi>
when he recounts all his gifts, and that it was that
very thing that muſt be tried. God gave me
quit other ſentiments: Her ſubmiſſion did
not render her form of ſilent prayer good; but
gave us only hope that ſhe ſhould be brought
back into the right way: The reſt appeared to
me manifeſt deluſions, that there was no need of
any other proof, but only a plain relation of the
matter of fact. I intimated my Opinion with all
imaginable freedom, but at the ſame time with all
poſſible meekneſs, fearing nothing ſo much as to
exaſperate him whom I deſign'd to bring again
into the good way. I withdrew aſtoniſhed to find
a man of ſuch fine wit, admiring a Woman whoſe
light was ſo ſhort, her merit ſo little, and her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions
ſo palpable. The tears I poured out then
in the ſight of God, were none of thoſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
my Lord of <hi>Cambray</hi> upbraids me now; you
ſhed tears for me, and you tear me in pieces. I
deſign'd nothing elſe but to conceal what I ſaw,
without opening my mind to any but to God
alone; and hardly could I believe it my ſelf: Nay,
I wiſh'd I had been able to hide it from my ſelf:
I as it were felt my ſelf trembling, and afraid at
every ſtep leſt I ſhould fall as well as a perſon of
ſo much light; yet I did not loſe courage, but
comforted my ſelf from the experience of ſo many
great Spirits whom God hath humbled for a little
while, to make them afterwards walk more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly;
and I applied my ſelf ſo much the more
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48044:15"/>
to undeceive the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon,</hi> becauſe they
whom we had inſtructed were under his Charge.</p>
            <p>21. A little after this Conference, I wrote a long
Letter to Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> wherein I explained my
ſelf upon the difficulties juſt now mentioned; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
ſome of them for a larger examination: I
markt all my own Sentiments, as I have juſt now
repreſented them; not forgetting thoſe prodigious
communications, nor the Authority of binding
and unbinding; her Viſions upon the <hi>Revelations,</hi>
and the other things I have related. My Letter is
of the 4th of <hi>March</hi> 1694. her Anſwer that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
upon it is very [ſubmiſſive] and juſtifies all
the matters of fact I have advanc'd as to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of the Books. She accepted my Advice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
&amp; neither to be ſeen or to write to any body
otherwiſe than about her buſineſs: I did much
eſteem the docible Temper that appeared in her
Letter; and I applied all my attention to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſing
the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon,</hi> as to a perſon
whoſe Conduct was ſo ſtrange.</p>

               <p>1. VVHilſt I was taken up with theſe
thoughts, and labouring betwixt
hope and fear, Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> turned the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to quite another thing than what it was at

               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48044:16"/>
She took it in her head to have the accuſations
brought againſt her Morals, and the diſorders that
were imputed to her, examined. Upon this ſhe
wrote to that future Protectreſs, whom ſhe thought
to have ſeen in her Prophecy, beſeeching her to beg
of the King that ſome Commiſſioners ſhould be
appointed, with power to inform themſelves, &amp; to
pronounce Judgment upon her Life. The Copy ſhe
ſent me of her Letter, &amp; that which ſhe joyned to
it, ſhew by their Dates, that this happened in <hi>June</hi>
1694. This was a deſign to fulfil her Predictions,
and for that end Mad. <hi>Guyon</hi> gave a ſpecious turn
to the thing, dexterouſly in ſinuating that ſhe muſt
be cleared of the Crimes ſhe was accuſed of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they would enter upon the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of her Doctrine with too much prejudice. But it
is not ſo eaſie a matter to ſurprize an enlightned
Piety. It was ſoon perceiv'd by the Mediatreſs
ſhe had choſen, that this Propoſal of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiners,
beſides other inconveniences, ſhot wide of
the Mark, which was to begin by examining the
Doctrines contained in her Wrirings they had in
hand, and in the Books where with the Church
was overflowed, and ſo the Propoſal dropt off it
ſelf: Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> yielded, and then demanded
by her Friends the thing in the World that was
moſt agreeable to me; <hi>viz.</hi> that to put an end to
an examination of a thing of that importance,
wherein the matter of Queſtion muſt be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
canvaſs'd, and a ſort of prayer ſo pernicious,
aboliſhed, if poſſible; I ſhould be aſſociated with
Mr. <hi>de Chaalons,</hi> now Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48044:16"/>
Mr. <hi>Tronſon</hi> ſuperior General of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of St. <hi>Sulpice.</hi> The Letter by which Madam
<hi>Guyon</hi> acquaints me with this ſtep, makes out to
the full all the reaſons that induced her to ſubmit
to thoſe two Gentlemen and to my ſelf. The laſt
of 'em was unknown to me, except by his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
But the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi> and his Friends
had a particular confidence in him. As for Mr. <hi>de
Chaalons,</hi> it is known with what holy friendſhip
he and I have always been united: He was alſo
an intimate Friend to the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon.</hi> With
ſuch Collegues I hoped to compaſs all things. The
King was acquainted with the thing ſo far as it
related to Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> only, and approved of
it. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has explained what
was written to him upon that account, and what
he anſwered. The Books I had ſeen were delivered
to thoſe perſons: The Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi> begun
then very privately to write upon that matter.
The Writings he ſent us augmented every day;
and without naming in them Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> or
her Books; every thing he wrote tended to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
or to excuſe them: The thing really in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was thoſe Books, and they made the ſole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Meetings. The ſilent prayer of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Guyon</hi> was, that M. <hi>de Fenelon</hi> was for, and
perhaps 'twas his own in a particular manner.
That Lady did not forget her ſelf, and during
ſeven or eight month that we applied our ſelves
to ſo ſerious a diſcuſſion; ſhe ſent us fifteen or ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
big Bundles, (which I have ſtill) to make a
parallel betwixt her Books, the holy Fathers, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48044:17"/>
and the Spiritual Authors. All this was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with proffers of entire ſubmiſſion. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>Fenelon</hi> took the trouble with ſome of his
Friends to come to <hi>Iby,</hi> a houſe belonging to the
Seminary of Sr. <hi>Sulpice,</hi> where we were obliged
to hold our Conference, becauſe of the infirmities
of Mr. <hi>Tronſon.</hi> They all deſired that we would
enter upon that examination throughly, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
they would refer all to our Judgment. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Guyon</hi> teſtified the ſame ſubmiſſion by Letters
full of reſpect, and afterwards our only care was
to terminate that Affair very privately, ſo as to
prevent all ſuſpicion of any diſſention in the
Church.</p>
               <p>2. We began to read, with more Prayers than
Study, and with Groans, God knows, for all
the Writing they ſent us, eſpecially thoſe of
the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon:</hi> To compare all the
paſſages, and often to read over again whole
Books how tedious and laborious ſoever the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof might be. The long extracts I have
by me ſhew what attention we gave to an Affair,
wherein really the Church was ſo nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
ſeeing the thing in queſtion was no leſs than
to hinder the revival of Quietiſm, which we ſaw
again appearing in the Kingdom, by the Writings
of Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> which were ſpread over all.</p>
               <p>3. We look upon it as the greateſt misfortune
of all, that ſhe had the Abbot <hi>de Fenelon</hi> for her
Defender: His Wit, his Eloquence, His Vertue,
the place he filled, and thoſe he was deſigned for.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48044:17"/>
Engaged us to labour with utmoſt diligence to
reclaim him. We could not deſpair of ſucceſs;
for although he wrote to us things that we muſt
own made us afraid, the memory where of is as
freſh to thoſe perſons as <hi>to me;</hi> he mixed them with
ſo many teſtimonies of ſubmiſſion, that we could
not perſwade our ſelves that God would deliver
him up to a Spirit of Error. The Letters he
wrote to me during the examination of this Book,
and before we had come to a Final Reſolution,
breathed out nothing but obedience; and tho
he ſurrendred himſelf entirely to thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:
I muſt own here, that beſide my being the
Preſident of the Conference, he ſemmed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
himſelf to me with ſo particular a freedom,
becauſe we had been long uſed to treat together
of the Theological matters in diſpute: One of
thoſe Letters was conceived in the following
terms.</p>
               <p>4. I receive my Lord with—great
acknowledgement the kindneſs you ſhew me. I can't
but ſee that you are willing out of Charity to
to ſettle my Heart in Peace: But I confeſs it ſeems
to me, that you are ſomewhat afraid to give me a
true and perfect ſecurity in my State. When ever
you pleaſe I ſhall acquaint you as to my Confeſſor with
whatever may be comprized in a General Confeſſion
of my whole Life, and of all that regards my
inward State. When I beſought you to tell me
the truth, and not to ſpare me, it was neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Complement, nor a trick to diſcover your ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
If I had a mind to uſe Art it ſhould be in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48044:18"/>
other things, and we ſhould not have come to this
paſs. I never deſired any thing, but what I will ever
wiſh, that is, if it be Gods will that I may know
the Truth. I am a Prieſt, I owe all to the Church,
and nothing to my ſelf, nor to my perſonal Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I declare to you ſtill my Lord, That I wont
abide in Error one moment through my own fault;
If I don't abandon it without delay I declare it is
you who are the cauſe of it, ſeeing you determine
nothing to me. I do not value my place, but I am
ready to leave it if I am rendred unworthy of it by
my my Errors. I ſummon you in the Name of
God, and for the Love you have to the truth, to
tell it me in the utmoſt ſeverity. I ſhall go and
hide my ſelf and do Pennance the remaining part
of my Days; after having abjured and recanted
the Erronious Doctrine that has ſeduced me; But
if my Doctrine be innocent, do not keep me in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
out of ſome Humane Reſpect. To you it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to inſtruct with Authority thoſe that are
ſcandalized, becauſe they know not the Operations
of God in the Soul: You know with what confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
I have delivered my ſelf to you, and applied
my ſelf without intermiſſion, that you ſhould not be
Ignorant of my ſtrongeſt perſwaſions. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
nothing for me to do but to obey. For it is
not the Man, or the moſt Grand Doctor that I
eſteem in you; it is God. And though you ſhould
miſtake your ſelf, my ſimple and upright obedience
ſhall—not deceive me; and I account it as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to miſtake, when I do it with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs
and Humility under the hand of thoſe who have
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48044:18"/>
Authority in the Church. <hi>Once more, my Lord,</hi>
if you doubt never ſo little of my decible Temper
withou reſerve, be pleaſed to put it to the proof with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpairing me. Although your mind is more
enlightned than that of any other Man. I pray to
God, that he would be pleaſed to take away all your
own Wiſdom and to leave you none but that which
is his.</p>
               <p>5. Thus, you have the whole Letter word
by word. And may ſee by his Offers to leave
all, and to make a Solemn Recantation of what
conſequence the matter was, and how far he was
engaged therein: Though he had not as yet writ
any Defence of the new way of Prayer. I accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with joy the Prayer he made for me, that I
might loſe all my own Wiſdom, which indeed
I did not relie on; and I endeavoured to liſten to
nothing but Tradition.</p>
               <p>Thus ſeeing the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi> ſo well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to ſubmit, I look upon it as an injuſtice to
entertain any doubt of his compliance. It never
entred into my mind that the Errors wherein I
ſaw him involv'd, tho' in themſelves very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
and pernicious, could ever do him any injury,
or debar him from the dignities of the Church.
They were not afraid in the fourth Age to make
the famous <hi>Syneſius</hi> a Biſhop, tho' he confeſſed
many Errors; they knew him ſo well diſpoſed
and ſo full of compliance, that they did not ſo
much as think that thoſe Errors, tho' Capital ones,
ought to be an obſtacle to his Promotion. I do
not ſpeak thus to juſtifie my ſelf: I only ſet down
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48044:19"/>
the matter of fact, the judgment whereof I refer
to thoſe who conſider it: If they will defer their
Judgment until they have ſeen the effect of the
whole, they will do me a great favour. Every
thing here depends upon what follows; ſo that
'tis not poſſible for me to conceal any thing from
the Reader, without involving all in darkneſs.
Moreover, the compliance of <hi>Syneſius</hi> was no
greater than that which the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi>
ſhewed. Another of his Letters contain theſe
words.</p>
               <p>6. <q>I cannot forbear to ask you with a full
ſubmiſſion, whether you have at preſent any
thing to require of me. I conjure you in the
Name of God, not to have any regard for me
in any thing; and without expecting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
you promiſe me, if you now believe that
I owe any thing to the Truth, and to the
Church wherein I am a Prieſt, one word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Arguments ſhall ſuffice. I hold only one
thing which is ſimple obedience, ſo that my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
is in yours. If I do amiſs, it is you who
make me to err for want of adviſing me. It is
your part to anſwer for me if I continue one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Error. I am ready to be ſilent, to
recant, to accuſe my ſelf, and even to retire, if I
have fail'd as to what I owe to the Church. In
a word, regulate me in whatever you pleaſe;
and if you do not believe me, take me at my
word to entangle me. After ſuch declaration I
think I ought not to conclude with Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48044:19"/>
7. In another Letter, <hi>he ſaid:</hi> 
                  <q>I have
already beſought you not to delay one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
out of any reſpect to me, the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
that I beg of you. If you are reſolved
to condemn any part of the Doctrine I
have expoſed to you, out of obedience, I
beſeech you to do it with as much ſpeed as
you ſhall be deſir'd. I had as good, nay,
rather recant to Day than to Morrow.</q>
The reſt was to the ſame purpoſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with theſe words: <q>Deal with me
as with a School-boy, without minding ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my place, or your ancient Kindneſſes
towards me. I ſhall be all my life full of
Acknowledgement and Compliance, if you
deliver me, as ſoon as poſſible, out of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
God forbid I ſhould propoſe this,
to engage you into a precipitant Deciſion,
to the diſadvantage of Truth; I only wiſh
you would not delay at all on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</q>
               </p>
               <p>8. Thoſe Letters were written to me by
the Abbot of <hi>Fenclon,</hi> betwixt the 12th of
<hi>December,</hi> 1694. and the 26th of <hi>January</hi>
1695. during which time we were draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up the Articles. Having read all the
Writings, as well thoſe of Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi>
as of Monſieur <hi>Fenelon,</hi> wherein we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed
the Condemnation of all the Errors
we found in t'one and t'other; weighing all
the Words, and endeavouring not only to
reſolve all the Difficulties that appeared,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48044:20"/>
but alſo to prevent by Principles, thoſe
that might ariſe afterwards. We were at
firſt, after the reading of the Writings, for
Converſation by word of Mouth; but we
feared leſt by bringing things to a Diſpute,
we ſhould ſooner exaſperate, than be able
to inſtruct a Perſon whom God was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
lead into a better Way, which was that
of an Abſolute Submiſſion. He wrote thus
himſelf to us, in a Letter I have yet by
me: <q>Spare your ſelves the trouble of
entring upon that Diſcuſſion: Take the
thing in groſs, and begin by ſuppoſing
that I have miſtaken my ſelf in my Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
I forſake them all; I don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
either to underſtand Greek, or to
make fine Arguments upon Paſſages: I
inſiſt only upon thoſe that you think may
deſerve ſome regard: Pronounce my Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to thoſe, and give a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
upon the eſſential Points; after
which, the remaining part will be of
little moment.</q> By this it may be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that we had declared our ſelves enough
upon his Writings. He had explained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
therein ſo thoroughly, that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
comprehended his Sentiments. We
met every day; we agreed ſo well on the
Point, that there was no need of a long
Diſcourſe. Notwithſtanding, we carefully
collected what the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi> had
told us at the beginning, and what he ſpoke
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48044:20"/>
upon occaſion. We dealt plainly, as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
among Friends, without taking any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
one of another; and ſo much
the more, becauſe we our ſelves, whom
they took for Arbitrators, had no other
Authority over the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon</hi>
than what he himſelf gave us. It ſeem'd
that God made his Heart ſenſible of the
Way we were to follow, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
him gently, without offedning ſo fine
and acute a Spirit. The Examinauion laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
long: It is true, the Neceſſities of our
Dioceſſes cauſed ſome interruption to our
Conferences. As to the Abbot of <hi>Fenelon,</hi>
we had rather not to have given him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
trouble at all about his Opinions, than
to ſeem to have condemned him raſhly,
and before we had heard all his defences.
It was ſomething of a Blow given to them,
to hold them as ſupicious, and to ſubject
them to Examination. The Abbot of <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elon</hi>
had reaſon indeed to tell us, That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
all, we knew not his Opinions any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way but by himſelf. As he could have
conceal'd them from us, ſo the freedom
wherewith he diſcover'd them, was to us
a mark of his docible temper; and we
concealed them ſo much the more carefully,
the more freely he diſcover'd them to us.</p>
               <p>9. So that during all the time we three
treated of that Affair with him, that is, for
Eight or Ten Months, the Secret was no leſs
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48044:21"/>
impenetrable than it had been during the
time that I alone was upon it. It muſt be
confeſs'd here, that the leaſt whiſper to
the King, of the Abbot <hi>de Fenelon</hi>'s favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
M. <hi>Guyon</hi> and her Doctrine, would
have produced ſtrange effects in the Mind
of a Prince ſo Religious, ſo nice as to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tets
of Faith, and ſo circumſpect in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up the great Places of the Church;
and the leaſt that this Abbot muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from it, had been an unavoidable
exculſion from all Dignities. But we did
not ſo much as ſuſpect (at leaſt for my part
I own it) that any thing was to be feared
from a Man, whoſe return was thought ſo
ſure, his Mind ſo docible, and his Intentions
ſo upright; and whether it were by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or prepoſſeſſion; or if you will, through
Error: (For I rather here make a publick
Confeſſion, than ſeek to defend my ſelf)
I thought the Inſtruction of the Princes of
<hi>France</hi> in too good a hand, not to do, on
this occaſion, whatever might conduce to
the Keeping of ſo important a Truſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
               <p>10. I carried that Confidence to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
pitch, as will be known by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Diſcourſe. It was the Will of God,
perhaps to humble me: And perhaps alſo,
I ſin'd by putting too much confidence in
the Knowledge I believ'd a Man endowed
with; or elſe, that in reality, I thought
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48044:21"/>
I might put confidence in the ſtrength of
Truth, and power of Grace; I ſpoke with
too much aſſurance of a thing that ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
my Power: However we acted upon
that ground, and as we were labouring to
reclaim a Friend, ſo we applyed our ſelves
with a ſcrupulous regard to manage his
precious Reputation.</p>
               <p>11. It was this that inſpired us with
the Deſign you ſhall hear of preſently.
We thought our ſelves obliged, in order
to ſet bounds to his Thoughts, to reſtrict
him by ſome thing under his hand; but,
at the ſame time, we propoſed to our
ſelves, in order to avoid making him look
like one that retracted, to have him ſign
with us as an Aſſociate in our Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
We had no other deſign in any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
but how to ſave ſuch a Friend;
and we were unanimouſly agreed for his
Advantage.</p>
               <p>12. A little while after, he was named
to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Cambray.</hi> We
applauded the Choice, as did every body
elſe, and he continu'd nevertheleſs in that
way of ſubmiſſion God put him in: The
higher he was to be raiſed upon the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick,
the more I thought he ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to that great ſplendor, and to the
grace of the Epiſcopal State, through the
humble compliance we ſaw in him. So
we continued the forming of our Sentence;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48044:22"/>
and he of his own accord begg'd if of us
with the ſame humility. The Four and
Thirty Articles that were drawn up at
<hi>Iſſy</hi> in our private Conferences, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiur
<hi>de Chaalons</hi> and I, preſented to the new
Prelate in my Apartment at <hi>Verſailles.</hi> The
Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has expreſſed in his
Anſwer to the Archhiſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
how uneaſie he was in reading it. We
told him without diſputing, with an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
ſincerity, how he ought to diſpoſe
of the Writings he had ſent us in ſo great
numbers; he ſaid not a word; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the reluctancy he had ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he offer'd that very moment, to ſign
the Articles meerly out of obedience. We
thought it more fit to put them into his
hands, that he might peruſe them ſome
time. Tho' they went to the quick, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
indeed overthrew the Foundation of
the new way of Prayer; yet their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
being clear, we thought that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
of <hi>Fenelon</hi> would not contradict them,
when once he underſtood them. He brought
us ſome reſtrictions to every Article, which
eluded all the ſtrength of them; and the
ambiguity thereof did not only render
them uſeleſs, but alſo dangerous; we did
not think fit to admit them. My Lord
of <hi>Cambray</hi> yielded, and the Articles
were Signed at <hi>Iſſy,</hi> at M. <hi>Tronſons,</hi> the 10th
of <hi>March,</hi> 1695.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48044:22"/>
13. When the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> ſays
in his Anſwer to our Declaration, that
he drew up the Articles with us; I am
ſorry he has forgotten thoſe holy Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
God had then put him into. It
has been ſeen by the Letters he wrote,
during the time we were buſie in drawing
thoſe Articles, that he begg'd a Deciſion
without Arguments. If we came to be of
that Opinion. I deſire thoſe that read this,
not to impute it to any haughtineſs or
diſdian. God forbid! on any other occaſion
we would have accounted it an honour to
deliberate with a Man of ſo much Light
and Merit, who was moreover going to be
received into our Epiſcopal Body, but at
that time God ſhewed him another way;
which was, that he muſt obey without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining.
Men muſt be led in the Path
which it pleaſes God to open unto them,
and by the Diſpoſition his grace puts into
their Hearts. Therefore the firſt time M.
<hi>de Cambray</hi> ſpoke of our Thirty Four Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
(which was in the Advertiſement of
the Book of the <hi>Maxims of the Saints</hi>)
he mentions only two Prelates, Monſieur
<hi>de Chaalous</hi> and I, that had drawn them
up, without thinking then that he ſhould
name himſelf as one of the Authors. He
remember'd the diſpoſition of Mind we
were all in when we ſign'd. Thus you
have an Account of the little Myſtery we
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48044:23"/>
were put upon meerly in regard to his
Advantage. I hear his Friends give out,
that this was as a ſecret of Confeſſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, which he would not diſcover,
and that we have revealed it. Never any
ſuch thing came into our thoughts, nor
did we imagin any other Secret but that
only of having a regard to his Honour,
and of his retractation under a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Title. If he had not declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
too much in his Book, and then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
our ſilence, that Secret ſhould ſtill
have lain in Darkneſs.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen how in one of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he offer'd to make a general Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to me; he well knows that I never
accepted that offer. Whatever could have
relation to Secrets of that nature, upon
his inward diſpoſition, is forgotten, and
will never be call'd in queſtion. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Cambray</hi> inſinuates in ſome of his
Writings, that I made nice Exceptions to
ſome of his Reſtrictions, and that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Paris</hi> took me up ſharply for
it. We have then both of us forgotten
it, ſince we have no Idea of it left in
our Minds: We were all along ſo una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous,
that we never had any occaſion
to perſwade one another, and being
wholly guided by the ſame Spirit of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
we were all the time of one
and the ſame mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:48044:23"/>
14. The Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> continued
ſo ſtedfaſt in the ſpirit of ſubmiſſion God
had put him into, that, having deſir'd me
to Conſecrate him, two days before that
divine Formality, kneeling and kiſſing the
Hand that was to Conſecrate him, he took
it to witneſs that he would never enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any other Doctrine but mine. I was
cordial, and I dare ſay it, more at his
Devotion than he was at mine. But I
received that ſubmiſſion as I had done
all others of the ſame nature, which are
ſtill to be ſeen in his Letters. My Age,
my being older in Orders than he, the
ſimplicity of my Sentiments conformable
to thoſe of the Church, and the Perſon
I was to act, gave me that confidence.
M. <hi>de Chaalons</hi> was deſired to be one of the
Aſſiſtants in the Ceremony, and we thought
we ſhould give the Church a Prelate, of the
ſame mind with thoſe that Conſecrated him.</p>
               <p>15. I don't believe that M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
will forget this praiſe-worthy Circumſtance
of his ſubmiſſion. After the ſigning of
the Articles, and about the time of his
Conſecration, he deſir'd me to keep, at
leaſt ſome of his Writings, to ſerve as an
Evidence againſt him, if ever he ſhould
ſtray from our Sentiments. I was far from
that ſpirit of miſtruſt. <hi>No Sir,</hi> ſaid
I, <hi>I will never uſe any other precaution
with you than to take your word.</hi> I gave
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48044:24"/>
back all the Papers as they were given
me, not keeping ſo much as one, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other thing except my extracts for a
memorandum of the Errors I was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute,
without naming the Author. As for
the Letters that belonged to me, I kept
ſome of them as has been ſeen, rather
for my comfort, than that I believed I
ſhould ever have need of them, except
perhaps for M. <hi>Cambray,</hi> to put him
in mind of his holy Submiſſions, in caſe
he ſhould be tempted to forget them;
that they are now publiſhed, is really ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to pure Neceſſity, which compelled
me to ſpeak more than I would. The
proteſtation he made to me a little before
his Conſecration, ſhould alſo have been
kept in ſilence as well as the reſt, if it
had not come to the King's Ears, that
advantage was made of it, and that they
made as if I confirmed the Doctrine of
the Book of the <hi>Maxims of the Saints,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I had Conſecrated the Author.</p>
               <p>16. A little before the Publiſhing of
that Book an Affair happen'd that gave
me a great deal of Trouble. In my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoral
Inſtructions of the 16th of <hi>April,</hi>
1695, I had promiſed a larger one to
explain our Articl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, and I deſired the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> to join his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
to that of M. <hi>de Chaalons,</hi> then
promoted to the See of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48044:24"/>
of M. <hi>de Chartres,</hi> for the Book I deſign'd
for that Explication. Seeing we are to
name here the Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> I muſt
take notice he was the firſt of the Biſhops
of that neighbourhood, who diſcover'd the
evil Effects of the Books and Conduct of
Madam <hi>Guyon.</hi> The Conſequences of that
Affair made us concur together in many
things; as for the Archbiſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi>
I was ſo much the more obliged to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
my ſelf by his Authority, becauſe
for the good of our Province, he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the Chief of it. I thought alſo, it
was for the publick Edification, that our
unanimity with M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> ſhould be
known more and more every where I
put my Book, in Manuſcript, into the Hands
of that Biſhop: I expected his Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and to correct my ſelf according to
his Advice: I found in my ſelf, I thought,
the ſame compliance for him that he had
ſhewed to me before his Conſecration:
But about three Weeks after, his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
was refuſed me, and that too for
ſuch a Reaſon as was far from my being able
to foreſee. A Friend to us both gave me,
in the Gallery of <hi>Verſailles,</hi> a Letter of
Credentials from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
who was in his Dioceſe. Upon which
I was given to underſtand, that that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
could not enter into the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48044:25"/>
of my Book, becauſe I therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> whom he could not
condemn.</p>
               <p>17. <hi>It was in vain for me to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
unto that Friend the Incovenience that
M.</hi> de Cambray <hi>would fall into.</hi> What! it
will appear, <hi>ſaid I,</hi> that to ſuſtain M. Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he diſunites himſelf from his Brethren?
then all the World will ſee that he is her
Protector; the ſuſpicion wherewith he was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured
abroad, will now be found a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty?
What becomes of thoſe fine Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
we ſo often had of M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi>
and which he and his Friends ſpread abroad;
as that he was ſo far from being concerned
in the Books of that Woman, that he was
ready to condemn them if it were neceſſary?
Now that ſhe had condemned them her ſelf;
that ſhe had, before me, ſubſcribed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of them, together with the Evil
Doctrine contained in them; would he counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
them more than her felf? In what
amazement will the World be, to find at the
head of my Book, the Approbation of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> and of the Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi>
without his? Was not that the way to make
the ſigns of his Diviſion from his Brethren
manifeſt? his Conſecrators, his moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Friends? What Scandal, what Reproach
to his Name? Of what Books would he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48044:25"/>
the Martyr? why would he bereave
the People of the comfort of ſeeing in the
Approbation of that Prelate, the ſolemn Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of our unanimity? <hi>All theſe Reaſons
had no effect; my Manuſcript was reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to me again, having ſtaid three whole
Weeks in the hands of M.</hi> de Cambray.
<hi>The Friend that had taken upon him to
give it me again, ſaid he had kept it for
moſt part of the time himſelf, and that
M.</hi> de Cambray <hi>had it but few days, and
gave it back without having read much
of it. I wrote a few Lines to that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
intimating to him my juſt Fears. I
received an Anſwer that ſignifi'd nothing,
and then he had begun to prepare what
you ſhall ſee afterwards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>18. You would perhaps know beforehand
what was become of M. <hi>Guyon.</hi> She had
deſired to be received into my Dioceſe,
in order to be there inſtructed. She was
ſix Months in the Holy Convent of the
Damſels of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> upon condition ſhe
ſhould have no communication with any
perſon whoſoever, either within or without,
by Letter or otherwiſe, ſave only with the
Confeſſor I appointed her according to her
Deſire, and with two Nuns I had choſen,
one of whom was the venerable Mother
<hi>le Picard,</hi> a moſt prudent Woman, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
of that Monaſtery. Seeing all her
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48044:26"/>
Letters and Diſcourſes breathed out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but ſubmiſſion, and a blind ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
we could not refuſe her the uſe of
the Holy Sacraments. I inſtructed her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently;
ſhe ſubcribed the Articles where
ſhe plainly ſaw they utterly condemn'd her
Doctrine: I rejected her Explications, and
her ſubmiſſion was pure and ſimple. A
little after ſhe ſubſcribed the juſt Cenſure
that M. <hi>de Chaalons</hi> and I publiſhed againſt
her Books, and the Evil Doctrine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in them, condemning them with
Heart and Mouth, as if each Propoſition
had been expreſly utter'd. Some of the
chief of 'em were ſpecified that compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
all the reſt, and ſhe renounced them
in plain terms. The Books ſhe condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
were the <hi>Short Method,</hi> and the <hi>Song
of Songs,</hi> which were the only Printed
Books ſhe owned: I would not meddle
with the Manuſcripts that were not known
abroad: She offer'd at every word to burn
them all; but I thought that precaution
needleſs, becauſe of the Copies that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd.
So I ſatisfi'd my ſelf with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
her to communicate them, or to
write of 'em to others; or to teach,
dogmatiſe, or direct, condemning her to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
and retirement as ſhe deſired. I
received the Declaration ſhe made againſt
the Abominations ſhe was accuſed of, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48044:26"/>
her to be innocent, as long as ſhe
was not Convicted by a lawful Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereupon never enter'd. She asked
me leave to go to the Waters of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon;</hi>
after her ſubmiſſions ſhe was free:
She deſired to be received after her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
from the Waters into the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery,
where ſhe kept her Apartment. I
granted it one deſign to inſtruct, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
to convert her, without leaving
her, if poſſible, not ſo much as the leaſt
tincture of the Viſions and Deluſions paſt.
I gave her that atteſtation her Friends ſo
much bragg'd of abroad; but ſhe never
durſt ſhew it, becauſe I expreſly ſpecified
therein, that Account of the Declarations
and Submiſſions of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> which we
had by us, ſubſcribed by her own Hand:
and of the Prohibitions accepted by her
with ſubmiſſion, neither to Write, Teach,
nor Dogmatiſe in the Church, nor to ſpread
abroad her Printed Books, or Manuſcripts,
nor to lead People into the way of her
ſilent Prayer, or otherwiſe. I was ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with her Conduct, and had continu'd
her in the participation of the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
wherein I found her. This At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation
was dated the Firſt of <hi>July,</hi> 1695.
I ſet out the next day for <hi>Paris,</hi> where
we were to adviſe what courſe we ſhould
take concerning her for the future: I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48044:27"/>
ſhall not recount how ſhe went off before
the day I had fixed for her departure, nor
how ſhe ſince abſconded her ſelf; how
ſhe was taken again, and convicted of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
things contrary to what ſhe had ſigned.
What I cannot conceal is, that ſhe ſet up
always for a Propheteſs; I have in her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
ſign'd with her own hand, that God
had put into her diſpoſal the life of ſuch
as oppoſe themſelves to her Viſions: She
has made Prelates and Archbiſhops, far
different from thoſe the Holy Ghoſt hath
choſen: She has alſo made ſuch Predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as would ſtrike horror into thoſe that
hear them. You have already ſeen what
ſhe had foretold as to the Protection of
her <hi>Silent Prayer</hi> by the King himſelf: She
has ſince given out, that after what ſhe calls
Perſecution, her Prayers would ſpring up
again under a Child: The Prophecy has
been taken notice of to the Auguſt Infant,
without making any Impreſſion upon his
Mind. God forbid I ſhould accuſe M. <hi>de
Cambray,</hi> nor the wiſe Heads that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
that lovely Prince, of the Diſcourſes
that have been made to him concerning
it; but there are amongſt all Parties, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of outragious tempers, who ſpeak with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
meaſure or aim, and that ſort of People
ſpread Reports abroad, that the times will
change, and thus they frighten the ſimple.
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48044:27"/>
You ſee then plainly, the Reaſons I have
to write thoſe Circumſtances: You ſee
in whoſe preſence it is I write them,
and why, at laſt, I make a Woma nknown,
who is at preſent a cauſe of Diviſions in
the Church.</p>
               <p>14. M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> during the time of
our examination, ſpoke of her in different
manners; he has often frighten'd us, when
he ſaid to two or three of us together,
that he had learnt more from her than
from all the Doctors together; and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
times he comforted us, ſaying, he
was ſo far from approving her Books, that
he was rather ready to condemn them, if
it were thought neceſſary in the leaſt; I
doubted no more of his Converſion upon
this point than upon the reſt; and ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing elſe but to convince throughly
of his Errors a Man of parts, by a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
ſo much the more ſincere as it was
meek, and without compulſion: I wiſhed
he might come, of his own accord, to
himſelf again, as it were from a ſhort fit
of giddineſs; and we thought fit to defer
the propoſing to him the expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of the Books of that Woman,
'till ſuch time as he could do it without
reluctancy. Thus you have an Account of
thoſe unmerciful Men, and of thoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that envied the glory of M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray;</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48044:28"/>
thoſe that had a mind to ruin him;
that have carried their ſeverity ſo far, as
<hi>it's impoſſible the relation of it can find Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
amongſt Men.</hi> Let the time at leaſt
be inſtanc'd when that madneſs ſeiz'd us.
They might well have found fault that we
ſpared him too much, ſhew'd him too much
meekneſs, and were guilty of too much
compliance: Let it be ſo, and I will
own it; and, to ſpeak only of my ſelf,
that I carried my Confidence, the love
of Peace, and that benign Charity which
ſuſpects no evil, too far; hitherto it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
at leaſt an uncontroverted Truth,
That the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> diſuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himſelf from his Brethren, to maintain
Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> againſt them.</p>

               <p>2. When M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> propoſed to me,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48044:28"/>
that I ſhould approve of his Book, I te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
to him with all imaginable tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
that I ſhould be very glad to give
that publick mark of my conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in Opinion with a Prelate, whom I
have lookt upon from my Youth up, as my
Maſter in the Science of Religion. I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to go to <hi>Germigny,</hi> to draw up
with him my Approbation. I ſaid, at the
ſame time, to my Lords of <hi>Paris</hi> and
<hi>Chartres,</hi> and to Monſieur <hi>Tronſon,</hi> that
I ſaw no ſhadow of difficulty between M.
<hi>de Meaux</hi> and me, as to the Point of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
But that if he would attack Madam
<hi>Guyon</hi> perſonally, I could not approve of
it. This is what I have declar'd ſix Months
ago. I never knew any thing of it more
than what follows.</p>
               <p>3. M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> gave me lately a Book
to be examin'd; at the opening of the
Packet, I found that they were full of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Confutation: I preſently acquainted
My Lords of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Chartres,</hi> and M.
<hi>Tronſon,</hi> with the hardſhip that M. <hi>de Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aux</hi>
put upon me.</p>
               <p>4. Let us explain whether he takes for
perſonal Coufutation, the Condemnation of
the Perſon: I did not ſo much as once
think of condemning the Perſon of Madam
<hi>Guyon,</hi> who had ſubmitted her ſelf. If
he call the Confutation of her Book a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48044:29"/>
perſonal Confutation, it was not then her
Perſon, but her Book he has a mind to
defend. He goes on,</p>
               <p>5. <q>They did not fail to tell me, that
I might condemn the Books of Madam
<hi>Guyon,</hi> without defaming her Perſon, or
doing my ſelf an injury: But I conjure
them that ſpeak ſo, to weigh, as before
God, the Reaſon I am about to preſent
to them; the Errors imputed to Madam
<hi>Guyon</hi> are not to be excuſed by the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
of her Sex; there is no ruſtick
Woman, tho' never ſo clowniſh, but
would preſently abhor what they will
have her to have taught: The thing in
queſtion is not a remote and ſubtil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
which might, contrary to her
intention, be drawn from her ſpeculative
Principles, and from ſome of her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions;
but the queſtion is, whether
it be a diabolical Deſign, as they ſay,
which is the Soul of all her Books; that
it is a monſtrous Syſtem which has a
connexion in all its Parts, and which
upholds it ſelf with great Art from one
end to the other. Theſe are not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
Conſequences that may have not
been foreſeen by the Author; but rather
the formal and ſole aim of all her Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme.
It is clear, ſay they, and it would
be want of ſincerity in any body to deny
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48044:29"/>
it; that Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> hath writ only
with a deſign to ruin, as an imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
all the explicite Faith of the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
of the Divine Perſons; of the
Myſteries of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity:
She would diſpenſe with the
ſenſible Worſhip of Chriſtians, and with
all diſtinct invocation of our only Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator.
She pretends to deſtroy in the
Faithful all the interior Life, and all
real Prayer, by ſuppreſſing all the diſtinct
Acts which Chriſt and his Apoſtles have
commanded, by bringing Souls for ever
to an idle quietneſs, which ſhuts out e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Thought of the Underſtanding, and
every motion of the Will. She main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
that when a Perſon has once done an
Act of Faith, and of Love, that Act ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
perpetually during the whole Life,
without ever having need of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;
that they are always in God,
without thinking of him; and that they
muſt take heed not to reiterate that
Act. She leaves to Chriſtians nothing
but a brutiſh and impious indifferency
betwixt Vice and Virtue, betwixt the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
hatred of God and his eternal
love, for which we ought to believe that
every one of us has been created. She
forbids, as unfaithfulneſs, all real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
to the moſt abominable Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48044:30"/>
She would have it believed,
that in a certain ſtate of Perfection,
whereunto ſhe ſpeedily raiſes Souls, there
is no Concupiſcence, that they cannot
ſin, that they are infallible, and enjoy
the ſame Peace that the Bleſſed do in
Heaven: That, laſtly, what one does
without reflection, with facility, and by
the inclination of the Heart, is done
paſſively, and by pure Inſpiration. This
Inſpiration which ſhe aſcribes to her ſelf,
and her Followers, is not the common
Inſpiration of the Juſt, it is a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
one; it includes an Apoſtolick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
above all the written Laws:
She eſtabliſhes a ſecret Tradition upon
ſuch a foundation as overthrows the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Tradition of the Church. I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
there is no ignorance how groſs ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
that can excuſe a Perſon who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances
ſo many monſtrous Maxims: They
aſſure us nevertheleſs, that Madam <hi>Guyon</hi>
has written nothing but to raiſe the
credit of that damnable ſpirituality, and
to procure the practice thereof. This is
the ſole aim of her Works; take away
that, you take away all: She could think
on nothing elſe. Then the manifeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination
of her Writings, renders her
Perſon manifeſtly abominable; I cannot
then ſeparate her Perſon from her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48044:30"/>
6. The manner after which M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
charges things here, he ſeems to have
had a deſign to frighten himſelf, and to
delude the Reader, without examining whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
I impute all thoſe Errors to Madam
<hi>Guyon,</hi> or part only, and the reſt to other
Authors; there is but this one word to
be conſider'd. If we ſuppoſe that this
Lady perſiſts in her Errors what ever they
be; it is true, that her Perſon is abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable:
If on the contrary ſhe humble her
ſelf; if ſhe ſubſcribe the Cenſures which
reject that Doctrine, and her Books where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſhe owns it is contained; if ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns
her Book, there is then nothing
but her Book that remains to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and through her humility, if ſincere,
and that ſhe perſiſts therein, her Perſon
is become innocent, and may even become
holy through her Repentance. There
was reaſon then, to tell M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi>
that he might have approved of my Book,
without blaming M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> whom I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
penitent, and againſt whom I ſaid
not a word; and unleſs it be ſuppoſed
that her Repentance was feign'd, and that
ſhe was return'd again to her Vomit, M.
<hi>de Cambray</hi> was unjuſt to repreſent her
Perſon as abominable by my Book, and
to refuſe his Approbation to it, upon that
vain pretext.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:48044:31"/>
7. It is in this place that he recounts
what has been tranſcribed before word by
word; that he does not comprehend M.
<hi>de Meaux,</hi> who on the one hand admits
M. <hi>Guyon</hi> to receive the Communion, and
on the other condemns her ſo ſeverly.
<q>As for me, <hi>continues he,</hi> if I believed
what M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> believes, touching
Madam <hi>Guyon</hi>'s Book; and by a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
conſequence of her Perſon, I ſhould
have thought, notwithſtanding my friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
to her, I was bound in Conſcience
to make her own, and formally recant
in the face of the whole Church, the
Errors ſhe had ſo manifeſtly taught in
all her Writings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>8. <q>Nay, I am of Opinion, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
power ſhould go farther; what is
more worthy of the Flames than a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter?
who, under a ſpecious ſpirituality,
aims only at the eſtabliſhing Fanaticiſm
and Impurity? who overthrows the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Law, who looks upon all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
as ſo many imperfections; who
turns into Proofs, and all Imperfections Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
who leaves neither ſubordination,
nor Rule in Humane Society; who by
the Principle of the Secret authoriſes
all manner of Hypocriſie and Lying;
laſtly, who leaves no certain Remedy
againſt ſo may Evils? All Religion ſet
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48044:31"/>
aſide, the Civil Government alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to inflict the laſt puniſhment upon
ſo peſtiferous a Perſon. It is then certain,
that if that Woman had a Deſign to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
that damnable Syſtem, ſhe ſhould have
been burnt inſtead of being diſmiſt; as it
is manifeſt that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> has done,
after he had given her the Communion
frequently, and an authentick atteſtation,
without her having recanted her Errors.</q>
If then ſhe has recanted them, if ſhe
has repented, if ſhe has deteſted the impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſeveral other Exceſſes you ſay they
aſcribe to her? If you falſely ſuppoſe that
ſhe is charged with them, there is not ſo
much as a Deſign to accuſe her? if ſhe be
reputed innocent of all what ſhe is not found
to be convicted of by Evidence? if they do
not ſo much as think upon that Examination
which was not then ripe, and which was not
the queſtion in hand, but only the Errors of
which really ſhe was lawfully convicted;
and which ſhe rejected by an authentick Act
with the Books that contained them, would
you deliver her into the hands of Juſtice?
would you burn her? do you conſider well
what is required of the meekneſs of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry?
are we not the Servants of him that
ſays; <hi>I deſire not the death of the ſinner?</hi>
When St. <hi>John</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> would have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48044:32"/>
commanded Fire to come down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
is it not to us, that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks
in the Perſons of thoſe two Apoſtles: <hi>Ye do
not know of what Spirits ye are?</hi> Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be unmerciful towards Errors, and
to condemn the Books that contain them?
but muſt we throw into deſpair, a Woman
that condemns both her Errors and her
Books? ought we not to preſume that ſhe
is ſincere, as long as there appears no
Acts of her to the contrary? and did not
her preſumed ſincerity deſerve ſome indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in regard of her Perſon? One would
really think you to be tranſported with Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if you ſhould carry your Zeal to that
exceſs; and he is to be accounted ſo, who
maintains that a Book muſt not be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without judging the Author of it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Fire, even when the Author
himſelf condemns his Book. <q>As for me,
<hi>continues M.</hi> de Cambray, I could not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of the Book wherein M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
aſcribes to that Woman ſo horrible a
Syſtem in all its parts, without defaming
my ſelf, and doing her an irreparable
wrong. The Reaſon is thus: I have ſeen
her often: I had her in eſteem: I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
her to be eſteemed by illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
whoſe Reputation was dear to the
Church, and who had confidence in me.
I neither could, not ought to have been
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48044:32"/>
ignorant of her Writings; tho I have not
examined them all at the time, at leaſt I
knew ſo much of them as induced me to
ſuſpect her, and to examin her with all
rigor. I have done it more diligently
than her Examinators could do it, for ſhe
was much more free, more in her natural
diſpoſition, more open with me in a time
ſhe had nothing to be afraid of: I made
her often explain her Mind as to the things
now in diſpute. I have compelled her to
explain to me the force of each Term of
that myſtical Language ſhe uſed in her
Writings. I ſaw plainly upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
that ſhe undeſtood them in a moſt
innocent and moſt catholick Senſe. I have
alſo been willing to examin the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
both of her Practice, and the Counſels
ſhe gave to the moſt ignorant and leaſt
ſuſpicious Perſons. I never met with any
part of theſe Infernal Maxims imputed to
her; could I then in conſcience impute
them to her by my approbation, and give
her the laſt ſtroak towards her defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
after having ſeen ſo narrowly and
ſo plainly into her innocence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>10. This is certainly to anſwer ſtoutly for
Madam <hi>Guyon:</hi> Here's fine words, but very
vain; for there is but one word to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
all this; that is, that they ſhould,
without heſitation, have approved in my
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48044:33"/>
Book, the condemnation of thoſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam
<hi>Guyon,</hi> if I took the ſenſe of 'em well;
and if I impoſed upon her, M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
could not avoid entring with me upon that
Examination, unleſs he were, as it appears
now he is, too much reſolved to defend both
that Woman and her Books, at what rate
ſoever againſt his Brethren.</p>
               <p>11. Lèt us then ſpeak the truth: He well
knew in his Conſcience that I imputed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him but what was true, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he continues in this manner: <q>That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
who only know her Writings, take
them in a rigorous ſenſe; let them do ſo,
I do not defend nor excuſe neither her
Perſon nor her Writings; and is not this
much to one that knows what I know? As
for me I ought, in juſtice, to judge of the
Senſe of her Writings by her Sentiments,
which I know to the full, and not of her
Opinions by the rigorous ſenſe they put
upon her Expreſſions, and which never
came into her mind; if I did otherwiſe,
I ſhould perfectly convince the Publick,
that ſhe deſerves to be burnt. Thus you
ſee my Rule is for Juſtice and Truth; let
us now come to decency.</q>
               </p>
               <p>12. All that Rule of Juſtice is grounded
upon this falſe Maxim, that ſhe deſerved the
Fire, notwithſtanding her having given an
abhorrence in Writing of the Errors ſhe was
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48044:33"/>
convinced of, and of ſuch as followed from
the natural ſenſe of her words. Beſides, it
is very certain, that her Books and her Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
had ſcandalized the whole Church:
<hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf had declared her Sentiments,
and ſo many Prelates in <hi>France</hi> and other
Places, had followed her Example, that it
was impoſſible to diſſemble any longer the
miſchievous Effects of thoſe Books, and the
Scandal given thereby over all the World.
Notwithſtanding M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> who had
given them for a Rule to ſuch as had confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in him, will not to this very Day
retract them. And leaſt he ſhould condemn
them, he breaks all meaſures with his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
and yet he is not willing we ſhould
ſee his bigotted conceit of thoſe Books:
What follows will make it appear much
better. At preſent it ſuffices to take notice
of two things that reſult from his Diſcourſe:
The one is, That he ſuffers <hi>Madam</hi> Guyon
<hi>to be eſteemed by illuſtrious Perſons, whoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
is dear to the Church, and who had
confidence in him.</hi> He adds: <hi>I neither could
nor ought to have been ignorant of her Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:</hi>
It is then by her Writings, that
he allows her to be eſteemed of by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
truly illuſtrious, <hi>who had confidence in
him;</hi> in a word, whom he guided. They
eſteemed Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> and her Writings,
with the approbation of M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:48044:34"/>
then the Abbot de <hi>Fenelon:</hi> The method
of Prayer he adviſed them to, was that
which M. <hi>Guyon</hi> taught in her Book which
he allow'd them to eſteem tegether with her
Perſon. <hi>It is juſt,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>to preſerve the
Reputation of thoſe Illuſtrious Perſons, who are
dear unto the Church,</hi> which we never ſo
much as thought once to attack it.
But who can deny that M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
was obliged to diſabuſe thoſe illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Perſons of the eſteem he had given
them (or allow'd 'em to have if you
will) of Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> and her Books? the
thing then in queſtion is not at their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which was protected by the authority
of M. of <hi>Cambray:</hi> Our buſineſs is to know
whether M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> himſelf would not
too much preſerve his own Reputation in
their Minds, and in the Minds of ſo many
others who knew how he recommended M.
<hi>Guyon,</hi> to ſuch as put confidence in his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct:
Whether he would not too much
ſave the Approbation he had given of Books
ſo pernicious, and diſlik'd wherever they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd.
This is what M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuſe himſelf from, after his Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
juſt now mention'd. Seeing by that in
the ſecond place, it now appears, That he
endeavours to this day to maintain thoſe
Books, and that he finds nothing dubious in
them, but that myſtical Language Madam
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48044:34"/>
                  <hi>Guyon</hi> uſes in her Writings. Is this a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Language, when ſhe has ſaid in her
<hi>Short Method,</hi> that the act of giving up one's
ſelf, being once perform'd, ought never to
be reiterated: Is this a myſtical Language,
when ſhe reduces to the inferior ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
that of the particular Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,
and of the Divine Perſons, without
excepting Jeſus Chriſt himſelf: Is that a
myſtical Language, to ſuppreſs all Deſire, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of our Salvation, and of Heavenly Joys,
only out of a deſire to reſt upon the Will of
God, either known or unknown, either for
our own Salvation and that of others, or
for our Damnation. What is afterwards
drawn out of her <hi>Short Method,</hi> and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the <hi>Song</hi> in the Book of the ſorts
of Prayer, tho' it be no leſs pernicious, is,
according to M. <hi>de C.</hi> a myſtical Language.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, but this myſtical Language
is that of the falſe myſticks of our Days: Of
<hi>Falconi, Molino</hi>'s, and <hi>Malavals,</hi> all condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
Authors; but not that of any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Myſtick. You ſee how M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
excuſes the Books of M. <hi>Guyon.</hi> To take
what has been juſt now recited, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
is of the ſame nature in the literal Senſe,
and according to the Conſequence of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
is in the Senſe of that Prelate, rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and ſevere, tho' it be the natural ſenſe
of 'em, and that which he endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe,
in order that thoſe pernicious Books
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48044:35"/>
might remain authoriſed, tho' he knows in
his Conſcience, that he is not able to juſtifie
them; and therefore to ſave them, he has
recourſe to that abſurd method of judging of
the ſenſe of a Book, by the particular Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
he has of the Sentiments of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and not of the Sentiments of an Author
by the words of his Book, to this end are
all the fine Excuſes of M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But laſtly, this rigorous ſenſe, as he
calls it, is that which aſtoniſh'd and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd
all Chriſtendom: And to Anſwer ſo
boldly for Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> that ſuch things
never came into her Thoughts, is another
bold ſtroke of judging of her Words by her
Thoughts, and not of her Thoughts by her
Words; this is always to open the Door to
the groſſeſt of Equivocations, and to furniſh
Excuſes for the moſt pernicious of Books.</p>
               <p>14. It is true indeed, that to this very day
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> makes uſe of this method; he
would have us divine what were his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in his Book of Maxims, tho' he hath
not ſo much as ſaid one word of them; and
we muſt not wonder that, after having juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Madam <hi>Guyon</hi> by ſo falſe a Doctrine, as
that we have juſt now heard, he ſhould alſo
make uſe of it to juſtifie himſelf. But
let us come to what he adds upon decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48044:35"/>
15. <q>I have known her: I could not be
ignorant of her Writings, I ought certainly
to know her Sentiments, I being a Prieſt,
a Tutor to Princes, and having applied my
ſelf from my Youth to a continual Study of
Doctrine, ought to have ſeen what is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt.
I muſt then, if it be ſo, have at
leaſt tolerated that impious Syſtem? which
is the thing that makes me guilty of Error,
and covers me with Eternal Confuſion. All
our Correſpondence has alſo been held up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that abominable Spirituality, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
as they ſay, ſhe has filled her Books,
and which is the Soul of all her Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
And in owning all theſe things by my
Approbation, I render my ſelf infinitely
more unexcuſable than M. <hi>Guyon.</hi> That
which will appear at firſt ſight to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
is, that I have been conſtrain'd to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to the Defamation of my Friend,
whoſe Monſtrous Syſtem I could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of, being manifeſt in all her Works,
according to my own Confeſſion. So that
my Sentence ſhould be pronounced and
ſigned by my ſelf, at the Head of M. <hi>de
Meaux</hi>'s Book; where that Syſtem is ſet
off with all imaginable Horror. I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
it, that ſuch a Daſh of my Pen given
againſt my Conſcienee, out of a baſe Policy,
would for ever render me infamous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of my Miniſtry.</q>
               </p>
               <p>16. <q>You ſee nevertheleſs, what theſe
moſt wiſe and affectionate Perſons towards
me, have deſired and prepared againſt me
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48044:36"/>
by a deep Contrivance. It is then to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
my Reputation, that they would have
me ſign, that my Friend deſerves to be
burnt with all her Writings, for a damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Spirituality, which is the ſole Tye of
our Friendſhip. But further, how muſt I
explain my ſelf thereupon? Muſt it be
freely according to my Thoughts, and in
a Book wherein I ſhall have opportunity
to ſpeak at large? No, I muſt be treated
like a Man that is dumb and confounded;
they will hold my Pen, they will conſtrain
me to explain my ſelf in the Works of
another Man; by a ſimple Approbation I
muſt own, that my Friend is manifeſtly a
Monſter upon the Earth, and the Poiſon of
her Writings, can proceed from no where
but out of her Heart. Thus you ſee, what
my beſt Friends have contriv'd for my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
If the moſt cruel Enemies would
have ſet Snares to catch me, is not this
exactly the thing that they ſhould have
demanded of me?</q>
               </p>
               <p>17. What does he not think, that amidſt
his Excuſes, every one that reads, them an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
him? No, your Friend deſerved not
to be burnt with her Books, ſeeing ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
them. Your Friend was not a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
upon Earth, but an ignorant Woman,
who being dazled with a ſpecious pretext of
Spirituality, deceived by her Directors, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
by a Man of your Figure, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
her Error, when Care was taken to
Inſtruct her. This Confeſſion could not but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48044:36"/>
edifie the Church, and wean from her Books
thoſe that have been ſeduced by them: M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> had nothing elſe to do, but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
ſo juſt a Conduct, had not an unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
fear that he ſhould defame his Friend
and himſelf, ſtuck too much in his Stomach.
What he calls a Defaming his Friend, is
to underſtand her Books in their natural
Meaning, as his Breathren did; and as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Body elſe did that condemn'd them. He
would not have his Friends perceive, that he
had put ſo bad a Book into their Hands;
this is what he calls Defaming himſelf: And
now we ſhall have cauſe of Wonder, to ſee
him retreat ſo many Steps backwards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being willing to own it; he fears too
much, not to defame himſelf, but to own a
Fault. This is not to defame himſelf, but
on the contrary to honour himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
his wounded Reputation. Was it ſo
great a Misfortune, to have been deceived
by a Female Friend? M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> is to this
very day, careful to ſpread abroad at <hi>Rome,</hi>
that he hardly knows M. <hi>Guyon:</hi> What Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
is this? at <hi>Rome</hi> he is aſham'd of this ſhe
Friend, in <hi>France</hi> he dares not ſay that ſhe is
unknown to him, and rather than ſuffer her
Books to be blaſted, he anſwers and gives
Security for their Doctrine, tho' already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
by their Author.</p>
               <p>18. What ſhall it be ſaid then? that M.
<hi>Guyon</hi> has ſubſcribed her Condemnation by
force? is that forcing her, when ſhe willingly
ſubſcribed it in a Monaſtery, where ſhe had
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48044:37"/>
confined her ſelf of her own Accord, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to be there inſtructed? Is that force, to
yield to the Authority of the Biſhops, whom
ſhe choſe for her Teachers? But could we
condemn thoſe Books more expreſly, than
by ſubſcribing to their juſt and ſevere Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
but this, ſay they, is to conſtrain M.
<hi>de Cambray</hi> to own too great a Miſtake:
What Remedy is there for it? It is certain,
by the common Declaration of all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and by the acknowledgment of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi>
that her Spirituality ought to be condemn'd.
It is certain, by the preſent Confeſſion of
M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> that all his Correſpondence
with Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> was about that Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality
ſhe her ſelf had condemned, and that
it made the only Tye of that Friendſhip ſo
much boaſted of: What Anſwer can be given
to ſo formal a Confeſſion? what can we ſay
to them who will Object, That this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
united by ſuch Tye, was either
known or not known? if it was not, M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> had nothing to fear, in approving
the Book of M. <hi>de Meaux;</hi> if it was known,
that Prelate was ſo much the more obliged
to declare himſelf; and there was nothing
he had reaſon to fear, but holding either
his Peace, or making Evaſions upon that
Subject.</p>
               <p>19. <hi>M. de Cambray</hi> ſeems to have foreſeen
that Objection, and therefore he continues
in this manner; for I Omit none of his
Words; <q>They will be ſure to tell me, that
I ought to Love the Church more than
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48044:37"/>
my Friend, and more than my own ſelf:
As if the Church were in Danger, in an
Affair wherein her Doctrine is ſecur'd, and
where the thing relates to a Woman, whom
I am ready to ſuffer ſhould be defamed
for ever; Provided I have no Hand in it,
againſt my Conſcience. Yea, I would burn
my Friend with my own Hand, and my
ſelf too chearfully, rather than the Church
ſhould be in Danger. She is a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
confin'd, oppreſt with Grief and
Reproaches; No body defends her, nor
excuſes her, and one is always afraid.</q>
Good God! is that nothing to the Church,
to Bleſs a Seducing Book, ſpread all over
the Kingdom, and further? eſpecially when
he is ſuſpected to approve it? Is it nothing
to the Church, to obſerve to ſet in a true
light to Confute the Errors of ſuch a Book?
this is what <hi>M. de Cambray</hi> won't hearken
to. Why does he ſeparate himſelf from his
Brethren, and not ſhew before the whole
Church, the Conſent of the Epiſcopacy againſt
a Book really ſo pernicious? A Body is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
afraid, ſays <hi>M. de Cambray:</hi> It is well
ſeen: He would have no Body to meddle
with that poor Captive, whoſe Fate he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores,
and that we ſhould ſuffer a Party that
has already too much over-run the World, to
ſtrengthen it ſelf. To what purpoſe is it for
him to ſay, <hi>Yea, I would burn my Friend wish
my own Hands, I would burn my own ſelf?</hi>
Such as do burn after this manner, do it that
they may burn nothing at all: Theſe are
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48044:38"/>
Tranſported Zealots, who go beyond the
Burt, to paſs over the Eſſential Point. Burn
not <hi>M. Guyon</hi> with your own Hand, you
ſhould be irregular in ſo doing: Burn not a
Woman that ſhews ſhe is coming to her ſelf
again; unleſs once more you be aſſured that

the pernicious Books that ſpread all
over the World, and put an end to a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that diſturbs the Church.</p>
               <p>20. <q>After all, continues <hi>M. de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
which is moſt proper, either that
I ſhould revive in the World the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my paſt Intimacy with her, and
acknowledge my ſelf the moſt inſipid Man
living, for not having ſeen manifeſt Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;
or that I am execrable, for having
tolerated them? or that I ſhould keep to
the laſt a profound Silence, as to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Perſon of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> as one that
excuſes her in his Heart, by reaſon ſhe
did not perhaps know the extent of each
Expreſſion, nor the ſeverity wherewith
they would afterwards examine the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Myſticks, upon the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Abuſes that ſome Hypocrites
have committed upon it? Tell me truly,
which is the wiſeſt part of theſe two?</q>
               </p>
               <p>21. I have nothing to do here, but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in one Word, <hi>that profound ſilence to the
laſt,</hi> which M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> promiſes here; it will
ſoon be ſeen, what Miſchief ſuch a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48044:38"/>
Silence cauſes to the Church. After
this neceſſary Remark as to the Fact, let
us go on with the Writing of that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>22. <q>They don't ceaſe to tell us every
day, that the Myſtick Divines themſelves,
even the moſt approved of 'em, have
much exagerated Matters: Nay, they will
have it, that St. <hi>Clement,</hi> and ſeveral of this
chief Fathers, have ſpoken in terms that
require abundance of Correction. Why
do they expect that a Woman only could
not exagerate? why muſt whatſoever ſhe
has ſaid, tend to the forming of a Syſtem
that makes a Body tremble? If ſhe could
exagerate innocently, if I have throughly
known the Innocency of her Exagerations,
if I know what ſhe would ſay, better than
her Books have explained it, if I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of it by Proof as deciſive, as the
Terms they reprove in her Books are
equivocal, can I defame her againſt my
Conſcience,</q> and defame my ſelf with her?
This Prelate declares himſelf more and more,
the Terms of M. <hi>Guyon</hi> are but equivocal,
the Biſhops, and even the Pope have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
her Book, only becauſe they did
not underſtand them well. We are, you ſee,
brought again in her behalf, to thoſe unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Diſputes of the Queſtion of Fact and
Right; M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> is the Author of it,
and there is none but this Shift left him to
defend M. <hi>Guyon</hi> againſt his Fellow Biſhops,
and againſt <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48044:39"/>
23. See how in this Condition he Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs,
ſaying without interruption, <q>Let
my Conduct be cloſely obſerved. Was
the bottom of the Doctrine the Queſtion?
I preſently told M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> that I would
ſign with my own Blood the thirty four
Articles he had drawn up, ſo that he would
explain certain things therein. The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Paris</hi> made earneſt inſtances to
M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> upon ſuch things as appeared
to him juſt and neceſſary. M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
yielded, and I did not defer one Moment
afterwards to ſign. But now when the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
tends to the defaming by a back-blow my
Miniſtry and Perſon, by defaming M. <hi>Guyon</hi>
and her Writings, they find I make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Reſiſtance. Whence comes that
difference of Conduct? Is it that I was
weak or timorous at the ſigning the thirty
four Propoſitions? They may judge of it
by my preſent Conſtancy. Is it that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
now, out of Conceit, and from a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious
Principle, to approve the Book of
M. <hi>de Meaux:</hi> They may judge of it by
my readineſs to ſign the thirty four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
If I was head-ſtrong, I ſhould
have been more eſpecially ſo as to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of M. <hi>Guyon</hi> than as to her Perſon;
I could not in my Bigottiſm, how ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and dangerous ſoever, care any thing
for her Perſon; but ſo far as I could be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lieve
it neceſſary, for the promoting of he
Doctrine. All this is plain enough by the
Conduct I have Obſerv'd, ſhe has been
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48044:39"/>
condemned, confined, loaden with Infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
I never ſpoke a Word to juſtifie her,
to excuſe her, to make her Condition eaſie.
As to the Matter of the Doctrine, I never
ceaſed to write, and to quote the approved
Authors of the Church. They that have ſeen
our Diſcuſſion, muſt own that M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi>
who was at firſt for thundering againſt all,
has been conſtrained to admit one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
things which he had a hundred times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
as moſt pernicious. It was not then the
Perſon of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> and her Writings I was
concerned for; it was the Doctrine of the
Saints, but too much unknown to moſt of
the Scholaſtick Doctors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>24. <q>As ſoon as the Doctrine was ſecured,
without ſparing the Errors of ſuch as are
led away by Deluſions, were not concern'd
at M. <hi>Guyon</hi>'s. Captivity and Diſgrace. If I
refuſe now, to approve what M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
ſays of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> it is becauſe I won't diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
her utterly againſt my Conſcience, nor
diſhonour my ſelf, by charging her with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties
and Blaſphemies, that reflect una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
upon my ſelf.</q>
               </p>
               <p>25. Thus you ſee all the Reaſons M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> gives for not approving my Book,
from thence reſult Facts of the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
in order to know perfectly the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that Prelate was at firſt in, and the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that hath happened in his Conduct, ſince
he has been Arch-biſhop. One may eaſily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
what the Meaning of thoſe thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Airs is, that he begins to give me; of that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48044:40"/>
profound Ignorance he aſcribes to the Shool,
the Authority whereof he now feigns himſelf
to have a Mind to maintain; of thoſe Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which he ecchoes out ſo loud, altho' there
never was the leaſt Ground for it, between
M. <hi>de Chaalons,</hi> who was conſtrained to make
great Inſtances; and me, who reſiſted him,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> did not yield without force. Thoſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact and others are of the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
let the prudent Reader remember
them: But in order to comprehend them the
better, let us without Interruption go on
with what follows of his Writing.</p>
               <p>26. Since I have ſigned the thirty four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
I have declared upon all Occaſions
that offer'd themſelves naturally, that I had
ſigned them, and that I thought it was never
to be allowed, that any ſhould go beyond thoſe
Limits.</p>
               <p>27. <q>I afterwards ſhewed to the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Paris,</hi> a moſt large and exact Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the whole Syſtem of the inward
Ways, in the Margin of the thirty four Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
That Prelate did not obſerve in
it, the leaſt Error or the leaſt Exceſs. M.
<hi>Tronſon,</hi> to whom I alſo ſhewed that Work,
did not correct any thing therein.</q> Obſerve
by the way, in the Matter of Fact, that there
is no mention made here, of having communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
thoſe Explications to me, of which truly
I never heard any Body ſpeak one Word.</p>
               <p>28. <q>It is about ſix Months ſince, a Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite
of the Suburb of St. <hi>James,</hi> deſired of me
ſome Inſtruction in that Matter; I wrote
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48044:40"/>
preſently a long Letter to him, which I had
examin'd by M. <hi>de Meaux.</hi> He propoſed to
me only to avoid a Word indifferent in it
ſelf, but which was by that Prelate obſerv'd,
had been ſometimes abuſed to ill Ends. I took
it out preſently, and added beſides ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
full of preſervatives againſt thoſe
Errors that he required not. The Suburb
of St. <hi>James,</hi> that gave Birth to the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Critick upon the Myſtick Divines,
had not one Word to ſay againſt that Letter.
M. <hi>Pirot</hi> ſaid boldly, it might be uſed as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Rule in thoſe Matters. In effect, I have
condemned therein all the Errors that have
alarm'd <hi>ſome good people in theſe latter times.</hi>
                  </q>
By the way, it falls much ſhort of it, and when
all is done, we don't talk here of examining a
particular Letter, the Nature of which I
know only by a confuſed Recital. But here
he begins to come to ſomething more eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</p>
               <p>29. Yet I do not find it enough to diſſipate
the vain Umbrages, and think it neceſſary to
to declare my ſelf ſtill in a more Authentick
Manner. I have writ a Book, wherein I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
to the bottom the whole Syſtem of the
inward Ways, wherein I mark on one ſide
whatſoever is conformable to the Faith, and
grounded upon the Tradition of the Saints;
and on the other whatſoever goes beyond, and
which ought to be rigorouſly cenſured. The
more I am under a neceſſity of refuſing my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
to the Book of M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> the
more Capital it is to declare my ſelf at the ſame
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48044:41"/>
time, in a more Emphatical and Expreſs Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The Work is now ready. They have no
cauſe to be afraid, that I ſhould contradict
there M. <hi>de Meaux.</hi> I would rather chooſe to
dye, than to preſent the Publick with ſo ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous
a Scene. I ſhall not mention him, but
to praiſing him, and making uſe of his words.
I know perfectly his Thoughts, and I may
promiſe, that he will be ſatisfied with my
Work when he ſees it publiſhed.</p>
               <p>30. Further, I won't preſume to have it
printed without Conſulting any body. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
to entruſt the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> and M.
<hi>Tronſon</hi> with it, as a great Secret of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
degree; as ſoon as they have read it over,
I will publiſh it according to their Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
They ſhall be the Judes of my Doctrine,
and nothing but what is approved by them
ſhall be printed. I ſhould have the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> were I not under a
Neceſſity of Concealing from him a Work,
the printing whereof, 'tis likely he would
hinder, out of reſpect to his own.</p>
               <p>31. In this Work I ſhall exhort all the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks
that have errred in Doctrine, to own
their Errors. I ſhall add, that ſuch as have
explained themſelves ill, without falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
any Error, are obliged in Conſcience to
condemn their Expreſſions without reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
never to uſe them any more, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
all Equivocating by a publick Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their real Sentiments. Can any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
go further to repreſs Error?</p>
               <p>32. God alone knows to what degree I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48044:41"/>
in making a Perſon ſuffer upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion,
for whom I have the moſt conſtant
and moſt ſincere Reſpect and Affection of
any Perſon in the World.</p>
               <p>33. Thus the Memoire written by the
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> concludes. We may
eaſily underſtand, who the Perſon is, whoſe
Suffering he is ſo ſorry to occaſion, and what
the Subject of that Suffering is. All the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
Friends of M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> do truly ſuffer,
to ſee him ſo ſtrangely addicted to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that Book; that he had rather ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
himſelf from his Fellow-Biſhops than
Condemn it, than to unite himſelf to them
by a common Approbation of my Book, to
which he juſt now declares in this Memoire
that the only Obſtacle that hinders him, was
his being unwilling to diſapprove the Books
of M. <hi>Guyon:</hi> But we leave theſe Reflections,
and come to the Eſſential Facts contained in
this Memoire.</p>

               <p>1. LEt us begin at the laſt, whilſt our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
is yet freſh. There are two of
'em very important: The One of which is,
That the Explications put on the Margin of
the thirty four Propoſitions were concealed
from me, and ſhew'd only to the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Paris</hi> and M. <hi>Tronſon.</hi> They begun then
from that time to Comment upon the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48044:42"/>
they turn'd them, they explain'd them
after his way: He Conceal'd it from me;
Why? becauſe he knew in his Conſcience that
he departed from our firſt Sentiments. He
will ſay, that M. <hi>de Paris</hi> and M. <hi>Tronſon</hi>
would have thought as I did: Who doubts
of it? So they did; and M. <hi>de Paris</hi> has well
ſhewed it: But then every one has his own
Eyes, and his own Conſcience: One helps
another: Why then did they ſeparate me
from thoſe Gentlemen? ſeeing that they and
I drew up thoſe Articles with a perfect una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity,
as has been ſaip? Why did he hide
himſelf but from him, to whom, before his
being Arch-biſhop, and at the time of the
Examination of the Articles, he referred all
things as to God, without any further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion,
as a Child, as a School-boy? It is
not for my advantage that I put him in mind
of thoſe words; it is to ſhew the laudible
diſpoſition of Humility and Obedience God
then inſpired M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> with. What has
ſince happened, that ſhould alter his Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
is it becauſe I had Conſecrated him? is
it becauſe he was not ſatisfied with his having
Choſen me for that Work, when at that time
he was more full than ever of the Sentiments
God had inſpir'd him with towards me, tho'
unworthy, and renewed his Proteſtation, that
he would never entertain other Opinions than
mine, the Purity whereof he knew? It was,
notwithſtanding, after having Signed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
that he gives, unknown to me, a large
Explanation of 'em to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:48044:42"/>
and to M. <hi>Tronſon.</hi> As for me, I ſhould
be ſatisfied with it; but as for M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi>
would he ſeparate and diſunite Brethren and
Unanimous Perſons, that had laboured and
concerted things ſo perfectly together, and as
became Church-men? If that was his Deſign,
what Conduct is this? if it was not, why
does he hide himſelf from me, who breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out nothing but Unity and Concord? Was
I become of a ſudden moroſe, capricious and
unmanageable, it had been much better to
have Communicated to me what he was
treating with the inſeparable Fellows of my
Labour, than a Letter to a Carmelite, which
related nothing to our purpoſe, ſeeing that
was writ rather with reſpect to his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Inſtruction, than to the State of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in General. But, what? he would make
ſhew of ſome Remains of Confidence, for a
Man that deſerved an entire Confidence;
whilſt the Eſſential Part is concealed from
him; and whilſt M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> in order to
leſſen the Number of the Witneſſes, of the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations
he was contriving, labours ſecretly
to ſeparate him from them to whom God had
join'd him in this Work.</p>
               <p>2. <q>I have writ a Book, wherein I fully
explain the whole Syſtem of the Inward
Wayes: The Work is now ready: They
need not be afraid that I ſhall therein Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
M. <hi>de Meaux:</hi> I'd rather chooſe to
dye, than to preſent the Publick with ſo
<hi>Scandalous a Scene.</hi>
                  </q> Without the Trouble
of Dyeing, to avoid that Scandal, he ſhould
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48044:43"/>
have only Communicated that New Work
to me, as all the others had been Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
and as I had Communicated that
which I was Medirating. I take here Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and Earth to Witneſs, that I never knew,
even according to the Confeſſion of M. <hi>de
Cambray,</hi> what he was Contriving, and that
I have my Hands free from the Scandalous
Diviſions that are thereupon happened.</p>
               <p>3. I ſhall not ſpeak of M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi> but to
praiſe him, and make uſe of his Words.</p>
               <p>Whom do they think to amuſe by that am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
Diſcourſe? to what purpoſe ſerves
wavering Praiſe in a Book of Doctrine? Is it
not common, to uſe the Words of an Author
againſt himſelf, and to convince him? Thus
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> did not give the World any
Aſſurance, againſt the Diſſentions they had
reaſon to fear from his Book, ſo that once
more I am innocent.</p>
               <p>4. <hi>I know perfectly well the Thoughts of M.</hi> de
Meaux, <hi>and I may venture to promiſe, that he
will be ſatisfied when he ſhall ſee my Work publiſh'd.</hi>
What, he knows my Thoughts ſo well, that
he won't do ſo much as ask them? <hi>I will be
ſatisfied, He anſwers for it,</hi> ſo I ſee but his Book
publiſh'd. Did he think to draw the Publick
after him, and by their Authority to drag me
alſo along? to make me believe, that in the
Articles of <hi>Iſſy,</hi> I had thought of all that
he would do, or that though he might be
aſſur'd, if I durſt ſay ſo of my pacifick Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
he believed I would connive at every
thing? did he not think that Diſcretion, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48044:43"/>
Compliance, eſpecially in matters of
the Faith, have bounds beyond which they
muſt not be puſh'd? There was a ſurer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
to prevent ſo great a Miſchief, which
was to concert, and to endeavour to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
one another, as I had given him Example.
He ſhunned a way ſo fair and ſo natural, and
thought to draw the Publick after him, but ſo
far were they from ſuffering themſelves to be
drawn away, that he ſaw an univerſal Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar
againſt it, that the like will hardly be
found exemplified. Thus God turns Men out
of the way, when they neglect the certain and
ſimple means they have in their Hands, and
relye upon their Eloquence.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>I don't preſume to have this Work printed
without conſulting any body. He promiſes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the Archbiſhop of</hi> Paris, <hi>and M.</hi> Tronſon,
<hi>and not to have any thing printed but what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
I would have, ſays he, the ſame confidence
in M.</hi> de Meaux, <hi>were I not under the neceſſity of
concealing from him a Work, the printing whereof
'tis likely he would hinder out of reſpect to his own:</hi>
Why ſhould I hinder it? Did he know in his
Conſcience, that by turning the Articles as
he has done, our Books would be contrary
to one another; and that he argued upon
Principles oppoſite to thoſe we had agreed
upon? This is what he ſhould have prevented.
It was perhaps, out of Jealouſie of excelling
me, that I would hinder his Book from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out? what Mark had I ever given of ſo
mean a Diſpoſition? why would he ſuſpect
ſuch a thing of his Fellow-Biſhop, his Friend,

his Conſecrator, who may well be accuſed of
being too much poſſeſs'd with a good Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his Compliance? If I had been as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
to ſhew ſo ſhamful a Jealouſie, and
to wrangle vainly with M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> M. <hi>de
Paris</hi> and M. <hi>de Tronſon</hi> would have confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me? and becauſe 'tis likely I ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
them upon this Conjecture and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
he really expoſes the Church to the
greateſt Scandal that could be rais'd.</p>
               <p>6. But whence comes this change of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct?
He to whom all was referred during
the Diſcuſſion of the Matter, he, whoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Judgment was expected, with a Submiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
I did not abuſe. In a word, he, to whom
he was willing to refer all things without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
and Reſervation, is now the only Man
from whom he conceals himſelf: Why? no
new thing is happened to me ſince M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> was made Arch-biſhop, I have given
him a new Mark of Confidence in deſiring his
Approbation, and in ſubmitting my Book to
his Examination; but it happen'd, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
raiſed to that ſublime Dignity, would for
ſome conceal'd ends, change the Articles he
had ſigned, and he muſt ſince then have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,
what he had promiſed to one of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators
he had choſen, and to whom he had
ſhewed moſt Submiſſion.</p>
               <p>7. He was no leſs miſtaken when he thought
ſo, than when he thought he could impoſe upon
the Publick; M. <hi>de Paris</hi> has refuſed him his
Approbation, he has given his Approbation
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48044:45"/>
O my Book. He attempted in vain, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
thoſe whom God, I dare ſay, had uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the common Faith, and by the Spirit
of the Tradition that we had ſought for in the
ſame Fountains. It is true, M. <hi>de Tronſon</hi>
grants, that he did not oblige M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
to give me his Approbation; but when all is
done, all depends upon the Expoſing of it to
the Publick: M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> did ſo expoſe it,
ſaying, he could not approve my Book with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
betraying his Sentiments; to tell him, that
he ought not to approve of his having ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
it, is the ſame thing as to Adviſe one
not to ſign the Confeſſion of Faith, ſo long as
he is not perſwaded of it. It is exactly what
M. <hi>Tronſon</hi> had order'd to be told me: It is
what he told me himſelf, he told me beſides
by ſeveral Perſons, and to my ſelf before un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable
Witneſſes, that he believ'd M.
<hi>de Cambray</hi> oblig'd in Conſcience to condemn
the Books of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> and diſown his own
Book; then all would have been at an end
if he had ſtood to his Advice: The Proof
of this would he very eaſie, but it is better to
ſtick cloſe only to what is deciſive.</p>
               <p>8. We may now ſee one of the Reaſons,
why M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> who ſtill conferred with
M. <hi>de Paris</hi> and M. <hi>de Chartres,</hi> conſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to confer with me. It appears already
by that Writing, that even before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication
of his Book, all his Care was to divide
us; but the Truth is ſtronger than the Wiles
of Men, and 'tis impoſſible for Man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite
thoſe that it unites.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48044:46"/>
9. <hi>I ſhall exhort the Myſtick Divines that have
erred, continues M.</hi> de Cambray, <hi>to own their
Errors; and they that have not explained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
well, to condemn without reſtriction their
Expreſſions: Can any one go further to repreſs
Error?</hi> Who doubts but they may, and ought
to go further? when he hath authorized an
evil Book, a Book not only, ſuſpected every
where, but beſides condemned at <hi>Rome</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and elſewhere: When he has allowed it to
be eſteemed by illuſtrious Perſons, and ſuffer'd
her to make uſe of the Confidence they had in
him to authorize that Book; and moreover,
tho' they could not juſtifie it, but by recourſe
to ſecret Explications, which they to whom it
was recommended, neither ought nor could
divine: When he alledges for his chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
that the reaſon of his excuſing that Book
was, only becauſe he explains it better than
it explained it ſelf: Is that enough to exhort
in general, Authors that have failen, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
their Faults; and if they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in an ambiguous ſenſe, to explain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
No, without doubt it is not enough:
That is a meer Illuſion, it is certainly one, to
propoſe to make a Woman write, who never
ought to have written, and who is condemn'd
to perpetual Silence. He ought to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
before the Publick, and not to make uſe of
a vain pretext to excuſe himſelf of it.</p>
               <p>10. He is ſo deeply engaged in defending
the Doctrine of that Woman, that he not
only owns her to be his Friend, but alſo that
all his Correſpondence and Intimacy with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48044:46"/>
her, was only grounded upon the Sprituality
ſhe profeſſed.</p>
               <p>11. He is, I ſay, to this very day, ſo wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to M. <hi>Guyon</hi>'s Book, tho' condemned by
ſo many Cenſures, that he affects to excuſe
the Errors thereof, as a Myſtick Language,
and as Exagerations which he offers to
maintain by thoſe of ſome Myſtick Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines;
Nay, even of ſome Fathers; without
conſidering, that what we reprove in that
Woman, is not only ſome Exagerations which
may happen innocently, but alſo that ſhe has
ſur paſſed in her Principles, all the Myſtical
Divines true or falſe; nay, has out-done the
Book of <hi>Molinus</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>12. Yet once more, he remains ſo cloſely
wedded to thoſe ill Books, that he had declared
juſt now in his Memorie, that he will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ſilent upon that Subject to the laſt. He is
indeed ſilent to Extremity, ſeeing that to this
very day, notwithſtanding the danger he is in
for endeavouring to excuſe thoſe Books, a
clear Condemnation thereof cannot be extort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from him.</p>
               <p>13. In order to conclude his Obſervations
upon the plain matters of Fact, we muſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obſerve the prodigious difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
what was really acted between us on the
ſigning the Articles, and what is related thereof
by M. <hi>de Cambray.</hi> If I ſay, that he offer'd to
ſubſcribe all that very moment, without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
any thing out of an entire and perfect
Obedience, I ſhould only repeat what is to be
ſeen in all his Letters; it is he that taught us,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48044:47"/>
it is he that laid upon us the Condition of the
Signature: I was a ſevere, moroſe Man, and
muſt be earneſtly preſs'd by M. <hi>de Paris,</hi> then
M. <hi>de Chaalons,</hi> in order to bring me to the
Sentiments of M. <hi>de Cambray.</hi> I never refuſed
to be taught by any of the loweſt order of the
Church; and much leſs by great Prelates:
But as for this time, and this Mattèr, I do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
it, and God knows that there never was
the leaſt Controverſie between M. <hi>de Chaalons</hi>
and me; we drew up the Articles with one
Voice, without any thing like a Diſpute, and
we unanimouſly reject the ſubtle Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to render all our Reſolutions uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>14. As for the matter of Doctrine, ſays he,
I did not ceaſe to write, and to hearken to
thoſe approved by the Church. To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is this Diſcourſe? the Queſtion was about
underſtanding them right. What is it that M.
<hi>de Cambray</hi> ſubmitted to our Judgment, if it
was not the Interpretation he gave to them?
but now 'tis quite another thing: It is he that
teaches us the Tradition, let us give Glory
to God if it be ſo; but was it we that deſired
Arbitrators of our Doctrine? who deſired on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Deciſion to ſubmit our ſelves thereto,
without reſerving to our ſelves the leaſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply?
who ſo earneſtly preſſed that they would
take us at our Word upon that Offer, and that
they would try our Compliance? what is there
happen'd ſince the time that M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
wrote thoſe things, except that he being ſince
made Archibiſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> would no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48044:47"/>
tye himſelf to the Doctrine he had volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
ſubſcribed, that he would now vary from
it; and Laſtly, that he has forgot the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
that God had then put into his Heart.</p>
               <p>15. <q>They that have ſeen our Diſcuſſion,
muſt own, <hi>continues he,</hi> that M. <hi>de Meaux,</hi>
who at firſt would thunder againſt all, has
been conſtrained to admit one after another,
things which he had a hundred times reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as moſt pernicious.</q> It was I then that
taught an evil Doctrine, it was I to whom
they muſt give Arbitrators; M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
who ſpoke only of Submiſſion to our Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
really he that taught us: M. <hi>de Meaux</hi>
was for thundering againſt all, but if he was
altogether of ſo thundering a Diſpoſition, and
ſo unjuſt in the time of the Diſcuſſion, why
would you expect his Deciſion to ſubmit your
ſelf to it? why would you deſire it ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
why would you hear in him, not only a
Doctor whom you were pleaſed to call one
of the greateſt, but God himſelf? were theſe
ſerious Words, or Flattery and Deriſion? were
theſe the Thunder-claps that you reſpected,
and a Man who thundered right or wrong,
that you took for your Judge? and that you
would hearken to as to God himſelf?</p>
               <p>16. Let us read once more the ſame words,
<q>They that have ſeen our Diſcuſſion, muſt own
that M. <hi>de Meaux</hi> who was for thundering
againſt all, was conſtrained, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to admit things that he rejected:</q> But
who was it that ſaw that Diſcuſſion? who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
us was admitted there? by what Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes

                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:48044:49"/>
will he prove, that I have ſo much vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
but if I was to acknowledge ſo many
faults, was M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> to acknowledge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?
for me, I have produced his Letter, and
a Memoire written with his own hand. It muſt
be confeſs'd, that he acts two very contrary
Parts; let us read the Letters he wrote during
the Diſcuſſion; he deſired only a Judgement,
after which he offered a Retraction at firſt,
and to abandon all. Let us read the Memoire
he makes after the ſame Diſcuſſion; M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> has not only no Sentiment he was to
forſake, but it was we that were to forſake
ours to embrace his, which we did nothing
but thunder againſt, right or wrong, without
Judgment.</p>
               <p>17. <hi>It was not,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Perſon of M.</hi>
Guyon, <hi>and her Writings, I was concern'd for;
but for the Doctrine of the Saints, which is but too
little known to moſt part of the Scholaſticks:</hi> We
were thoſe Scholaſticks then, to whom the
Doctrine of the Saints was ſo unknown,
and it was M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> that taught us that
Doctrine. During the Diſcuſſion he carried
himſelf as a Scholar, but ſince he is arriv'd to
an higher Degree, he would propoſe new Rules
by his Explication, he repents that he had ſo
ſubmitted, and he ſpeaks now as tho' he was
the Arbitrator of all.</p>
               <p>18. We are not infallible; No, without
doubt; but yet he ſhou'd ſhew us wherein we
had need of Inſtruction: What Errors did we
teach? Did we except againſt ſome part of
the Doctrine of the Saints? Did we deſire
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48044:49"/>
Doctors and Arbitrators? Go, let us take
heed not to glory, except it be in the Lord:
Let us not ſpeak of the deference we owe to
one another; a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
it his glory to learn every day, and that
too of all Men: But yet we muſt not forget
the part that we acted, M. <hi>de Chaalon,</hi> M. <hi>de
Tronſon,</hi> and I: Without doubt they looke
upon us as Men of ſound and uncorrupt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
to whom they would referr all upon
the <hi>Myſteries of Prayer</hi> and <hi>Pure Love,</hi> that is
to ſay, upon moſt Eſſential Points of Faith.
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> himſelf propoſed us, received
us, and lookt upon us as ſuch, and now all
of a ſudden we are no more but a ſort of
Doctors to whom, as well as to the moſt
part of the Scholaſticks, the Doctrine of the
Saints is utterly unknown.</p>
               <p>19. But whilſt M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> aſcribes to
himſelf ſo much Authority and Light, God
permits that he ſhould diſcover to us his
Changeableneſs. Now he boaſts only of the
School, and accuſes us as being Oppoſers of
the Scholaſtick Doctors, but then his Buſineſs
was only to teach us the Doctrine of the
Saints unknown, yea, moſt unknown, not to
ſome, or to a ſmall Number, but to moſt of
the Doctors of the School.</p>
               <p>20. <hi>It is not the Perſon of</hi> M. Guyon <hi>and her
Writings I was concerned for:</hi> What was the
thing then in Queſtion at that time? Who
was it that propoſed the Queſtion? Why
were Arbitrators choſen and deſired? Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators
to whom all was ſubmitted; was it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48044:50"/>
not to Judge of the Prayer, and of the Books
of M. <hi>Guyon?</hi> will he always forget and looſe
ſight of the expreſs Subject of the Diſpute?
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> had not then publiſhed any
thing upon that Matter: It was not he that
was accuſed, it was M. <hi>Guyon</hi> and her Books:
Why did he meddle ſo far in that Buſineſs?
who call'd him thereunto, if not his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
by which he knew, thàt if we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
the Books of Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> which he
had ſo much recommended, he would be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Condemned himſelf? Why did he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
ſo many Writings? was it to accuſe or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
and defend thoſe Books? that muſt then
have been our Queſtion; and yet if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> this was not the Matter
he was concerned for; it was for <hi>the Doctrine
of the Saints.</hi> What; For the Doctrine of the
Saints in general, or in relation to thoſe Books
that were ſo mightily accuſed? He would
then teach us, that thoſe Books were confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
to the Doctrine of the Saints, and that
if they were accuſed, it was becauſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the School, for the moſt part, were
ignorant of that Doctrine which Madam <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
came to teach them?</p>
               <p>21. Let us tell the truth, as it reſults from
the Matters of Fact, and from the Writings
juſt now mentioned: Whilſt ſhe wrote before
as the Party accuſed, the Abbot <hi>de Fenelon</hi>
wrote alſo as much as ſhe, either as her Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate
or Interpreter: However to hinder her
Condemnation, the Matter in Queſtion was
not the Perſon who always ſpoke as having
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48044:50"/>
ſubmitted, it was the Books and the Doctrine
he had a mind to defend, and he had no other
Reaſon or Title for entring upon that Cauſe:
What he had begun when only M. <hi>de Fenelon,</hi>
he continued it when made Arch biſhop of
<hi>Cambray;</hi> it is under this Title that he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
the thirty four Propoſitions: He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
to ſubmit all to the Arbitrators he had
Choſen, and to whom he ſent all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:
He received that Motion as a Motion
from God, which he entertained even to the
time of his Conſecration: If he afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
all, what have we to ſay to it, but that
he diſſembled? or that being advanced as
high as he could be, he had changed his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
and taken another Method.</p>
               <p>22. He makes wonderful Arguments upon
his Conduct: <q>Is it that I was meek and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
when I ſigned the thirty four Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
they may judge of that by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Reſolution: Is it that I have refuſed
out of Self-conceit, and a Factious Spirit to
approve the Book of M. <hi>de Meaux?</hi> they
may judge of that by my readineſs to Sign
the thirty four Propoſitions.</q> To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
are his Arguments, when Matters of Fact
ſpeak? Thoſe Matters of Fact ſhew a Rule,
and a more ſimple and natural way to judge
of his Change of Conduct: It is in a word to
be Arch-biſhop or not; to obſerve Meaſures
before his being made ſo, and to keep none
when the Buſineſs is conſummated.</p>
               <p>23. He Values himſelf much upon Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to ſuffer M. <hi>Guyon</hi> to be condemned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48044:51"/>
fined, and loaden with Reproaches, without
ſaying ſo much as one word to juſtifie her, to
excuſe her, or to ſweeten her Condition. We
muſt not yet argue too much on this Point:
It is naturally and plainly thus, that M. <hi>Guy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
by her ill Doctrine, and her raſh Conduct,
for it was not then throughly div'd into, was
become ſo ridiculous and odious, that the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and Precaution of the Abbot <hi>de Fenelon,</hi>
even ſince he was made Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
did not permit him to expoſe himſelf in
vain: What, do I ſay to expoſe himſelf?
to loſe his good Name utterly by upholding
her, and that there was no other way for one
that would defend her, but to take indirect
Methods.</p>
               <p>24. It is what appears to us in all his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
that he had ſecretly undertook to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
her: Thus that he defends her to this
very day, in maintaining the Book of the
Maximes of the Saints: He lays down now,
as he did then, all the Principles he can to
uphold her: If, by his Knowledge he covers
her Doctrine, if he mittigates it in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
that way of Teaching it is ſo much the
more dangerous. In fine, we could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him then but by his extream Submiſſion,
the Proof whereof we have been conſtrained to
give by his own Letters, and we had not loſt
thoſe Hopes of him but by the Publication of
his Book, of which we muſt now ſpeak.</p>

whom he would no more hearken:) That
Book, I ſay, wherein he had engaged himſelf,

at laſt on a ſudden in <hi>February,</hi> 1697.
without the leaſt Mark of any ſuch Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has explain'd
himſelf to the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> how
that Book appeared againſt his Advice, and
againſt the formal Word M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> had

Head, I ſhall only Obſerve, that not to
find the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris's</hi> Approbation

Opinion as the Refuſal of it, ſeeing, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

reduce the Expreſſions to the utmoſt rigour of
the Theological Language, and by that means
to ſerve as a Rule to all Spirituality. We
ſaw, I ſay, that Book appear without any Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,
not ſo much as of thoſe from whom
it was moſt Neceſſary, and whoſe Approbation
he had promiſed to take.</p>
               <p>2. It is in vain to Anſwer, that M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
had, 'tis true, promiſed to ſpeak nothing
but what M. <hi>de Paris</hi> ſhould approve of, but
not to take his Approbation in Writing, for
'tis not the Cuſtom to prove an Approbation
by a Chimerical Matter of Fact: It muſt be
ſhewed in Writing, and Signed, eſpecially
when he of whom he takes it, is concerned in
the Caſe, as the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
ſo in the New Book, ſeeing he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
in the Preface of his Book that he would
explain his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>3. So M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> ventured at &amp;: He,
that choſe rather to dye, than to preſent the
Publick with ſo ſcandalous a Scene as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
me, expoſes himſelf likewiſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and to ſet
the whole Church in a Combuſtion. He had
rather indeed expoſe himſelf, and did it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly,
than with his Friends, with his
Fellow-Biſhops, not to ſay with them he had
Choſen for Arbitrators of his Doctrine, whilſt
on our part we offered to Concert all things
with him, and did ſo accordingly, and put our
Compoſitions into his Hands. He has broke
all Union, out of an eager deſire to give Laws
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48044:52"/>
to the Church, and to furniſh Excuſe to M.
<hi>Guyon;</hi> nor can he endure to be told, that he
alone is the Cauſe of Diviſion among the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and of the Scandal of Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>4. He would have it forgot, how ſpeedy
and univerſal an Oppoſition was made to his
Book: The Town, the Court, the Sorbonne,
the Monaſteries, the Learned, the Ignorant,
Men, Women, yea, all Orders without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
ſhewed their Indignation, not againſt
the Proceedings, for they were known but to
few, and indeed to no body throughly; but
againſt the boldneſs of ſuch an ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion,
againſt the refinedneſs of the Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the ſtrangeneſs, unprofitableneſs, and the
ambiguity of that unheard of Doctrine: It
was then that the Publick Noiſe convey'd to
the Sacred Ears of the King what he had ſo
carefully conceal'd: He heard it from an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Perſons, that M. <hi>Guyon</hi> had met with a
Protector in his Court, in his Family, one that
waited upon the Princes his Children: And
with what Diſpleaſure, we may judge by the
Piety and the Prudence of that great Prince.
We were the laſt that ſpoke of it, every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
knows the juſt Reproaches we underwent
from the Mouth of ſo good a Maſter, for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
concealed from him what we knew; with
which you may be ſure he charg'd our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences:
Yet M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> in ſuch a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
diſſatisfaction only complained of us; and
when we were conſtrained to excuſe our ſelves
for having ſerved him too much, and that we
muſt laſtly begg Pardon for our Silence that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48044:53"/>
hád ſaved him, he made and contrived the moſt
ſtrange Accuſations that could be againſt us.</p>
               <p>5. Did I alone raiſe up the Publick? what!
my Cabal? my Emiſſaries? ſhall I dare to ſay
ſo? I can ſay it with Confidence and before
the Sun; the moſt ſimple of all Men, I would
ſay the moſt incapable of all Cunning and of all
Diſſimulation, as one who never found Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,
but becauſe I have always walk'd ſo as
to obtain common Credit: All of a ſudden I
have conceived the bold Deſign of ruining by
my Credit alone the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
whom until then, I had always been
willing to ſave at my own Peril: But that is
nothing, I alone have by imperceptible ſprings,
from a Corner of my Cloſet, amongſt my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and my Books, ſtirr'd up the whole Court,
all <hi>Paris,</hi> all <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, where
the univerſal Aſtoniſhment, not to ſay more;
was carried as faſt as the Publick News could
convey it: What the moſt credited, and moſt
abſolute Potentates could not perform, and
care not undertake; <hi>viz.</hi> to make Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
as it were in an inſtant, in the ſame
thoughts, I alone have done it without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from my Cloſet.</p>
               <p>6. Yet I wrote nothing; my Book that was
finiſhing, and printing when that of M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> appeared, ſtay'd three Weeks longer
in the Preſs; and when I publiſhed it, they
ſound therein 'tis true, Principles contrary to
thoſe of the Maxims of the Saints; (it could
not be otherwiſe, ſeeing we took ſuch diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ways; and that I deſigned only to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48044:53"/>
the Articles that M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> had a
Mind to elude) but not one Word againſt
that Prelate.</p>
               <p>7. I ſhall ſay nothing of my Book, but one
well known and certain Matter of Fact: It
paſſed without any ſeeming Contradiction, I
had no Advantage of it, I therein taught the
Doctrine of the Catholick Church; the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of M. <hi>de Paris,</hi> and that of M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
did add thereunto that Authority which
the Holy Concurrence of Biſhops gives natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
in Matters of Faith. The Pope himſelf
did me the Honour to ſènd me a Letter upon
the Book I had laid at his Sacred Feet, and
was pleaſed to expreſs himſelf in brief, that
my Volume had much encreaſed the good
Will he entertain'd for me: That brief Letter
is publiſh'd in my Second Edition. It appears
alſo in the Letter to M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> whether
there be a Word of his Book: That difference
regards not my Perſon: It is an Advantage
from the Doctrine I taught, which is known all
over the Earth, and which is authorized and
always favoured by the Chair of St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>8. Affairs ſeemed afterwards to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
embroil'd. It is the ordinary Conduct
of God againſt Errors. There happens at the
very firſt Appearance of 'em an illuſtrious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the Faith. It is as the firſt ſtroke of
the Ancient Tradition, that repulſes the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties
they deſign to introduce: A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
a ſecond Time follow'd, which I call
the time of Temptation; the Cabals, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
began to ſtir, Paſſion and Intereſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48044:54"/>
the World: Great Bodies, great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
ſtir themſelves, Eloquence dazzles
the ſimple, the Dialecticks lay Snares for
them, Extravagant Metaphy ſicks carries the
Minds of Men into unknown Countries, many
know no more what to believe, and hold all
in Indifference, without Underſtanding or
Diſtinction, they embrace their Party meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
out of Humour. There's the Times I call
Times of Temptation, if they will, Times
of Darkneſs; we muſt wait in Faith for the
laſt Time, when Truth ſhall triumph, and
get the victory.</p>
               <p>9. The firſt thing that appeared upon open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Book of M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> was a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
affectation to excuſe the Myſticks newly
condemned, by cutting them off once, twice
and thrice, from the Liſt of the falſe Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts.
Here we may diſcover him that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to keep ſilence to the laſt upon the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of M. <hi>Guyon.</hi> We have ſhewed in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
place, that the <hi>ſhort Method</hi> of that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was nothing elſe but a more expreſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of <hi>Molinos's Guide,</hi> and eſpecially as
to indifference about Salvation, and that they
had beſides affected to tranſcribe into that
ſmall Book, the ſame Paſſages <hi>Molinos</hi> relyes
upon in his Guide; among others a Letter of
Father <hi>Falconi,</hi> which has been cenſur'd at
<hi>Rome.</hi> So that to ſave Madam <hi>Guyon,</hi> they
muſt ſave <hi>Molinos;</hi> and for this reaſon M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> ſpared him in the Maxims of the
Saints. It is true, that he durſt not forbear
condemning expreſly, that Hereſrarcha in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48044:54"/>
Letter to the Pope. But he ſpoke therein on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of 68 Propoſitions of that Wretch, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to keep ſilence as to the <hi>Guide,</hi> which is
the Original of the New Quietiſm, and of the
<hi>ſhort Method.</hi> As for this laſt Book, very far
from condemning it, he excuſed it in the ſame
Letter, by compriſing his Author among the
Myſticks; <hi>Who,</hi> ſays he, <hi>carrying the Myſtery
of the Faith in a pure Conſcience, had favoured
the Error by an exceſs of affectionate Piety, for
want of precaution, the choice of terms, and through
a pardonable Ignorance of the Principles of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi>
He adds, that this was the Subject of
the Zeal of ſome Biſhops, and of the 34 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
altho' thoſe Propoſitions and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
had no regard to any, but to M. <hi>Guyon</hi>
and <hi>Molinos.</hi> There's the pretended Exage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
the pretended Equivocations, and in
one Word, the pretended Myſtical Language,
which is plainly to be ſeen he prepared as a
Refuge to that Woman; and he preſented
that Excuſe to the Pope himſelf, to draw his
Advantages from it, if he would have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it.</p>
               <p>10. Here we may ſee the ſame Spirit of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
for the ſhort <hi>Method,</hi> and M. <hi>Guyon's</hi>
other Books, when ſpeaking of the Cenſures
of ſome Biſhops againſt <hi>certain little Books,</hi>
of which he durſt not hold his Peace altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before the Pope, he reduces the ſame
Cenſures to <hi>ſome places, which taken in the ſence
that naturally offers at firſt,</hi> deſerve to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.
He would ſeem thereby to condemn
them, if we remember'd not the particular
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48044:55"/>
ſenſe he would have to be found in the ſame
Books, notwithſtanding their proper Words,
and judges them to be condemnable only in a
rigorous ſence, which he aſſures us never came
into the Mind of their Author; by which it is
but too plain, he reſerved to himſelf the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of excuſing them, by this particular
ſenſe he pretends to find in the Book, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Words of the Book it ſelf.</p>
               <p>11. In the mean while, how little ſoever he
may have ſaid of it, he is ſo afraid we ſhould
believe that he hath paſs'd a Sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
upon the Books of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> by ſo
ſpeaking in his Letter to the Pope of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
that have cenſured her, that he explains
it in his Anſwer to the Declaration; where he
ſays, that he does not relye at all upon their
Cenſures, wherein he never had any part nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
directly nor indirectly: Words choſen on
purpoſe, to ſhew that he was very far from
approving them.</p>
               <p>12. What he anſwers upon the affected
Omiſſion of <hi>Molinos,</hi> and of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> is no leſs
eſtrange; <hi>Do they pretend,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſeriouſly,
that I would defend or excuſe</hi> Molinos, <hi>when in
all my Books I deteſt all the Errors of the 68 Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
that occaſion'd him to be condemned?</hi> Yes
without doubt, they ſeriouſly pretend it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that theſe very Words confirm the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
affectation of ſuppreſſing the <hi>Guide</hi> of
that Author, and of touching only upon the
68 Propoſitions, as if they were the only Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of the Condemnation of the Holy See,
without comprizing that Book therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:48044:55"/>
13. <hi>As for the perſon,</hi> adds he, <hi>whoſe Books
the Prelates have cenſured, I have already given
an Account to the Pope my Superior, of what I
thought thereupon.</hi> Who does not ſee, that
this is to ſhift off the eſſential point? is it in
vain that St. <hi>Peter</hi> had ſaid, That we muſt be
ready to give an Account of our Faith, not
only to a Superior, but to all thoſe that deſire
it? What would it have been for M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
to explain himſelf to the whole Church,
without affecting to ſpare and uphold M.
<hi>Guyon?</hi> But yet let us ſee, what Account he
has given to the Pope, of his Sentiments upon
the Books of that Woman. I do not repeat it,
ſays he, my Letter being made publick. There
is no Letter publick, but that wherein he ſays
to the Pope, <hi>That there are ſome certain ſmall
Books cenſured by the Biſhops, ſome places whereof, in
the ſenſe that naturally offer'd, were condemnable.</hi>
You ſee all the Account he gives to the Pope of
thoſe Books that are pernicious throughout,
and not to be countenanced in any ſenſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
what is read in them is pernicious, and
what he conjectures is to be found in them, is
forced and not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>14. One may alſo obſerve here his affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of naming to the Pope only <hi>Molinos,</hi> and not
M. <hi>Guyon.</hi> It is true, he hath ſet down in the
Margin of the Letter to the Pope the <hi>ſhort Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</hi>
&amp;c. with the Explication of the Song
of Songs. But after the Liberty M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
has taken, to ſay, that they have inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
what they would in his Text, who ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him from diſowning a Marginal Note, the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48044:56"/>
Text whereof is inſignificant? and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
happens, he will come off with condemning
ſome places only in thoſe Books, whilſt he
ſpares the bottom, which is wholly corrupted;
and beſides, he condemning them only in that
pretended ſevere ſenſe, for which he is ſurety
that it never came into the Author's Mind.</p>
               <p>15. He does not ſatisfie the publick any thing
more in adding theſe Words: I ſhall do on
this point as on all others, what the Pope will
judge fit; for what was he to expect ſince the
Centure of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1689. do we not
ſee that M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> who has ſo long after
defended that Book, deſigns ſtill to ſhift off
the Condemnation thereof by deferring it?
So that Letter which he hath made publick,
does viſibly ſay nothing at all; therefore M.
<hi>de Cambray</hi> would fain have us to believe, that
he has written a more ſecret and expreſs Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the Pope: It is for this reaſon that in
the ſecond Edition of his Anſwer, he has ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
theſe Words, <hi>My Letter is made publick,</hi>
and he would have recall'd the Edition where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they were, becauſe we ſaw there very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that as to the Books of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> he was
meerly for ſhifting off, and never for explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf.</p>
               <p>16. He does more than keep ſilence. M. <hi>de
Paris</hi> has demonſtrated that his Book of the
Maxims is only a faint Mittigation, a dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and artificial Juſtification of the Books of
M. <hi>Guyon:</hi> M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> has only covered
over with fine Colours the Excluſion of the
Hope, and of the Deſire of Salvation, with
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48044:56"/>
that of Jeſus Chriſt, and of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
in pure Contemplation, and all the other
Exceſſes of that Woman: It is viſibly, her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Life, that this Prelate deſigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe,
and that he would palliate her manifeſt
Failings in his 39 Articles, it is what is found
in her Life, where ſhe ſpeaks of her ſelf in this
manner; <hi>Souls of inferior degrees will often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
more perfect: Then they find themſelves ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
from the reſt of Men, and they think ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
from 'em, that their Neighbour becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable.</hi>
Here's a new Wonder, to find
themſelves ſo much above other Men, that the
Eminency of Perfection, which induces us to
look upon our Neighbours with the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Condeſcenſion, ſhould hinder us from endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
them: But the Wonder of Wonders is
this, We feel, adds he, in the new Life, that
<hi>We cover the exterior part by apparent Weakneſſes:</hi>
So that among the Failings which ſhe can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
overcome nor cover, ſhe flatters by thoſe
haughty Excuſes the hidden Complaiſance,
that makes her to turn her Weakneſs into
Pride, and by the ſame means M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
entertains the Admiration of the juſt that
know her.</p>
               <p>17. What ſignifies theſe fine Diſcourſes in
the Maxims of the Saints, upon Souls that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to be perfect: <hi>They ſpeak of themſelves out of
pure Obedience, ſimply well or ill, as they would ſpeak
of another:</hi> Who does not ſee, that they were
deſign'd as Excuſes for the Enormous Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of a Woman, that gave out ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with a Prophetick and Apoſtolick Spirit,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48044:57"/>
with Power to bind and unbind, ſo full of
Grace as to over-flow, and with a perfection
ſo eminent, that ſhe could not endure the reſt
of Men? when ſuch Exceſſes diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
the Excuſe is ready for it in the Book
of M. <hi>de Cambray:</hi> M. <hi>Guyon</hi> ſpoke of her ſelf,
as ſhe would have ſpoke of another; ſhe
ſpoke out of Obedience to Father <hi>Lacombe</hi> her
Director, to whom ſhe addreſſes her Life,
wherein are found all thoſe things which have
been related.</p>
               <p>18. Father <hi>Lacombe</hi> was he that was given
her in a particular and wonderful manner; if
he was become her ſpiritual Father, ſhe had
firſt been his Mother; it was he alone to
whom ſhe communicated Grace, tho' afar off;
with all the tenderneſs that ſhe repreſents in her
Life to that degree as to feel her ſelf conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that it might evaporate, to tell him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<hi>O my Son, you are my beloved Son, in whom
alone I am well pleaſed:</hi> God had notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given her in her Priſon, and as the Fruit
of her Labours, another Man far more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
than Father <hi>Lacombe;</hi> and how great
ſoever her Union might be with that Father,
that ſhe was to have with the latter was quite
another thing. As to that, I will not conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
any thing, I relate here only that of her
Life, to ſhew that the falſe Myſtery is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued,
and that we are not come to the end of
the Deluſions that we are to expect from that
Woman.</p>
               <p>19. In the mean while that Father <hi>Lacombe</hi>
is the Author of the Analyſis condemned at
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48044:57"/>
                  <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſince by ſeveral Biſhops. The Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of his Intimacy with that Woman
have been known of the late Biſhop of <hi>Geneva,</hi>
of holy Memory, <hi>John d' Aranthon:</hi> And the
Hiſtory thereof is become publick in the Life
of that holy Biſhop, which the Learned and
pious general of the <hi>Carthuſians</hi> has publiſhed.
The time is come, when the pleaſure of God
is, that this Union ſhould be entirely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered:
I ſhall ſay nothing more of it, but ſhall
content my ſelf to deſcribe the Perſon by
whoſe Order M. <hi>Guyon</hi> wrote her Life.</p>
               <p>20. In every page of that Life ſhe gives
way to her Rapture, ſo far as to ſay, <hi>O let
me hear no more of Humility! The Virtues are
no longer for me! No, my God, let there be no
more for me neither Virtue, nor Perfection, nor
Holineſs!</hi> And every where in her Life ſhe ſays,
Virtuous Manners are imperfect Manners: The
Virtue Humility is a feigned Virtue, or at leaſt
affected and forced: It is there alſo that we
find the Source of the New Language; where
it is mentioned, that they will have no more
Virtue as Virtue. M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> has adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoſe words: Thence comes whatſoever we
find in his Writings to leſſen the Eſteem of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
and thence comes in the laſt place his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
forcing ſo many paſſages of St. <hi>Francis
de Sales,</hi> which are to be underſtood more ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
as that Saint did.</p>
               <p>21. We had ſaid nothing like this in our
Articles: Such Explications as are added in
Favour of M. <hi>Guyon</hi> are not a more large expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
as M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> promiſed; but an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48044:58"/>
Depravation of our Sentiments and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
In the as Article we ſpoke all upon the
Conditions and Suppoſitions impoſſible: This
was ſufficient to verifie what had been ſaid of
it by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and other Saints, who
would never introduce thoſe Suppoſitions, but
with the Expreſſion of an impoſſible Caſe. But
what was ſufficient for the Saints, was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to excuſe M. <hi>Guyon:</hi> So that to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
her, they were fain to invent the abſolute
Sacrifice never heard of before, and all the
Circumſtances that have been often remarkt,
all things added to our Articles, and unknown
to all Authors, except to <hi>Molinos</hi> and M. <hi>Guyon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>22. To ſpeak a word of it by the by, and
to bring the Reader a little back again to the
Matter of Fact, was that an Expliction of
our Principles, or his acquieſcing to his juſt
Condemnation, which one of our Articles has
expreſsly condemned, that we muſt never
ſuffer troubled Souls to acquieſee in their
Deſpair, and apparent Damnation: On the
contrary, M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> permits ſuch as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence
by a Director; and to render it
more voluntary, to aſcribe it to the higheſt
part of the Soul, he calls it a Sacrifice, and
an abſolute Sacrifice. We ſaid in the ſame
Article, that we muſt with S. <hi>Francis de Sales</hi>
aſſure thoſe Souls, that God will not forſake
them: But far from approving that Article,
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> confutes it expreſly, when he
ſays that our Buſineſs is not, neither to argue
with thoſe Souls that are incapable of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
nor to repreſent unto them the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48044:58"/>
of God in general. We muſt then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
of Comfort thoſe Souls we ſuppoſe to
be holy, and bereave them with their Reaſon
of the reaſonable Service St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches:
We muſt deliver them up to their Cruel
Thoughts, and to ſpeak it in one word, to
their Deſpair; was this to explain or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave
our Principles? Did we ſay any thing
like this in our Articles?</p>

               <head type="sub">On the Arch-biſhop of Cambray's Explications,
and the Neceſſity of our Declaration.</head>
               <p>1. IF we muſt now come to the Explications
of M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> three Things are to
be Obſerved in the Matter of Fact: The firſt
is, that they were Explications we never
heard one Word of, and that we were to own
them as contained in the Articles of <hi>Iſſy,</hi> ſeeing
it was thoſe Articles which my Lord of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
would have had explained: The ſecond
was, that he changed them every day, ſo that
they are not yet finiſhed: And the third was,
that they did viſibly contain new Errors.</p>
               <p>2. What had we to do with his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Love, which never came into our Mind?
and ſuppoſe we had admitted it, did it avail
any thing towards ſolving the Difficulties?
the chief of all was the acquieſcing to his juſt
Condemnation on the part of God: The
Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has lately demonſtrated,
that the acquieſcing to the Loſs of that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48044:59"/>
Love, is ſo far from acquieſcing to one's
own Condemnation on the part of God, that
it is on the contrary a receiving of Grace
from it, ſeeing according to the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
this is one of the 'greateſt, to be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
of a Love which they account the ſole
Obſtacle to perfection? what could we have
ſaid to an Argument ſo clear? and was not
this ſufficient to hinder us from receiving Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications,
which afford no help to the Book
they would have us to excuſe.</p>
               <p>3. On the other hand, that Explication is
ſo bad, that M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> has lately chang'd
it, in the very laſt Letter he addreſs'd to me. In
that laſt Letter, to acquieſce in one's own
Condemnation, is no more to acquieſce in the
Loſs of Natural Love, as hitherto he would
have us to underſtand it: <hi>To acquieſce in his
juſt condemnation, is</hi> (for a Sinner) <hi>to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that he deſerves Eternal Puniſhment:</hi> So the
Natural Love is uſeleſs to that act; it is not
out of a Natural Love that a Sinner owns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to deſerve Eternal Puniſhment. But this
new Anſwer is not better than the reſt, and
the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray</hi> will find himſelf
conſtrained to forſake it, as ſoon as he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
this ſhort Reflection, It is not true, that
to acknowledge ones ſelf to deſerve Eternal
Puniſhment, is to acquieſce in his juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation:
For 'tis ſo far from acquieſcing
therein, which happens to Men in Deſpair,
that we begg Pardon of the juſt Judge: We
beſeech him to change his Juſtice into Mercy,
and not to deal with us according to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:48044:59"/>
but to ſave us through Grace in the
Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; ſo far are
they from Conſenting by that Act to their
own Condemnation, that it is on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to oppoſe his Mercy thereunto, which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Effect thereof.</p>
               <p>4. So, (and this is the Second Remark)
thoſe Explications changed every day: That
which M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> ſeems to adhere to, is
that of Natural Love, and of the terms of
<hi>Motive,</hi> to which, as he grants, he now gives
a new Senſe different from that of the School.
I do not touch upon that Matter, whereof
the Biſhop of <hi>Chartres,</hi> by whom the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
have been tranſmitted to us, will ſay
what, according to his Prudence, he thinks
fit: But I ſhall only take Notice of thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Matters of Fact. The Letter to the Pope
appeared a few Months after the Book, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to ſoften the Expreſſions thereof; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mentioning therein either a Natural Love,
or the New Senſe of <hi>Motives.</hi> Soon after there
came into our Hands by M. <hi>de Chartres,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Explication, wherein that Prelate can
teſtifie, no mention was made of Natural Love,
and he gave <hi>Motive</hi> a Senſe therein, quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to that which has been propoſed ſince.
At laſt, the Natural Love which we had not
yet heard of, is come out, and this is that
ſame Explication which was ſet forth in the
Paſtoral Inſtruction.</p>
               <p>5. To draw all the Diſpute on that Point,
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> publiſht at <hi>Rome,</hi> and other
places where he had a mind, the Latin Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:48044:60"/>
of his Book. He altered it after a ſtrange
manner in the tranſlating it: For almoſt in
every place where, in the Book, the word
<hi>proper Intereſt, Commodum proprium,</hi> is found,
the Tranſlator has inſerted the word <hi>deſire,</hi>
and <hi>mercenary appetite, appetitionis mercenariae.</hi>
But our own Intereſt is not a deſire: Our
own Intereſt is manifeſtly an Object without,
and not an Affection within, nor an inward
Principle of action: All the Book is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
altered by this Change. It is a vain Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> to ſay, that he thus
underſtood it, ſeeing that in a Verſion one
muſt ſimply tranſlate the words, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
any gloſs.</p>
               <p>6. He has alſo inſerted every where the
term of <hi>mercenary,</hi> without ever having defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
it, and that he might have room to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate
in the Book whatſoever he had a mind
to, by a double Senſe that reigns all over it.</p>
               <p>7. In the ſame Latin Verſion the word <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi>
is tranſlated by <hi>that of inward affection; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitus
interior;</hi> againſt the natural ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that word, which is that we ought to
follow in a faithful Tranſlation. It was
nevertheleſs this Verſion that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Cambray</hi> beſought the Pope he
would be pleaſed to advert to in order to
judge of his Book: So that he would be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon a falſe Tranſlation. He added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Latin Notes, which did no leſs diſagree
from his Book, and this he propoſed, to ſhift
off the Examination of the <hi>French</hi> Book, by
Explications not only added to his Book, but
alſo diſagreeing from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:48044:60"/>
8. They that have neither ſeen that Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
nor thoſe Notes, may judge of it by his
Paſtoral Inſtruction. It has been ſhewed by
ſo demonſtrative Proofs, how little that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
is conformable with the Book, that
there is none but M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> who dares
deny it: So much are his Explications viſibly
forced. But that which proves the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of thoſe Explications is this, that their
Author ſeems to be ſo little ſatisfied with it
himſelf, that he cannot ceaſe to give New
Senſes to his Paſtoral Inſtruction. He had
obſerved therein, as has been demonſtrated
in my <hi>Preface, That his Natural Love was not
confin'd to himſelf, but that it tended to God as
to the Supream Good:</hi> That alſo thoſe who are
imperfect, who acted likewiſe by that Love,
<hi>deſired the ſame Objects, and that the difference
was not on the part of the Object, but on the part
of the Affection wherewith the Will deſires it:</hi>
But he perceiv'd the Inconvenience of that
Doctrine, and in the Letters he directed to
me, he will not there have it, that his Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Love is a Natural Love of God in it ſelf,
nor any thing elſe but the Natural Love of a
Created Gift, which is the formal bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p>9. But in that he miſtakes ſtill; we muſt not
believe that becauſe it is a Created Gift, <hi>the
formal Bleſſedneſs,</hi> that is to ſay, the enjoying
of God can be deſired naturally, becauſe that
Created Gift is ſupernatural, and the Love of
it is inſpired by Grace only, as the Love of
God; ſo that the Reaſon that obliged him to
correct himſelf, does as ſtrongly militate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:48044:61"/>
his Correction as againſt his firſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
               <p>10. I bring only this Example, tho' there
are a great many others of that Nature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is ſufficient to let us ſee by a ſenſible
Proof, that to engage in the Explications of
M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> was to enter into endleſs Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Windings, ſeeing he adds ſome new
Strokes to them continually.</p>
               <p>11. Here's nevertheleſs another Proof of it,
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> has publiſh'd at
<hi>Rome,</hi> two Editions of his Anſwer to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of three Biſhops: The one in 1697.
without any Name either of Printer or of
Town: The other is in 1698. at <hi>Buſſels,</hi> by
<hi>Eugen Henry Frix.</hi> Wherein the Additions
or Reſtrictions are enough to fill 5 or 6 Pages,
and when he preſented it at <hi>Rome,</hi> he deſired
to have the other again, tho' given by his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
which ſhews that he would have cover'd
his Changeableneſs; and yet he wonders, that
we ſhould not join with him in ſuch Variable
Explications.</p>
               <p>12. One weighty Reaſon that ſhews the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of joyning with them is, that
thoſe Explications are often-times new Errors.
I ſhall bring only one Example, but a very
clear one, M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> does not know how
to diſtinguiſh his Love of the fourth degree
from the fifth, nor how to preſerve to this
laſt the Pre-eminence he would give it, ſeeing
that the fourth Love as well as the fifth, <hi>Seeks
God for the Love of himſelf, and prefers him to
every thing without Exception;</hi> carrying alſo
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48044:61"/>
the Perfection and the Purity ſo far, as <hi>Not to
ſeek its own Happineſs, but with relation to God;</hi>
which is ſo pure, as 'tis impoſſible for one to
go beyond it, or to ſhow leſs regard for our
own Intereſt.</p>
               <p>13. I ſpeak of theſe things only in ſhort,
becauſe they are enough explain'd elſewhere,
and cannot be always repeated. M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
being perplex'd with this Remark, which
overthrows his whole Syſtem, anſwers that the
Love of the fourth degree, tho' it be juſtifying,
(obſerve that Word) refers truly all things
unto God, but <hi>habitually and not actually,</hi> as the
fifth; as, ſays he, the Act of Venial Sin is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
unto God, according to St. <hi>Thomas,
habitually and not actually.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>14. This Anſwer is hitherto a ſtranger to
the Schools, and contains two Evident Errors:
The firſt is, that he makes juſtifying Love re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
unto God, in the ſame manner as the Act
of the Venial Sin does: The ſecond is, to
make the Act of Venial Sin it ſelf habitually
relate unto God, which no Body ever did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
M. <hi>de Cambray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>15. The Error is enormous; for if the Act
of Venial Sin is habitually referred unto God,
it follows thence, that one may commit it for
the ſake of God, which takes away all the
Malice of Venial Sin. One may then well ſay
with St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> that Venial Sin hinders not,
neither the Man nor the Humane Act indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely,
from being referr'd unto God as the
laſt End; but that the Act it ſelf of Venial Sin,
wherein is found that which we call Diſorder,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48044:62"/>
                  <hi>Inordinatio,</hi> ſhould be referred habitually unto
God, it is againſt the Nature of all Sin, and
by conſequence of Venial Sin.</p>
               <p>16. The Rule which M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> gives
here is no leſs Erroneous: The Rule is, that
Acts which have no relation at all to the laſt
End, and which are not referred unto God,
<hi>at leaſt habitually,</hi> are mortal Sins; but thence
it follows in the firſt Place, that all Sins are
mortal, ſeeing that no ſin can in any ways be
referred unto God: And <hi>Secondly,</hi> As M. <hi>de
Paris</hi> has obſerv'd it, that all the Acts of the
Pagans are mortal ſins, ſeeing that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
the Venial Sin from breaking in the juſt,
that commits it, the Relation at leaſt habitual
unto God, is the Habit of Charity abiding in
their Soul: Whence by a contrary Reaſon it
follows, that a Pagan not having in him ſuch
a Principle of Habitual Charity, nor any
thing that unites him to God, by the Rule of
M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> tho' he may do never ſo much,
he always ſinneth mortally.</p>
               <p>17. So the New Explications being ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
go off more and more from the
Truth; to enter into them was to throw one's
ſelf into a Labyrinth of Errors, which is not
yet finiſhed. The Author writes no Books
without producing ſome Novelty againſt
ſound Divinity: He ſeemed to have rejected
the <hi>involuntary</hi> he had admitted, in the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Holy Soul of Jeſus Chriſt; but it
is clearer than the day, that in his laſt Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
he re-eſtabliſhes that impious Doctrine:
I have made a Demonſtration of it, which I
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48044:62"/>
don't repeat; that is to ſay, he walks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Rule and Principle, according as his
preſent Occaſions puſh him.</p>
               <p>18. It is evident by ſuch Matters of Fact as theſe, that
we could not receive his Explications: It is therefore like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
evident, that we could not but reject the Book, nor be
hindered from diſowning publickly the Author, who had
publickly aſcribed to us the Doctrine of it. For what
could we do, or what could M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> adviſe us? to
hold our Peace it is to conſent: It is failing in an eſſential
part of the Epiſcopal Function, all the Grace whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in ſpeaking the Truth: It is ſo oppoſing our ſelves to
the Sentence of Pope St. <hi>Hoſmidas, Ipſe impellet in Errorem
qui non inſtruit ignorantes: He drives the Simple into Error,
who does not Inſtruct them:</hi> Eſpecially in ſuch a Caſe wherein
you are appeal'd to as a Witneſs, and your Name made
uſe of to deceive them. What then ſhall we ſpeak? it
is what we have done with all ſimplicity in our Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But, ſay they, it is an anticipated Cenſure: Not
at all; it is a Neceſſary Declaration of our Sentiments,
when we are forced to ſpeak them out. What obliged
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> to explain our Articles without our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?
to Cite us in our own Names, and laſtly to make
us believe, that his Book, where we found ſo many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
was but a more large Explication of our own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine?
is he allowed to undertake whatever he pleaſes,
and muſt we keep ſilent, tho' he goes on againſt us? Theſe
are not meer Pretexts, they are Reaſons clearer than the
Sun. M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> is no leſs unjuſt, when he ſays, that
we have denounced him: Sincerity would oblige him to
acknowledge, that he denounced himſelf by his Letter to
the Pope, when he deſires him to judge of his Book: No
Body had accuſed him, it is he who did himſelf the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to bring the Buſineſs before the Pope. We approved
of his Submiſſion, but we could not diſſemble that it was
without conſenting to his Doctrine.</p>
               <p>19. <hi>Why,</hi> ſays he, <hi>did you ſend your Declaration to</hi> Rome?
The anſwer is ready in every one's Mind. It is becauſe
his Book had been ſent thither, that he himſelf had ſent it
thither, and that he wrote to the Pope, that this Book
contained no other thing but our Doctrine: Does Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48044:63"/>
allow any Man to diſſemble in things ſo clear? but
the thing is, he had a mind to complain, tho' he had no
reaſon for it.</p>
               <p>20. Theſe Complaints are confuted by one word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they tend only to this, to ſay that we had a mind
to ruine M. <hi>de Cambray:</hi> God knows the contrary. But
without calling ſo great a Witneſs, the thing ſpeaks of
of it ſelf. Before his Book appeared, we conceal'd his
Errors, ſo far as to endure the Reproaches you have
heard of already: When the Books appear'd, he had
already ruined himſelf enough: If we have been willing
to ruine him, he concurred with us, by raiſing up all
the World againſt him by his ambitious Deciſions, and
by filling his Book with Errors ſo palpable, and with
ſo many unexcuſable Exceſſes.</p>
               <p>21. When he upbraids us, and me in particular, as
if he had propoſed it to us, that we ſhould by a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Letter beſeech the Pope, to order our Queſtion to be
judged without Noiſe by his Divines, and in the mean
time to keep ſilence: Firſt, he tells a thing of which I
never heard one Word, and ſo falſe that he himſelf ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
the chief Circumſtances, as has been ſeen from the
beginning of this Relation. It is beſides true, that the
Propoſal was impracticable: What he had imputed to
us, as to his Doctrine, was made publick in his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
in the Book of the Maxims of the Saints.
He had reiterated it without asking our Conſent, as he
owns it, and he repeated therein once or twice, that
his Doctrine was conformable to ours: Therefore
our Conſcience obliged us to diſown it as publickly, as
we had been appeal'd to as Witneſſes of it. In the third
place we made no queſtion of the Falſhood of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:
We held it determinately to be evil, and not to
be countenanced: This was not a particular Affair be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> and us: It was the Cauſe of the
Truth, and the Concern of the Church, which we could not
take upon our ſelves alone, nor treat it as a private Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
which M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> would have been at. Then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
he perſiſted invincibly, as he has done to impu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us his Thoughts, and would never retract it. We should
not ſave our ſelves, but by declaring our Sentiments to
all the World. This Declaration remained naturally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48044:63"/>
to the Pope, as all Particulars in matters of Faith
do; and preſenting it to him was as much as to ſubmit it
to him, but in the mean time we diſcharg'd our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and as much as we could, we rejected the Errors
which our Silence might have confirm'd.</p>

               <p>IF it be ſaid that we ſhould have tried all ways of Mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
before we had come to a Solemn Declaration;
this we did alſo. The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> has demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
it ſo clearly for himſelf, and for us, that I ſhould

               <p>2. But if any one has a Mind to be ſatisfied by his own
Eyes, as to the fairneſs of my Conduct; let him but
read the Writing I addreſſed to M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> before the
ſending of our Declaration. If the Reader thinks it tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to be referred to other Writings, and would find all
in this; here's in ſhort what I ſaid: That after ſo many
Writings, <hi>we muſt take a ſhorter way, and where alſo we
may explain our ſelves more preciſely, which is a Conference</hi>
Viva Voce; <hi>that this way was always uſed,</hi> and even
by the Apoſtles, as the moſt efficacious and gentle, to
agree about any thing, <hi>this being often propoſed him,</hi> I did
again propoſe it my ſelf by writing, <hi>upon condition to put
far away from me all manner of Contention, and to be declared
an Enemy of Peace,</hi> if on my ſide <hi>it was not amicable and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful.</hi>
As for what he ſeemed to fear my quickneſs, as
he called it, I alledged to him the Experience, not only
of my Conferences <hi>with the Miniſters, but alſo thoſe we had
ſometimes together upon this Occaſion, without having raiſed my
Voice ſo much as half a Note higher.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. If there were any Expedients to be found, they
could not but iſſue from ſuch Conferences, but I plac'd my
hope in another thing; I conceiv'd hope I ſay, from the
ſtrength of Truth, and from a perfect Acquaintance with
the Diſpoſition of M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> that I could bring him
again to right Principles; God is my Witneſs, <hi>clearly and
amicably, I durſt ſay ſo, certainly and without reply; in a few
Conferences, and perhaps in one only, and in loſs than two

               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48044:64"/>
4. <hi>All that M.</hi> de Cambray <hi>objected was, that I had en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gaged
my ſelf to anſwer to 24 Demands in Writing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
which I thought fit afterwards to defer, by reaſon ſaid I,</hi>
of the Equivocations <hi>of the 24 Demands, which would
take</hi> too much time to diſintangle, and by reaſon of the long
time that muſt have been employed in writing the Conſutations
and Proofs: <hi>Adding notwithſtanding, that</hi> I would readily
write all the Propoſition I ſhould have advanced in the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
if deſired; but that we were to begin at what was moſt
ſhort, moſt deciſive, and moſt expreſs, I added alſo moſt charitable;
nothing being able to ſupply Verbal Conference, and a lively tho'
plain Diſcourſe on the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the midſt of us,
when we ſhould be aſſembled in his Name to agree upon the Truth.</p>
               <p>5. Every body was amazed at the inflexible Refuſal of
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> during ſix Weeks, we have undeniable Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
for it, and they earneſtly deſired to have us confer
together. I refuſed no Conditions; a Clergy-man of
Note being moved, as every Body elſe was, with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
deſire of re-uniting the Biſhops, oblig'd me to give
my Word to agree to a Conference, where he ſhould be.
If he had told the Anſwer he brought me, to me alone;
perhaps we ſhould have left it with himſelf: It was in a
word, that M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> would not have it ſaid, that
he changed any thing by the Advice of M. <hi>de Meaux.</hi> If
this Prelate won't grant that this was his Anſwer, let
him make ſuch an one as he pleaſes; but we may ſee that
he cannot make any that's good. However, I my ſelf ſent
him the Writing, the Extracts whereof you have juſt
now heard: It is not long, one may read it over in leſs
than a quarter of an Hour, amongſt thoſe I have collected:
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> does not deny that he received it. Here's
five great Letters he addreſſes to me, where he only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
me for having ſaid in my Writing, that I <hi>bore
him in my Bowels;</hi> he does not believe it poſſible for a
Man <hi>to bear in his Bowels,</hi> ſuch as he reproves for the ſake
of the Truth, nor to deplore their State, but by ſhedding
artificial Tears to tear them the more in pieces. Why
did he not come to the Conference, to try the Strength of
ſuch brotherly Tears and Diſcourſes, which Charity, I
dare ſay ſo, the Truth had inſpired us with. We expected
three Weeks the effect of that new Invitation, and the
Declaration was not ſent, 'till at laſt we had made uſe of
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48044:64"/>
all the mild ways imaginable, of which Declaration we
muſt yet ſpeak a Word.</p>

Summa Doctrinae.</head>
               <p>1. THey complain it is too ſevere, but the Arch-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
of <hi>Park</hi> has truly affirmed, that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Cambray</hi> has been very much ſpared therein.
We have there kept under ſilence, thoſe Temptations of
a particular kind, which cannot be reſiſted, and of which
we could not forbear to ſpeak in another place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we had kept nuder Silence thoſe Compliances of
<hi>Ingenuous Souls upon humbling things</hi> indefinitely, <hi>which
ſhould be commanded them:</hi> The Deprivation not only of <hi>all
Comfort,</hi> but alſo <hi>of all Liberty; that readineſs to forſake all,
and the way it ſelf, that teaches this readineſs: That Diſpoſition
without bounds, to all the practices laid upon them,</hi> and that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
forgetfulneſs <hi>of their Experiences, of their Readings,
of the Perſons they have formerly conſulted with confidence:</hi>
Laſtly, We there kept under ſilence <hi>the Poſſeſſions, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions,
and other extraordinary things,</hi> which the Author
had given us, as <hi>belonging to the interior ways:</hi> It is known
what uſe the falſe Spiritualiſts make of it, as well as of
other things juſt now mentioned. M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> himſelf
inſinuates it, and we receive little Comfort in hearing him
ſay, that the way of <hi>pure Love and pure Faith</hi> that he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
is that <hi>wherein you ſhall ſee leſs of it</hi> than in others; as
if nothing were to be done here, but to conſider the more
or the leſs, and that he ought not to have explained him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
more expreſly againſt ſuch abominations.</p>
               <p>2. The Author objects continually, that we have not
taken Notice of his Correctives, wherewith he will have
his Book to be fuller than any other Book whatever; that
is the very thing we complained of: We thought it an
Unhappineſs for a book of that Nature, to have ſo many
Correctives, as it is for a Rule to need too many Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
The Truth is more ſimple, and that which muſt
be ſo often modified, diſcovers naturally an ill Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He had nothing to do, but to explain himſelf ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
as he had promiſed: Whatſoever he hath ſaid upon
the abſolute Sacrifice, has only afforded Difficulties in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48044:65"/>
Article of the impoſſible Suppoſitions, therefore he ſhould
have omitted thoſe Correctives, which ſerve only to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the evil; for inſtance, the dangerous Corrective
of the Perſwaſion, not <hi>inward but apparent,</hi> which ſerves
only to excuſe the Language of <hi>Molinos,</hi> as has been ſhewed
elſewhere. All impartial Readers acknowledge, that theſe
Correctives are but ſo many Perplexities, fit to make Men
mad, and we have ſeen enough to make us ſenſible of the
Snares, that ignorant People meet with in the obſcurity of
that Book, which promiſed ſo much plainneſs, and neatly
to cut off all Equivocations.</p>
               <p>3. One of the things they cry up moſt as an excellent
Corrective, is the falſe Articles, where 'tis true, M. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray</hi>
condemns the falſe Myſtical Divines, the Arch-biſhop
of <hi>Paris</hi> has diſcovered the Subtilty of it; a Man entangles
himſelf naturally, when he will not condemn what he
dares not defend openly. In another place he overſtrains
Quietiſm, the better to paſs over the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.
What<note n="*" place="margin">Max. Art 2. faux <hi>p.</hi> 31, 32.</note> Quietiſm has ever <hi>conſented

good? To carry the renouncing of one's ſelf ſo far, by an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hatred of our Soul, which ſuppoſe it to be evil in its nature,
according to the principle of the Manichees?</hi> When we ſhoot
at this rate, we ſhoot at random, we paſs over the body,
and after the manner of the Poets, endeavour to ſatisfie
the juſt averſion of the faithful againſt Quietiſm, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:48044:65"/>
Sorbonne, which ſays, <hi>that the</hi> Janſeniſts <hi>have joyned with
the Biſhop of</hi> Meaux <hi>againſt M.</hi> de Cambray, <hi>and that the
other Biſhops have united againſt him, as againſt another</hi> Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna,
<hi>becauſe he would not come into their Cabal, and joyn in
their miſchievous Deſigns.</hi> The ſame Writing magnſſies
M. <hi>de Cambray,</hi> as a <hi>Neceſſary Perſon to maintain the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Holy See againſt the Biſhops, and therefore it behooveth
her not to ſuffer ſuch an able advocate to be oppreſt.</hi> In other
places we are called Enemies to the Monks, whoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> is. We may ſee by this, what En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines
he has ſet on work. But the Pope who governs the
Church of God, will not ſuffer any thing to leſſen the
Glory of the Clergy of <hi>France,</hi> who have been always ſo
obedient to the Holy See. The Truth does not maintain
it ſelf by Lies, and as for the Monks, in what Dioceſſes
of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> are they more fatherly dealt with than in
ours? Perhaps M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> will ſay, that all this is
ſpoken without his Order; but I leave it to the prudent
Reader to judge, whether in an Accuſation ſo viſibly falſe,
which equally concerns Religion and the State, and the
Reputation of the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> that make ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
a part of the Epiſcopacy, it would be enough
ſimply to diſown with his Mouth, ſuppoſe he had done
it, ſuch manifeſt Calumnies, after they have had their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
upon certain Perſons: And whether Juſtice and
Truth require not a more Expreſs and more Authentick
Declaration.</p>
               <p>2. They boaſt mightily in thoſe Writings of the great
Number of Biſhops and Doctors that favour the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> and that nothing
but fear hinders them from declaring themſelves; they
ſhould at leaſt name one, but they dare not; the Biſhops
have not been infected, and M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> cannot cite
for his Opinion any one Doctor of Note.</p>
               <p>3. Amongſt other things, that the Arch-biſhop ſeems
to have moſt Reaſon to reproach me for, this is one,
that he deſerved not to be treated with, ſeeing he hath
ſubmitted after the ſame manner the <hi>Pelagians</hi> are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
As if it were not known, that theſe Hereticks have
for a long time acted the part of ſuch as had ſubmitted,
even to the Holy See. I wiſh nothing more than to ſee
M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> ſeparated from ſuch as have made an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48044:66"/>
Submiſſion; but to ſpeak ſincerely and in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
can any Man be content with the Demand
which that Prelate, notwithſtanding his former Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
would make of the Pope, to determine the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
in which he was to pronounce Judgment, as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
it in his Letter of the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1697. It is
true, that in a following Letter he ſpeaks theſe words:
<hi>God forbid I ſhould preſcribe a Law to my Superior: My pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Subſcribing, and to publiſh a Mandate conformable
thereunto, is abſolute and without Reſtriction.</hi> What meant
then thoſe words in the Letter of the <hi>3d.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt? I
ſhall only deſire of the Pope, that he would be pleaſed to mark
preciſely the Errors he Condemns, and the Senſe in which he
Condemns them, to the end that my Subſcription may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Reſtriction.</hi> Without that then the Reſtriction is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable:
But this is to put the Pope and the Church
upon impoſſiblities. There ſhould never have been any
Deciſion, if this Church muſt have foreſeen all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which the vitious fertility of ſubtle Wits could have
produced: At this rate we ſhould neither have had
the <hi>Homouſion</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> nor the <hi>Theotows</hi> of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> We
ſee then that the <hi>Moderate Wiſdom of St.</hi> Paul is to be
followed, otherwiſe we ſhall fall into vain and undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Queſtions, forbid by that Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>4. They may ſay perhaps, that M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> retracts
that abſurd Propoſition in his Second Letter: But it is
not ſo; ſeeing he continues to demand, that the Pope
<hi>ſhould be pleaſed to Mark every Propoſition worthy of Cenſure,
with the preciſe Senſe upon which the Cenſure is to fall.</hi>
This is again to replunge himſelf into impoſſibilities, by
which all Eccleſiaſtical Deciſions are eluded. If M. <hi>de
Cambray</hi> declares that he will ſubmit, and <hi>that no body ſhall
ever ſee him, whatever happens, neither write nor ſpeak to
evade the Condemnation of his Work: It is at the ſame time</hi>
in declaring <hi>that he will Content himſelf to demand of the
Pope a particular Inſtruction upon the Errors he is to reject.</hi>
On that Condition he proteſts he will be quiet, both as
to the Matter of Right and Fact: But it is after having
before hand declared to the whole Univerſe, that he is
ſo far from being quiet within, he will not ceaſe to make
inſtances to the Pope to make him ſay other things than
what he decides.</p>

this is carrying the Suſpition too far: But in the mean
time I only repeat the words of the two printed Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> denyes not: However I pray
to God that he may keep to the general Terms of his

               <p>1. WE have been Oblig'd then in fine to reveal the
falſe Myſteries of our days: Here you have
it in ſhort, ſuch as it has appeared in the former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes:
A New Propheteſs has undertaken to raiſe up
again the <hi>Guide</hi> of <hi>Molinos,</hi> and the Prayer which he
teaches therein: It is with this Spirit ſhe is fill'd: The
Myſterious Woman of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> it is with this
Child ſhe is bigg: The Work of this Woman is not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed;
we are come to the Times which ſhe calls Times
of Perſecution, when the Martyrs, as ſhe ſays, of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt ſhall ſuffer. The time ſhall come, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to her we are at the brink of it, when the Reign
of the Holy Ghoſt and of Prayer, whereby ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
her own, which is that of <hi>Molinos,</hi> ſhall be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
with a Train of Wonders, that ſhall amaze the
Univerſe: From thence comes that Communication of
Graces; from thence comes it that a Woman has the
power of binding and unbinding. It is evidently true,
that ſhe has forgot what ſhe has Subſcribed before me,
and before others more conſiderable, upon the Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
both of her Books, and of the Doctrine contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therein. Every Biſhop ought to give an Account in
Convenient time, of what the Diſpoſition of the Divine
Providence has put in his Hand: Therefore I have been
conſtrained to explain, that the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
a Man of that Dignity, is fallen into that unhappy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,
and has made himſelf the Defender, tho' by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
ways, of that Woman and her Books.</p>
               <p>2. He will not ſay, that he knew not that prodigious
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48044:67"/>
and non-ſenſical Communication of Graces, nor ſo many
pretended Prophecies, nor the pretended apoſtolical
Miſſion of that Woman, when he has ſuffer'd her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own Confeſſion, to be eſteemed by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great Perſons who put a Confidence in him as to Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Conſcience. He had then ſuffer'd a Woman to be
eſteemed, who Propheſied according to the Deluſions of
her Heart. His great Intimacy with that Woman, was
grounded upon her Spirituality, and this was the only
Bond of their Correſpondence: This is what we have
ſeen writ with his own Hand, after which we have no
reaſon to be amazed at his having undertaken the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of her Books.</p>
               <p>3. It was to defend them that he wrote ſo many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
before thoſe that were choſen Arbitrators; nor
is it neceſſary for me to repreſent the long Extracts of
'em I have yet by me, ſeeing the ſubſtance of 'em is to
be found in the Book of the Maxims of the Saints.</p>
               <p>4. That he might have a Pretext for defending thoſe
pernicious Books, the Text whereof he himſelf thought
could not be maintained, he muſt have recourſe to a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſenſe, which that Woman has diſcover'd to him; he
muſt ſay, that he has explained thoſe Books better than
the Books explained themſelves; the Senſe that naturally
offers, is not the true Seſe: It is but a rigorous Senſe,
which he aſſures us ſhe never thought on; ſo that to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them well, we muſt read the thoughts of their
Author; we muſt gueſs what is known to M. of <hi>Cambray</hi>
only, and judge of Words by Words by Sentiments, and not of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
by Words: The moſt non-ſenſical in the Books of
that Woman is a Myſtical Language, for which the Prelate
is our Security; that her Errors are meer Equivocations,
her Exceſſes are innocent Exagerations, like unto thoſe
of the Fathers, and of approved Myſticks.</p>
               <p>5. Theſe are the Thoughts of this great Prelate, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Books of M. <hi>Guyon,</hi> after having, if we may beleive
him, examin'd them unto the utmoſt rigor; this is what
he has writ with his own hand, ſome time before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of his Book; and after ſo many Cenſures we have
not for all that, been able to draw from him a real Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation
of thoſe Evil Books: On the contrary, it was
to ſave them, that he ſpared the <hi>Guide</hi> of <hi>Molinos,</hi> which
is the Original of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:48044:67"/>
6. Yet notwithſtanding all the Mittigations in the Book
of the Maxims of the Saints, we may ſtill find therein
M. <hi>Guyon</hi> and <hi>Molinos</hi> too weakly dignified not to be
known; and if I ſay further, that the Work of an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
and Enthuſiaſtical Woman, and that of M. <hi>de Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray,</hi>
have manifeſtly one and the ſame Deſign; I ſhall
ſay no more after all, but what appears of it ſelf.</p>
               <p>7. I ſhall not ſay it, but after having tried to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,
what Meekneſs and Charity could do, we us'd no
Tricks as to the Submiſſion of M. <hi>Guyon:</hi> We admitted
them with a well-meaning mind, (I ſhall make uſe of
this Word) and preſuming always on her Sincerity and
Obedience, we conſulted the Honour of her Name, of her
Family, of her Friends, and of her Perſon, as much as
was poſſible; nothing has been omitted to convert her,
and nothing was cenſured but her Errors and ill Books.</p>
               <p>8. As for the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> we have but
too well juſtified our ſelves by the undeniable matters of
Fact contain'd in this Relation; as to my own particular,
I am juſtify'd more than I wiſh I were: But in order to
confute all the unjuſt Reproaches of that Prelate, we were
under a Neceſſity, not only to diſcover part of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of Fact, but to have the whole, as far as the Source:
By which, if I may ſay ſo, it appears from the beginning,
that we have endeavoured to follow the motions of that
<hi>Meek and Patient Charity, which</hi> neither <hi>ſuſpects nor thinks
any evil:</hi> Our Silence was inſuperable, till M. <hi>de Cambray</hi>
declared himſelf by his Book. Nay, we had Patience to
the utmoſt, ſo that notwithſtanding his obſtinate Refuſal
of all Conference, we did not declare our ſelves 'till the
Extremity. Where will he fix the Jealouſie he accuſes
us of without Proof, and if we muſt clear our ſelves of
ſo mean a Paſſion, what were we jealous of in the New
Book of that Arch-biſhop? Did we envy him the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of defending and ſetting forth M. <hi>Guyon</hi> and <hi>Moli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi>
with fine Colours? Did we bear an Envy to the Style
of an ambiguous Book, or to the Credit it gave to its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
whoſe Glory on the contrary was thereby buried?
I am aſhamed for the Friends of <hi>M. de Cambray,</hi> who
make Profeſſion of Piety, and yet have, without any
ground, publiſhed every where, and even as far as <hi>Rome,</hi>
that ſome private Intereſt has ſet me at Work. How
ſtrong ſoever the Reaſons be, which I could produce in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:48044:68"/>
my Defence; God puts no other Anſwer into my Heart,
but that the Defenders of the Truth, as they ought to be
free from all ſelf-intereſt, they ought no leſs to be above
the fear of that Reproach, to be accounted ſelf-intereſted
Perſons. However, I am not againſt their believing,
that Intereſt has provok'd me againſt that Book, if ſo be
that there is nothing worthy of Reproof in its Doctrine,
nor any thing that may be favourable to the Woman,
whoſe Deluſions muſt be made manifeſt. God has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
that againſt my Will, they ſhould put into my
Hands thoſe Books that are Evidences of it: God was
willing that the Church ſhould in the Perſon of a Biſhop,
a living Witneſs of that Prodigy of Error: It is only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible
Neceſſity obliges me to diſcover it, when they
continue ſo wilfully blind in their Error, as to force me
to declare all: When not being ſatisfied to triumph, they
will needs inſult: When God on the other hand, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſo many things that were kept ſecret. I take great
care, not to impute to M. <hi>de Cambray</hi> any other Deſign,
but that which he has diſcovered by his Hand-writing, by
his Book, by his Anſwers, and by ſeveral undeniable
matters of Fact: This is enough and too much, that he
ſhould be ſo open a Protector of a Woman that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and who propoſes to her ſelf the ſeducing of the whole
Univerſe. If they ſay this is too hard againſt a Woman,
whoſe Errors ſeem to be the effect of madneſs. I will grant
it, if that madneſs be not a pure Fanaticiſm; and if the
Spirit of Seducing did not work in that Woman, and if
this <hi>Priſcilla</hi> has not met her <hi>Montanus</hi> to defend her.</p>
               <p>9. If in the mean time the Weak are ſcandalized; if
the Libertines triumph; if they ſay, without enquiring
into the Source of the miſchief, that the Quarrels of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
are implacable: It is true, if it be underſtood, that
they are really points of revealed Doctrine. This is the
Proof of the Truth of our Religion, and of the Divine
Revelation which guides us, that Queſtions upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith are never to be accomodated. We can
ſuffer every thing, but cannot endure any Evaſions or
Shifts, how little ſoever, upon the Principles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
If thoſe Diſputes be of no conſequence, as Men
of the World would have it, we muſt ſay with <hi>Gallio,</hi>
Proconſul of <hi>Achaia,</hi> which was the higheſt Dignity of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in her Provinces: <hi>O Jews, if the thing
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48044:68"/>
in queſtion was ſome Injuſtice, or ſome ill action, or ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of importance, I ſhould think my ſelf obliged to hear you
Patiently: But this regards only to ſome Points of your Doctrine,
and Diſputes of Words, and touching your Law: Decide your
Differences among your ſelves as well as you can:</hi> As tho'
he ſaid, Fight amongſt your ſelves about this Matter as
long as ye pleaſe, <hi>I won't be the Judge of it.</hi> And in
effect the Jews <hi>beat</hi> Soſtheneo <hi>even before the Tribunal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>
Gallio's <hi>taking the leaſt Notice of it.</hi> This is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Politick World, and of worldly Men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Diſputes of Religion; which holding as of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
they think it enough to ſay, that the Heat of the
Biſhops is too great: But (a thing very different in all
reſpects from <hi>Gallio</hi>) if a great King, full of Piety, won't
become the Judge of thoſe Matters, it is not out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt;
it is out of reſpect for the Church to whom
God has given the Right to judge of it: Yet what is
there New here, and which hath not been always pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
by his auguſt Predeceſſors, and all Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to protect the Biſhops who walk in a beaten Path,
and according to the Solid and ancient Rule?</p>
               <p>10. We wiſh, and we hope ſpeedily to ſee the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Cambray</hi> acknowledge at leaſt the Unprofitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his Speculations. It did not become him, the
Title he bears, the part he acted in the World, nor his
Reputation and his Wit, to defend the Books and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of a Woman of that ſort. As for the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
he has invented, let him remember of his having
agreed, that he finds none of them in the Scripture: He
quotes not one paſſage of them for his New Doctrine:
He Names the Fathers, and ſome other Clergy-men,
whom he endeavours to draw after him by Conſequence,
but wherein he finds neither her abſolute Sacrifice, nor
her ſimple Acquieſcency; nor her Contemplation from
whence Jeſus Chriſt is abſent by <hi>Eſtate;</hi> nor her extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
Temptations that ſhe muſt yield to; nor her
actual Grace, which makes us to know the Will of good
Pleaſure on all Occaſions and Events; nor her natural
Charity, which is not the Theological Virtue; nor her
Concupiſcence, which without being Virtuous is the root
of all Vices; nor her pure Concupiſcence, which is,
tho' Sacrilegious, the Preparation to Juſtice; nor her
dangerous Separation of the two parts of the Soul, after

the example of Jeſus Chriſt involuntarily troubled; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

her unhappy return to that involuntary trouble; nor
her Natural Love, which he reforms every day, inſtead
of rejecting it wholly once for all, as equally uſeleſs
and dangerous in the uſe he makes of it; nor her other
Propoſitions which we have mentioned, they are the
fruit of vain Logick, of extravagant Metaphyſicks, and
of a vain Philoſophy, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> has condemned.
We hear every day his beſt Friends bewailing him, that
he ſhould have ſhewed his Learning, and exerciſed his
Eloquence upon Subjects of no Solidity at all. Does he
not ſee, with his Abſtractions he is ſo far from inſpiring
the Love of God into Men, that he does but dry up their
Hearts, by weakning the Motives capahle of ſoftning or
enflaming them? The vain Subtleties wherewith he da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zles
the World, have alwayes been the Subject of the
Churches groans. I will not enumerate to him all ſuch
as have been deceived by their fine Curious Wit; I ſhall
Name him only one, in the Ninth Age, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>John
Scot</hi> born at <hi>Aire,</hi> whom the Saints of his time upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(tho' 'tis true in another Subject) with vain Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,
wherein he alledged that Religion and Piety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted.
It was by reaſon of this that the Fathers of the
Council of <hi>Valence</hi> ſaid, that in thoſe unhappy times he
accumulated their Labours, he and his followers, in
propoſing frivolous Queſtions; <hi>ineptas queſtiunculas;</hi> in
authorizing empty Viſions; <hi>aniles Fabulas;</hi> in refining
upon Spirituality; and to ſpeak with thoſe Fathers, it
