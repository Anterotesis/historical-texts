            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thinke that no man is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
vnleſſe he be altogether
a ſtranger to worldly affaires,
that many haue written ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things touching the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
perſons in Learning, or
Warre, whom this our Age
hath brought forth, as alſo
touching the ſundry occurrences befallen in this
bleſſed Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> as alſo in <hi>France, Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
and the higher and lower <hi>Germany:</hi> But in ſo
great a number of ancient and Moderne Writers,
I doe wonder there hath beene none, that as yet
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6316:3"/>
hath particularly ſet ſorth that cruell butchery of
good men, made in the Kingdome of <hi>France,</hi> in the
yeare 1572. on <hi>Bartholmew</hi> day. Truely, if I knew
it had beene done by any (though it were but by
ſnatches, or in parts, and peeces) I had rather be
ſilent, after the paſſage of ſo many yeares, then
bring forth any thing vnſeaſonably, that might ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
breed offence to your Lordſhip, or the <hi>Reader.</hi>
But (as I haue formerly ſaid) ſeeing I am fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded,
there is none that already hath purpoſely
dealt in this Argument, I deemed it as free, and as
lawfull for me as for others, to runne in this race,
and in this Field to make tryall of my ſlender
ability.</p>
            <p>Let it pleaſe you therefore (my good Lord) at this
time, when others out of a plentifull &amp; rich harueſt
haue brought to this <hi>Bartholmew</hi> Faire abundance
and ſtore enough of fruit; That I, out of my little,
barren, and poore Garden, may with a pure heart
and hand offer a few leaues to your liking. And I
beſeech you vouch ſafe to aſſiſt and further me with
your honourable good will, and fauour, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
and diſcouery of this buſineſſe, according to
your accuſtomed piety, and your remarkeable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Learning ſo famouſed both in your owne
Countrey, as alſo in forraigne.</p>
            <p>Since then the whole matter is ſo plaine and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to all good men, and of vpright iudgement,
it ſhall not be amiſſe, if in the beginning wee ſeeke
out the cauſe from whence ſo hainous and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
an Act proceeded. It is certaine (if wee may
beleeue <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his Commentaries) that the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:6316:3"/>
Nation was of old ſo fierce and cruell, that they did
be-ſmeare euen their <hi>Altars</hi> with humane blood,
they would hale and teare innocent and harmeleſſe
men to be ſacrificed: Nay more, that robberies and
out-rages, done out of the Walles and borders of
their Cittie, they did not account diſhoneſt, or to
be blamed. But from the time that it was once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by lawes, and worthy diſcipline, and that it
learned to obey one King, it preſently fell from that
rude and barbarous kinde of life to humanity, and
Ciuility; So as at this inſtant we may truly, and
not vnfitly terme <hi>Fraunce, the Mother of Ciutill cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,</hi>
and that from our ſelues, by our owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
But before I wade further into other things,
me thinks this one cauſe ſhould be firſt chiefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
namely, from whence that Nation (once
ſo cruell and ſauage, and now ſtyled with the praiſe
of <hi>Courteſie</hi> and <hi>Ciuility</hi>)
ſhould draw the matter and
ground-worke of this wicked and perfidious deed
we now ſpeake of? And more; what ſhould moue
<hi>Charles</hi> their King, then of greene and tender yeres,
(from whom nothing but Acts of glory and Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
were expected, both in regard of his excellent
forwardneſſe, as of his moſt Royall diſpoſition
both in body and minde,) that he ſhould ſo fauour
theſe men, which vnder the pretext and counterfait
zeale of ancient <hi>Religion,</hi> bring about and compaſſe
any thing with the ſimple people? From hence it is
that theſe griefes ariſe; by this onely bait was King
<hi>Charles</hi> caught; by theſe circumſtances and by-wayes
was that Prince led and miſſe-led, being in
his firſt yeares Noble, milde, and gentle; That hee
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6316:4"/>
(with griefe I ſpeake it) in whom (as <hi>Buchanan</hi> the
Prince of Poets in our age, ſaith godly and truely)
the Image of the moſt high God ought to be, and
ſhine, ſhould abandon himſelfe to wickedneſſe and
villany, and all manner of impudency and periury.
But that Chriſt (the mouth of <hi>Truth)</hi> hath fore-told
it ſhould be ſo, that <hi>Religion,</hi> which ſhould be the
bond of Peace and Society, yet often through the
ſubtilty of Sathan, and malice of men, proueth the
occaſion and matter of vproares, debate, and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults.
And verily, he that writ this, writ not vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
neither did hee write toyes or fables when hee
ſaid,—</p>
            <q>
               <hi>Quod ſaepius lim</hi>
               <l>Relligio peperit ſceleroſa atque impia facta.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>That Religion of yore hath brought.</l>
               <l>Forth, deeds vile, wicked and nought.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And in another place;</p>
            <q>
               <l>Tantum Relligio potuit ſuadere malorum.</l>
            </q>
            <q>
               <l>Religion hath the skill</l>
               <l>To perſwade to much ill.</l>
            </q>
            <p>But that we may come to the purpoſe, and our
ſpeech may returne from whence it hath digreſſed,
he is farre out of the way that perſwades himſelfe,
or imagineth, that this deed ſo deteſtable was bred
or forged in any other place, then in the ſhop of the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Anuile</hi> of all wickedneſſe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe,
it is not to be thought that this Pylote
ſate alone at the Helme in this Shippe, (ſo fully
fraught with all impiety) but that he had Mariners,
and Sea-faring fellowes enow of that ſort, carefully
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6316:4"/>
trained vp in any villany. For firſt, what parts in
this Act and deed may not the Conſpiracie of the
<hi>Councell</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> challenge to it ſelfe? What Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in this Army doth not the encouragement of
the <hi>Cardinals</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> lead? What hath not
the furie and rage of the cut-throat <hi>Ieſuits</hi> attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in theſe Tents and fields of vngodlineſſe? who
make their daily vowes and prayers to ſpill the life
and bloud of godly Kings and Princes, eſpecially of
thoſe, which either in words or deeds deny to yeeld
any duty or homage to this rauenous Wolfe of
<hi>Rome.</hi> And that nothing (forſooth) might be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
there was added to this <hi>Councell,</hi> (and ſo holy
Congregation) the <hi>Councell</hi> deuiſed and aduiſed by
that Family which long ſince hath ſo greedily thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
after the bloud of good and godly men, which
when I name to be the family of <hi>Guyſe,</hi> I doe euen
in one breath ſhut vp the many, yea the infinite mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
and calamities of <hi>France:</hi> This is that family
that inſtructed the King in all the wicked principles
of <hi>Craft</hi> &amp; <hi>Deceipt,</hi> and egg'd him on to that foule &amp;
moſt abhominable deed. This is that, which had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
haue all <hi>France</hi> vtterly to ſinke and periſh, then
ſee (much leſſe indure) any great man to reſide in
the Kings Court, who hath been either noted to be
of Religion reformed, or accounted famous for lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and vertue. Of this family (ſo praiſe-worthy)
not any vnprofitable or baſe and vnworthy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
but the very <hi>Head</hi> was that notable and Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<hi>Cardinall,</hi> whom whoſoeuer it was that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
with a certaine Councellour of the Emperour
<hi>Decius,</hi> did him right, of whom the <hi>Eccleſiaſticall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6316:5"/>
Hiſtorie</hi> writeth, that hee was called <hi>The Miniſter of
the Deuill,</hi> becauſe (farre worſe, and more miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
then the <hi>Emperour</hi> himſelfe) he ſtirred vp and
incenſed as many as he could againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
This is that ſcarlet <hi>Cardinall,</hi> whom one termed
(not vnfitly) <hi>The Cateline of our time,</hi> that by fraude
or treacheries, by right or wrong, omitted not to
inuent a thouſand meanes of doing miſchiefe.</p>
            <q>
               <l>He would reioyce and take a great delight,</l>
               <l>If he could once draw Brethren euen to fight.</l>
            </q>
            <p>All his felicity was to fill houſholds full of batred
and enmity, that purpled hindge and proppe of the
<hi>Romaine Biſhop,</hi> left nothing vndone that might cut
aſunder the conditions of <hi>Peace,</hi> and might nouriſh
the ſeeds of warre, and diſcords, or giue fuell to
the fire of factions, vproares, and murthers. To
conclude, in that very deed, that vaſſaile of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt</hi>
might ſhew there is no miſchiefe or attempt
ſo fowle or hatefull, which hath not iſſued from out
the Popes roofe. There is nothing in this Clergy
ſound or vnſpotted; Nothing ſo holy or ſanctified,

impoſtures, and wicked practiſes of this Scarlet-Prelate,
ſhall liue to the memory of <hi>Poſteritie,</hi> ſo long
as the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> world endures. This Man forſooth,
and Men of the ſame coate (whoſe hearts harbour
nothing but wicked thoughts and purpoſes) will be
the light of the world, and not the ſpight; the band,
and not the fire-brand; the beſt, and not the beaſts;
Theſe (I ſay) will be the Salt of the earth, who not
onely haue that little they haue vnſauory, and vnfit
for vſe, but as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſayes of <hi>Cateline,</hi> which is
worſe, are of an euill and peruerſe diſpoſition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent,
vndermyning, and changeable: Theſe (to
be ſhort) are thoſe good Shepheards which endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor
not to teach &amp; feed their flock, but are no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
entred into holy Orders, but are giuen to ciuill

their ſheepe, and (as I may ſpeake with <hi>Homer)</hi> to
weaue deceipts; or as <hi>Plautus</hi> ſayes, neatly to frame
tales and entrappings for them. And this (I warrant
you) gets them great praiſe. Let men of vpright
iudgement cenſure theſe things, and if they be ſilent
and will not, the very ſtones will ſpeake in many
Prouninces of <hi>France</hi> eſpecially, as alſo in the greateſt
part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Spaine,</hi> where the
Popes crafts are not yet diſcouered, but by the iuſt
iudgement of God, lye ſtill lurking, and vnreuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
Which notwithſtanding, that in their due time
they may be brought to light, in ſpight of Sathan
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6316:6"/>
and the wicked-minded, <hi>Time,</hi> nay, God himſelfe
will bring about. Howſoeuer let this be throughly
imprinted in all mens minds, that there is neuer any
thing more cruell, or more working, then is <hi>Idolatry,</hi>
or the falſe worſhip of God, which as often as it is
voyde of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> ſeekes to maintaine it
ſelfe by force, fire, and ſword, and by all meanes to
bereaue the true worſhippers of God, of the goods
and wealth they poſſeſſe; of the life and breath they
draw; of the light they enioy. Neither let any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
here, or be diſmayd, that this both is and was
from time to time, and is like to be ſtill, the lot of the
<hi>Church,</hi> which, as the kingly <hi>Prophet</hi> witneſſeth, hath
from her <hi>Youth</hi> vpwards beene afflicted with many
diſtreſſes, vexed with iniuries and revilements, and
toſſed with many ſtormes and tempeſts: Yet let not
any man be in this hereſie, that hee iudge the true
<hi>Religion,</hi> which we learne out of the <hi>Olde</hi> and <hi>New
Teſtament,</hi> to be the cauſe of warres, vproares,

the <hi>Truth,</hi> through the malice of men, and of

doe I write contrarieties; for here I meane the true

which out of <hi>Lucretius</hi> we haue noted to be wicked,
turbulent, and quarelſome, nor that <hi>Religion</hi> ſo ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

whither, ſince through the goodneſſe of God, the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6316:6"/>
light of the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> and true <hi>Religion</hi> hath cleerely
ſhined, the rage and outrage of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> kingdome

haue not come innumerable lyes, menaces, &amp;
hatreds againſt the <hi>Churches</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> yet it was
ſo. For (to confirme this our obſeruation) as ſoone
as (King <hi>Henry</hi> being dead) the Churches in <hi>France,</hi>
which were neglected afflicted, and oppreſſed, and
lay in obſcurity, began to peere out, and riſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
that Arch-worke-maſter of all deceipt and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe,
that Factor for the <hi>Romane Biſhop,</hi> the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall</hi>
of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> (whom a while ſince wee haue
ſomewhat deciphered) that he might make all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
way to his impious deeds and Tyranny, and
might purchaſe Power ouer the life and goods of
ſuch as were good men, began to driue all thoſe
from the Kings Court, whom he thought able to
croſſe his faction, or withſtand his godleſſe and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
attempts, and behaued himſelfe with ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
and inſolence againſt the <hi>Peeres,</hi> and other <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>
of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that they conſulted together how
they might ſuppreſſe the immeaſurable ambition
of this Man, and of his whole family; wherupon did
ariſe many grieuous and deadly ryots and inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
as well at <hi>Amboyſe,</hi> as elſewhere in <hi>Fraunce.</hi>
Then did hee hereupon ſcandalize the Churches,
and the chiefe Men and Rulers of the true <hi>Religion,</hi>
with inſpeakeable calumniations. Then did hee
burthen them with lyes, ſlanders and deceipts; nay,
that this deſperate miſcreant and out-caſt-wretch,
might not ouerſlip any nefarious enterpriſe, he did
then charge them with many faigned and deuiſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6316:7"/>
offences. It is ſurely a thing worth the telling, to
ſhew with what wiles and tricks this <hi>Cardinall</hi> could
leade and miſſe-leade a number of people: For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
as once the <hi>Iewes</hi> were, in ſcorne, called of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Sabbotheans;</hi> and the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> of <hi>Iulian</hi>
the <hi>Apoſtata,</hi> the <hi>Galileans:</hi> Euen ſo then, they
which imbraced the true Doctrine, that they might
be accuſed as of ſtrange errours before the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> holy-dayes, were begun to be
called <hi>Hugenets;</hi> which in-auſpitious name, firſt
found and inuented by an vnfortunate and accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Man, ſticke in the memory of the people of
<hi>France;</hi> Fye vpon both the manner and matter of
a wicked deed, and wicked ſeed: Neuertheleſſe, let
vs ſee vpon what ground-worke this ridiculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe
is founded, and that the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> and his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates,
are buſied rather in any other thing, than
in reading and meditating the holy Scriptures.
Thus therefore it is that this honeſt man would
haue them named <hi>Hugonets,</hi> of a certaine viſion,
which about that time in the night neere vnto the
Towne of <hi>Tiſrwin,</hi> the common people (that beaſt
of many heads) beleeued to wander vp and downe:
And now my friends can you forbeare laughing?
It was thought to be the Ghoſt of a certaine Monke
called <hi>Hugh,</hi> lately deceaſed, and becauſe in thoſe
times the Chriſtians, through perſecutions, were
compelled to keepe their meetings in the night, hee
cauſed them to be named <hi>Hugonets.</hi> Whileſt theſe
things were in doing, and that not one in the whole
kingdome was found that durſt take in hand the
cauſe godly men, &amp; of the afflicted Church, our
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6316:7"/>
Lord God euen beyond all hope &amp; expectation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed
that moſt honourable and valiant Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Caſpar Caligni,</hi> high Admirall of <hi>France,</hi> with the
ſpirit of <hi>fortitude</hi> and incredible <hi>zeale,</hi> ſo as with an
vndaunted courage, in the very middeſt of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults
and vproares, he preſented a Confeſſion of
their faith to the King himſelfe, <hi>Francis</hi> the ſecond,
in the name of the reformed Churches in <hi>Fraunce,</hi>
and pleaded their cauſe with wonderfull wiſedome
and ſtoutneſſe, at the Kings <hi>Priuie Councell Table,</hi> in
the Tower called <hi>Callirrhoe.</hi> This deed of his, how
much hatred and enuie it purchaſed vnto him,
(though otherwiſe a man in high fauour with the
King) cannot eaſily be expreſſed. After this, all the
rowte and crue of the Popelings made him their
onely marke to ſhoote at: He was the man whom
they aſſalted with all their weapons: He the Prince
on whom thoſe wicked and loathed ſociety caſt all
their reproaches and contumelies: Aboue the reſt
the family of the <hi>Guyſes</hi> were neuer wearied with
rolling this ſtone, and aduancing this abhominable
and prodigious deſigne, that it might glut it ſelfe
with the <hi>French</hi> blood, for which it thirſted, and
might alone gouerne all the affaires of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
They haue in very deed approoued that

concerning many other honourable Perſonages, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to behead them, or to puniſh them with the
amercement of ſome great fine to be impoſed vpon
them: Or if they dealt more mildly with any, to

               <l>Oh rage, oh too much inbred thirſt of rule!</l>
            </q>
            <p>Meane while, he that by his prouidence, as out of
a watch-Tower, beholdeth all things did breake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder
theſe cruell complots, and commaunded
King <hi>Francis,</hi> breathing out fearefull ſlaughters, to
yeeld and ſurrender his laſt breath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But what of that?
Doe you thinke that this wicked generation was
any thing mooued at the iudgements of God, or at
this example, ſo freſh and euident? No, nothing at
all: But as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ſayes, <hi>The brutiſh generation
of the wicked, is ſtarke blinde in the iudgements of God,
and hath their breſt ouercaſt and clowded with a thicke
miſt of ignorance:</hi> And a factious company, deuoted
and giuen ouer to ſinne, reioyce with triumph in
their ſinne, and ſay in their hearts, <hi>God doth not looke
vpon theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore theſe blinde men, and leaders of the
blinde, theſe enemies of Truth, were not beaten
backe from their wicked hopes and ſinnefull practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:6316:8"/>
againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no, not then, when (young King
<hi>Francis</hi> being dead) whom they had abuſed to the
deſtruction of good and godly men, the Churches
began euery where to take breath, and ſprowt out;
but euen preſently they renewed their conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and went about to entangle ſome with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and cunning deuiſes, as <hi>Anthony</hi> King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narre;</hi>
ſome to affright with murthers, and all ſorts
of cruelty, the foundation of which they lay in the
Towne of <hi>Vaſsien,</hi> and thruſt the miſerable Realme
into three moſt bitter ciuill warres, for the ſpace of
tenne whole yeares. It were a hard thing (or rather
impoſſible for me to reckon vp all their kindes of
cruelty by which the Popelings in <hi>France</hi> haue out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped
the very <hi>Tigers</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> themſelues; Yet
can I not winke at, or ouer-skip the horrible deedes
of the men of <hi>Orleance:</hi> Theſe men in the yeare 69.
in one day putting fire vnderneath, burnt in diuers
priſons aboue two hundred men of all degrees.
Who ſo vnderſtandeth not, that from them, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage
and barbarous hatred againſt the <hi>Admirall,</hi> and
the <hi>French</hi> Churches, tooke beginning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
him I iudge to ſee nothing in a moſt cleare
light.</p>
            <p>Let vs in the meane while conſider what we may
learne from that ſelfe-ſame hatefull peace, which
once was reſtored and ſet on foote in <hi>France.</hi> And
firſt this that the Lord doth graunt certaine truces
for a time, leſt with the continuance of miſchiefes,
the godly ſhould altogether faint and grow feeble,
next, in the vncertainty of that Peace, and the great
alteration of things which for full ten yeares was in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6316:9"/>
               <hi>France,</hi> wee may obſerue that no true <hi>Peace can be
between the World and the true Church:</hi> which let the
<hi>Low-Countries</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Princes</hi> marke, that we
may wholly relye on that peace which God affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs, and alwaies take heed to our ſelues of the
world, which hateth the light, and the Sons of light,
and hath this reſolution, if it can, to blot and raze
out the very name of <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Goſpell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now to the purpoſe: When as the enemies in
two ſull yeares could not by skirmiſhes ouerthrow
the forces of the reformed, who wearied, did often
refreſh themſelues; nor were able either with poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
which they often attempted, to make away, or
in battaile to ouercome and get the victory, the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall</hi>
being Generall of the hoſte, a man for paines
vntyred, for dangers valerous, for practiſe skilfull,
for aduice diſcreet and wiſe, they determined to
try it another way; ſeeing by open fight they could
profit nothing, that by ſubtilties and deceipt, in
which the vngodly are moſt experienced, and by
putting on the falſe name of Peace, they might get
the vpper hand: So, when they knew the reuerence
of the reformed Princes, of the <hi>Admirall,</hi> and of the
whole <hi>Nobility,</hi> to be great towards the King, and
that little credit would be giuen to them if they
ſhould treate of Peace, which they had ſo many
times broken and infringed, they make the King
himſelfe to perſonate and be actor of their <hi>Tragedy,</hi>
who to that purpoſe auowed hee would haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more holily and more religiouſly obſerued
then the Peace, and thereupon in countenance and
ſpeech yeelded the greateſt intimation hee could of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6316:9"/>
rendering and wiſhing well to the Nobility of the
<hi>Goſpell,</hi> and entertained <hi>Teligni,</hi> the Sonne in law of
the <hi>Admirall,</hi> to many his ſecret counſels. He did
moreouer by all meanes ſet forward that marriage
of the King of <hi>Nauarre</hi> with his Siſter, as the moſt
holy bond and pledge of Peace, and made often
motion that it might be haſtened. What did hee
more? He fained he was farre at oddes with the
Pope himſelfe, and tooke it exceeding ill at his
hands, that he ſhould warne him by his <hi>Legate</hi> not
to marry his Siſter to an <hi>Heretique Prince.</hi> But oh
accurſed and vnlucky <hi>Nupitails.</hi> Oh diſmall and
vnhallowed <hi>Bridall.</hi> A <hi>Bridall</hi> they call it: That
name they do paint on their Sinne, for that was the
diſmall day, the firſt of annoy, not of ioy, and the
firſt ſowrce and ſpring of all miſchiefe.</p>
            <p>And although that marriage might then ſeeme
to the <hi>French Nobility</hi> full of honour and concord,
there were notwithſtanding ſome politike perſons,
&amp; of greater iudgement then others, who thoght o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
&amp; were not beſide the matter; for by this it
came to paſſe that the King very earneſtly ſent for
the <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> out
of all his kingdome, not ſo much to a <hi>Bridall,</hi> as to
a <hi>Buriall:</hi> At which time, had not their minds been
very careleſſe, or rather had it not beene the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi>
deſtiny (if I may ſo ſpeake) that their houre
of death and extreame calamity was come, many
fore-tokens and vnhappy ſignes might haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
that miſchance, as the ſodaine and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought-of
deceaſe of the Queene of <hi>Nauarr:</hi> the
bitter menaces of the <hi>Popelings</hi> throughout all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6316:10"/>
Realme, who vaunted that <hi>Peace</hi> would be ſlight
and ſhort; the ſecret conference of the <hi>Cardinall
Lorraine</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Alba;</hi> his going to <hi>Rome</hi>
about a <hi>Sinode;</hi> great troopes of Souldiers placed
in <hi>Roane</hi> field, vnder this pretence, that a Nauie
muſt be rigged out againſt the Duke of <hi>Alba,</hi> and
many like matters.</p>
            <p>But yet when the Princes of the <hi>reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
had wholly prepared themſelues, at their great
charges, to this wedding, (as the Sonnes of God are
more ſimple and leſſe apprehenſiue then the ſonnes
of this world, and light beleofe is rather an ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight,
then a fault) as to mirth, and the delight of
the King, and that the King did daily either enrich
them with gifts, or bewitch them with flatteries,
who would not haue thought here had beene ſure
truſt? But, good God, how eaſily doth the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
deceiue vs; when as the ſelfe-ſame King
did ſo entertaine the <hi>Admirall</hi> himſelfe, as if hee
had beene the moſt inward partaker of his deepeſt
ſecrets?</p>
            <p>But alas, alas, on the fourth day after this Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
came that laſt day and ineuitable fate: For as
that moſt valiant Prince, the <hi>Admirall,</hi> at dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
returned homewards from the Court, hee was
ſhot through both his hands with a bullet out of a
Piſtoll: And (oh griefe) what hands? Let him heare,
and all <hi>France</hi> remember, euen thoſe hands which
had beene borne, made, and vowed for recouering
the liberty and <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>France.</hi> But when as, after
this wound receaued, he preſently fell not dead, and
that the bullet had pierced his hands onely, and not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6316:10"/>
his heart, as that impious faction and crew had
well hoped, the Conſpiratours and bloud-ſuckers
thought fit, with their wondrous diſſimulation, to
draw our men on ſtill, and to conceale their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:
The King vpon that report, bends his eyes and
countenance to ſorrow, and commaunds that the
party guilty of that act ſhould be enquired out,
promiſing and proclayming rewards to him or
them which ſhould apprehend him; ſends Letters
by Poſt-horſes into all the <hi>Prouinces</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> in
which he proteſts that this heauy miſchance of the
<hi>Admirall</hi> grieues him to the heart, and that he will
reuenge this deed by ſome notable exemplary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>To conclude, that the Nobility of the true <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi>
which was grieuouſly troubled with ſo hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
an act, might be ſecure, and all ſuſpition ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away, that they might at vnawares and vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nided
be ſurprized; the King himſelfe, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with his Mother, and Brethren, repaires to viſite
the <hi>Admirall,</hi> layd on his bed, ſpeakes to him very
kindly, and encourageth him to be of good cheere,
aſſuring him certainely that he will throughly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge
ſo vilde an offence. That vertuous Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
then turning himſelfe to the King, I am not
(ſaith he, my Soueraigne Liege) carefull about this
my wound, nor about the puniſhment of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour</hi>
of this deed, for that I referre, as this my life,
ſo all my reuenge vnto God, to whom I wholly
make my complaint, and whoſe ſight in Heauen
will be the end of my labours, which I had beene to
vndergoe in this life, and the full fruition of my
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6316:11"/>
true happineſſe: But if it ſhall pleaſe my gracious
and great God to call me from this my worldly ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
theſe three things (my dread Soueraigne) do I
moſt humbly craue and entreat of your Highneſſe;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That you neuer will ſuffer the Peace now ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in your Realme to be broken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Next,</hi> That you fully perſwade your ſelfe, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
the renowne, glory, and ſafety of your ſtate, to
giue ayde and aſsiſtance to the people of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
moſt vpright men, and moſt vnworthily oppreſsed,
againſt that cruell and barbarous Tyrant the Duke of
<hi>Alba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let this be ſtedfaſtly beleeued of you, that in
all my actions I accounted nothing more worthy, or more
to be regarded, then to defend the authority of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties
commands againſt men turbulent, enemies of their
Countries liberty, and endeauouring nothing but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowe
of their King, and the lawes of God: And
this aſſure your ſelfe, that I alwayes haue, and will be
ready for the good and ſafegard of your Realme, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
my life and bloud to all kindes of danger.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like ſpeeches did that worthy
Nobleman, full of courage and magnanimity,
though at that time faint and feeble of body, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
conſtantly and ſincerely. The King gone
from thence, to free the <hi>Admirall</hi> and the other
<hi>Peeres</hi> of all feare and ſuſpition, commandeth ſome
ſelect Souldiers of his Guard, ſuch as the <hi>Admirall</hi>
himſelfe would appoint, to be placed in that ſtreet,
who ſhould take care leſt either the people of <hi>Paris,</hi>
or any others ſhould aſſault the <hi>Admirals</hi> houſe:
The King likewiſe commandeth, that for many of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6316:11"/>
the <hi>Peeres</hi> and <hi>Religions Nobles,</hi> addicted to the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,</hi>
which were here and there diuerſly diſperſed
through the Citie, there ſhould be lodgings proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the ſelfe ſame ſtreete, that ſo ioyned together
they might be the ſafer, or rather, that coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in one heape, as ſheepe appointed for the
ſlaughter, they might at one blowe be butchered.
Who then will doubt, that there are many regions
between the tongue and the thoughts, many cranies
and blinde corners in the mindes of men? who
waighing theſe things, may doubt the ſpeech of
<hi>Truth</hi> to be ſimple, but faynings, craft, &amp; lyes to be
full of intricate inuolutions, and to ſtand in need of
many ſhadowes, and pretences? There cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly
any more plaine or foule example be giuen
of a diſſembling and deceiptfull minde.</p>
            <p>Oh good God, that ſuch things ſhould enter into
the heart of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> yea, into the minde of any
man, were he neuer ſo vile, much leſſe into the heart
of a moſt Chriſtian king, the Maieſty and dignitie
of whoſe name onely, vnleſſe it withhold vs, what
ſhall we here finde either kingly or commendable?
But I pray you: To be changeable, ſubtile, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
after the blood of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> to be a fainer and
diſſembler, may you ſay theſe are vertues beſeeming
a <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> king? <hi>God forbid.</hi> Let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
learne by this that we are oftentimes, moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in thoſe things wherein we ſhould be moſt wiſe,
<hi>That the fauour of Court is as brittle as Glaſſe.</hi> And let
all <hi>Courtiers</hi> learne here that be honeſt men, and
ſuch as beſt deſetue at their Princes hands. That it
can hardly be they ſhould eſcape ENUY, HATRED, DESTRUCTIO<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

               <hi>impriſonments</hi> and other <hi>calamities.</hi> Let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
marke aduiſedly. <hi>how changeable the courſe of
things is in Court.</hi> I will, though I digreſſe a little,
briefly and cloſely expreſſe what I meane. I omit
ancient matters. But is there any that knows not the
example of a lamentable caſe which wee haue in
<hi>Papinian, in Peter de Vineis, Moore Aluar de Luna,
Iames Corde,</hi> &amp; <hi>Columbus,</hi> who was moſt ſhamefully
and vnworthily ouerthrowne by <hi>Bombadilla; in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaus</hi>
alſo, <hi>Buſſonus, Conſaluns,</hi> and infinite others?
Nor are there examples old, and new wanting of
this, in the Courts of the <hi>Germane Princes.</hi> What if
we think of that ſo late, and freſh in memory, which
fell out in this your bleſſed <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and in
the <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>France?</hi> Doth not this <hi>Italian,</hi> ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
raiſed out of the duſt, without any deſert of his, to
ſuch great wealth and honours, giue vs an apparant
example hereof? vnleſſe they be ſtarke blind, all men
ſee it plainely. Therefore if we haue any wit, let vs
be taught by the example of others, and not ſlightly
paſſe ouer the remembrance of what happened to
the <hi>Admirall,</hi> a moſt valerous Peere of happy me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
For (Oh good God) how ſoone, how eaſily,
was King <hi>Charles</hi> carried from his accuſtomed cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie,
and mildeneſſe towards the <hi>Admirall</hi> and his
followers, vnto an incredible diſtaſte, and bitternes;
ſo as himſelfe procured the cheife Nobles of the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Religion,</hi> &amp; amongſt thereſt that moſt valiant
worthy, and the very <hi>Atlas</hi> of all <hi>France,</hi> to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
in the Court and entrance of his <hi>Pallace,</hi> and
out of his windowes (with ſhame enough) called
vpon his guard, and animated them on to doe thoſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6316:12"/>
villanies? yet could they ſcarce ſatisfie his deſire
therein, it was ſo great, and greedy. On the ſame
day therefore which was the foure and twentieth
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> about foure of the clocke in the morning,
when thoſe Noblemen were all of them ſound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe,
and the <hi>Admirall</hi> himſelfe had prepared
himſelfe ready for reſt: Behold, at vnawares, there
was a great hurly-burly in the ſame ſtreete, a huge
noyſe, and at the very ſame inſtant Ryots and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
on euery houſe. What doe they then thinke
you? The ſauage and vnruly Souldiers breake
downe the dores, hurry and ouerturne all things.
Then, I beſeech you, of what minde ſhall we thinke
that godly and ſore-wounded Peere was? Surely,
not forgetting his woonted conſtancy when hee
ſaw his death, yea moſt cruell death, inſtantly to
approach, hee willed a Miniſter of Gods Word,
whom hee had about him in his Chamber to ſay
prayers, and wholly gaue himſelfe to godly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uout
meditations: Afterwards ſending away his
Seruants, that euery one as well as he could might
ſhift for himſelfe, weakely raiſing himſelfe out of his
bed, he ſat downe on a ſtoole, that hee might, as it
were, goe meete death, which hee knew, and did
foreſee would be happy for him in the Lord: And
what he had formerly preſaged in his mind, fell out
afterwards ſo indeed; for without any ſtop or ſtay,
a damned villaine, choſen out of the whole rabble,
a ſhameleſſe cutter and cut-throat of the traine of
the Duke of <hi>Guyſe,</hi> after he had made himſelfe way
with his ſword to the <hi>Admirals</hi> Chamber (oh deed
moſt wicked and accurſed) driuing his Launce
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6316:13"/>
with all his maine force, he pearc't through his ſides
and intrailes. Then came another ympe of Sathan,
who with gaſhes bemangled his <hi>Heroicall</hi> and Peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
face. Oh deſperate villaines, oh Deuils incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
oh monſters and prodigious men! Could not
the reuenging hand of the moſt powerfull God (oh
wicked and deteſtable Souldier) reſtraine and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
thee? Could not the Chambers threaſhold, the
very walls, nor the countenance of ſo great a Peere
(whoſe name had always beene dreadfull to all
wicked and hatefull perſons) affright or amaze thee?
Could not the words of this great &amp; godly Captain
moue thee to pitty; who with a loud voice admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
that firſt cut-throat ruſhing into his Chamber,
that he ſhould ſpare him, a man now of great yeres,
and ſore wounded? Nay, which is more, this Peere
more then halfe dead, was then throwne headlong
out of his Chamber window, that the eyes of the
Dukes of <hi>Annale,</hi> of <hi>Guyſe,</hi> and his other enemies,
who in the backeſide of the houſe ſtood longing for
that ſight, might be glutted and ſatisfied; and that
(as the <hi>Grecians</hi> did in times paſt to dead <hi>Hector)</hi>
they might inſult and triumph ouer him.</p>
            <p>O ſauage and barbarous men, who breaking all
the barres of ſhame and of Nature her ſelfe, that one
vnpardonable ſin might be heaped vpon the necke
of another, doe furiouſly aſſault all the other <hi>Peeres</hi>
and <hi>Nobles;</hi> Men of all degrees are maſſacred; all
the houſhold of the King of <hi>Nauarre,</hi> and Prince of
<hi>Condee</hi> are ſlaine; they of moſt name amongſt the
other Nobles, the Earle of <hi>Rupefueldanus,</hi> and <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>gni,</hi>
the <hi>Admirals</hi> Sonne in Law, whom the King
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6316:13"/>
before ſeemed to hold ſo deere, that hee could not
be without them, were all put to the ſword.</p>
            <p>Oh damnable and inexorable Man-killers, for
whom it was not enough to ſlaughter and mangle
their bodies, but that they runne alſo vpon their
goods, which were then layd open to the will and
prey of theſe cut-throats, who in their owne eſtates
before, hauing been moſt needy, baſe, &amp; ragged, are
now with other mens goods profuſe and riotous:
Neither had any good man any thing in his houſe
of any ancient Monument from his Anceſtors; any
thing (I ſay) neuer ſo deare, or well-eſteemed, that
could ſcape the clutches of theſe rapinous theeues
and burglarers. The carkaſſe of the <hi>Admirall</hi> was
haled into the ſtreetes, and abuſed with infinite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
by the raſh, baſe, and ignoble vulgar, and
a long time tumbled vp and downe in the kennels
and durt: At laſt, the head being cut off (which
ſome ſay was ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> was moſt deſpightfully
hanged vp on a publique gallowes without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Oh vnworthy deed! oh madneſſe! oh barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
furie, and moſt eſtranged from all ſence or fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of humanity! Did it become your enuy and
treachery to dragge a man to an ignominious exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Natures frame, almoſt diuine, and of a
minde altogether good and great; a man fit to haue
beene kept for the doubtfulleſt and hardeſt times
of the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> whom his moſt famous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruings
towards his <hi>Countrey,</hi> his many noble acts,
and the glory of his vertue had raiſed vp to Heauen?
And yet for all this he had nothing left him, which
the rage and fury of the Souldiers could deprine
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6316:14"/>
him of. But what could not be taken from a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
and godly man, a ſtedfaſt faith in God, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall
memory of his name and reputation; thoſe,
neither wounds, nor words, nor bloudy cut-throates
could bereaue from him.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things are thus done at <hi>Paris,</hi> and
that the King had willed the Captaine of theſe men
to ſtay the ſight, whilſt the body of the <hi>Admirall</hi>
was abuſed in the ſtreets with all manner of iniuries;
then after this began the ſeditious Cittizens to run
in heaps into the ſtreets to aſſaile people of euery
Sex, and degree, and to ruſh euery where in the
darke, making confuſion of all things, as if an eternal
night had ouerſpred the kingdome: What ſay you
to this? That very many, euen well affected to the
Popſh Religion were ſlaine, and extremitie ſhowne
euen to the very Counſellors of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> if
any amongſt them were of a milder temper then
they. Be this knowne to all good men, that no light
or fluency of <hi>Eloquence</hi> can be ſuch; no man can be
ſtored with ſuch abundance, and facility of ſpeech,
that he may be able to deliuer the deadly ſpoiles and
deaths of that day: For what degree of miſchiefe can
be added to the vnbridled, and vntamed lycentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of theſe conſpirators, ſeeing there is nothing
ſo common as <hi>breath</hi> to the liuing, <hi>earth</hi> to the dead?
Theſe men after they had taken away life, did either
caſt the very carkaſes to be torne and rent of dogs,
or threw them into the riuers: ſo was a Woman,
for vertue and lynage moſt noble, and excellently
learned aboue her Sexe, the Lady of <hi>Iuern,</hi> with her
daughters: ſo were two ſiſters, women of <hi>Orleance,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:6316:14"/>
throwne into the Riuer of <hi>Soame,</hi> becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to heare their ſacrilegious Maſſe; and had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſhed their life and bloud, then that they would
forſake the true, and ſincere <hi>Religion.</hi> After theſe
ſinnes ſo horrible, and abhominable; What thinke
you was done next? Any breſt, in which there is
the leaſt drop of remorſe, may heare it, and lament.
The <hi>Pariſians</hi> reioyce, with all merriments; they
triumph openly with ioy; they goe on Proceſſion,
to giue thankes to their <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Idols,</hi> as for a thing
done brauely. Oh blinde, and impious thoughts of
men, oh trunkes, oh ſtockes and ſtones! Good God,
can theſe things enter into the hearts of <hi>Chriſtians?</hi>
But let vs proceede, and with griefe wee ſhall ſee,
that no ſort of wickedneſſe was omitted in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe.
They fained, that God by a new miracle,
did approue and allow of theſe murthers, and that
in the great Church-yard of Saint <hi>Innocents,</hi> as they
tearme it, a certaine Hawthorne-buſh, that neuer
before had budded, did on the ſodaine, in that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed
day, bud and flouriſh; which buſh, the Duke
of <hi>Aniow</hi> the Kings brother, with a great traine of
them of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Orleance,</hi> would needes ſee, kiſſe,
and adore. What impiety, (I pray you) what bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſneſſe
can be greater then this? or what more
franticke part is there, then that theſe men ſhould
inuent ſuch a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>racle, to witneſſe their phrenſie, and
make their madneſſe more manifeſt to the world?</p>
            <p>Then forſooth did buſhes flouriſh; it was not
the buſh, but deceit that flouriſhed, wickedneſſe
flouriſhed; &amp; for a time the vngodly flouriſhed, but
they ſhall wither at the laſt, &amp; be adiudged to euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6316:15"/>
fire; as ſtraw, or ſtubble, they ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.
Neither yet, after that diſmall day, did the
cruelty of theſe robbers and <hi>Aſſaſsines</hi> ceaſe or giue
ouer; for there were then ſent, euen when there was
weeping and wailing through the whole citie, and
that in all the ſtreetes thereof many were cruelly
ſlaine; either of the <hi>Nobilitie,</hi> or of the <hi>Counſellors</hi>
and <hi>Aduocates,</hi> or of the moſt notable Profeſſours of
the <hi>Vniuerſitie,</hi> or of the <hi>Merchants:</hi> Some (I ſay)
were ſent, euen of the King (oh deede nothing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!)
which in euery houſe, and inward roome of the
houſe ſhould make diligent ſearch, if any hidden by
chance, had eſcaped the hands of theſe murtherers.
Hereupon a moſt huge ſlaughter is made againe;
neigther (as I may ſpeake with the <hi>Poet)</hi> was then,
<hi>the Hoſte from Gueſt, or Gueſt from Hoſte was ſafe.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
perſons, of great and high name and eſtimation,
were committed to the Goales; if any of them refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to heare their execrable Maſſe, they had ſtraight
their throates cut, and tumbled headlong into the
Riuer. For the vpſhot, that all in generall might
taſte of their rage and cruelty, and that all things in
the whole kingdome might be turned topſi-turuie,
with Letters ſent by Poſtes, and with what meanes
they can, they perſwade the Gouernours of Prouin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and the Cities of the Kingdome, by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
vtterly, and without exception, to make away
and roote out all thoſe that were of the reformed
<hi>Religion.</hi> Neuertheleſſe there wanted not ſome, euen
the moſt heauy enemies of <hi>Religion,</hi> that refuſed to
obey theſe Edicts; and amongſt the reſt, the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Burgundy, who plainely diſallowed of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6316:15"/>
Kings proceedings; yet to them of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and the
ſeditious people of <hi>Lions,</hi> this meſſage was moſt
welcome aboue all things, where beyond meaſure
they exerciſed cruelty; and where Butchers were hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
as in the time of <hi>Licinius</hi> the Emperour, to bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
vp the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> nay more (which is an horrible
thing to ſpeak) to buy the far &amp; greaſe of them, which
were fatteſt. This likewiſe is a dolefull and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
caſe, that very few Cities at all in the Kingdome,
very few Townes, very few Villages, and Riuers
there are, which haue not beene filled with the
goare of the godly <hi>Martyrs.</hi> This is more, that
their inhumane cruelty was ſo great, as in ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
an affliction it was not lawfull for Widowes
to bewaile their Husbands, nor <hi>Orphanes</hi> their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents;</hi>
but that, at <hi>Paris,</hi> little ones and infants were
found, who when they did ſee themſelues hal'd from
their Mothers breſts, their Mothers hurried to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,
did not forbeare to cry out, till themſelues
likewiſe had their tender bloudſhed: Oh more then
<hi>Scythian</hi> barbarouſneſſe! for what Tyrant did euer
doe this in any part of <hi>Scythia?</hi> not to ſuffer them to
mourne, to whom he gaue cauſe of mourning. Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
didſt thou, moſt graue <hi>Orator</hi> and <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> that
didſt not well endure, nor couldeſt abide to beholde
men ſo barbarous and miſchieuous.</p>
            <p>There remaineth nothing, that theſe combined
enemies of the Truth haue, wherewith to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
themſelues, either before God, or nature it
ſelfe, or any <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> but that they may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
of the very <hi>Ethnicks</hi> themſelues, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
endued with the knowledge of the true God,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6316:16"/>
nor inſtructed with holy-writ, nor puft vp with that
great and gliſtering name of <hi>Romane Catholike,</hi> doe
gather theſe things euen by the very law, and light
of Nature it ſelfe, by which they are a ſhame to you
<hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees.</hi> Doe therefore the Law, and
Prophets, (in GODS name) depend vpon you?
vpon your counſels and traditions? vpon the Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borde
of the Pope (father of miſchiefe)? and vpon
his Meſſengers and Aſſaſſines? Bluſh you Theeues
and Pyrats, woe to you <hi>Hipocrites,</hi> which attribute
to your ſelues the <hi>Supremacie</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> vnder
a falſe and forged title; You (I ſay) conſcript and
ſworne Fathers, who haue forſworne Piety, and
the knowledge of good things, and a ſound Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But leſt any man ſhould thinke wee grow teaſtie
without cauſe, and ſpeake preiudicially, which vſeth
to take away right iudgement; Let vs heare, and go
forward with the reſt, and that by the tops and
chiefe points of the matters, leſt our diſcourſe grow
to be infinite. The things already ſpoken of, though
they were cruell and abhominable, yet did they not
fully ſatisfie the deſires of theſe bloudy butchers.
They goe on therefore, and at <hi>Paris</hi> in the middeſt
of the Market-place, they cauſe to be hanged vp
<hi>Brickmald,</hi> a moſt renowned man, and moſt skilfull
in warlike affaires, being almoſt of the age of three-ſcore
and ten yeares, who by chance had hid him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in the houſe of the Engliſh Embaſſador; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
one <hi>Cauagne,</hi> a man of great wiſedome, and <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
to the Princes both of <hi>Naturre</hi> &amp; of <hi>Condee;</hi>
then made they a laughing-ſtocke of the Picture
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:6316:16"/>
and coat of Armes of the <hi>Admirall,</hi> which through
the ſtreets they ignominiouſly abuſed: and euery
day they were altogether buſie in this, either how
they might kill, or by fearefull threatnings enforce
to their impious and forbidden ſuperſtition, the
profeſſors of the true and reformed <hi>Religion,</hi> By
this it appeareth more cleare, euen then noone-day,
that the cruelty of theſe men was in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
their Nature fierce, and ſauage, themſelues ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarious
bloud-ſuckers, and that neuer any Pyrate
was more barbarous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antiochus</hi> was cruell, but an open enemy of the
Church, and an <hi>Heathen. Nero</hi> was cruell, but for
full fiue yeares moſt mercifull, and afterwards open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
euill. <hi>Domitian</hi> was cruell, but when hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was Heauenly,
not earthly, he left off to perſecute the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> In
the Raigne of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſixt, King of <hi>France,</hi> hee
being young, fooliſh, and witleſſe, (as the <hi>Chronicles</hi>
report) <hi>France</hi> was grieuouſly diſtreſſed: But there
can nothing be repeated out of all the records of
Antiquity, which comes neere vnto the cruelties we
haue rehearſed, if we well waigh the circumſtances.
And although theſe things be thus true, apparant,
and approoued; yet dare they charge theſe godly
Noblemen with an idle accuſation, and an imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of forged conſpiracie; when amongſt them all,
not one (though prouoked) did vnſheath his ſword;
when thoſe pittileſſe cut-throats did likewiſe put to
death Women and Children; when their very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin
<hi>Germans,</hi> and amongſt them, ſome <hi>Earles, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons,</hi>
and <hi>Nobles,</hi> did not eſcape from them without
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6316:17"/>
great danger; when they baniſhed from the Court,
and kept priſoner <hi>Michaell Hoſpitalis,</hi> the high <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellour</hi>
of <hi>France,</hi> and a moſt honourable perſon, for
this cauſe onely, <hi>That he withſtood their wicked Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailes;</hi>
when they enforced no ſmall number by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
and threatnings, to their idolatrous Maſſes;
laſtly, when <hi>Chriſtopher Thouanus</hi> the firſt Preſident
in the Parliament, gratulating to the King that (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
his famous victory, did openly amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things, repeat that ſaying of <hi>Lewis</hi> the elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth,
<hi>Who knowes not how to diſſemble, knowes not
how to rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I detaine your <hi>Lordſhip</hi> with an Oration o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-long;
leſt therefore I ſhould abuſe your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi>
patience, I will make ſhort of what remaines.
Let vs then but looke into this one thing, whether
theſe matters which wee haue already vttered, doe
not ſo palpably ſhew forth the impious combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Popelings,</hi> that it may be viewed euen with
our eyes. From hence let all Chriſtian Kings and
Princes that are wiſe, ſee, and vnderſtand this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
that this <hi>French</hi> calamitie cannot be diſioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
from theirs, when the <hi>Religion</hi> common to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is aſſailed, and the Tyrants invred to ſo many
miſchiefes, and greedy of good mens bloud, cannot
ſo reſt and content themſelues.</p>
            <p>Oh moſt renowned Princes, do you ſtill remaine
in doubt? Doe not ſo: but marke and note what
(after theſe times which we haue recounted) at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
time, and not fiue yeares ſince, befelt that
great and moſt Chriſtian King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth?
Conſider with how many ambuſhes, fraudes, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6316:17"/>
deceipts they belayed the moſt famous Queene of
<hi>England,</hi> ELIZABETH of happy and bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
Call to minde with how many engines they
battered the poore wretches of the <hi>Low-Countreyes,</hi>
both publiquely and priuately, for the ſpace of theſe
fortie yeares and vpwards. Remember all you of
the <hi>Engliſh Nobility,</hi> that horrible Gunne-powder
Treaſon, which enterprized at one ſtroke to deſtroy
and blow vp your moſt mighty KING, your no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
QVEENE, together with their Royall <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny,</hi>
and the flower of all the Nobility of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is worth the labour to know, with how
plauſible and goodly a name theſe glozing <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zites,</hi>
and Pillers of the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> doe entitle
ſuch like abhominable miſdeeds; marry, <hi>A ſtroke
giuen from Heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh vowes, oh words, and men of Hell! Doe
you, you hell-hounds, bring downe from Heauen
the forge and fountaine of your ſinnefull actions?
I ſpeake truth (oh <hi>Chriſtians)</hi> and your ſelues know
it to be ſo, that had not the Lord of Heauen and
Earth hindred this ſtroke, <hi>England</hi> had not for one
yeare onely beene miſerable, and tormented, but
ſtab'd and mangled with infinite wounds, iniuries,
violences, murthers, and rapines ſhould hardly
haue drawne their begged breath amidſt her deadly
enemies. Wherefore I pray and beſeech you, you
Princes and Noblemen, that the painted ſhew of
<hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the name <hi>(Catholike)</hi> deceiue
you not; let this rather be your reſolutions, <hi>That
force by force, is to be beaten backe from your bodies
and liues.</hi> For this defence, <hi>Reaſon</hi> to the Learned,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6316:18"/>
               <hi>Neceſsity</hi> to the barbarous, <hi>Cuſtome</hi> to all Nations,
and Nature it ſelfe, hath preſcribed to the bruite
beaſts. What need I ſpeake more; let vs haue no
league with this brood of Antichriſt, but warre ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Let vs bethinke our ſelues, all and euery one of
vs, who haue any care and liking of Religion, or of
the ſafety, renowne, and liberty of their Countrey,
that we ought to beware of the Popiſh traines and
entrappings: For ſooner or later, whatſoeuer they
now intend and couer, will they at their time ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
and bring to paſſe; Whoſoeuer thinkes they
haue giuen ouer, thinkes farre amiſſe, ſeeing that
rule ſo old, true, and religious, doth neuer faile, <hi>There
is no peace with the vngodly.</hi> Therefore let it be ſo
farre from vs, to hold conſederacies with theſe <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited</hi>
Traytors, that we rather account them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies,
which although they lye hid perhaps for
a time, yet at laſt they appeare, and are as eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
by their actions, as the Lyon by his clawes.
What? Is there for vs greater ſecurity now, then
was in thoſe <hi>French</hi> vproares, when theſe <hi>Ieſuites,</hi>
theſe plagues of men, haue lowly inſinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
into very many Prouinces, Cities, Townes,
Caſtles; yea, and into the Courts of Princes, and
their familiarity; for ſo exceedingly well do theſe
runnagate common <hi>Barretors</hi> know at firſt how
to humilitate themſelues, as alſo to faigne Pouerty,
and aboue all things, to ſeeme godly; that theſe
coyne-mongers haue not onely by their forged
name gotten incredible wealth, and opinion of true
<hi>Religion,</hi> but like <hi>Bloud-bounds,</hi> of better ſcenting
then euer <hi>Verres</hi> had any, they haue alſo cunningly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6316:18"/>
ſmelt out the purpoſes of Princes, and their ſecreſies
and myſteries of <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, as ſoone as afterwards they haue in
particular beene related to their fellowes, and by
common aduiſe handled and diſcuſſed; then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
are ſent into ſundry Prouinces, ſuch men, as
ſome call the <hi>Kings,</hi> ſome the <hi>Popes Legats,</hi> others
the <hi>Apoſtolicall Nuntioes,</hi> and others call them with
other Titles; but as for me, by what name I may
call them, I know not, vnleſſe peraduenture in that
they tempt and ſollicite ſome by rewards and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries,
ſome by hope and promiſes, ſome by feare
and threatnings; they may rightly be called <hi>Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi>
and betrayers of their Countrey: who if in the
beginning, the conſines and entrance of Kingdomes
and <hi>Regions</hi> had beene forbidden them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
to abſtaine hereafter, they had beene
deliuered by the conſent of all the <hi>States,</hi> either theſe
<hi>Mountebanckes</hi> had not at all brought their poyſon
into diuers Prouinces, or elſe they had receiued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
paiment for their paines: But after it was lawful
for them to betray Kings and Princes, to effect their
buſines either by gold or ſiluer, to ſend intelligencers
abroad, to retaine Pentioners, and to turne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
at their pleaſure, to what place ſoeuer, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
miſchiefes did preſently enſue thereupon, and
doe daily; Let euen <hi>Spaine</hi> her ſelfe, the chiefe nurſe
of theſe Waſpes and Locuſts, beare witneſſe; be <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taly</hi>
alſo witneſſe; let <hi>France</hi> ſpeake, and the (not
meane) Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Low-Countries:</hi> from
my very ſoule I reioyce that the Iland of <hi>England</hi> is

ſome that perchance lurke, and lye cloſe in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners)
and I pray God it may ſo remaine euerlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Meane while, moſt noble (King <hi>Iames,)</hi> moſt
mighty, valiant, and conſtant defendour, and reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of the faith, goe on to chaſe out thy kingdome
this Vipers-brood, men, mockers and contemners of

deriued) which goe about vnder the pretext of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi>
vtterly to roote out all iuſt and lawfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion.
Your Maieſtie, according to your ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
wiſedome, doth ſee what that wicked deſire of
the <hi>Pope</hi> went about to doe with your <hi>ſelfe,</hi> your
children, your poſteritie, and your ſubiects: Hath
not that <hi>Romane</hi> gulfe long ſince deuoured all the
wealth, bloud, and life of <hi>England?</hi> Are not theſe
holy men, the fathers of the <hi>Societie?</hi> ſuch as ſtriue
to enter not onely vpon our goods, cheſts, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
but vpon the liberty alſo, and ſafety, and as it
were, the very bones and marrow of vs all? Are not
theſe the men, that were accuſtomed, not onely to
ſet vpon, but to ſell our liues and ſoules, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
it ſelfe at a price? To theſe men then muſt we
liſten, of theſe and none other are Kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be iudged; if they refuſe, and doe not of their
owne accord, accept of any moſt vnequall conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they ſtrait cry out, that they are to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
and perſecuted to death. Are not theſe thoſe
companions, that euery-where labour with tooth
and naile to bring in that <hi>Spaniſh Inquiſition?</hi> which
at firſt was practiſed onely againſt the <hi>Sarazens,</hi> and
<hi>Infidels?</hi> and I pray you, what good comes of it?
of what vſe is it? Truely none, vnleſſe, as miſerable
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6316:19"/>
wretches, wee ſhall be conſtrained to looke for
murther vpon murther, and moſt cruell ſlaughters.
But God forbid, moſt gracious King, and you all,
vertuous and great Princes, that we, who by ſo long
and large diſtance of ground ſeuered from <hi>Spaine,</hi>
haue no communitie at all with the <hi>Religion,</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and cuſtome of that <hi>Nation,</hi> liue in a well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned
Kingdome &amp; Commonwealth, ſhould beare
the ſame yoake, as this people doth; or that the
ſame euill ſhould be put vpon vs, or any good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
which hath in it all euils, <hi>The Spaniſh Inquiſition.</hi>
For this is that (if any man knowes it not already)
which not onely by poyſoning takes away the liues
of famous men, the Countries beſt commoners,
teares in peeces the ciuill lawes of Commonwealths,
but alſo breakes in ſunder the very lawes of nature
and <hi>Nations.</hi> Liſten further, and vnderſtand ye Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
could euer yet, euen <hi>Spaine</hi> her ſelfe, and <hi>Arra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon;</hi>

vntamed, and ſo vnſatiable is that <hi>Spaniſh-Romane
beaſt;</hi> which cannot (I ſay) be fattened, nor ſo much
as haue her paunch filled vp with <hi>Chriſtians</hi> bloud.
And to this <hi>Beaſt,</hi> ſo wilde and ſauage, will the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
French-men, the wiſe men of the <hi>Low-Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi>
and the <hi>Gentles,</hi> and <hi>Nobles</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> refuſe
to yeelde obedience? with good reaſon. Set before
your eyes examples, which for the moſt part doe
chiefely moue; conſider them, call to remembrance
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6316:20"/>
the late and freſh memory of the <hi>French, Germanes,</hi>
and <hi>Low-Country-men,</hi> and you ſhall haue cauſe
great enough (oh Princes) to defend your right,
your priuiledges, and eſpecially <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi>
purged from the Popiſh dregs and filth: All which
truely, according to your faith and dutie, wiſh to
be protected by your prouidence, and cannot be
forſaken of you, without the manifeſt deſtruction
of all that's Gods, or mans: Neither is it likely that,
that <hi>Stoicall numbneſſe,</hi> is ſo ingrafted &amp; imprinted in
your mindes, that the many wiſhes, prayers, yea,
and iuſt complaints of good men, may finde in you
no ſenſe of humanitie, no protection for their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency:
I beſeech you (moſt noble Princes and
Peeres) that you thus fully perſwade your ſelues;
if there be any of all men liuing, who ought to haue
care of ſuch, and ſo great a cauſe; that you eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
are they, and that to you aboue the reſt, this
cauſe belongs, whom the moſt mighty good God,
hath in this rotten and feſtered age, placed here, the
<hi>Champions</hi> of his reſtored Religion and ſaluation;
that each of you, to the vttermoſt of his power, ſo
farre with your wiſedome, temperance, faith, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
vigilance, and (in one word) with that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
and inborne <hi>Engliſh</hi> valour, whoſe glory with
all Nations is immortall, doe ſo much ſtudy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
and aduiſe for your Countrey-men, as that
our God, according to his mercy will, no doubt,
aide your endeauours; and as good men, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſire, but will alſo celebrate, to the memory of
Poſteritie. But that in this one onely thing, of all the
moſt honourable, there needes agreement, both of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6316:20"/>
mindes and counſels, I thinke no man is ignorant,
vnleſſe of what belongs vnto man he be ignorant;
for this alone is it which affordes vs good counſell
in dangers, Conſtancy and valour in miſchances,
moderation in Proſperity, and in euery fortune
that gift of <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> without which nothing can
be well thought, nothing well done: This one, and
alone <hi>Concord</hi> is it (I ſay) which ſafe-guards that
ſtraight knot of <hi>Charity,</hi> that yeelding neither pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately
to <hi>Enuie,</hi> nor publikely to <hi>Ambition,</hi> vpholds
the Tower of your happineſſe, which if it remaine
ſtrengthned, and confirmed amongſt vs. There
ſhall not be (as I hope, nay confidently truſt) any
cauſe why wee ſhould any longer doubt either of
the ſafety of the Common-wealth, or of our <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
and reſtored truely-Catholike and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<hi>Religion.</hi>

            <p>ALmighty and moſt high God, which gouerneſt

Realme of <hi>England,</hi> that is at this time the largeſt
<hi>Theater,</hi> and very eye of the whole earths compaſſe.
Ariſe (great God) and raiſe thy ſelfe againſt the

King IAMES, renowned for godlineſſe, learning,

of our moſt cruell foes, from thoſe ſacrilegious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiratours,

Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the

man, that ſetting apart the vnſeaſonable contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
invectiues, and preiudices of many Diuines in

would rather apply their mindes to the eſtabliſhing

once when <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour perſecuted the
true Chriſtians, <hi>Baſill,</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> did)
then in wrath and ſpleene to ſeeke out new matters
of ſtrife. If wee haue a purpoſe to ſtriue and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
let it be with mutuall duties and godly emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
