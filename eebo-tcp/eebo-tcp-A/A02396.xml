            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We then which expound <hi>This,</hi> to be His Body, onely by way of Sacrament, and as water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is His blood; doe take the intent of our Sauiour in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to be for the ordayning and faſtning a ſecond ſeale vnto his New Teſtament: that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now He had vndergone the condition of mans nature, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3715:5"/>
was about to finiſh the price of our redemption; Hee thought good not onely to haue it recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Scriptures, and publiſhed all the world ouer what he had done for vs (though that might haue beene thought ſufficient for beleeuers,) but alſo to ordaine certain viſible tokens and formes of remembring His ſuch perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance: that ſo as His word did inwardly, theſe ſeales might out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, ſeuerally in Baptiſme, and ioyntly in this Communion, expreſſe and impart vnto men the benefit of His incarnation and ſuffring; and we thereby to haue both His hand and ſeales to our redemption. Which ſeales alſo that they might the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably be made one with His teſtament, and withall at the firſt bluſh more liuely repreſent the ſubſtance thereof; He thought
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3715:5"/>
good to ſtampe and imprint them with his owne image and ſuperſcription: and therefore here in the text calleth the bread expreſſely <hi>His bodie,</hi> as an other Scripture likewiſe calleth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeale, <hi>His blood: (the ſpirit,</hi>

But principally and with moſt fell violence let them crie, out vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all arguing and reaſoning in this buſines.

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:3715:25"/>
and that <hi>we infinitely robbe the ſame,</hi> by denying theſe their monſtrous ſuppoſes, <hi>as if there were any thing impoſſible with Him?</hi> And thereupon fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally let them glory in the ſtrength of their owne Faith, for that, it is ſo ſtrong (numbd, ſeared, and ſenſeleſſe indeed) as that with eaſe they can beleeue, that which their aduerſaries are afraid once to imagine. And then laſt of all, let them cloſe vp all with this pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, that ſurely their opinion is inuincible: for why? becauſe (no doubt) it is builded vpon a rocke; yea the moſt high and mighty Rocke, the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of God. But, a laſſe, poore, miſerable, abominable fooles! For if he be a foole that builds (though neuer ſo good ſtuffe) vpon a ſandy foundation; then
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3715:25"/>
how abominably fooliſh is he, that builds moſt rotten and moſt vile ſtuffe, vpon the moſt precious foundation? As if cob-webs were any whit the ſtronger for beeing built in pallaces? ſhall they not ſo much the ſooner be ſwept away? ſo this their like planting ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-like, abominable ſtuffe thus at the right hand of God, ſo farre ſhall it bee from getting ſtrength thereby, as that from thence it ſhall receiue moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible confuſion. The power of God, who denies it, yea wee glory in it that it is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: <hi>all things are poſſible vnto Him</hi>; we know it: Scripture teacheth it: namely, ſo far forth as they carrie an honour in the performance. For elſe, why ſaies an other Scripture, <hi>it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that God ſhould lie?</hi> but to

ſhew vs, that no kind of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable actions (whereof ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is one) may bee aſcribed vnto Him: All power alſo to diſgrace, diminiſh, or deſtroy (finally) either it ſelfe or other, beeing impotence and vnſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe. Before therefore they had preſumed to affirme that God can doe ſo, or ſo; they ſhould firſt with feare and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, haue conſidered whether it might ſtand with His glorie, ſo, or ſo, to worke. For that His power does neuer worke out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to the creature-ward, but as it is firſt beckned vnto, and cited by His glory: that beeing the ground and ſquare of all power and poſſibility whatſoeuer: euen the power of ſinne beeing grounded here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, becauſe the glory of God is aduanced by ſubduing

ſinne: All ſayings, finally, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, and expoſitions whatſoeuer, beeing no further allowable, but ſo farre forth as they make for, or at leaſt may ſtand with, This diuine Glory. The Church therefore inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting thoſe tearmes of <hi>Face, Eyes, Hands, Armes, Wings, Foote, &amp;c.</hi> to be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God improperly, and by way of His gracious condiſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto, and ſympathizing with mans nature; becauſe bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing litterally taken, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory vnto His eternall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereunto <hi>ſimplicity</hi> and <hi>v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niformitie</hi> is of abſolute neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Are then thy ſuppoſes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable vnto God? So far then is the Omnipotence from effecting them, or yeelding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the leaſt poſſibility of proceeding from Him, as that

infinitely it barres, repells and abhorres them. True indeed, time was, and wee bleſſe the time, when He tooke contempt vpon Him; (ſo loued He the world, mans miſery otherwiſe beeing endleſſe;) but what of that? is therefore honour and diſhonour vnto Him all one? He paſſed through the wombe of a woman without defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; true: but was it without abaſement? where then is the merit thereof?<note place="margin">Pſal. 123 5.</note> Or he <hi>that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth Himſelfe, in that He does behold the things done in heauen and earth</hi>; did He not infinitely more humble Himſelfe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into the <hi>heart of the earth?</hi> Or becauſe alſo He was ſcourged and crucified without any defilement, ſhall that alſo be counted all one vnto Him, that ſo thou mayeſt crucifie

Him, yea drinke His heart blood againe and againe? We grant alſo that as He is pure God, He is not onely vnpollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, but alſo vnaffectable with mans actions. But ſhall man therefore be careleſſe of his actions? The blaſphemies of wicked men do no way hurt, or come nigh Him; ſhall it therefore be lawfull to bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheame? <hi>If thou ſinneſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) what doeſt thou againſt Him:</hi>

               <hi>or if thou be righteous, what giueſt thou vnto Him?</hi> wilt thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be indifferent whether thou ſinneſt or not, whether thou does well or not? <hi>Hee ſees not as man ſees</hi>; well: His Eternall and incomprehenſible nature indeed, ſees all things in a moment, and without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing time, place, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: But as He hath ſet

Himſelfe in reference and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect vnto his creature, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that creature whoſe nature He hath aſſumed, He now hath determined to ſee, though not peruerſly as wicked men, nor ſhallowly as all men, yet by thoſe courſes and formes of conceiuing, which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grained His creature withall: And therefore now forbeares not to ſay,<note place="margin">Gen. 18.21.</note> 
               <hi>I will goe downe, and ſee whether they haue done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their crie, and if not, I will knowe:</hi> yea, now He will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his creature, will be angred and pleaſed with it, will accept honour and euen out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſpects from it: the holy Baptiſt therfore profeſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe not <hi>worthy to vntie the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet of his ſhooes</hi>; and the good Centurion eſteeming him too great to enter the roofe of his
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:3715:28"/>
houſe: yea now He calls for the <hi>bending of euery knee,</hi> and <hi>the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe before His footeſtoole,</hi> with all poſſible praiſe, honour, and glorie. Remember there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O preſumptuous man, (wormes meate, duſt, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes,) remember, that His re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed Law, not his incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible nature, muſt bee thy ſquare and gouernour. His law bids thee euery where aſcribe vnto Him all glorie, praiſe, power, and dominion; giue Him therefore that He cals for: and ſeeing He calls for honour, ſee thou offereſt nothing vnto Him, but that which, at leaſt, thou thinkeſt to be moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and moſt honourable: and whatſoeuer thou wouldeſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme vile, inglorious, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelious, if it were offered vnto thy ſelfe, ſo farre muſt thou
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3715:29"/>
be from offring that vnto Him, or ſuppoſing it by Him, as thou wouldeſt be from blaſpheming. Thou reacheſt foorth thy hand in loue or fauour vnto ſome man; he biteth it, or puts it in his mouth; does hee honour thee in ſo doing? or if thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt ſuch vſage for a fowle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie, wilt thou offer the like vnto Him, vnto whome thou oweſt all honour, feare, dread, and reuerence vnto? Or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like when Hee ſo calls for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, glorie, maieſtie, &amp;c.</hi> Hee meanes ſome other matter, or retaines ſome ſpeciall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnder thoſe words, which man neuer meant? As if God ſpeakes vnto vs in any other language but our owne? or when He forbids <hi>murther, adulterie, ſtealing, &amp;c.</hi> He meanes any thing elſe by
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3715:29"/>
ſuch words, but as man (the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of words, as God is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of all things) intended them to ſignifie? Then know, O per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe man, that when he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally calls for honour, glorie, maieſtie, wiſedome, iuſtice, &amp;c. to be aſcribed vnto Him, Hee meanes nothing elſe but thoſe reſpects and offices (ſaue onely in the higheſt degree) which man that made thoſe words did firſt meane to vnderſtand by ſuch words; vnleſſe thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to make His word of no effect, yea a very ſnare and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement vnto vs, and to ſpeake by contraries, and ſo to blaſpheme it as thou doeſt his Omnipotence. But finally, were it ſo that theſe ſuppoſes did not indeed diſhonour God, and ſo conſequently might be allowed amongſt things not impoſſible;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3715:30"/>
muſt they therefore of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie be beleeued? becauſe dooms day may be to morrowe, muſt it needs therefore ſo befal? God can raiſe children out of ſtones, and humane bodies out of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells of bread; muſt it therefore ſo be expected? does poſſibility impoſe neceſſitie? to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then is there ſo great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prooue a poſſibilitie of theſe things, which both they are infinitely ſhut from, and alſo were it graunted them, they are neuer the nearer. As little does it helpe them, but more and more condemne them, when they challenge all argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and renounce all kind of euidence which either ſenſe or reaſon offreth in this cauſe. For are not Senſe &amp; Reaſon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ordinance of God, imprinted in mans nature when it was
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:3715:30"/>
moſt perfect? yea, in the eſtate we now are in, are they not the onely meanes whereby wee are both capable of His will, ſtand liable vnto his lawes, and tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to His purpoſes? Does not euery word of God preſuppoſe at leaſt a reaſonable vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being otherwiſe as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable vnto the beaſt? yea, when the Lord meanes moſt palpably to conuince men, does He not referre them to their ſenſes? Are not not all His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulations &amp; meſſages what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, directed vnto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whoſe ground is Senſe and Science?<note place="margin">Luk. 24 39.</note> does He not ſend the vnbeleeuer to his touch,<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:3715:31"/>
the madneſſe of ſpeaking in an vnknowne tongue?<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14 23.</note> yea, does He not euerie where conuince men of the greateſt ſinne, euen of Idolatrie, onely by this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they worſhip that which their common Senſe could tell them was a ſenſleſſe creature? whereas if the power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe bee ſo blind, or ſo weake, or ſo falſe, as that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainely ſay, whether the thing it ſees, handle, and taſteth bee a morſell of bread or not; how ſhall it be able to ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which it worſhippeth be a ſtone or not, yea and that ſo infallibly, as that the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipper thereof ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, by the ſentence of the moſt vpright Iudge, to be an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolater thereupon? For may not the Idolater iuſtly plead, that howſoeuer his common
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3715:31"/>
Senſe told him it was a ſtocke, or a ſtone, yet might it indeede bee very God, as well as that which common ſenſe affirmeth to be a morſell of bread, is not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding very God? And if it be replyed vpon him, that he might haue found Scripture to warrant the perſon of God in the appearance of bread; may he not readily anſwer againe, that there is as much Scripture to warrant the perſon of God in the appearance of a ſtone, for that the ſame Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth as expreſly the ſame God by the name of a ſtone, and a rocke, whereof for ought hee knowes, his God may bee a peice? And thus by the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the iudgement of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, ſhall the Idolater be furniſhed with a faire excuſe; and may in the ende be iuſtified
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3715:32"/>
for taking <hi>a tree,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8.17.</note> 
               <hi>and making a fire to warme himſelfe with one part, does make a god of the other:</hi> as wel as they which of the ſame dough fill their bellies with one part, and then fall downe in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration before the other. So as this renouncing of common Senſe, what is it but to cut in ſunder the ſtrings of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence (wherewith hee leads men in and out before Him, like a flocke of ſheep,) and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to peruert the rule, and bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpheme the proceedings of His Iuſtice? True indeed, the Scripture often tells vs, that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſedome and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is vanitie, fooliſhnes, yea, enmity with God; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the wiſedome of moſt men is fooliſhneſſe indeed, and partly becauſe in compariſon with Gods wiſedome, the beſt
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:3715:32"/>
is but fooliſhneſſe: but princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally, becauſe vnder the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of vnbeleefe, malice, and concupiſcence, it is abuſed, peruerted, and made enmity with God, as a weapon in the hand of a rebell becomes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt his Prince: But ſhall we therefore from theſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like reſpectiue, comparatiue, and abuſiue ſpeeches, proceed abſolutely to fruſtrate and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null the faculties themſelues? Becauſe the corruption of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be wrought out, muſt therefore nature it ſelfe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? Or becauſe the light of nature muſt be ſubiect vnto the Faith (and ſo is a Prince to his Phyſitian, or Pilot, in their elements) ſhall therefore the faith cleane put out the light of nature? does ruling ouer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects conſiſt in deſtroying ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects?
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3715:33"/>
cannot my beaſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect vnto me, vnleſſe it falls downe vnder me? or becauſe the Eye cannot heare, ſhall therefore the Eare put out the eye? So becauſe ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cannot lay hold of future things, ſhall therefore the Faith deny their iudgement in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things? yea take away theſe reaſonable powers, and what ſhall become of the Faith? can it be ingrafted into the beaſt? For as the naturall man is the wild oliue, vntill he ſhoots into the true vine; ſo is the faith without effect, and muſt rerurne to Him that gaue it, vnleſſe it finds a reaſonable (though a wild) ſtocke to receiue it, and finde materialls vnto it, Or againe, how ſhall an infidell be conuerted (though in the act of conuerſion theſe naturall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:3715:33"/>
faculties moſt of all muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained) if Senſe and reaſon be thus wholly laid aſide? For the onely meanes which Grace v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto mans conuerſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preaching and miracles: take away Senſe, and what ſhall become of preaching? how ſhall we heare, or how ſhall we read? So againe take away rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and what ſhall become of miracles? how ſhal they mooue admiration and aſtoniſhment, or get acknowledgement? In ſo much as it might bee a ſhort deciſion of this whole cauſe, to retort their argument, and ſay; Common Senſe does acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge no ſubſtantiall change in this bread, nor any manner of miracle whatſoeuer; therefore no ſuch matter in this buſineſſe may bee ſuppoſed. For all the miracles that euer we read of,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3715:34"/>
not onely were acknowledged by theſe naturall faculties, but alſo were immediately directed vnto them, whereby to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaied vnto the heart of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man, toward his conuicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or conuerſion. For the firſt intent of all miracles beeing to conuince vnbeleefe; either in whole, as in the vnbeleeuer, or in part, as in the weake belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: As for the vnbeleeuer; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can poſſibly come at him but that which this naturall light (beyond which he hath no capacity) can entertaine: and as for the weake beleeuer; conſidering that weakeneſſe of faith is (in degree) a want of faith, neither againe can he be outwardly wrought vpon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the remoouing that his weakenes, but by thoſe manner of meanes which can in ſome

So as thoſe manner of miracles which this outward light of nature cannot acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, muſt needs be as vaine (and therefore not of Gods working,) as to point out the way to a traueller, and then to put out his eyes: the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of all miracles beeing this; outwardly to point vnto that ſupernaturall power, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Grace onely does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale.

man for him, let him be taught for a preparatiue to beleeue, that hee thus daily takes the forme of a peice of bread for him; and ſo not only the means ſhall prooue incomparably more hard to brooke, then the end, moſt prepoſterouſly, but alſo that which was intended to comfort, or (ſuppoſe) to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the weake faith, ſhall ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme and breake the backe of the ſtrongeſt faith: though (who knowes not) the intent of this Sacrament is to refreſh and nouriſh, not to exerciſe the faith; and that the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ſhould be by ſupplying new ſtrength, and producing more plaine euidence; not by increaſing the burthen, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perplexing the Senſes. Laſt of all, what intent or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit can there be imagined for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3715:39"/>
the behoofe of man, which our Sauiour cannot effect vnto vs without his bodily preſence? yea, the leaſt miracle that euer we read of, and whereunto the Omnipotence of God did leaſt of all deſcend, were it but the ſofteſt voice, or the reaching forth of a hand, &amp;c. would it not far more mooue and worke vpon the hearts of men, (were miracles now to be expected,) then this all-ſurpaſſing Reall-preſence, and moſt ſtupendious concurring operations? Wee conclude then, that no poſſible or imaginable intent of this our Sauiours Ordinance, does take any the leaſt furtherance by theſe manner of ſuppoſes, but rather is vtterly oppreſſed and confounded thereby. For whereas the principall intent thereof, is to put vs in minde,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3715:39"/>
that He tooke the forme of a man for vs: what doe theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, but teach the flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, namely, that Hee hath left the forme of a man, and hath betaken vnto Him the forme of common bread; yea, not onely the intent of this Sacrament, but euen the foundation of the Chriſtian faith is diſtempered; and (as much as in man lyes) o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerturned hereby. For if Hee that is a perfect man, ſeemes to be a morſell of bread; if Hee ſeemes to be bodily eaten, and ſeemes to be chewed with the teeth, when indeed Hee is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo eaten, chewed, or any way touched: ſhall not men hereby learne to imagine, that likewiſe when He was here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, He might ſeeme to be a man, and yet was not; ſeemed to bleed, ſuffer, and die, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3715:40"/>
yet indeed did not; and ſo the life and power of our Saluation to come to nothing? If then neither the words of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, nor any imaginable mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them doe inforce this Reall-preſence, where is the Scripture that muſt make vs put out our eyes, and renounce all our wits for gain-ſaying it? or that Scripture which tells vs <hi>that wee muſt eate His fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> does it of neceſſitie bind vs to beleeue, that here it is in the forme of bread? as if the true eating of this fleſh indeed, did not conſiſt in our onely belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing on Him, and that before euer we taſt of this Sacrament?

ſuppoſe that the Diſciples were ſo fully reſolued of our Sauiours deity, as that therfore at this ſupper they made no maruell at any thing which He ſaid or did.

be ſo vnmindfull of the weake beleefe, which future times are more and more ſubiect vnto, as in their Epiſtles and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpells to leaue no mention of theſe wonders, concurring at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Sacrament, and beeing of ſuch neceſſitie to be beleeued? which alſo had they with many repetitions and inculcations put poſterity in mind of, yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen inſerted into their Creed, yet all would haue been little e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to haue procured vnto it the meaneſt degree of vnfained beleefe.

partly becauſe they haue no ſuccour left, where-vnder to ſhelter themſelues, but this pretence; and partly for that by this kind of ſearch, they hope to gaine time, and neuer come to an end.
