         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:3930:3"/>
from God to Iſrael;
and each of thoſe follow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

fauours to his people; They
anſwere him with their ſinnes,
hee replies vpon them with
Iudgements; and all of theſe
are in their height; the fauours
of God are ſuch as hee askes.
What could be more; the ſins
are aggrauated by thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours;

Grapes and diſappointment?
And the Iudgements muſt be
aggrauated to the proportion
of their ſinnes, what worſe
then the Hedge taken away,
the Wall broken, the Vinyard
troden downe, and eaten vp:
Let vs follow the ſtepps of

                  <p>God and wee beginne with
fauours; fauours not meane

in a right-downe affirmation,
but in an expoſtulatorie, and
ſelfe-conuincing Queſtion;
<hi>What could haue beene done
more to my Vineyard that I haue
not done to it?</hi> Euery word is
a new obligation. That Iſrael
is a Vineyard is no ſmall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour

Vineyard, is yet more; that it
is Gods Vineyard ſo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely

Iſrael is no vaſt Deſert, no

Fenne, no barren Heath, no

a Soyle of vſe and fruit.
Looke where you will in

Wine which cheareth God

cheared with Wine? It is an
high hyperbole; Yet ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the God of truth; I
<hi>will drinke no more of the fruit
of this Vine, till I drinke it new
with you in my Fathers kingdom,
Mat.</hi> 26. 29. It muſt needes be
an excellent liquor which is
vſed to reſemble the ioyes of

Whiles wee continue
Vines it is not in the power of
our imperfections, to loſe our
thankes; The delicateſt Grape
cannot bee ſo relliſh-ſome to
the palate of man, as our poore
weake obediences are to the
God of mercies. Thou haſt
rauiſhed my heart, my Siſter,
my Spouſe, thou haſt rauiſhed
my heart; ſaith Chriſt of his
Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. The Vine
is a noble plant, but a feeble
and tender one; Other trees
grow vp alone out of the
ſtrength of their owne ſap;
this grouels on the ground,
and rots if it haue not an Elme
to prop it; Like as Man, the
beſt creature, is in his birth
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3930:7"/>
moſt helpleſſe; and would
preſently die without outward
ſuccours; Such is the Iſrael
of God; the worthieſt peece
of Gods Creation; yet of it
ſelfe impotent to good; here
is no growth, no life but from
that Diuine Hand; Without
Me can yee do nothing: They
are no Vines that can ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
thoſe proud Spirits, as
they haue no need of God, ſo
God hath no intereſt in them;
His Iſrael is a Vineyard; and
the Vine muſt be propped.</p>
                  <p>As a Vineyard, ſo Gods
Vineyard. The Church ſhall
be ſure not to be Maſterleſſe:
There is much waſte ground
that hath no Owner; our
Globe can tell vs of a great
part of the World, that hath
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3930:8"/>
no name but <hi>Incognita,</hi> not
knowne, whether it haue any
inhabitant; but a Vineyard
was neuer without a Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor;
till <hi>Noah</hi> the true <hi>Ianus</hi>
planted one, there was no
newes of any; Come into
ſome wilde Indian Forreſt all
furniſhed with goodly Trees,
you know not whether euer
man were there; Gods hand
we are ſure hath beene there;
perhaps not mans; but if you
come into a well dreſſed Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
where you ſee the Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lockes
equally ſwelling, the
ſtakes pitcht in a iuſt height &amp;
diſtance, and the Vines, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly
pruned, now it is eaſie to
ſay (as the Philoſopher did
when he found Figures) Here
hath bin a man, yea a good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3930:8"/>
There is an vniuerſall
prouidence of God ouer the
World; but there is a ſpeciall
eye, and hand of God ouer
his Church: In this God chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth
a peculiar intereſt that
is his (as wee heard worthily
this Day) in a double right, of
Confederation, of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
Iſrael is my Sonne, yea
my firſt borne, ſaith God to
<hi>Pharaoh:</hi> Thou haſt brought
a Vine out of Egypt, thou haſt
caſt out the heathen and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, 80. 8.</p>
                  <p>Oh the blaſphemous diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of fooliſh men! Can we,
dare we impute ill husbandry
to the God of Heauen? Hath
God a Vineyard, and ſhall he
not tend it? Shall hee not
mightily protect it? Goe on,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3930:9"/>
yee Foxes, yee little Foxes,
to ſpoile the tender Grapes;
Goe on yee Boares of the
Wood to waſte this Vineyard,
and ye wild beaſts of the field
to deuoure it; our ſinnes, our
ſinnes haue giuen this ſcope
to your violence, and our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie:
But yee ſhall once
know that this Vineyard hath
an Owner; euen the mightie
God of <hi>Iacob;</hi> euery cluſter
that you haue ſpoiled ſhall be
fetcht backe againe from the
bloudie Wine-preſſe of his
wrath: And in ſpight of all
the gates of Hell, this Vine
ſhall flouriſh. Euen ſo, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
we beſeech thee, O God
of Hoſts; looke downe from
Heauen and viſit this Vine:
and the Vineyard which thy
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3930:9"/>
right hand hath planted: and
the branch that thou madeſt
ſtrong for thy ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Yee haue ſeene Iſrael a
Vineyard, and Gods Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
now caſt your eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the fauours that God hath
done to his Vineyard Iſrael;
ſuch, as that God appeales
their owne hearts for Iudges;
<hi>What could haue beene done more
to my Vineyard that I haue not
done?</hi> Marke, I beſeech you;
Hee doth not ſay, <hi>What could
haue beene done more then hath
beene done, but, more, that I haue
not done;</hi> challenging all the
acts done to his Vineyard for
his owne; as the Soyle is his,
ſo is all the Culture; Hee that
elſe where makes himſelfe the
Vine, and his Father the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3930:10"/>
here, makes Iſrael
the Vine, and himſelfe the
Husbandman; nothing is, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can bee done to his
Church that paſſeth not his
hands: My Father ſtill wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
ſaith hee, and I worke.
This worke, this care knowes
no end, no limits. Many a
good Husband ouer-taskes
himſelfe, and vndertakes
more, then his eye can ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke,
or his hand ſway; and
therefore is faine to truſt to
the menagement of others;
and it ſpeedes thereafter. But
the Owner of this Vineyard
is euery where; and workes
where euer he is; nothing can
paſſe his eye, euery thing muſt
paſſe his hand; This is the
difference betwixt <hi>Salomons</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3930:10"/>
Vineyard, and his that is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then <hi>Salomon; Salomon</hi> lets
out his Vineyard to Keepers,
<hi>Cant.</hi> 8. 11. Chriſt keepes his in
his owne hand; Hee vſeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the helpe of Men, but
as Tooles, rather then as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents,
he workes by them, they
cannot worke but by him; Are
any of you great Ones, Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours
to his Church (a rare
ſtile I confeſſe in theſe not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
but ablatiue times) yee
are but as the hands of the
Subalmoners of Heauen: God
giues by you: Are any great
Potentates of the earth ſecret
or open perſecutours of his
Church: <hi>Aſhur</hi> is the rod of
my wrath, ſaith God; They
are but as Gods pruning
Kniues, to make his Vine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3930:11"/>
bleede out her ſuperfluous
iuice: God cuts by them:
He is the Author of both, men
are the inſtruments. To him
muſt we returne the prayſe of
his mercie in the one, and in
the other, the awe of his
iudgements, what euer is done
to his Church, God doth it
himſelfe. Neither doth hee
ſay, <hi>What could I haue done more
that I haue not done,</hi> as our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Tranſlation reads it, with
a reference to his abſolute
power; according whereto,
we know that he can do more
then hee doth, more then hee
will doe, but (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Would God ſet his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

Power vpon it, we know
hee could make all the World
Iſrael; he could make all Iſrael
Saints, hee could haue made
Deuils men, men Angels. But
God vſes not to proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the rule of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Omnipotencie, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Oeconomie of
his moſt holy, moſt wiſe, moſt
iuſt Decrees: Whereby hee
hath chalked out vnto men
thoſe wayes, and helpes of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation,
which hee ſees fit for
the attainment of that end;
theſe are they wherein he hath
not beene fayling to his Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe hee ſayes, <hi>What
could haue beene done more that I
haue not done?</hi> See what no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
God takes, and what rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3930:12"/>
hee keepes of all the
good that hee doth to any
Church or people; he files vp
all his bleſſings; Hee is boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
not profuſe; open-han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but not ſo as that his lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſe
makes him reſpectleſſe
or forgetfull of his beneficen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
hee giues not like the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of <hi>Fortune,</hi> blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
or, like an Almoner in a
throng, hee knowes not to
whom; he notes both the man
and the fauour; In our gifts,
our left hand may not know
what our right hand doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
our weakneſſe is ſubiect
to a proud-ſelfe-conceit, and a
miſ-opinion of too much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
in the Receiuer; but
he, whoſe infinite goodneſſe
is not liable to any danger of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3930:12"/>
thoſe infirmities which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
our ſinfull nature, ſets all
his mercies on the ſcore, and

to an other I deliuered

ſtrong, Bee ſure, if
we be forgetfull, God will not
miſ-reckon his owne mercies:
Our fauours are (like our
ſelues) poore and impotent,
worthy to bee ſcribled vpon
the Sand, that they may bee
waſht off with the next waue,
his, are full of goodneſſe, and

Honourable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued,
Why doe not we keepe

How ſhould wee meditate

that they ought to bee had in

ſhould wee gratefully recount
his fauours, and call the World

vnthankfulneſſe; the familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie

Alas, thy mercies haue not
beene ſowne, but buried in vs;
We haue beene gulfes to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

we ſmart, becauſe wee forget.
How iuſtly are thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

                  </p>
                  <p>What then is it, O Lord,
what is it that thou haſt done,
then which more could not
bee done for thy Vineyard?
Thou beſt knoweſt thine own
mercies, and canſt beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:3930:14"/>
them: thou that wouldſt
not haue vs ſearch into thy

ignorant of thy fauours: thoſe
are particularized in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
words: In thy choice. In
thy fence, In picking, In plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
in ouerſight, in preſſing;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, there is the aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the place choſen; where
hath hee ſetled his Vineyard
but vpon a very fruitfull Hill?
A double aduantage, An hill,
and very fruitfull: Hils are
held beſt for Vines; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliuitie
whereof giues much
ſtrength to the reflexion; ſo
as the moſt generous Vines
are noted to grow vpon the
hils. Yet, there are barren hils;
nothing but heapes of vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
ſands; this is a fruitfull
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3930:15"/>
hill, yea ſuperlatiuely fruitfull,
the home of the Son of oyle,
as it is in the originall; that is,
by an Hebraiſme; an hill emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
fat and fertile.</p>
                  <p>But what would it auaile
the ground to bee fruitfull,
if it bee vnfenced, that the
wild Bore, or the Foxes may
ſpoyle it: as good no fruit as
to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Loe then here, Secondly,
both an hedge, and, leaſt that
ſhould not bee ſufficient, a
Wall.</p>
                  <p>But to what purpoſe ſhould
it be fenced with ſtones with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
if it bee choaked with
ſtones within; As therefore
thirdly the ſtones were laide
together in the Wall, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence;
So they were gathered
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3930:15"/>
off from the ſoyle to auoide
offence.</p>
                  <p>But to what purpoſe is the
fruitfulneſſe, fencing, ſtoning,
if the ground yeeld a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Crop of Bryers, Thiſtles,
Weedes? <hi>Iniuſſa vireſcunt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina;</hi>
ill Weedes grow faſt;
here is therefore, Fourthly,
the maine fauour to this Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
that the owner hath
planted it with choiſeſt Vines;
It is the praiſe of the Earth, to
ſofter any Plant that is put into
the boſome of it; it is the chief
care of the Husbandman to
ſtore it with Mants of worth:</p>
                  <p>Now all this prouiſion of
ſoyle, Fencing, Stoning, Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
were nothing without a
continual ouer-ſight; the wiſe
owner therfore. Fiftly, builds,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3930:16"/>
not a Bowre, not a Banque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
houſe, for pleaſure, but a
Towre for ſuruay; and that
not in ſome obſcure Angle,
but in the midſt of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,
that hee may view the
carriage of his labourers, and
deſcrie the firſt danger of the
annoyances.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to what purpoſe
were all this choyce, Fencing,
Stoning, Planting, ouer-ſight,
if when the Grapes are grown
to their due ripeneſſe, they
ſhould not bee improued to
an vſefull Vintage, this muſt
be done by the Wine-preſſe;
That is ſet vp: and now, what
can remaine, but the ſetting
vnder of Veſſels to receiue the
comfortable iuice, that ſhall
flow from theſe, ſo well huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded
cluſters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:3930:16"/>
All this hath God done for
his Vinyard, what could haue
beene done more?</p>
                  <p>Not to dwell in the myſts
of Allegories; God himſelfe
hath reade this Riddle. <hi>The
Vineyard of the Lord of hoaſts
is the houſe of Iſrael:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 7.</note> And the
houſe of Iſrael is his Church.
The Church is Gods hill,
conſpicuous for his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fauours (though not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer)
euen to the eye of the
World; not an hidden vnhee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Valley. A fruitfull Hill, not
by nature, but by grace; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
was like it ſelfe, in it, in
the World; God hath taken it
in from the barren Downes,
and gooded it: his choice did
not find but make it thus.</p>
                  <p>Thus choſen hee hath fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:3930:17"/>
it about with the hedge
of Diſcipline, with the wall of
his Almightie protection.</p>
                  <p>Thus fenced hee hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained,
by iuſt cenſures to
picke out of it thoſe ſtones of
offence, which might hinder
their holy proceedings, and
keepe downe the grouth of
the Vines; whether ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Men, falſe Opinions, or
euill Occurrences.</p>
                  <p>Thus cleared, he hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it with the choyſeſt Vines
of gracious motions, of whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Doctrines,</p>
                  <p>Thus planted, hee hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlookt
it from the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towre
of Heauen, in a carefull
inſpection vpon their wayes,
in a prouident care of their
preſeruation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:3930:17"/>
Thus ouer-looked, he hath
indeuoured to improue it by
his ſeaſonable Wine-preſſe in
reducing all theſe powers and
fauours, to act, to vſe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by fatherly corrections,
or by ſuggeſting meet oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of practice; And now
hauing thus choſen, fenced,
cleared, planted, watched, and
ordered to ſtraine his Vines,
hee ſayes moſt iuſtly what
could haue beene done more
that I haue not done?</p>
                  <p>Certainely it is not in the
power of any humane appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
to conceiue what act
could be added to perfect his
culture, what bleſſing could
bee added to the indearing of
a Church. If hee haue made
choyce of a people for his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3930:18"/>
owne; If he haue bleſſed them
with good gouernement,
with ſafe protection, If he haue
remoued all hinderances of
their proficiencie; If hee haue
giuen them wholeſome inſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ructions,
and plide them with
ſolicitations to good; If his
prouident eye haue beene e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ouer them for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerances;
If laſtly, he haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
both faire &amp; foule meanes
to wring from them the good
iuice of their obedience; Say
men are Angels. What could
haue beene done more? What
Church ſo euer in the World
can make good to it ſelfe theſe
ſpecialities of mercie, Let it
know that God hath abated
nothing to it of the height of
his fauour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:3930:18"/>
Theſe are the fauours
wherewith God hath begun
to Iſrael, now turne your eares
to the anſwere that Iſrael re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes

I looked that it ſhould bring

wilde grapes? A wofull iſſue
of ſuch bleſſings: wild grapes,
and that with the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

                  <p>Two vſual faults doth God
find with any vicious Tree;
No fruit, Ill fruit, The one in

Had only Maples, or Thornes,

therefore, gather you, O Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not worthy to be loued;
and caſt backe your eyes vpon
thoſe incomparable fauours,
wherewith God hath prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,

in which, I dare boldly ſay we

How hath hee choſen vs

vs from the reſt of the

wonder of his bountie; what
ſhould I ſpeake of the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
temper of our Clime;
the rich prouiſion of all vſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

Rules of Iuſtice, whether

of our deliuerances
filed vp by the pen of one of
our worthy Prelates.</p>
                  <p>How hath hee giuen vs
meanes to remoue the rubs of
our growth; and to gather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the ſtones of falſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
of hereticall prauitie,
of miſchieuous machinations
that might hold downe his
truth: And, which is the head
of all, How hath he brought
our Vine out of the Egypt of
Popiſh Superſtition, and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it; In plaine termes; how
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3930:23"/>
hath hee made vs a truly-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxe
Church; eminent
for puritie of doctrine, for the
graue and reuerend ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of true Sacraments, for the
due forme of gouernment,
for the pious and Religious
forme of our publike Lytur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie;
with what plentie hath

With what pregnant ſpirits
hath hee furniſht our Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
With what competencie

So as in theſe regards; we may

How hath the vigilant eye

not a darke Lanterne could

and ſhamed the Agents, and

                  <p>Laſtly, how infinitely hath
his louing care laboured to

he ſcruzed vs in the Winepreſſe

                     <hi>Ruffine</hi> tells vs that among the
ſacred characters of the Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
the croſſe was anciently
one, which was ſaid to ſignifie
eternall life; hence their learneder

not wee; but; that it is made the
tree of life to all beleeuers, we are
ſure; This is the onely ſcale of
heauen; neuer man aſcended thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

himſelfe climbd vp to his owne

make our reproch: had not our

no Sauiour for vs; had not our

as to which heauen and earth,

But this, though the ſumme of
the Goſpell, is not the maine drift
of my Text: I may not dwell
in it, though I am loath to part
with ſo ſweet a meditation:
From Chriſt crucified turne your
eyes to <hi>Paul</hi> crucified; you haue
read him dying by the ſword;
heare him dying by the croſſe;
and ſee his morall, ſpirituall, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
crucifixion.</p>
                  <p>Our Apoſtle is two men, <hi>Saul</hi>
and <hi>Paul;</hi> The old man, and the
new; in reſpect of the old man
he is crucified and dead to the
law of ſinne; ſo as that ſinne is
dead in him; neither is it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with euery regenerate. Sin
hath a body, as well as the man
hath, <hi>(who ſhall deliuer mee from
this body of death? Rom.</hi> 7. 24. A

body that hath limmes, and

the limmes of our humane body,

that are made of corruption, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
vncleanneſſe, inordinate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
&amp;c.</hi> The head of ſinne
is wicked deuices; the heart of
ſinne, wicked deſires; the hands
and feet of ſinne, wicked execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
the tongue of ſin, wicked
words; the eyes of ſinne, luſtfull
apprehenſions; the forehead of

ſpeaks not this ſingularly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

it was the body of ſin; not the life
of ſinne; a body of death, not the
life of that body; Or if this body
had yet ſome life, it was ſuch a
life, as is left in the limmes when
the head is ſtruck off; ſome dying
quiuerings, rather as the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of a life that was, then any
act of a life that is: Or, if a further
life, ſuch a one as in ſwounds,

and fits of epilepſie, which yeelds
breath, but not ſenſe; or if ſome
kind of ſenſe, yet no motion, or
if it haue ſome kinde of motion

ouer vs. What power, motion,
ſenſe, reliques of life are in a fully
crucifyed man? ſuch a one may
waft vp and downe with the
winde, but cannot mooue out of
any internall principle.</p>
                  <p>Sinne and grace cannot more
ſtand together in their ſtrength,
then life and death: In remiſſe
degrees all contraries may bee
lodged together vnder one roofe;
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſweares that he dies
daily, yet he liues; ſo the beſt man
ſinnes hourely, euen whiles hee
obeyes; but the powerfull and

O God, if whippings, and haire-clothes,

O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe;</hi> Yet it is
as true, that it is more eaſie to

there is paine in the one, none in

                  <p>The length was from the

him? That reall vnion, then, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>

ours. So as the thornes pierced
our heads, the ſcourges blooded
our backs, the nayles wounded
our hands &amp; feet, and the ſpeare
gored our ſides, and hearts: By
vertue whereof, we receiue iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
from our ſinnes, and true
mortification of our corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.
Euery beleeuer, therefore, is dead
already for his ſins, in his Sauiour;
he needs not feare that he ſhal dy
againe. God is too iuſt to puniſh
twiſe for one fault; to recouer the
ſum both of the ſurety, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall:
All the ſcore of our are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages
is fully ſtrucke off, by the
infinite ſatisfaction of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Redeemer; Comfort thy ſelfe,
therfore thou penitent, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſoule, in the confidence of thy
ſafety; Thou ſhalt not dy but liue,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:3930:59"/>
ſince thou art already crucifyed
with thy Sauiour; He dyed for
thee, thou dyedſt in him; <hi>Who
ſhall lay any thing to the charge of
Gods elect? It is God that iuſtifies?
Who ſhall condemne? It is Chriſt
that dyed; yea rather, that is riſen
againe, and liues gloriouſly at the
right hand of God, making interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for vs:</hi> To thee ô bleſſed Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu,
together with thy Coeternall
Father, and holy Spirit, three
perſons in one infinite, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible
Deitie; be all
praiſe, honour, and glory,
now, and for euer.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
