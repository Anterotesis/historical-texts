         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HIgh words cannot reach the ioy that your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence hath created in our hearts, which doe blesse our eyes for so desired an obiect. Learning doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the mercy of Heaven in bringing your Maiesty to give voyce to the dumbe Academy, and renue the Muses, slaine by that <hi>Briareus</hi> of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which breathes nothing but Religions destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Our <hi>Oxford</hi> hath now throwne off all clouds of discontents, and stands cleare, guilded by the beames of your Maiesties Royall presence. The bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cast on me, is my ioy, or rather the ioy of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cademy, extaside into a learned amazement, and rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into speech to see your Maiesty. All gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation cannot comply with our thoughts, to shew the pleasure our fancie takes to behold your Maiesty. See Royall King, how <hi>Oxford,</hi> beauteous in her age, doth kneele, making teares of ioy a Sacrifice, and begging to be protected from threatned ruine. Shall the Spring of learning bee dam'd up? while igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance doth teare and rend the Muses Garlands, as would both contemne and destroy Schollers: For no enemy can learning have, unlesse it bee the ignorant. Your Royall Maiesty is by descent, a protector of learning, and borne (as your Father was) to bee the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61418:4"/>
glory and defender of the Muses. This may strongly invite your love, wherein wee are already happy in some degrees. But wee feare a malignant enemy should violate our cleare <hi>Minerva,</hi> and banish from her both maintenance and glory. Pure zeale doth make them seeke with one blow to destroy both learning and Religion, now bleeding and wounding by schismaticall heads, and expecting cure from your Royal Maiesty. Yet our feares are great, and groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the unhappy fate of learning, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised of precise Schollers that weare black onely to mourne for the decease of learning. But ioy cannot imagine the time discreet for a iust reproose, and therefore I must tell what pleasure doth refresh and water our thirsty Garden, rather then complaine of scorching heate of persecution. Our memory must not be active in striving to manifest sorrow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with our present ioy. Enlarge rhy selfe therefore <hi>Oxford</hi>: and let not any griefe so blinde thy heart to a stupid peace, but let loud gratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations wound the aire with reporting welcome to our Gracious King CHARLES.</p>
