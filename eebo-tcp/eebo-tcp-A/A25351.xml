            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Behmen</hi> in ſome things, and ye are of his Judgement: But alas! alas! the Concluſions that you have drawn to your ſelves from his Writings, will not profit you; neither doth it make you any jot the more excellent, that ye can talk much of him, and his Books and Writings, being not come to the right Spirit in which is life, which brings men out of dead forms, and vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and by its immediate teachings and power leads them up to God, and teacheth them how to worſhip in ſpirit and truth. What advantage would it be to us if we were able to ſpeak with the tongue of men and Angels, if we through the ſtrength of memorie were able to diſpute and talk of all the lives of the holie men of God, and ſay that we are of ſuch a man<hi>'s</hi> judgement, and knew not that unerring, infallible Spirit of God to lead us thereto? What is all elſe that is done by way of imitation of others, but traditional, and ſuch knowledge as puffeth up, and maketh men Phariſaical, as if they knew much, when in truth they know nothing yet as they ought to know; and ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may pay tithe of Cummin and Anniſeed, be ſtrict and zealous in forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and neglect Judgement, Righteouſneſs and Mercie, the weightier mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law. And friends, this I muſt tell you, That until ye have felt and known the Spirit of Judgement and Burning to paſs upon you as Fullers Sope, and as a Refiners fire, to cleanſe your earthen Veſſels, ye are not fit for the Lord's uſe, neither do you ſerve him in your Ordinances (as you call them) with acceptance, but toil and labour in your vain minds to bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but abominations: It's no better, whatever your conceits are yea, and your ways are as grievous and burthenſome to the Lord's Spirit, as the way of prophaneneſſe, for Hypocriſie is a moſt hateful thing unto the Lord, and to profeſſe Religion by way of tradition, without the Spirit of Life to lead and guide men therein, is no better than to Sacrifice Swines blood, and the cutting off a Dogs neck in this the Day of the Lord. Therefore deceive not your own ſouls by your imaginary righteouſneſs, and ſelf-ſeparation, which exceeds not that of the Scribes and Phariſees, which enter not God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but will be ſhut out as an unclean and unholy thing, amongſt the dogs that are without the Gate of that City wherein dwelleth that righteouſneſſe which God hath choſen and appointed, and is wrought by his own Eternal Spirit: But the ground of your Image is from that root which is evil, of the Enemies planting, and can never bring forth fruit unto God. There is a right ſeed ſown by God in the hearts of men, but ſome falls on the high-ways ſide, and Satan immediatelie cometh and catcheth away the Word out of their hearts, and ſo becomes their Head, and leadeth them to do that which is evil, yet many times under a pretence of Religion, Righteouſneſs, and Zeal for God: And here the Devil works in a Myſtery.</p>
            <p>And thus friends, I may deal plainly with you, there was ſometime in you (I believe) a hungering and thirſting after righteouſneſſe, and from that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, as not knowing the way to attain thereunto, you ſeparated, and ſearched holy Writings, as ye judged, to find out this way, and not keeping to the Light in your own Conſciences, down to that which begat the deſire, which alſo ſhews the way, (and ye ſhould have taken heed unto it, as to a Light ſhining in a dark place, until the day had dawned and the day-ſtar had ariſen in your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45169:3"/>
hearts, which would have given you the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt) ye wandered in your imaginations to find out this way without a Guide, and ſo erred and went aſtray from that which would have manifeſted the waie to you, and in you, and laid hold on that which ſeemed moſt ſuitable to your judgments and underſtandings, which were dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and by how much the more zealous and real ye were in your intentions, by ſo much the more firmlie ye ſtand united and joined to that waie which in your ignorance ye have choſen, and it may be ſomewhat the more faſtened to it, becauſe it may challenge a prioritie of images ſet up in theſe latter days wherein the Myſterie of Iniquitie hath wrought under ſo many divers colour, and forms of Heavens and Heavenlie things. And do ye think that when ye made choice of this your Religion which ye now hold, that the Spirit of this world, the Prince of the power of the air, had not the greateſt intereſt and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling power in you? Or were ye come to know the voice of the true Shepherd in you, from the voice of that falſe prophet which ſate in God's Judgement-ſeat in your hearts, and perverts the right waies of the Lord; if ye are not through God's righteous Judgements upon the Prince of this World in you, come to diſcern and know the true voice of God's Eternal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, from the Spirit of Error and Deluſion in you, which preſents it ſelf (when God's work is to be done) to draw the mind after it, to follow after ſhadows inſtead of ſubſtance; how can ye have confidence that ye are in the right waie, and are not deluded and drawn awaie with the error of the wicked? And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing built upon that foundation, the more abominable your profeſſion is, it being a branch alſo of Myſterie Babylon the Mother of Harlots, who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appears in the dreſſe of the true and chaſt Spouſe, but all to this very end, to hide her Hypocriſie and Deceit, the filthineſs of her hearts Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Whoredoms.</p>
            <p>And what is all the talk and profeſſion of Religion in the world without the preſent teachings and motion of God's Spirit, but dead works, and the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Antichriſt? And all your talking of God's Kingdom, of Salvation and Redemption by the Blood of Chriſt, while ſin and iniquitie lodgeth in your hearts, is no better than to account the blood of Chriſt an unholy thing to cover the Serpent's Head in you: And the Devil can ſay, that Chriſt is the Son of God, and this hurts not his Kingdom; but when the Ax comes to be laid to the root of that tree in man which bringeth forth evil fruit, then all the world is an uproar, and the Devil rageth againſt this Work with all his ſtrength and ſubtilties, for this ſtrikes at the root of his Kingdom; and whoſoever knows the deſtruction thereof in them by the power of God, which is Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the world, they muſt know many ſore combats and bitter conflicts, and the righteous judgements of the Lord God muſt be poured out upon the man of ſin in them; that through the Croſs of Chriſt, the power of God, man may be made willing to forſake the Devil and all his works, and ſo being brought from under Satan's power into the power of God, they may come to know that Seed raiſed in them which bringeth forth fruit unto God, it being that which redeems out of the fall, from under the curſe, and is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for evermore.</p>

Verily Friends, the work of Regeneration is not an eaſie work to fleſh and blood, but is to be known through much ſore travel of ſoul, yea ſuch pains and pangs doth truly accompany that Birth, as the pangs of a woman in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; and this is not a notional thing onely, but truly and really to be felt in the creature, and through death life is to be known: Therefore deceive not your ſelves to think that ye are the people of the Lord, and in a good ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when it is otherwiſe with you; think not I ſay that ye are come to the ſubſtance, but are catching after ſhadows which will not profit your ſouls. And this is my teſtimony to you from the Lord, That ye are not in the truth of God, but out of the way of his ſalvation, yea in that which grieves his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, under Death's power ye are, what images or likeneſſes ſoever ye frame to your ſelves, and bring forth, and what ſervices ſoever ye perform, and not from the preſent teachings of God's Spirit, are but abomination in the ſight of the Lord. And the more ye do ſtruggle and ſtrive in your unregenerate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and utter words without knowledge, the more are your underſtandings darkned, and alienated from the life of God, and the Common-wealth of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and are enemies to God in your minds by reaſon of wicked works, and the ſpirit of bondage is over you, which crucifies the juſt. Therefore repent and return from the evil of your waies, that you may be redeemed from the vanity of your minds, and know a change wrought in your hearts by the Word of God, which is quick and powerful, ſharper than any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder between the ſoul and the ſpirit, the joints and the marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, which Word liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
            <p>And think not I ſay, that your imaginations from <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi>'s Writings about baptizing of Infants, have any more authority or ground from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of truth given forth by the Spirit of God, neither is it of more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to you, than the Croſſes ſet up by <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the High-ways, and on the top of Steeple-houſes, are to deſtroy ſin, and ſave your ſouls, which were ſet up in the daies of Apoſtacie from the truth; for here is the riſe and ground of Images, when men went from the truth of God within, then the Devil which draws the mind into viſible things of this world where he works) perſwades them to ſet up ſome likeneſſes without, which may pleaſe the carnal and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual part, to feed that Birth which is of the fleſh, and ſtands at enmity againſt God, and ſo in the apoſtacie, when people forſook the Croſs of Chriſt the power of God, that deſtroys ſin in the fleſh, then inſtead of that, up comes all ſorts of Croſſes without, and ſo the like of other pictures and images ſet up and worſhipped by men of corrupt minds; and inſtead of the new birth ſpoken of in the Scriptures, which is of Water &amp; the Spirit, without which none can be ſaved, which is irkſome &amp; grievous to ſuch as are grown old in ſin and iniquitie; therefore a more eaſie invention is found out, to make children Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by ſprinkling a little water upon them, before they know the right hand from the left; and ſo under the Name of Chriſtians, live in the abomination of Heathens all the daies of their lives, which profiteth them ſo much as the talking of God's ſalvation doth profit him that lives in ſin and iniquitie, which is onely ſo much as for a man to have a name that he lives, while he is dead.</p>
            <p>

And as for your <hi>Mediums</hi> that you work by, they are little leſs then new Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours which ye have begotten in your carnal imaginations and reaſonings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the things of God, not knowing him who is the way, the truth and the life, who is that Bread which came down from God out of Heaven, upon which he that is born of God feeds, and is nouriſhed up unto eternal life; but that which is born of the fleſh, ſavours the things of the fleſh, and feeds upon that which muſt die and come to an end, and comes not to know the bodie and blood of Chriſt to be meat and drink indeed; and except ye eat his fleſh and drink his blood, ye have not life in you: But this is too hard a ſaying it may be, for you who have ſed ſo long on Husks, upon that food which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, that ye cannot reliſh that food which liveth and abideth for ever: And have you that life in you, or elſe ye are dead in ſins and treſpaſſes: And is that Fountain of water opened in you, that ſpringeth up unto everlaſting life? Or elſe ye are drie and barren, and without fruits unto God. And do ye eat his fleſh? and do ye drink his blood? and are ye lead by his ſpirit? Or elſe ye are none of his. And where then is the Man Chriſt, the Bodie prepared to do the will of God? Or elſe you are uſing your <hi>Mediums</hi> as dead works, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this new and living waie, and ſo ſeek the living amongſt the dead, to get qualifications into your ſouls, as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> would give money for the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, a corrupt price for a heavenlie purchaſe. And is the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and Blood of Chriſt too hard for you, and unſuitable to that birth which ye are of, and therefore is moſt agreeable to that ye feed upon, Bread and Wine, and plead for Bread and Wine as thoſe that know no better food, but that which feeds that birth which is after the fleſh, and muſt die, and lives up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhadows after the ſubſtance is come? And what birth do you feed with your bread and wine, is it not that which luſteth, and ought not to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? For that birth which is of God, hungers and thirſts after the living preſence of the Lord, &amp; is therewith onely ſatisfied. Therefore trie and examine wel this matter, whether ye are in the Faith of God, and elect in that nature which pleaſeth God, or elſe your eating and drinking, and ſacrificing, is no better than the plowing of the wicked, which is ſin.</p>
            <p>And as for your <hi>Mediums</hi> and working-Inſtruments that ye uſe as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the conveyance of God<hi>'s</hi> Grace and vertue into your ſouls, introduced by waie of example from the Miracles done by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the old Prophets, by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, by outward means, ye being not in the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God by which the noble acts of the Lord were done: In you it tends to no other end but to ſet or keep up ſomewhat of men<hi>'s</hi> inventions above the preſent teachings and power of God, which is the beginning of falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and leads to ſet up the Creature above the Creator, and to exalt that birth which is after the fleſh, above that which is of the Spirit; for whence comes all the worſhipping of Saints, and the Heavenly Hoſt (as they call it) amongſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as the means and way to get into God's favour, but from him who firſt taught people to worſhip ſtrange gods, and to ſet up the traditions of men above the Commands of Jeſus Chriſt, who ſaith, <hi>Come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will refre</hi>ſh <hi>you;</hi> he who faith, <hi>I am the way, the truth and the life, appointed of God unto ſalvation; and there is</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45169:4"/>
               <hi>not another Name under Heaven whereby men can be ſaved.</hi> But in days of old there was a people that diſigently ſearched the Scriptures which teſtified of him, and thought therein to find life, but would not come unto him who hath the words of eternal life, that they might receive life from him; but would have it in their own way from the Scriptures as their <hi>Mediums:</hi> And what is the end of all their attainments, but onely this, they grew wiſe to do evil, and crucified the Lord of life.</p>
            <p>And what can ye with all your Mediums do, as to the deſtroying of ſin, &amp; ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving your ſouls, more than the ſons of <hi>Sceva,</hi> the Vagabond <hi>Iews,</hi> the Exorciſts could do to caſt out Devils by way of imitation, in the name of that Jeſus whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, whom they knew not to be the power of God unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to every one that believes; and there is not another Mediator between God and Man, but Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the world, unto whom ye muſt all come, as to that Original Fountain of Life from whence all good doth flow; and wait to know his voice in you, which will teach you the way of God more perfectly, and not to boaſt of other mens lines, but to come down out of all your imaginations, in the ſilence of fleſh to wait to hear his voice, who is able to inſtruct you in the way of life, and teach you to do the will of God in earth as it is in Heaven; and whatever ye do without him, it's no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <hi>Cain's</hi> Sacrifice, which finds not acceptance with God: And all your treaſuring up of wiſdom and knowledge in your unregenerate nature, which is not from the preſent teachings of God<hi>'s</hi> Spirit, (who knows what is fit for you will profit you no more than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> gathering of Manna beyond God<hi>'s</hi> command, did profit them, and it is no better than the treaſuring up of wrath againſt the day of wrath and revelation of God<hi>'s</hi> juſt Judgements up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all ungodly men, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs. Therefore come down to him who is meek and lowly in the heart, unto the appearance of Chriſt Jeſus in you, who is come a Light into the world, and follow him who reproveth the world of ſin, that by it ye may be lead into all truth. And know aſſuredly, that until ye come to the Light, to walk in the Light, ye are not the children of God, but abide in darkneſs, and the Prince of this world rules in your hearts, as in other the children of diſobedience. And let not the ſhame of the Croſs affright you alſo from the Crown of the Kingdom, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not by obſervation, but is within you; and the Word nigh, in the heart and in the mouth, which diſcovereth to man his thoughts, wil onely ſhew you the way; and unleſs ye come to know Chriſt in you the hope of glory, all other hopes are but as the hope of the hypocrite, that ſhall periſh.</p>
            <p>And as to the neceſſity that ye ſeem to place in your Mediums of Water, Bread and Wine, as if a man could not be ſaved without them, by way of Query ſomething farther propoſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Whether ye own</hi> Tranſubſtantiation, <hi>and judge it to be the body and blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth from all ſin, and ſo ſet up the Creature above the Creator?</hi>

2. <hi>Or whether ye uſe them as ſigns and figures of good things to come, as not knowing him come who is the Subſtance?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Or whether ye uſe them as helps to ſalvation, accounting the blood of Chriſt the Light of the world, inſufficient to deſtroy ſin, and to ſave your ſouls?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Or whether ye have notſet up an imagination in your minds about the way of God's Salvation, and reſolve to have ſalvation in your own way, and to oppoſe that which is contrary to it, as men do that know not the preſent teachings of Gods Spirit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Or whether do you think that Chriſt hath left the work of God's ſalvation to any Creature, and is not the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever, the alone Saviour of the world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Or whether the Myſterie of Gods Kingdom be hid from you, and ſo its beyond your Capacities, and therefore with them that perish, you'l feed upon mortals, upon that which muſt dye, and reject him who is the Word of God, that liveth and abideth for ever, that Bread which came down from God out of Heaven, Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World, the onely way to the Father?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Try and examine well theſe things, and let the witneſs of God in your own conſciences be anſwerd in every particular, that ſo you may no longer live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Death's power, but repent and be converted unto the power of God, which is onely able to deſtroy ſin, and ſave your ſouls, as witneſſed by</p>
