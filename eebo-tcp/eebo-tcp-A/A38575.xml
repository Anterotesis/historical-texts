            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>LEſt any, lighting upon this Treatiſe, ſhould won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what Motives or Provocations made me bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
my ſelf in this Controverſie about Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
I ſhall as Conciſely as Truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
the World with the Riſe and Occaſion
of it. 'Tis now much about ſixteen years ſince ſome men
have fallen into a kind of Excommunicating Frenzy (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſpecious Title of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, and as they
contend, ſacred <hi>in it ſelf,</hi> and enjoyn'd the Church by God)
and fain would they have the whole Church tainted with
the like; that the manner of it (<hi>they propoſe</hi>) ſhould be
thus: That a ſelect number of Elders ſhould ſit in the
name of the whole Church, and judge who were fit and
who unfit to be admitted to the Lords Supper. I could not
but wonder to ſee them conſulting of ſuch matters, at ſuch
a time when we had neither fit perſons to excommunicate,
or to be excommunicated: for ſcarce a thirteenth part of
the people underſtood and approved of the Doctrine <hi>of the
Reformation which was then but blooming;</hi> the reſidue
were our profest Enemies: ſo that no man, who had his
<pb facs="tcp:61349:3"/>
wits about him, but must needs ſee that ſuch a matter must
unavoidably introduee dangerous Diviſions among us.
And therefore I thought it not then ſo proper an Enquiry
how ſome might be ſhut out of the Church, as how more
might be brought in; and that the best thing we could
apply our ſelves to, would be the propagating <hi>ſaving</hi> Truths.
Beſides, they who were to be the Superviſors, were not ſo
much ſuperior to the others, in Age, Experience, Parts, Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
Virtue, or Eminency, that they could manage ſo
weighty a matter with that Port and Dignity that was
requiſite. Since therefore I ſaw that their deſires could
not have the labour'd Effects, without the Churches Ruine
and Subverſion, I was ever and anon cautioning them, that
they ſhould weigh well what they did, and not raſhly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
what they might after too late repent. But though
as yet I verily thought that Excommunication had been a
thing commanded in the Scriptures, yet I did not find it
commanded after that manner that they propoſed: So that
ſince Christ ſeemed <hi>to me</hi> to have left us at large for the
manner of it, I ſet my thoughts on work what might be
the best way and courſe under our circumſtances, and
would be attended with the least Diſtractions <hi>and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies;</hi>
which I did with the cloſer application and
diligence, upon ſome Reflections that I had, how fatal and
turbulent to Chriſtianity this had formerly proved, and was
ſtill little better, <hi>as it was managed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whilst I was upon theſe thoughts, and look'd a little
back upon what the Antients had writ on this ſubject, I find
it weaker in all points than I had before ſuſpected; ſo
that I could not but begin to doubt of the very <hi>thing.</hi> My
next reſort was to the School-men, among whom I met
with as little ſatisfaction. Then came I to our Modern
<hi>Writers,</hi> who no whit mended the matter; nay, I obſerv'd
that they did most manifeſtly differ among themſelves in
ſome things, which quicken'd my diligence in the Enquiry.
<pb facs="tcp:61349:3"/>
So I laid by theſe Commentators <hi>a while,</hi> and betook my
my ſelf to the Scripture; in the peruſal of which, I mark'd
and noted, with all the exactneſs I could, what was diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant
from, and what agreeable unto, the <hi>commonly</hi> recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Opinion. And truly it was no ordinary aſſiſtance to me
in this matter, to take a ſurvey with my ſelf of the ſtate of the
Jewiſh Church and Government: for thus thought I with
my ſelf, God in the 4th Chapter of <hi>Deut. v.</hi> 6, 7, 8. bears
witneſs to their Laws, that there was no Nation that had
Statutes and Judgments ſo righteous, and that for their
Laws <hi>ſake</hi> it ſhould be ſaid of them, Surely this great Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is a wiſe and underſtanding People: Therefore it ſeem'd
neceſſary with me, that to have a Church gloriouſly and
wiſely modell'd, it must make near approaches to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daical
Form. But certain it is, that in this Jewiſh Church
things were never ſo inſtituted by God, as that there ſhould
be diſtinct procedures in the puniſhing Immoralities, one
by the Civil, and another by the Eccleſiaſtical power: What
hinders then, but that even now too, that that Church which
God hath bleſſed with a Chriſtian Magiſtracy, may ſit down
contented under one form of Government?</p>
            <p>I then communicated my thoughts to learned, good, and
pious men, ſo far, as that I preſs'd them not to conſider the
matter ſlightly and curſorily: for I could not but deem it
very unneceſſary that there ſhould be two Heads of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Church, where the Body is but one; and that their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates,
Injunctions, Decretals, and all the Acts of a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Authority, ſhould be diſtinct (as hitherto they have
been) ſo that the Government of one ſhould not be ſubject
to the Inſpection <hi>or Controul</hi> of the other, but both their
Juriſdictions be Chief in their kinds: For ſuch a Church-Senate
or <hi>Convocation of ſelect</hi> Elders would they in
truth have fram'd, that they ſhould have the Supreme
Right <hi>and Power</hi> of puniſhing Vice even in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
themſelves, but not with corporal puniſhments, but
<pb facs="tcp:61349:4"/>
by prohibiting them the Sacrament, first privately; and if
on this they reform'd not, then in a more ſolemn and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
manner. But my Opinion was (as I <hi>always</hi> told
them) That one Supreme Magiſtrate of Gods inſtitution,
<hi>and of the true Faith,</hi> might, <hi>and had as good right,</hi> now,
to reſtrain Vice, as heretofore <hi>under the Law:</hi> And I took
me an inſtance from <hi>Solomon</hi>'s glorious Reign, which was
a kind of Type of the Chriſtian Church's reigning upon
Earth. Now neither under him, nor yet under <hi>Moſes,</hi> the
Judges, or any other the Kings, or when govern'd by the
Optimacy, have we any foot-ſteps of two ſo diſtinct Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<hi>over mens actions and manners.</hi> Nature (ſays <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſculus</hi>)
allows not two abſolute and Independent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(without any ſubordinacy of one to the other) to
Lord it over the ſame people. I must confeſs I received
great Aids and Improvement of theſe my Thoughts from
the perſons with whom I conferr'd them: for in ſome
things their Obſervations out-went my own; and where
they did not, they furniſht me many material hints to
mend them by: But ſtill I kept my ſelf quiet from any
publick Conteſts in this Affair, and entered not into any
Debates about it where I was not provok'd, and then too I
uſed the utmost moderation in the managing them; eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it as diſadvantageous as needleſs to trouble our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
with this Diſpute, when it did not yet appear that any
body had impoſed ſuch a Form of Diſcipline upon them.
But others who think <hi>the reliſh of</hi> Government more ſweet
and pleaſant than <hi>that of</hi> Obedience, could not ſo temper
their <hi>mouths,</hi> but by all the Arts and Inſinuations that they
thought might work our most pious Prince to their deſignes,
they labour'd (as I afterwards underſtood) to introduce
ſomething very like this into our Churches; and had not
other rubs thwarted them, God knows how far they might
have prevailed. Beſides, how did they lie at me all this
while? what Dirt did they throw upon me, onely for that
<pb facs="tcp:61349:4"/>
they knew how averſe I was to their purpoſes, and that I
ſhould not be wanting, according to my best endeavours,
to fruſtrate them? But this I need not here enlarge upon.</p>
            <p>It happened about the ſame time, that an Engliſh-man
(who was then ſaid to have left his Country becauſe he
could not brook a Surplice and ſuch-like Formalities <hi>then
enjoyn'd</hi>) deſiring to commence Doctor, propoſed <hi>in his
Theſes,</hi> Diſputes concerning indifferent matters and <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi>
habits. Now <hi>our</hi> Divines would not admit of this
man <hi>to his Doctorſhip,</hi> for fear of giving diſtaſte to the
Engliſh <hi>Clergy</hi> (though in the latter of his Theſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
was propoſed too relating to this matter); but it
ſeems they thought the peace and tranquillity of our own
Church, a trifle not worth the regarding. And therefore
amongst his other Theſes this was one, That in every Church
that was rightly inſtituted, there ought to be a Government
<hi>or Diſcipline</hi> obſerved, whereby the Miniſtry, in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with Elders for that purpoſe to be elected, ſhould
have right and <hi>authority</hi> to excommunicate any vitious
Liver, even Princes themſelves. Now though I was not
without apprehenſions that this Diſpute was not then taken
up for nothing, yet I hoped withal that no more would come
of it than of an ordinary Diſputation, where the Queſtion
is agitated Pro and Con, not for deciding the matter ſo
much, as to whet and exerciſe the young Diſputants, and
to try how well qualified they are for the Degrees that they
ſtand Candidates for. I therefore ſtirr'd not thither; and
indeed other affairs hindered my being preſent. And for
others, who I ſaw ready to take up the Cudgels, I adviſed
them to have a greater regard to the Churches <hi>Tranquillity,</hi>
than to the Follies of a few; yet ſome diſputed the point
<hi>with them:</hi> But it might have prov'd no more than a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
of courſe, had they not called as well them as me,
Profane, Satanical, Deviliſh Makebates, Enemies to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
and Holineſs, Fanaticks, and what not?</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61349:5"/>
Truly for my ſelf, I can religiouſly ſay, it never enter'd
into my thoughts to ſet Pen to Paper in this matter, till I
both heard and ſaw with what intemperateneſs they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
themſelves both publickly and privately; ſo that I
thought a longer ſilence but a betraying the Truth. But as I
was then more than ordinarily employed (by reaſon of the
ſick Souldiers who return'd from <hi>France</hi> with <hi>Caſimire,</hi> in
the year 1568.) I ſet down my Thoughts but brokenly, as in
the intervals of my Employ, things from time to time oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd
to my mind; which, when I had amaſſed a pretty
deal (though confuſedly and immethodically) together, I
diſtributed and ſubmitted them to the Cenſure of others,
intreating them withal, that if they obſerv'd any thing
falſe, or but weakly maintain'd, they would anſwer the one,
and ſtrengthen the other with better Reaſons. And I hop'd
to gain this (if nothing elſe) thereby, that thoſe of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sentiments would become more calm and moderate upon
the peruſal of what I had writ, and not differ from us far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than they had Arguments to bear them out. One of the
two perſons (with whom I thought of conferring most par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly)
ſaw and read three parts of four before the whole
was tranſcribed; and being then askt what was his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it, he promiſed to give it when he ſhould have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed
the whole. But ſomething, I know not what, he ſaid
by the by of Leaven, and that he thought the Conſent of the
antient Church was to be very much eſteem'd of; and, in
fine, ſome other things did he let fall: whereby 'twas eaſie
for me to make a Judgment of his Opinion in the caſe.
And I learnt quickly after, that the very ſame perſon had
writ a Tract about Excommunication, in maintenance of
the Vulgar Opinion; which made me no longer-doubt what
anſwer I ſhould meet with from him: for I knew him to be
one who was not eaſily brought to retract what he had once
aſſerted. Therefore ſince I had in the latter part of my
Book confuted all his Objections, I preſented it whole to
<pb facs="tcp:61349:5"/>
another perſon, who I thought the best Friend I had in the
world: He not onely took the Book from me with diſdain
and contempt (whether he had an item of it before, I know
not) but he plainly ſaid he ſhould not vouchſafe it a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;
yet I left it with him for ſome days, and beſought
him with all the earneſtneſs and entreaties that I could,
that he would but look it over and give me his Judgment
upon it. But I underſtood upon good grounds that my Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitations
had been fruitleſs. I ſent for my Book about
twelve days after, that I might get others Opinions upon it.
But becauſe 'twas long, and could not be ſo ſoon read over
by many perſons, I contracted it into certain Theſes <hi>or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,</hi>
that I might the better communicate it into many
hands; ſo that hereby I quickly got the Opinion of the
most eminent German Divines; and others who had refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
the reading of it at my request, were at last thus drawn
into it unawares.</p>
            <p>But that it might appear to the World that I ſought after
nothing but the naked Truth, I prefix'd a Preface to it,
wherein I requeſted two things: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That all men would
be pleaſed diligently to examine every point, and weigh it
by the Scale of Holy Writ; and if they ſaw me in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
would endeavour to ſet me right again, that I might
be contributory to ſetting others to rights: I promiſed from
the bottom of my heart (God, the Searcher of hearts, is
my Witneſs) that I would thank him both before God and
man, whoever ſhould ſhew me my Errour. And (becauſe
I foreſaw what after came to paſs) my <hi>ſecond</hi> Request was,
That if they found fault with any thing, that they would
ſo do it, that I might have a just liberty of explaining my
ſelf, and of juſtly defending any thing they ſhould undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly
condemn: for though I had approv'd my ſelf a Friend
to them in all good turns, I could ſcarcely expect like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
again, by what I had before experienced. Nor was I
deceived: for the very men whom I had ſo fondly concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb facs="tcp:61349:6"/>
to have been my best Friends, turn'd ſuddenly my Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and would not ſo much as ſpeak to me, though I had
never through all my life injur'd them in Word or Deed,
but always did and ſtill will ſtudy to oblige them: but
however, I thankt God that I experienced their Conſtancy
and good Will to me, rather in a concern of this, than of
any other nature. But reſtleſs were they; and ſince they
had vainly attempted by the help of the Magiſtrate to call
in theſe Theſes out of the hands where they had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd,
they go another way to work, and deſir'd (under the
pretext of Laws which were never yet heard of) that as
Divines were not to meddle with the Opinions and Rights of
other <hi>Profeſſions,</hi> that it might be enacted and enjoyn'd,
That all of other Profeſſions might be reſtrained from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into their Divinity-Schools. Had this been ask'd
threeſcore years ago, it might have paſs'd well enough; but
how 'twould go down now, let others judge. Are the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
to ſearch the Scriptures, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. and 1 <hi>Joh. 4. 1.
Try the ſpirits whether they are of God;</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſſ. 5. 21.
Prove all things; hold faſt that which is good,</hi> and the
like, Precepts which were given to none but thoſe who teach
Divinity for Hire? I had thought that Chriſtian Divinity
had been a Doctrine common to all men, and was therefore
to be taught every where. But what is it they ask, when
they would have us keep from their Schools? <hi>Do they mean</hi>
as they concern not themſelves in any other Faculties?
Sure they would not have us not to hear their Lectures, or
that we ſhould not come thither to learn? Who I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pray,
ever forbid them to ſtudy the Languages, Philoſophy, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
or Law? But if they care not for, or neglect thoſe Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
must we do ſo by Divinity? Did indeed the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of the Scriptures carry no worſe conſequence with
it, than their ignorance in the other Studies, we might pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radventure
complement them upon that point; or they
might eaſily prevail, if no body must ſpeak against what
<pb facs="tcp:61349:6"/>
they enact and determine. This was a thing that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts
indeed, and by a better Right than they, laid claim
to; but I cannot gratifie either of them herein, ſince Christ
my Saviour has countermanded me.</p>
            <p>Now that, they ſay, it becomes me not to meddle with
matters of Divinity, I value it not; or that I have not a
just regard to my Reputation (as they ſuggest) perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I make not a Gain, or am not hired to ſtudy the Truth:
for were I paid for my Teaching of Divinity, I ſhould do
nothing (as themſelves hold) unſuitable to my Duty and
Function. But in truth I deſire nothing but to have the
Truth underſtood, and God's Name glorified, and my ſelf
expoſed to ſhame, rather than the Truth be kept under deck:
for Christ hath not without cauſe ſaid it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 44. That
they cannot believe, who receive Honour one of another, and
ſeek not the Honour that <hi>cometh</hi> from God onely.</p>
            <p>Therefore when this too fell not out to their minds, and
yet they could no longer ſmother their Animoſities, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to aſſail me with dint of Argument; which upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
they urged not without the ſeverest Reflections <hi>upon
me.</hi> Now though I heard thereof from ſeveral hands, yet,
for Quietneſs and Peace ſake, I eaſily deſpis'd it, hoping to
ſee the day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that when thoſe first Emotions ſhould be over, and
their Paſſions cool, they might ſtand more fair and equally
affected to me. But alas, I was no Prophet here neither;
for, for almost five months after, their Hatred run as high
as ever: nor did they give over baiting me and my Writing,
partly with Clamour and Reproach, and partly with I know
not what Sophiſtical Reaſonings. Therefore taking a ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter
review of my Theſes, which made an hundred before, I
contracted them to Seventy five, and marſhall'd them in a
little better order: Somethings in them I explained more
clearly, and enforc'd them more ſtrongly. And in fine, I
have made it my buſineſs to give as full ſatisfaction to all
Lovers of Truth, as I could in ſo little a Treatiſe.</p>

            <head>A
QUESTION
OF THE
Weightieſt Moment, cleared:
<hi>Whether Excommunication (ſo far as it debars thoſe
who underſtand and make profeſſion of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion from the uſe of the Sacrament, by
reaſon of ſome ſin committed) be of Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
or the Invention of Men?</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">
               <label>POSITION I.</label>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE name of Excommunication ſeems to
be derived from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> cap. 10. and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
an amotion <hi>or ſeparation</hi> from the
Communion; which there, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. is
called the <hi>Communion of the Bloud of
Chriſt:</hi> And in truth, Excommunication
is now defined by almoſt every body, to be an Excluſion
from the ſociety and communion of the Faithful.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Now the company of the Faithful is twofold; <hi>the
one,</hi> Internal and Spiritual; <hi>the other,</hi> External or Viſible,
and Political <hi>or Civil. (For,</hi> for that third ſort which <hi>our</hi>
Modern Papiſts have invented, 'tis neither <hi>of it ſelf</hi> a
well-fram'd one, nor pertinent to <hi>our</hi> preſent purpoſe.)</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:61349:8"/>
III. Now betwixt both theſe, the difference is <hi>at least</hi>
ſo great, that there is no neceſſity that either ſhould be
comprehenſive of each other: for as he may ſtill remain a
Member of Chriſt, who without any juſt cauſe is caſt out
of the viſible Church, or is <hi>otherwiſe</hi> conſtrain'd to take
Covert, and make his abode among Infidels; ſo they that
paſs muſter amidſt the viſible Flock, are not all the Living
Members of Chriſt. Hence does it follow, that thoſe things
may <hi>well</hi> be different which unite us to one and not to the
other, and ſeparate us from the one, and yet not from the
other.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. And indeed we are made the Members of Chriſt,
that is, are joyned to the Internal and Spiritual Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of Chriſt, and of the Faithful, by <hi>that</hi> Faith alone
which worketh by Charity: and <hi>'tis</hi> by Infidelity onely
<hi>that</hi> we fall from this <hi>Conſortſhip.</hi> And therefore no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
can give <hi>us</hi> admiſſion into this Society, or ſhut the
doors upon us, but he that can impart to us a lively Faith,
and again withdraw it <hi>at his pleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. Now 'tis by the Profeſſion of the ſame Faith, by
the Approbation of the ſame Doctrine, and in fine, by the
<hi>promiſcuous</hi> uſage of the ſame Sacraments, that we become
Conſorts and <hi>Fellow-members</hi> of the External and Viſible
Church. He that has theſe three in him, ſo long as he
remains ſuch, is reckon'd for a Member of the Outward
Congregation of the Faithful, albeit he arrives not at
the <hi>farther pitch</hi> of Internal Fellowſhip of the Soul and
Spirit.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. He therefore that is thruſt out from External
Communion with the Church (that is, that is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated)
is debarr'd all three, or two, or but one of
them: But <hi>now</hi> from the two firſt, to wit, the Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Faith, and Aſſent to the Chriſtian Doctrine (under
which <hi>latter</hi> I would include hearing of the Word and
Doctrine) no one ought to be prohibited; but rather <hi>on
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:61349:8"/>
the other hand,</hi> the whole World are to be invited, and by
all the Allurements and Arts <hi>of men, won and brought</hi> into
theſe. There is nothing left then, but that he who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated,
muſt and can (of all the forementioned
three) be onely prohibited from the participation of the
Sacraments: But whether the debarring of all private
Commerce be an unſeparable appurtenant of this, or the
one may be without the other, will be an after-conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
Thus much is certain, that no other puniſhment
hath any thing to do with this Excommunication, as to
the ſubſtance of it: for <hi>as for other Penalties,</hi> they may <hi>as
well</hi> be inflicted on ſuch as ſtand not excommunicate, as
they may not be inflicted on ſuch as ſtand ſo.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Therefore the Papal <hi>Faction,</hi> over and beſides this
Excommunication (which they call the leſſer, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
define it by a bare Excluſion from the Sacraments) do
very improperly to adde any ſecond, which they call the
greater, and anathema; and define it againſt expreſs Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
by interdiction <hi>and ſecluſion</hi> from Temples, from
<hi>all</hi> private Commerce and Converſation, and from all
lawful Tranſaction <hi>betwixt man and man:</hi> for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. plainly ſhews, that neither Heathens nor
any others were precluded from hearing or reading the
Word of God, or from the Thankſgivings or Prayers of
Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. From what has been ſaid, Excommunication is
apparently nothing but a publick and ſolemn Interdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as was ſaid before, <hi>or Excluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from</hi> the Sacraments,
and more particularly the Lords Supper (which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
calls peculiarly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Communion) to the end that
the Sinners may repent, and be again readmitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Here now the Queſtion ariſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether any
perſon be to be prohibited or debarred the uſe and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the Sacraments, upon the account of any <hi>previous</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61349:9"/>
ſin acted <hi>by him,</hi> or for the wickedneſs of his life, if he
himſelf deſires to take the Sacraments with other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?
This Queſtion is meant, of ſuch who profeſs the
ſame <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, is ingrafted into the Church by Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm,
and differs not from her in Doctrinals, (as we ſaid,
<hi>Sect.</hi> 5.) but fails in <hi>point</hi> of Morality and a good Life
<hi>onely.</hi> The Queſtion is therefore this: Whether there
be any footſteps in Holy Writ, of either Precept or Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
whereby ſuch perſons are either commanded or taught
to be debarr'd <hi>acceſs to</hi> the Sacraments?</p>
            <p n="10">X. Our Anſwer is in the Negative, That there is no
ſuch; and that rather there are both Examples and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
too, more than once to be met with in the Bible, of a
quite contrary nature: for we have it from <hi>Moſes, Exod.
23. v.</hi> 14. and 34. <hi>v. 23. Num. 9. Deut. 16. v.</hi> 16. that
every Male that was circumciſed was to appear before God
thrice in the year; that is, in the Feaſt of Unleavened
Bread, in the Feaſt of Weeks, and in the Feaſt of Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles:
And the Law commanded ſtrangers too, <hi>Deut. 9.
v.</hi> 14. (provided they were circumciſed) to celebrate
the Paſſover with the Jews. The unclean alſo, <hi>Deut. 16.
v.</hi> 10. &amp; 13. and thoſe that ſhould be in a Journey afar
off, were commanded to eat the Paſſover the ſame day of
the ſecond month, and in the ſame manner with the Jews.
Nay, 'tis farther added, <hi>v.</hi> 13. that the man that is clean,
and is not in a Journey, and forbeareth to keep the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
even the ſame Soul ſhall be cut off from his People.
'Twas therefore the Will and Command of God, that all
the circumciſed ſhould celebrate it; and God excluded
none from this Sacrament, (nor indeed from any other
Rites, Ceremonies, or Sacrifices) except the Unclean.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. In <hi>Leviticus</hi> ſeveral kinds of Sacrifices are enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
according to the difference of the ſins which the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
was thereby to expiate; whether they were ſins of
ignorance and errour, or voluntarily and knowingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61349:9"/>
In like manner doth God, <hi>Deut. 14. v.</hi> 23. give a
general Command to all, (there's no exception there of
ſinners) <hi>That they ſhould eat the Tythe of their Corn,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>before the Lord in the place which he ſhould chuſe, that ſo
they might learn to fear the Lord their God always.</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
therefore were <hi>to them</hi> Allurements to Piety;
and for that reaſon was no body thruſt from them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was every individual man invited to frequent them.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. In very truth, we do not at all read that any one
among the Jews was either by <hi>their</hi> Prieſts, Levites, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
Scribes, or Phariſees, prohibited acceſs to <hi>their</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices,
Ceremonies, and Sacraments. The Chief Prieſts
and Phariſees counted Chriſt and his Apoſtles bad men
enough, but we never find that they attempted to thruſt
them from their Sacrifices or Sacraments either before or
after Chriſts death; nay, they did not drive out of their
Temple, or from their Ceremonies, ſo much as a Publican
that was a Jew, or any other circumciſed <hi>Proſelyte,</hi> though a
bad liver: for they were not to learn, that this was more
than the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> allowed them to do. Indeed, in
<hi>Mat. 9. v.</hi> 11. they reproved Chriſt for eating and drinking
with Publicans and Sinners; but at no time or place did
they twit him for praying with them in the Temple, for
his frequenting their Sacrifices and <hi>other</hi> Rites, for his
yearly Progreſs with them and others <hi>of the Rabble</hi> to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi>
to celebrate the Paſſover and other Solemnities:
And ſo far were they from any endeavours to put the
moſt cruel Villains, and moſt wicked Hereticks, the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,
from their Ceremonies <hi>and Communion in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
that they even permitted them to climb to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Chief Prieſts: And yet 'tis moſt apparent out of
<hi>Joſephus</hi> and the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> what an <hi>inveterate</hi>
hatred they had for one another. Had it therefore been
lawful, they would with open arms have embraced ſuch
an occaſion of revenging themſelves on their Enemies.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61349:10"/>
XIII. But farther yet, it was not in their power to keep
them from eating the Paſſover: for that was not eaten be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prieſts, but in their private houſes, as we read Chriſt
to have celebrated his laſt Paſſover with his Diſciples. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man was then a Prieſt as 'twere, as <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> bears
witneſs, when ſpeaking of the Paſſover, he tells, That
on that Feſtival every man throughout the Nation ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
<hi>for himſelf,</hi> not expecting <hi>nor tarrying for</hi> their
Prieſts: for the Law indulg'd the <hi>priviledge</hi> of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
to the whole Nation, that on one ſet day every
year they ſhould ſacrifice with their own hands. And
<hi>Exod. 12. v.</hi> 4. 'twas commanded, <hi>That if the Houſhold
were too little for the Lamb, that then he and his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
next unto the houſe ſhould take it according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the Souls,</hi> to the end that the whole might be eaten.
The like ſeems to have been obſerved in <hi>the matter of</hi> Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion,
(excepting in this particular, that they were
not obliged to circumciſe at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> onely, as they were
to celebrate there the Paſſover:) for I do not remember
that the preſence of the Prieſt was requiſite to Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt too, who was the forerunner of
Chriſt, did conſtantly do the ſame: for he baptized not
onely the Phariſees and Sadduces that came unto him
(whoſe behaviour and manners he very well underſtood,
when he publickly called them a Generation of Vipers)
but alſo the Publicans, and all others <hi>that reſorted to him
to be baptized,</hi> to the intent that they repenting them of
their former evil life, might ſet about the amending it, and
ſo might flee from the Wrath to come. 'Tis ſcarce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that ſuch a man as <hi>John</hi> was, ſhould admit of men
of ſuch profligate lives, men that impiouſly, <hi>audaciouſly,</hi>
and publickly denied the Reſurrection of the Dead, had
he not known that the Law forbad not acceſs to ſuch: for
the <hi>Judaical</hi> Law (as has been already ſhewn) prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61349:10"/>
no circumciſed perſons, but the unclean and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prous.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. Beſides, this Uncleanneſs was a Legal Ceremony,
not <hi>any</hi> impurity of Life, or <hi>pravity</hi> of Manners: for not he
who had ſinned, or committed any wickedneſs, was <hi>thereby</hi>
unclean; but the Unclean were thoſe who touched any
dead Corpſe, any Excrements, any perſon that had an
Iſſue of Bloud, or the like. And 'twas for this cauſe that
the Phariſees would not go into the Judgment-hall, when
they had delivered up Chriſt to <hi>Pilate</hi> to be put to death,
leſt they ſhould be debarred <hi>thereby</hi> from eating the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
But ſurely the Moſaical uncleanneſs did not ſo ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pifie
<hi>and repreſent</hi> our iniquities, that as they who were
thereby defiled were ſhut out from the Tabernale, and the
company of others: ſo ſhould it ſignifie that theſe ſins
were to be corrected and puniſht by with-holding the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
and by Excluſion from the Viſible Church; as
appears plainly by what follows: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Even whilſt Legal Uncleanneſs was in force, and
there were then wicked men in abundance, yet were not
the ſame puniſhments appointed for the wicked and for
the unclean. What probability is there then that theſe
Ceremonies ſhould <hi>typifie their puniſhment, or in any ſort</hi>
ſignifie that <hi>Moral Delinquencies</hi> ſhould be thus checkt
and <hi>redreſs'd,</hi> when the Ceremonies themſelves ſhould be
taken away and cancel'd?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Moſes</hi> had plainly been inconſiſtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
had he in fact admitted them to the Temple
and Rituals, whom <hi>at the ſame time</hi> he by thoſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
ſignified that they were to be excluded. For
certain it is, that no one was ever thruſt out of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,
or from the Congregation, for the pravity of his
Manners, if, as the Law commanded, he had neither tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
any dead Body, nor otherwiſe in that nature defiled
himſelf. At this rate therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould puniſh thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61349:11"/>
that were but figuratively unclean, and let ſuch as were
unclean in reality go unregarded; (I mean, as to this
<hi>ſort of</hi> puniſhment.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. That Legal Impurity affected and tainted the Body
alone; whereas wickedneſs conſiſts in the <hi>Internal</hi> acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and operations <hi>of the mind:</hi> for the cauſe and root of
<hi>all</hi> Evil is born with us, and falls not under mans correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whilſt it puts not forth its fruit; for otherwiſe muſt
the whole World be Excommunicate: for we ſhall not get
theſe ſpots out of our Soul, whilſt we breathe mortal air.
But that other Impurity, which is but a bodily ſtain, is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
by being debarr'd Commerce with others, though
there be no other fruit, <hi>no farther evil</hi> ſpringing from that
uncleanneſs, nor he that is defil'd hath done nothing againſt
the Law: <hi>but</hi> for the actions and tranſgreſſions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean,
they were dealt with at the rate of others tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
if the parties under that defilement did any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Law; <hi>and the cleanneſs or uncleanneſs of the
ſinner neither aggravated nor leſſened the moral guilt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Our <hi>very</hi> Adverſaries confeſs, that not all ſorts and
ſizes of ſins are to be redreſſed by Excommunication;
whereas the Law commands that every uncleanneſs be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſht
by Excluſion from the Tabernacle and publick Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices:
ſo that thoſe could not typifie all ſorts of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
            <p n="5">5. No man that ſins unwittingly can be excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but 'twas uſual for men unwittingly to contract un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,
<hi>and not onely</hi> without any blame of theirs, but
to their great grief <hi>and trouble.</hi> What fault was there in
him, who ſleeping, unvoluntarily ſuffered nocturnal Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions?
and where the Wife might unexpectedly fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that condition which the Law made a Pollution to the
Huſband, if he approach'd her? or by the deceaſe of
Children, Wife, or Parents? or the like, which uſually
happened? And now it needs not to be proved that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61349:11"/>
they are onely voluntary <hi>and ſpontaneous</hi> Crimes, for
which perſons may be (as ſome men think) debarr'd
Acceſs to the Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A far ſeverer puniſhment was ordained for him that
killed a man againſt and without any will <hi>or intention of ſo
doing,</hi> than a <hi>naked</hi> ſecluſion from the Sacraments for ſome
few weeks or days: If therefore an <hi>unpremeditated</hi> and
involuntary offence, and by conſequence a ſin of the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
die, underwent a more ſharp and bitter chaſtizement
than the fouleſt Legal Impurities, 'tis plain that the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
for them are not intended to repreſent the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
for <hi>Moral</hi> Iniquities.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It often fell out, that men of the greateſt Sanctity
and Integrity became unclean, and were debarr'd both
from entering into the Temple, and from the uſe of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices;
whilſt on the other hand, men moſt notoriouſly
wicked had admiſſion to either, without controul: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if in the Church of God both ought to undergo the
ſame puniſhment, the latter ſhould rather be ſecluded than
the former.</p>
            <p n="8">8. 'Tis manifeſt that God did at no time or place abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
prohibit all Legal Impurity: for ſome were to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the dying perſons, ſome thoſe that were infected with
an unclean diſeaſe, ſome muſt bury the dead, and in fine,
ſome muſt purifie the unclean, (by which means they
themſelves became defiled, <hi>v. Numb.</hi> 19.) ſo that God
would not that all Legal Impurities ſhould be avoided:
But God prohibited ſins of all <hi>kinds,</hi> and to all men, and
at all times, and never indulg'd the perpetrating any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
action at any time or place whatever.</p>
            <p n="9">9. God commands that ſin ſhould be reſtrain'd by Fire,
Sword, Halters, Stoning, Stripes, Mulcts, Impriſonment,
and other penalties of the like nature; but ordains that
the legally unclean ſhould be purified by ſprinkling and
waſhing with water, and the like, <hi>Numb 19. v.</hi> 17, 18, 19.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:61349:12"/>
10. He that had contracted uncleanneſs according to
the definitions of legal <hi>Pollutions,</hi> and died in that ſtate,
as <hi>for inſtance,</hi> women in their menſtruouſneſs, or men ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
a Gonorrhea or Leproſie on them, were not for that
inroll'd among the wicked, or doom'd to damnation: But
he that ſhall ſo live, that honeſt good men ſhall deem him
worthy of Excommunication, cannot be accounted of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than as a ſinful and impious perſon.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Legal Uncleanneſſes took place <hi>and were regarded</hi>
but with one ſingle People, and <hi>there too</hi> but for a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
time; whereas ſins ſprang up every where, among all
Nations, without diſtinction of place or time. Since
then, as well among all other Nations, as among the Jews
<hi>themſelves,</hi> before Legal Impurities were introduced,
ſins were both when puniſhed and in the puniſhing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<hi>ſins,</hi> it certainly ſignified ſomething more than the
puniſhment of flagitious men; <hi>which was</hi> ſurely lighter
than what was to make ſatisfaction to the Will of God.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Every perſon was purified at ſet-times and places,
<hi>and</hi> by uſing ſet <hi>and peculiar</hi> Ceremonies, be the party
how he would as to his mind; that is, whether he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
unclean with or againſt his Will: but none <hi>ſtand</hi>
acquitted from their ſins, but ſuch as heartily repent, and
do with as much ſincerity as earneſtneſs deſire to grow and
be better.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Every one was his own judge of his being clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(excepting the leprous, and ſome few others) and
ſtood not in need of Judges or Elders, who ſhould judge
for them, and pronounce them clean or unclean. Our
Oppoſers have othergueſs Sentiments of the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated:
for they put the Deciſion upon the judgment of
their Elders, not upon the Aſſertion of the Parties who
ſay they repent.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Leper, <hi>Lev. 13. v.</hi> 12, 13. whoſe Leproſie
ſpread from the crown of the head to the ſo<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the feet,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61349:12"/>
ſo that <hi>the Leproſie cover all his fleſh,</hi> and that the ſkin
of the whole body be all over of a colour, was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
whole and clean; but he who on the contrary
had his ſkin <hi>raw and defiled</hi> but in ſome one or more
parts, was <hi>to be</hi> accounted unclean. <hi>Now</hi> in the caſe of
ſinners, 'tis quite otherwiſe: for he that wallows over
head and ears in ſin (like a Sow all bemir'd) is not an
honeſter man than he who retains ſome ſhadow of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and <hi>ſhew</hi> of Honeſty.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The Lepers are not commanded to do any thing
on their part towards their cleanſing, but barely to ſhew
themſelves to the Prieſt, that he may pronounce <hi>the
Plague</hi> clean or not clean: But to wicked men the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
is direct, that <hi>themſelves</hi> amend their lives, and give
evidence of a ſorrowful <hi>and penitent</hi> heart by their good
and holy works.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Many were made unclean by touching the very
things whereby others were made clean, and while them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
did purifie others, <hi>v. Numb.</hi> 19. but ſure no man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
to be excommunicated from the means he uſes in
the healing and purifying others who are defiled with ſin
and iniquity: Whereas if you would have the figure to
anſwer <hi>herein,</hi> you muſt grant that all that would recal
others into the <hi>ways of Righteouſneſs</hi> by Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are to be excommunicated themſelves.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The unclean were not by the Law interdicted all
Sacraments: for they were to obſerve all the private
Rites <hi>and Ceremonies</hi> of their Country; <hi>they were</hi> to keep
the Sabbath, and celebrate the Feaſt of Purification,
whereby the fruits and benefits of Chriſts <hi>meritorious</hi>
works were chiefly <hi>ſhadowed or</hi> expreſſed; and all this
at the peril of their lives, <hi>vid. Lev.</hi> 16. and 23. for they
were not (as I ſaid before) taken for men damn'd, and
of a deſperate condition: But whether in the opinion of
our Adverſaries the Excommunicate are to be thought o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
'tis needleſs for me to attempt much the proving
it.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:61349:13"/>
18. The unclean under the Law did propagate an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
to the cloaths, houſes, places, and perſons that
they <hi>touched, or</hi> had <hi>otherwiſe</hi> to do with; but wicked
men did neither defile the Temple nor any thing elſe, nor
indeed any other men, unleſs thoſe others joyn'd with
them in the ſin. The Temple was not polluted by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in an Adultereſs, <hi>Numb. 5. v. 19. John 8. v.</hi> 11. no more
did the Publican (who in the Parable, <hi>Luke 18. v.</hi> 9.
went up with the Phariſee into the Temple to pray) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file
it by his preſence; that Phariſee who thought him a
mighty ſinner, compar'd with himſelf, yet never thought
himſelf defiled <hi>by his company.</hi> When <hi>Judas</hi> threw down
the Traiterous Pieces, <hi>the Price of Bloud,</hi> in the Temple,
we do not read that the Temple was thereby polluted,
or that the Phariſees made any complaint, as to that, who
yet would not go <hi>into the Judgment-hall, leſt they ſhould
be defiled, John 18. v.</hi> 28. Whereas were but a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
in her Menſtruouſneſs, or having an Iſſue of Bloud,
or any one who had buried another, or had (though una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares)
touched a dead body, been ſeen in the Temple,
all had been polluted <hi>and unclean;</hi> nor might they have
ſacrificed, or perform'd any other Worſhip, till 'twere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
purified. In like manner <hi>Judas</hi> polluted not that laſt
<hi>Paſchal</hi>-Supper by his deteſtable acts; which yet would
have been the caſe, had but he or any other of the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
touch'd any dead body.</p>
            <p>In fine, the uncleanneſs under the Law, did figure our
perverted and corrupt Nature, which could not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into Heaven, unleſs waſhed and purified in and by
the moſt pure <hi>and precious</hi> Bloud of Chriſt: for as the
Tabernacle typified Heaven, and the caſting out thence
<hi>ſignified</hi> Damnation, or the Excluſion from the heavenly
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo the cleanſing <hi>or waſhings</hi> by ordinary or
ſanctified Water, prefigured <hi>that</hi> Purification by the death
of Chriſt. 'Twas not therefore <hi>typical,</hi> or figurative of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61349:13"/>
the quality of the Actions, but of the quality or pravity
of our Nature. Nor did <hi>Gods Law</hi> prefigure how Vice
ſhould be <hi>bridled and</hi> reſtrained; (for <hi>Moſes</hi> taught this
in clear and expreſs words) but what ſhould be our State
in another life, to wit, in the Kingdom of Heaven, which
the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> did ſhadow <hi>to them:</hi> All which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough appears in <hi>Rev. 21. v.</hi> 27. St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> writing
againſt the Donatiſts, was of opinion that it ſignified the
Excluſion of Hereticks: But, <hi>be it how 'twill,</hi> even a
blind man may ſee, from the many and great differences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the <hi>Legal and Moral</hi> Impurities, that the former
could not be figurative of the latter, as our Adverſaries
contend.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. Though <hi>Moſes</hi> makes none but the forementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
Exception, yet ſhall I anſwer to an Objection, which
may be collected out of his words: for peradventure ſome
one may thus argue, The Jews are by <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded
to eat the Paſſover without Leaven; which <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi>
5. <hi>v.</hi> 8, interprets the filthineſs of the fleſh, <hi>that is, Moral
wickedneſs:</hi> It may therefore ſeem to ſome a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<hi>and likely</hi> matter, that the Lords Supper which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to the Paſſover, ſhould be celebrated by ſhutting
out <hi>malicious and</hi> wicked men.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. I anſwer, <hi>firſt,</hi> That it carries little of probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
with it, that God ſhould command a thing in expreſs
terras, and again at the ſame time figuratively prohibit the
ſelf-ſame thing. God plainly <hi>and expreſly,</hi> and with rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated
Precepts, commands that every Male (except the
unclean, and ſuch as were in a Journey) ſhould keep
the Paſſover: He never therefore intended to frighten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
ſome under the figure of the Leaven. There were
then plenty enough of bad men preſent, that it muſt be
needleſs to typifie <hi>and ſhadow</hi> them <hi>out</hi> by Leaven: And
the <hi>wickedneſs of</hi> men was <hi>a thing</hi> as obvious to mens ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<hi>and as much to be taken notice of,</hi> as the Leaven <hi>that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61349:14"/>
ſhould repreſent it.</hi> Therefore ſince no figures are <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly</hi>
inſtituted of ſuch things as are at hand and in
view, and which with equal <hi>clearneſs</hi> ſtrike the Senſes,
'tis in vain to ſeek for any Figure there: How much more
where the things figured are more notorious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
than the Figures themſelves? But beſides, <hi>Moſes</hi>
does not command that the Eater of Leaven ſhould be
debarr'd eating the Paſſover; but commands him to be
ſlain: Therefore ſinners ſhould not ſo much be kept from
the <hi>Lords</hi> Supper, as they ſhould be capitally puniſhed.
Which is a Conſequence I ſhould be ſo far from admitting
with difficulty, that I <hi>rather</hi> wiſh it might ſo be: for I
deſire nothing more, than that the ſtricteſt Moral Diſcipline
might be obſerv'd in the Church; but ſuch <hi>ſtill</hi> as is of
Gods appointment, not of mans invention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Jews might eat Leaven all the year round,
excepting onely thoſe ſeven days of Unleavened Bread;
(which they did commence from the eating of the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.)
Now if you would parallel this with the Lords
Supper, you muſt of neceſſity grant a liberty for licentious
living all the year, provided you abſtained from vice all
the time you were celebrating the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, Moſes</hi> ſpeaks here of the Paſſover onely, not of
any other Sacraments; <hi>by Analogie</hi> therefore wicked men
ſhould onely be kept from the Lords Supper, not from
Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apoſtle makes not the compariſon to run
betwixt the Feaſt of the Jews and the Lords Supper, but
<hi>betwixt that and</hi> our whole courſe of life; he ſays we
are unleavened (as men that are waſhed in the Bloud of
Chriſt, and purged from all Leaven) and therefore, ſays
he, let us <hi>keep the Feaſt, that is,</hi> let us live not with the
Leaven of Malice, but with the Unleavened Bread of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and Truth. There is a vaſt difference betwixt
Leaven ſimply ſo called, and the Leaven of Malice or
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61349:14"/>
Wrath: There is none but knows that <hi>in the ſecond ſence</hi>
'tis taken figuratively; and School-men ſay, that an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogical
or figurative ſence proves nothing. This is
certain, whatever is meant by Leaven, Excommunication
can never be maintain'd or juſtifi'd from it, againſt Gods
precept.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. But ſome may object that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks here of
the Paſſover; but what, <hi>I pray,</hi> makes this to our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
as if this word Paſſover were put for the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
in the New Teſtament: Chriſt, ſaith the Apoſtle,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. is our Paſſover ſacrificed <hi>or ſlain</hi> for us; not
his Supper. The meaning <hi>of the words</hi> is this: As the
Jews, who onely began their Feaſt of Unleavened Bread
with eating the Lamb, did eat Unleavened Bread all that
week after; ſo ſhould you, who have begun to believe in
Chriſt, and are purified and become unleavened through
his Bloud, you ſhould lead a pure and unſpotted life all the
reſt of the week, that is, all the days of your life.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. Now that nothing of different nature is to be
met with in the other Books of the Old Teſtament, may
be known <hi>and proved,</hi> if it were but from this alone, that
the <hi>Jews</hi> Poſterity were to live according to the Laws
and Inſtitutions of <hi>Moſes;</hi> contrary to which they might
not <hi>by any means</hi> inſtitute <hi>or enjoyn</hi> any thing which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to the Worſhip of God. Moſt certainly the <hi>good
and</hi> pious Judges, Prieſts, Prophets, and Kings, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
away none from their Sacraments and Sacrifices,
but rather invited all to them with the greater earneſtneſs
<hi>and zeal.</hi> The ſtory of good King [it ſhould be <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
I ſuppoſe: See 2 <hi>Chron. 35.] Joſiah, 2 Chron. 35.
v.</hi> 18. is well known, who called together all the Children
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as well thoſe whom he knew to have ſacrificed
and burnt Incenſe to ſtrange Gods or Devils, as thoſe who
for the ſhortneſs <hi>of the warning</hi> could not be cleanſed,
2 <hi>Chron. 30. v. 19. according to the purification of the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:61349:15"/>
Sanctuary:</hi> From whence 'tis obſervable, that Sacraments
are Provocations and Allurements to <hi>Religion and</hi> Piety;
and that men grow better rather by frequenting, than by
being robb'd of them, provided they are rightly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
inſtructed.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. Excommunication therefore can never be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
from the firſt Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> v. 13. <hi>Pſal. 50.
v.</hi> 8. and many places of like import; where 'tis ſaid, that
God will have nothing to do with the Sacrifices and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Wicked: for God doth in all thoſe places
condemn the abuſe of them, in that they thought that
they fully perform'd the Will of God by the <hi>meer</hi> exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
performance, at what rate ſoever their Soul ſtood af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.
Beſides, God neither commands the Prophet,
nor any one elſe by him, to exclude the Wicked from the
Sacrifices and <hi>Rites;</hi> but ſhews that God will not hear
them, unleſs that withal they amend their lives. Now the
external Policy <hi>and Government</hi> of the Church ſtands
upon a different foot with the Will of God to us-ward,
as himſelf is the Approver or Condemner of our <hi>thoughts
and</hi> actions. In fine, from the ſelf-ſame places it may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and in the ſame manner be demonſtrated, that none
that is a ſinner may call upon the Name of the Almighty;
nay, that 'tis unlawful <hi>for ſuch an one</hi> ſo much as to praiſe
or give thanks unto God: and then 'twill be incumbent
on the Prieſts and Elders to forbid the Wicked all theſe;
for God hath a like averſion to thoſe <hi>when they come</hi> from
wicked men, as is plain as well from the Texts inſtanc'd
in, as from places of the like import. And if this latter
carries abſurdity in it, no leſs doth the former.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. Neither doth that of 1 <hi>Eſdras,</hi> chap. 9. v. 3. 4.
make any whit againſt us; for that was a matter of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
and no ways relating to the Sacraments: for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
(not <hi>Eſdras</hi> the Prieſt alone, though he too was
a part of the Magiſtracy; for as <hi>Joſephus</hi> bears witneſs,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61349:15"/>
though they had a Leader, yet were they govern'd by the
Optimacy <hi>or Nobility</hi>) ſet forth a Proclamation, That
whoſoever met not at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> within two or three
days, their Cattel ſhould be ſeized to the uſe of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and they be caſt out from them that were of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity;
not from their Sacraments and Sacrifices. But
we make it not the enquiry of this place, whether the
Magiſtrate hath a right of puniſhing ſo or ſo, but whether
the Prieſts had any authority of removing diſſolute and
bad Livers from the Sacrifices: <hi>Eſdras</hi> could not do this
contrary to the Command of God. Adde to this, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> never commanded this penalty (to wit, Excluſion
from Sacraments) to be inflicted on them who married
ſtrange women, <hi>Deut. 7. v.</hi> 3. And in the 8th Chap. of
1 <hi>Eſdras,</hi> 'tis ſhewn how he was to proceed againſt the
Tranſgreſſors of the Law <hi>in that point, to wit,</hi> by Death,
Baniſhment, Corporal Puniſhments, Confiſcation of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates,
Bonds or Impriſonments. But in fine, 'twas quite
another thing to be thruſt out from the company of them
who had returned from the Captivity, and to be ſhut out
from the Temple and Sacrifices: for it appears from <hi>Exod.</hi>
1. 2. 21. and <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 2. that the ſtranger that was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed,
was admitted to keep the Paſſover, and then too,
many of thoſe who either had continued in <hi>Judea,</hi> or
who of the Inhabitants had forſaken the filthineſs <hi>and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations</hi>
of the Gentiles, and became Jewiſh Proſelytes,
did together with all the others, celebrate the Paſſover, as
'tis written at the end of the 6th Chapter of <hi>Eſdras.</hi>
Theſe, ſuch as they were, were not debarr'd the Sacrifices,
Temple, or Ceremonious <hi>Rites,</hi> though they were not
reckoned among the number of them who return'd from
<hi>Babylon.</hi> In like manner did they remove ſome of the
Prieſts from their Sacerdotal Function, becauſe they could
not make out their Pedigree; as appears 1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 2.
And from all put together, 'tis plainly impoſſible that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61349:16"/>
Excommunication can be ſhor'd up or ſupported here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. There is yet one Objection left, which ſome
men hug themſelves in, and prize mightily, and that is
the caſting out of the Synagogues: for to aſſert Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
the more irrefragably, they quote you what is
written in <hi>John 9. v.</hi> 22. and <hi>ch. 12. v.</hi> 42. and <hi>ch. 16. v.</hi> 2.
But many and true are the Anſwers to this. The word
Synagogue ſometimes ſignifies a place; as when Jeſus is
ſaid to have entred into and taught in the Synagogue:
Sometimes a Convention or Meeting, whether the ſame
were in the Synagogue it ſelf, or elſewhere; as when the
Phariſees are ſaid to chuſe the chief Seats in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
and the uppermoſt Rooms at Feaſts, <hi>Mark 12.
39. Luke</hi> 20. 46. In this latter ſence (or <hi>rather</hi> in both of
them) is it uſed, <hi>Mat. 10. v.</hi> 17. and <hi>ch. 23. v.</hi> 34. where
Chriſt foretels the ſcourging of his Followers in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues;
and <hi>Mat. 10. v. 17. Mark 13. v. 9. Luke 12.
v.</hi> 11. and 21. <hi>v.</hi> 12. in which places the word ſignifies no
more than the publick <hi>place of</hi> Judicature, as 'tis often
uſed for the ſame by the Septuagint; as we ſhall have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to clear hereafter. But in the laſt forecited
places, <hi>Mat. 10. v.</hi> 17. and <hi>Mark 13. v.</hi> 9. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and

               </gap> 
               <hi>which we tranſlate Councils and Synagogues,</hi> are
there put as if they both ſignified the ſame thing: In the
other places, after <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, preſently follows <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,
Kings and Rulers, as in <hi>Luke 21. v.</hi> 12. (inſtead of which

of Superiority; or if more did act, they did it in the
name of one of them. In theſe Aſſemblies or Synagogues

out of this <hi>kind of</hi> Synagogue, was a kind of Political
or Civil Ignominy or Puniſhment, and ſo a local baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as 'twere, as we gather out of <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 28, 29. which
can never be applied to Sacraments, which (except it be
that of Circumciſion, and ſome few others) were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
in the Temple (of which there was but one) and
at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> And of the ſame nature doth that puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſeem to be, which we ſpoke of a little before in our
clearing that of <hi>Eſdras.</hi> There is no body but knows
that ſuch Synagogues there were in every City; therefore
whether you take the word in that of <hi>John,</hi> ch. 10. v. 17.
for the Aſſembly it ſelf, or for the place <hi>where they aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi>
it thwarts not our Opinion any manner of ways:
and if at moſt it were denied to be <hi>a</hi> Civil <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> yet
muſt it manifeſtly appertain to religious matters. But I
diſpute not here whether he who entertains erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of the true Religion, be to be excommunicated:
for the Phariſees, ſays <hi>John 9. v.</hi> 22. agreed, that if any
man did confeſs that Jeſus was Chriſt, that he ſhould be
put out of the Synagogue. But farther yet, it was matter
of <hi>Repute and</hi> Honour to be of the Synagogue, as of the
other hand 'twas a piece of Reproach to be caſt out of it;
as may, methinks, be <hi>eaſily</hi> gathered from <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 42. where
'tis ſaid, that among the Chief Rulers alſo (of whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<hi>Nichodemus</hi> was one) many believed on him; but
becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſs him, leſt they
ſhould be put out of the Synagogue; and the reaſon is
added, <hi>v.</hi> 43. for they loved the praiſe of men more than
the praiſe of God. Beſides, it appears that even the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61349:17"/>
Publicans were not admitted into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
in the ſence we now take the word: for the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees
would not endure ſo much as to ſpeak with them;
and one of their Cavils at Chriſt was, for his familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
with thoſe men. But I cannot imagine, that any
one who underſtands himſelf, can affirm that theſe very
<hi>Publicans and Sinners</hi> were debarred from the Paſſover,
from the Temple, <hi>or</hi> from Sacrifices; therefore muſt they
needs be two quite different things, ſo to be diſſynagogu'd,
and to be kept from the Sacraments and Rites of Gods
own inſtitution: which is manifeſt, as well from what has
been already ſaid, as from <hi>Acts 5. v.</hi> 42. for the Diſciples
after they had been ſeverely leſſon'd by the Synagogue,
did not yet ceaſe to teach and preach Jeſus Chriſt dayly
in the Temple. What a many of Synagogues was <hi>Paul</hi>
put out of? but the Jews never caſt it in his teeth, never
accus'd or condemn'd him for coming into the Temple,
and for offering there for himſelf and others. But to cloſe
all this, more may yet be ſaid, could it never ſo plainly be
made out that the Phariſees counted it one and the ſame
thing to exclude from the Synagogue and from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
(which I ſhall make appear never was, is, or could
be true;) yet they muſt needs have done this (as well
as many other things) againſt the expreſs Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and then are we obliged not to imitate but condemn the
Pattern: for we are to live up to the Laws, and not to
Preſidents; and not walk after any one in his deviations
from the Laws of God, unleſs we will confound all <hi>the
Rules and Meaſures of Right and Wrong:</hi> Let us indeed
have an eye to the good Examples of the good, and ſtrive
to come after them, but not after the bad of the bad. I
have been ſo particular (though with all the brevity I
could) on this Argument, becauſe ſome do mightily hug
and applaud themſelves in it, though to the deceiving of
themſelves as well as others.</p>
            <p n="23">
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61349:17"/>
XXIII. 'Tis therefore a moſt certain unſhaken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable
truth, that <hi>under the old Teſtament</hi> no man was
ſhut out from Sacraments for Immoralities; but on the
contrary, all the holy Prieſts, Prophets, Judges, Kings,
and at laſt, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, that moſt eminent and moſt
holy Forerunner of Chriſt, rather ſent Invitations to all,
<hi>good and bad,</hi> to come in and keep them according to the
Law, than ſhut the doors upon them.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. But now our Sacraments, and thoſe of our
Forefathers under the Old Teſtament, are (as to the things
ſignified, <hi>ſee the ſpiritual ſence of them) altogether</hi> the
ſame, as <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. plainly intimates. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſs it can appear that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> either is
aboliſhed or changed in this point, none has authority to
ſet up a contrary practice.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. For as againſt the Anabaptiſts we do well urge as
a moſt effectual Argument, that ſince Baptiſm came in the
place of Circumciſion, and that Chriſt did nowhere for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
the baptizing of Infants, it cannot be leſs lawful for us
to baptize our Children, than 'twas for the Jews to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe
theirs; ſo may we here argue with equal force,
that the Lords Supper ſucceeded to the eating the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
but Vice and Immoralities were not puniſhed by
prohibiting <hi>them to eat</hi> the Paſſover, nor were the Jews
on any ſuch account drove from it; but the Law did ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
invite all, <hi>of what age or condition ſoever,</hi> eſpecially
every Male, to keep it: Which being not found to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
antiquated nor aboliſhed, <hi>but holding ſtill as to the
reaſon of it,</hi> Crimes are no more now to be puniſhed by
denying us the Lords Supper; neither ought any one on
this account to be rejected. But enough has been ſaid
with reference to the Old Teſtament; 'tis time we ſhould
now come to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, that is, to the New
Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. Now we read not any where that our Lord and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61349:18"/>
Saviour Chriſt did in any wiſe interdict any perſon acceſs
unto, or uſe of the Sacraments; or that he ſo much as
commanded the Apoſtles that they ſhould do any thing
like it: for Chriſt came not into the world to deſtroy the
Law, but to fulfil and perfect it; therefore when the Law
commanded all but the unclean to celebrate the Paſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Chriſt would not ſurely forbid any one.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. For 'tis very clear that Chriſt checkt no body
for uſing Sacraments, or frequenting the Temple and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices;
but onely caution'd them to uſe them aright, and
agreeably to the Will and Law of God: He went into the
ſame Temple with Phariſees, Sadduces, Publicans, and
who not, be they bad, be they good; he was with them
at the ſame Sacrifices; uſed all Sacraments promiſcuouſly
with the reſt of the people; was baptized of <hi>John</hi> with
the ſame Baptiſm as thoſe wicked ones were.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. Upon this account was it that Jeſus hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
not <hi>Judas</hi> his Betrayer from eating the laſt <hi>Paſchal</hi>
Lamb <hi>with him,</hi> but he ſate down <hi>to it</hi> with all his twelve
Diſciples: not but that there are ſome who endeavour to
prove that <hi>Judas</hi> was not preſent at this new <hi>inſtituted</hi>
Supper of <hi>our</hi> Lord (which is an hard, if not an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
matter to evince from Sacred Writ) but that he
withdrew before the Inſtitution: yet ſure none can have
the hardineſs to deny that <hi>Judas</hi> was according to the
Law admitted to the eating the Paſſover; on which
Conceſſion, our Argument holds firm and unanſwerable:
for whether he went or went not out before the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another Supper, (though the latter carries moſt of
probability in it, and always hath been believed by moſt
men) this ſtill is plain, that he was preſent and partaker
of the firſt, and was not openly or expreſly forbidden the
latter: Neither read we any where that Chriſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
him to go out, to the end that he might not be a
Communicant in his new-<hi>inſtituted</hi> Supper; if therefore
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61349:18"/>
he did go out, he did it voluntarily, and of his own head;
neither went he out for any ſuch purpoſe. But <gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
with us is, what Chriſt, not what <hi>Judas</hi> did: 'Tis
enough for our purpoſe, that Chriſt never commanded
him to withdraw from his Supper.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. But the common Put-off and Salvo for this
matter, is very light and frivolous; That <hi>Judas</hi> his Crime
was not of a publick nature, and that on that conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he was not to be put out: for firſt, he had ſtruck the
bargain, and agreed the price with the Phariſees before,
and Chriſt acquainted his Diſciples with it at that Supper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time;
this was an <hi>ample</hi> Publication <hi>by Christ himſelf,</hi> and
ſhould therefore have been the rather made a Preſident
and Example <hi>in this matter.</hi> But ſecondly, (whatever
this may be) he was at leaſt known to be a Thief before;
and though ſuch an one he were, yet did our Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
a Miniſtry <hi>and office</hi> to him, and beſtowed on him
the power of caſting out Devils, of healing the Sick, and
of doing other ſuch-like Miracles. Laſtly, Chriſt admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him as well as the reſt of his Diſciples to the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Paſſover, all the whiles he was with him. Is
not this proof enough that Chriſt had no mind, <hi>no intent
or deſire</hi> that flagitious perſons ſhould be puniſht by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring
them the Sacraments? Sure 'tis matter of greater
moment to take a wicked man into the Miniſtry, than to
admit ſuch an one to the Supper! yet we ſee that Chriſt
did both to <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="30">XXX. 'Tis farther obſervable, that at his firſt Supper
the Diſciples began to contend about Greatneſs and Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority;
yet was none of them ſhut out thence on that
ſcore: nay, Chriſt would and commanded that all ſhould
drink of the Cup, <hi>Mat. 26. v.</hi> 27. which, <hi>Mark 14. v.</hi> 23.
is ſaid to be actually done: (And as to this buſineſs, the
reaſon holds in the Bread as well as Wine.) Now what
can it be believed was the mind <hi>and intent</hi> of Chriſt, but
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61349:19"/>
to ratifie what God had before commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
to wit, <gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t none who were initiated by Baptiſm, ſhould
be debarr'd from that publick and ſolemn act of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
who had a mind to be at it? Whence it appears,
that no perſon is to be thruſt from the Lords Table, who
embraces the Doctrine of Chriſt, and ſubmits to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by him.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. Chriſt doth not deſire that his Kingdom (I
ſpeak of his viſible and external one in this world) ſhould
be of a narrower extent among Chriſtians, than were the
boundaries and limits ſet unto the Jews. As therefore
God commanded that all that were externally circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
ſhould participate <hi>and communicate</hi> in the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
and Rites; but that Criminals and other Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors,
ſhould by the Sword and other <hi>civil</hi> Puniſhments
be reſtrained and puniſhed: ſo is it Chriſt's Will, that all
who are baptized into him, all that profeſs Chriſtianity,
and have a right and ſound ſenſe of Religion, ſhould be
admitted to the uſe of all external Ceremonies and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
whilſt the Wicked and Criminal fall under the
correction of the Magiſtrate, whether it be by Death,
Exile, Impriſonments, or other the like Penalties. And
the Parables of the Net, Marriage, and Tares, ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
no leſs.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. We find among the Apoſtles, <hi>Paul</hi> eſpecially,
no fewer nor leſs plain and forcible Arguments for our
Aſſertion. Firſt, there are no Footſteps that the Apoſtles
did either teach or practiſe ſuch a <hi>kind of</hi> Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
This Argument, though it be not ſo evincing and
ſtrong of it ſelf, yet will be made unanſwerable, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that the Apoſtles all their time kept themſelves to
a ſtrict obſervance of ſuch Laws of <hi>Moſes</hi> which Chriſt
had not abrogated; as may be gathered out of the 21th
and 28th Chapters of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles:</hi> for which
cauſe they never did nor would, attempt to put by any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61349:19"/>
one from our Sacraments (which differ from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of their Forefathers, in the ſignes and time of ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
onely) if he be a profeſſed Chriſtian, and make a
right Confeſſion of that Doctrine: for they neither did
nor taught any thing contrary to the Precepts of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
which Chriſt had not before abrogated, but kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to as cloſe and ſtrict obſervance of the Law after his
death, as before; as the chief of the Apoſtles bears wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in the before-cited places: for that permiſſion, to
live free from the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to the Gentiles one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
not to the Convert Jews; which ought carefully to
be remark'd here, for the ſake of what follows. And as
to the ſubſtance of their Doctrine, they taught nothing
that interfer'd with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: for had they
taught any thing diſſonant, the <hi>Bereans</hi> could not have
judged it agreeable to thoſe Scriptures that they ſearched,
<hi>Acts 17. v.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. But to adventure yet one ſtep farther: Much
may be ſaid for the ſenſe of <hi>Moſes;</hi> (which jumps alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with ours) but for the contrary Opinion, <hi>Paul</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
us not one Argument: for that Apoſtle, in 1 <hi>Cor. 8.
v.</hi> 7. excludes neither thoſe who yet <hi>retaining ſome fear
and conſcience of the Idols,</hi> thought them to be ſomething,
nor thoſe proud boaſting Gnoſticks, who in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in the
Houſe or Temple</hi> of the Idol (at leaſt, in the Room that
was ſet apart for their ſolemn and publick Idol-Feſtivals)
did promiſcuouſly with the profane and impious Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
eat of the things offer'd to Idols: A thing expreſly
forbid by <hi>Moſes, Exod. 34. v.</hi> 15. by the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi>
15. <hi>v.</hi> 29. by <hi>John, Rev. 2. v.</hi> 14. This was a ſin as hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
as 'twould be now-a-days for a man to dare to be
preſent <hi>and communicate</hi> at a Popiſh Maſs; as any one
may eaſily gather out of the 10th Chapter of that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle:
for <hi>Paul</hi> there proves, that ſuch as thoſe do not leſs
declare themſelves by that action to be Communicants,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61349:20"/>
and keep a Fellowſhip with Devils, than they teſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt by
partaking of the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. Again, <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 10. 1, 2, &amp;c.</hi> reaſons the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thus: As (ſays he) God ſpared not in old time ſuch
as luſted after evil things, nor Idolaters, nor Fornicators,
nor ſuch as tempted and murmured againſt Chriſt; though
all of them were baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſame Baptiſm,
<hi>v.</hi> 2. and did all eat the ſame ſpiritual meat, and did all
drink the ſame ſpiritual drink, <hi>v.</hi> 3, and 4. ſo ſhall he not
ſpare even you too, whoever of you are defiled with like
abominations, though you alſo all eat in like manner, as
did they, of the ſame Bread, and drink of the ſame Cup
with the righteous and holy ones. By this it is ſeen,
<hi>first,</hi> that the Sacraments of the Jews before Chriſt, and
ours ſince, are, as to the internal and heavenly <hi>deſigne of
them,</hi> the very ſame; elſe would the Apoſtles, Argument
be of no force. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis evident that in both caſes
many vile and wicked Wretches, and notoriouſly known
and mark'd for ſuch, found admittance. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
clear, that none were commanded to keep away (as the
Excommunicated now-a-days always are:) for the Apoſtle
doth not ſay that ſuch, whilſt ſuch, ſhould be kept from
coming; but foretels <hi>and denounces</hi> like puniſhments on
them, as befel ſuch ſinners of old: Some of whom <hi>Moſes</hi>
with the Levites ſlew, <hi>Exod. 32. v.</hi> 28. ſome God himſelf
deſtroyed with Fire and Sword, Serpents and Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes;
which was theſe Corinthians caſe too: for, ſaith
St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 11. v. 30. For this cauſe many are weak
and ſickly among you, and many ſleep;</hi> that is, <hi>are puniſhed
by Diſeaſe and Death from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. In the next Chapter (<hi>though St.</hi> Paul <hi>take
notice of Diviſions and Hereſies among them, and of ſome
drunken at the Lords Supper, yet</hi>) neither are thoſe Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
and Sectaries, thoſe Drunkards, or others of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61349:20"/>
debauched Principles, commanded to be kept from
eating it; there's no tittle or word of any ſuch Interdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Yet doth he there redreſs leſſer matters, as that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man ſhould eat at home, if he be hungry. How
could he have here paſs'd over this in ſilence, had he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
it? had he thought it ſo neceſſary to the Church?
<hi>But</hi> the Apoſtle well knew that the Law commanded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
and that the uſe of Sacraments in the Church
was to other purpoſes than the puniſhing of Moral Vices
by their deprivation; therefore commands he that every
man examine himſelf, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 28. the Precept is not,
that they ſhould try and examine one another. Nay, the
Apoſtle there cautions them that they eat worthily; <hi>For
he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
damnation to himſelf,</hi> v. 29. He doth not in the leaſt
command that unworthy Communicants ſhould be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
acceſs, but threatens them with ſad dooms from the
hand of God. He divides the Eaters into two ſorts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their differing Complexions; the worthy, and
unworthy ones: he gives no Precept to either for their
not eating, but would that all ſhould eat worthily.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI. Afterwards, in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> ch. 12 and 13. he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
not thoſe (who, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. v.</hi> 21. after a former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
had not repented of the Uncleanneſs, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,
and Laſciviouſneſs which they had committed)
with excluſion from the Table of the Lord, but, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 10. according to the power and authority which the
Lord had given him, <hi>to edification, and not to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he would not ſpare,</hi> ch. 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2. and 10. <hi>that is,</hi> he
would proceed with rigour and ſeverity, <hi>according to his
extraordinary and Apoſtolick power;</hi> a thing he often did
<hi>threaten</hi> in his Epiſtles: But nowhere has he preach'd
this Doctrine (which is the Queſtion now in hand) That
any ſhould be interdicted the Sacraments; nor has he
commanded Preſbyters or any others to do it. But had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61349:21"/>
he been diſpoſed to have this way given check to Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
he would <hi>aſſuredly</hi> have ordain'd that Sinners
ſhould have been kept from Sacraments till they became
reform'd <hi>in their manners,</hi> eſpecially ſince he had before
<hi>appointed or</hi> ordain'd Elders in the ſame Church, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.
v.</hi> 5. and had corrected the Abuſes, the miſs-celebration
in the Lords Supper. But perhaps we may have more to
ſay to this hereafter.</p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII. As we find no mention made of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
in the <hi>receiving and</hi> celebrating <hi>this</hi> Sacrament,
ſo neither doth any thing of that nature appear in its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
nor indeed hath the Scripture taken any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
thereof in her Explications of the uſe and ends of
Sacraments: Whereas had Sacraments been given to the
Church for this, as well as other ends and purpoſes, that
they ſhould have been for Penalties upon Offences and
Offenders, ſome mention muſt needs have been of it. The
end <hi>and deſignes</hi> of this Inſtitution of the Lords Supper,
are, That we may commemorate in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
the Death of our Lord: That we may pay our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
in a publick Recognition and Thankfulneſs, for the
Deliverance he hath purchaſed for us: That we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind
our ſelves, and by our preſence bear teſtimony to
others, that we have no other Food of Life, but a Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
Saviour; no other Drink, but his Bloud poured out
for us: That we may declare our ſelves as well penitent
for our paſt <hi>courſe of</hi> Life, as that we have enter'd upon
thoughts <hi>and reſolutions</hi> of a better; and that we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
the Chriſtian Doctrine, are the Members of Chriſt,
belong unto his Church, in which we deſire piouſly and
religiouſly both to live and die. Has the Scripture any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
prohibited any man from performing theſe things?
But, you may perhaps ſay, Some men have <hi>too</hi> frequently
relaps'd to their former bad courſes, and become not one
whit the better. <hi>I anſwer,</hi> He that by the <hi>aid and</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:61349:21"/>
of the Holy Spirit hath the thoughts of his heart
right at the time of his receiving, the Scripture turns him
not away; but God only knows whether and how long
he will hold on his good purpoſes <hi>and reſolutions.</hi> 'Tis
our duty to hope always the beſt of all men, however
we may ſometimes be miſtaken: nay, we ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs
our hearty Prayers to God, that he would vouchſafe
to ſtrengthen and confirm both us and them in all true
Religion and Virtue. But ſtill the ſinner is to be told of
his faults, is to be reprehended, admoniſhed, and adviſed,
that he may <hi>ſo</hi> try himſelf, that (as the Apoſtle cautions)
he eat and drink not Damnation to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="38">XXXVIII. Laſtly, Whether are the Sacraments (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the authority <hi>of their Inſtitution,</hi> or <hi>the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi>
dignity <hi>of their</hi> nature) of greater worth than the
Word, <hi>that Word of God which Chriſt preached?</hi> or is
there more neceſſity of the uſe of thoſe, than of this?
None without the Word, <hi>can or</hi> could be ſaved; but who
can doubt but that many have been, and yet may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
without the Sacraments, (eſpecially the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per)
provided they are not contemners of them? The
Apoſtle ſeems to have thought ſo too, when he ſays he
was not ſent to baptize, but to preach the Word. Do
not almoſt all men ſay that the Word is <hi>plain</hi> and viſible,
and ſets before our eyes what words ſignifie to our ears?
Why do we therefore make no attempts to ſhut any out
from the Word, but do it from the Sacraments, eſpecially
the Euchariſt; and that contrary unto (or at leaſt much
beſide <hi>the intereſt</hi> of) Gods expreſs Command? Do they
ſay 'tis becauſe the Word is for all, but that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were inſtituted onely for Converts to the Word?
I know all that, and ſpeak not therefore of Turks <hi>and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>
ſuch as never came within <hi>the Churches Pale,</hi> but of
ſuch as God hath called and ingrafted into his Church,
ſuch as own the Doctrine, and deſire (at leaſt to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61349:22"/>
appearance) to be worthy partakers of <hi>theſe Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX. Hitherto have I ſtrongly demonſtrated, that
there is no word or inſtance, no footſtep or preſident to
be found either of Chriſts, or among his Apoſtles, of ſuch
Chaſtizements, or rather <hi>Reſtraints and</hi> Coertions put
upon wicked men. Since therefore neither the Old nor
New Teſtament hath commanded this ſort of puniſhing,
but the clean contrary is often found in both of them, we
may juſtly think <hi>this</hi> Excommunication (as far, <hi>I mean,</hi>
as it excludes men from the uſe of the Sacraments for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probity
of Life, and vitiouſneſs of Morals) rather an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of Man, than any Law of God. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that we examine what thoſe who oppoſe us have to
ſay for themſelves; and to convince the World, that all that
they ſay has nothing of proof <hi>or force</hi> in it.</p>
            <p n="40">XL. They tell you of a Precept, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 15, 16, 17. and in
St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle they tell you too of an Example or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of that kind, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 3, 4, 5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 19, 20. We
will take them in order; and firſt for that in <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="41">XLI. 'Twas not the deſigne of Chriſt in that Chapter
of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to ſet up any new <hi>Model</hi> of Government,
or form of putting Excommunications in execution, but
to inſtruct his Diſciples how they ſhould avoid giving of
fence <hi>or ſcandal</hi> in the matter of righting themſelves in
private Injuries done them: for ſince they who flie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
to the Magiſtrate to right them (eſpecially where
the Magiſtrate, as was that the Jews were then under, is
an Heathen and prophane) do often give <hi>occaſion of</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<hi>and ſcandal</hi> thereby to the weak. He firſt exhorts
<hi>and adviſes</hi> them, that they rather forgive Injuries, than
run to the Magiſtrate upon every ſlight occaſion. Thus
far doth he nothing but call to their minds that Precept of
<hi>Moſes, Lev.</hi> 19. 17. (which <hi>Ecclus</hi> 19. 13. hath a little
more fully paraphras'd): After this, he directs, that if
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61349:22"/>
they are neceſſitated to reſort to the Magiſtrate <hi>for redreſs,</hi>
that yet they ſhould not (if they would avoid ſcandal)
accuſe their fellow-brethren the Jews, before the Roman
<hi>Judicatures,</hi> till their own Magiſtrates fail'd in doing them
Juſtice. The like Precept hath St. <hi>Paul</hi> given, 1 <hi>Cor. 6.
1, &amp;c.</hi> (which place is a kind of Comment upon this) that
is to ſay, that Chriſtians go not to Law with Chriſtians
before the Unbelievers. This therefore is the true and
genuine ſenſe of this of St. <hi>Matthew:</hi> If thy Brother (that
is a Jew) treſpaſs againſt thee, try to make up the matter
betwixt your ſelves alone; but if alone you cannot do it,
try what may be done by the <hi>Arbitrement and Mediation</hi>
of two or three <hi>of your Brethren (the Jews ſtill);</hi> and
if this way you have not a juſt ſatisfaction and amends
made you, tell it to the Church, that is, to the Sanedrim,
to the Magiſtrate of your own Religion and Nation; and
if he refuſe to hear him, <hi>if he ſtand not to the judgment of
your own chief Judicatures,</hi> you may without juſt offence
to any man, deal with him as with a Publican or Heathen
that ſhould do you any injury, and whom you cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead
nor call before any other Authority but the Roman
Tribunals.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. That this is the proper and genuine Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the place, is plain and evident from the whole <hi>tenor
and</hi> ſeries of the Diſcourſe, but eſpecially from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of it, and from all its circumſtances: For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Chriſt talks not here of any enormous and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Tranſgreſſions which belong'd to Religion, and the
Laws and Rites of their Nation, for theſe the Sanedrim <hi>or
great Councils of the Jews</hi> were to redreſs; but his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
is of private wrongs, which every man had power
for himſelf to remit. One manifeſt proof of the truth of
what I ſay, may be, for that all the whole Oration runs in
the ſingular number: If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
thee, go and tell him his faults between thee and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61349:23"/>
him alone; and again, tell the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and let him
be to thee as an Heathen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Luke 17. v.</hi> 3. If thy
Brother, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>v.</hi> 4. if he treſpaſs againſt thee ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn again to
thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him. We can
no ways interpret <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>against thee,</hi> here, to be meant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Church: For when 'tis after ſaid, Tell it to the
Church, the ſence would be, O Church, tell it to the
Church. And again, we can as little interpret it with
thy privity <hi>and knowledge:</hi> for neither the ſence of the
words, nor the nature or circumſtances of the diſcourſe,
will admit of ſuch an Explication. For why am I requir'd
to tell a man his fault betwixt me and him alone, if I was
<hi>but as one</hi> privy <hi>to his Crime,</hi> and that he treſpaſſed not
privately and againſt me alone? Why ſhould I not rather
be enjoyn'd to take in them with me whom he directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd,
that they and I might reprove him together? But
Chriſt gives not that ſcope and liberty to take others with
me in my firſt Applications to my injuring Brother: And
therefore <hi>'tis plain,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of Injuries done me by
my Brother privately. But farther yet, how can the
words of St. <hi>Luke [If he turn again to thee, thou ſhalt
forgive him]</hi> be accommodated to this ſence? Can we
ſay that here, To thee, is put for, Thou being privy and
conſcious <hi>to the injury done by him?</hi> What muſt then the
meaning be of, Thou ſhalt forgive him? Muſt we here
alſo ſay, Thou ſhalt be privy and conſcious to his forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?
Did the prodigal ſon, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 11. that ſinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Heaven, <hi>onely</hi> ſin in the <hi>ſight</hi> and privity of Heaven?
'Tis <hi>indeed</hi> plain enough in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. that we ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Brethren, when we do a thing which may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Stumbling block to them through their weakneſs.
But this of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is quite of a different nature; and
truly the whole frame of this Diſcourſe, and way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
it, can't allow us to expound it of any other than
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61349:23"/>
private wrongs; which every man has power and right
in himſelf to <hi>remit and</hi> forgive: And if the Injurer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
him not of his own accord, this is to be done on the
part of the Injured, to bring him to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is again proved, for that the Apoſtles of
Chriſt did not otherwiſe underſtand him; as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
from St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Queſtion, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Whether his ſeven
times forgiving his offending Brother would be enough?
<hi>Peter</hi> could not be to learn, that he neither could nor ought
to pardon an offence which concern'd others, or the whole
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The words Unto thee, <hi>v.</hi> 17. is a farther proof
hereof. Chriſt doth not ſay, Let him be unto us, or unto
others, or unto the Church; but let him be unto thee as
a Publican, unto thee who art or haſt been the injur'd
man. Chriſt, though he addreſs his diſcourſe to all the
Apoſtles equally, yet commands that the Wrong Doer be
held for an Heathen and Publican by him alone who is
the Sufferer thereby; and that too, not till the Church
(<hi>that is, the lawful Magiſtracy of the Jews in their Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim</hi>)
had admoniſh'd him. Beſides, he ſpeaks not there
of things which relate to the whole Church, or to any
number of perſons; but which relate to private men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of ſuch Treſpaſſes which we are
obliged to pardon as often as the Offender ſays, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.
And that this Remiſſion and Forgiveneſs tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
between two alone, puts an end to the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
appears from theſe words, <hi>v. 19. Again, I ſay unto you,
If two of you ſhall agree on earth, as touching any thing
that they ſhall ask, it ſhall be done for them of my Father
which is in Heaven.</hi> But an hanious <hi>and publick</hi> Offence,
which concerns many perſons, or <hi>perhaps</hi> the whole
Church, may not be remitted by one alone. And here
we may take notice by the by, of that Adverb <hi>again;</hi>
whereby he intimates his having ſpoke before to the ſame
purpoſe, though in different words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61349:24"/>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of Treſpaſſes and Offences which
the actor of them is not aſham'd of, or which he will not
ſtick <hi>frankly</hi> to confeſs and own before any man. Had
he ſpoke of Crimes of a deeper dye, which concern'd ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
or the whole Church, 'twould be in vain to bring him
to others that might bear witneſs (as 'tis <hi>v.</hi> 16.): for
ſuch an Action, if 'twere <hi>yet</hi> private, no Offender would
avow it before witneſs, <hi>which might endanger him.</hi> But
in all things here diſcourſed of, this gradual procedure
recommended by Chriſt, muſt be obſerv'd; and therefore
he ſpeaks of private Injuries, which others have nothing
to do with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of ſuch Offences which the
Church, he here ſpeaks of, doth not otherwiſe puniſh than
by admoniſhing the Offender with bare words: for
'twould be needleſs to have added, <hi>If he hear not the
Church,</hi> could an open puniſhment have redreſs'd the
Offence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> The Parable that follows, <hi>v.</hi> 23. gives a clear
proof to this matter; its concluſion being, that God will
not forgive them their Treſpaſſes, who from their hearts
forgive not the Treſpaſſes of a repenting Brother, without
exacting farther pains or penalties upon him. But the
Church (as <hi>ſome of</hi> our Adverſaries tell us) ought not
thus to forgive, but ought to keep them, at leaſt for a time,
from the Sacraments, till they ſhall have given teſtimony
of their Repentance to Elders <hi>ſurrogated and</hi> appointed
for that purpoſe: So that ſuch a Church will not ſeven
times a day forgive them that ſay they repent, but will ſee
the argument and <hi>proof</hi> of that Repentance; things
which Chriſt ſays not a word of: he requires no farther
argument than the Confeſſion of the Fault; which ſcarce
any man will <hi>have occaſion to</hi> repeat ſeven times a day,
who hath not plaid the Hypocrite <hi>in ſome, or all, of the
former ſix.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61349:24"/>
We have, I think, from all this evidently prov'd, that
Chriſt in this 18th Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſpeaks nothing
of Crimes that are to be redreſſed by Excommunications,
but of light and private Injuries, and the way and means
of making them up and reconciling them; and therefore
belongs not to the buſineſs of Excommunication. If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
we do but well weigh the cloſe of that Chapter, all
doubt from hence muſt be at an end.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. He that can and will needs imagine that Chriſt
in this 18th Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> ſet up or inſtituted
Excommunication, ought to ſhew in which of the words
'tis contain'd: If he cannot ſhew it any where there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
'tis to no purpoſe to ſay 'tis there commanded.
But if it be there, it muſt either be in theſe words, <hi>v. 17.
Tell it unto the Church:</hi> or in theſe, <hi>Let him be to thee as
an heathen and a publican:</hi> or <hi>laſtly,</hi> in theſe, <hi>v. 18. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ye ſhall bind on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c.
But I doubt not to prove it with moſt unanſwerable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
that none of theſe words comprize any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and ſince it can be found in no other, 'tis loſt labour
to enquire here after it.</p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. Theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Tell it unto the Church,</hi>
prove no more than this, that he who has been injur'd by
his Brother, and all his endeavours of reconciliation with
him have been ineffectual, may <hi>honeſtly and lawfully</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of him to the Church, or to the Governours and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Church. And further, that this ſame Church
hath a right and authority to reprehend and admoniſh the
Wrong Doer, that he ceaſe from being ſo: <hi>But</hi> no more
of power is here given to the Church, than (<hi>v.</hi> 17.) was
before given to the one or two Witneſſes, excepting onely
in this, that the Cauſe is not to be brought before the
Church without the Witneſſes. Is it not therefore a weak
way of reaſoning, to ſay, The Church has power to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh
him that treſpaſſes againſt his Brother; therefore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61349:25"/>
has ſhe power to excommunicate him, or to deb<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> him the
Sacrament? But now, ſome may <hi>perhaps</hi> urge, that the
Church not having a Right <hi>or Authority</hi> of puniſhing
the guilty with Death and other corporal puniſhments,
ſhe is neceſſitated to have recourſe to this way of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them the Sacrament. But I anſwer, Were the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
as true (as indeed from both the old Teſtament,
from the Hiſtory of all Ages, from what our own Eyes and
Senſes tell us, we are aſſured 'tis quite otherwiſe) no ſuch
conſequence could be drawn from it; nor can it be ever
proved that theſe things have any neceſſary coherence
one with another: The Church hath not the power of
the Sword, <hi>ſhe can't kill and ſlay;</hi> therefore may ſhe, muſt
ſhe, drive from the Sacrament thoſe who own and profeſs
the ſame Religion, <hi>the ſame ſaving Faith; ſhe muſt drive
from that Sacrament that was inſtituted for, and ought to
be open and common to all that outwardly profeſs the ſame
Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="45">XLV. If yet our Adverſaries think Excommunication
to have been inſtituted in theſe other words, <hi>Let him be
to thee as an heathen man and a publican,</hi> I utterly deny
it: Nether can it by any Art or Rhetorick, Perſwaſion
or Argument whatever, be demonſtrated whilſt the world
ſtands, that this <hi>form of</hi> Speech, <hi>Let him be to thee as an
heathen man and a publican,</hi> ſhould tantamount to this,
Let him be excommunicate, let him be kept from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament:
for even in the days of Chriſt, the circumciſed
Publicans, were they Jews or Gentiles, were not prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
the Temple, Sacrifices, Rites, Ceremonies, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.
And truly Chriſt may ſeem to have joyn'd the
Publican with the Heathen, to prevent all thoughts and
ſuſpition of his here interdicting them <hi>ſuch Rites and</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
How could the Publicans by the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law
be ſhut out from the Temple, and from worſhipping God
<hi>there,</hi> when 'twas not ſo much as a ſin to be a Farmer or
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61349:25"/>
Collector of Taxes and Tribute-money; nor found to be
any where prohibited by God? Sure 'tis, that Chriſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
forbad it. When the Publicans aſkt <hi>John</hi> what
they muſt do to be ſaved, he doth not bid them quit their
Employments; but directs them, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 13. not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
more than that which was appointed them. And,
<hi>Luke</hi> 19. 5. Chriſt doth not order <hi>Zacheus</hi> (the Chief
among the Publicans) to lay down his Office, nor finds
any fault with him on account of his Employ: and the
Publican that, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 10. went up into the Temple to
pray, and return'd to his houſe more Juſtified, in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Chriſt, than the Phariſee; we do not read that
he left off being a Publican; nor thoſe others who, <hi>Luke</hi>
7. 29. and <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 7. juſtified and praiſed God, and
were dear and intimate with Chriſt and his Apoſtles. In
ſhort, I ſay, that the Holy Writ, that is, God hath not at
any time or place condemn'd, or any ways ſpoke againſt
Publicans for their very being Publicans, that is, Tax-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers;
which all ſober men will voluntarily grant me.
Upon which Conceſſion, I argue thus: God in Scripture
condemns not a Publican as a Publican. Now whom
God condemns not, he cannot be excommunicated by
any Law of God; therefore no Publican could by the
Law of God be prohibited acceſs to the Temple, or to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worſhip. I therefore make this concluſion: No Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
could by the Law be condemned or excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
but Chriſt commands that he that neglects to hear
that Church which he there ſpeaks of, ſhould be to him
as a Publican: therefore he wills, that he ſhould be to
him as a man who was not by the Law of God accurſed,
that is, not barely for his being a Publican. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
theſe Excommunication-men ſay, that the words, Let
him be to thee as a Publican, ſignifie as much as if he had
ſaid, Let him be to thee as a Publican is to the Phariſees;
'tis both abſurd, falſe, and impoſſible: for 'tis in no ſort

               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               </gap>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:61349:27"/>
credible, that Chriſt in the ſame place in which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
to inſtitute (as our Adverſaries will have it) a
thing of that weight and moment, and ſo beneficial and
neceſſary to the Church, ſhould or would make the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
action of moſt profligate men, the Rule and Meaſure
for all the World to go by afterwards. Beſides, it hath
been already prov'd, that no man was ever excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Jews, after the rate that we now talk of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.
And laſtly, all the words of Chriſt are
inconſiſtent with this their interpretation: for Chriſt here
talks neither of, nor with the Phariſees, but all is betwixt
him and the Diſciples, and <hi>the ſubject of</hi> the diſcourſe is
of avoiding Scandals; and this is the thing that Chriſt
ſays, If the Wrong Doer neglect to hear the Church, let
him be to thee, that is, he is to thee, as a Publican;
<hi>to thee,</hi> not to the Phariſees. Moreover, 'tis plain that
Chriſt and his Diſciples, and other good men, had no
hatred for the Publicans; moſt certainly they never
thought them to deſerve Excommunication, but did dayly
eat and live with them. And in that Chriſt joyns the
Heathen and Publican together, we muſt needs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that Chriſt ſpeaks of a matter common to them
both: therefore theſe words, Let him be to thee as a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican,
muſt have quite another meaning from theſe, Let
him be to thee as an excommunicate perſon. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
muſt be the meaning of the place: If he neglect to hear
the Church, you may (as to this matter) proceed againſt
him without offence or ſcandal to any man, as if you had
to do with an Heathen man or a Publican. Now he that
had a Controverſie with any ſuch, was forced to ſubmit
his Cauſe to the Roman Magiſtracy; (which is plain, as
to the Heathens alone: and that 'twas ſo for the Publicans,
may eaſily appear, for that they were the ſworn Officers of
the Romans, even againſt their own Nation; and for that
alſo, that they could expect ſcarce common Juſtice from
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61349:27"/>
the Phariſees and Chiefs of the Jews, who accounted them
the moſt deſpicable and profligate of mankind.) But
Chriſt allowed not this <hi>Appeal to the Roman Magiſtrate</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
a Brother-Jew, till he had endeavoured a Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
that way which Chriſt propoſed, and which had
before been preſcribed them by the Law. St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
for himſelf, in the laſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> looks much the
ſame way, to wit, that he had never appeal'd unto <hi>Caeſar</hi>
had he not been conſtrain'd; nor did he it to accuſe the
Jews, but defend himſelf from violence and wrong. The
Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. commands, that if any Chriſtian had a
matter againſt another, he ſhould decide it before the
Saints, and not preſently go to law before the unjuſt: But
if a Chriſtian had juſt cauſe of Action againſt an Infidel,
what doubt is there, but that he might proſecute his Right
before an Heathen Magiſtrate? So if any one did neglect
or deſpiſe the Sentence, Judgment, <hi>and Admonitions</hi> of
the Elders of the Church, he that was the Sufferer, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd
perſon, might without offence to his Neighbour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
unto the Heathen Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p n="46">XLVI. But we ſhall handle this matter with the more
perſpicuity, if we take into examination what, and of
what nature that Church was, which Chriſt commanded
the injur'd perſon to tell it unto: in the clearing of which,
I lay this for the entrance and foundation; which I doubt
not but all men will allow of, and I know none that ever
denies it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That Chriſt ſpeaks of a Church that
was then in being; how could he otherwiſe have bid them
tell it to a Church which was <hi>then</hi> nowhere to be found,
and of which, and of its <hi>nature and</hi> conſtitution, they as
yet heard nothing? Had he deſign'd the raiſing a new
Church, or new form of Government <hi>as yet</hi> unknown to
the Apoſtles, he had deliver'd them but a very lame Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
for that he neither told them who were that
Church, nor how, nor of what <hi>ſort or number</hi> of men it
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61349:28"/>
was to be made up of, nor the ways of their judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,
nor <hi>what</hi> penalties <hi>they might inflict, and the
like:</hi> Neither did he ſpeak of all kind of ſins, as I have
before proved; and even they who build their Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
upon this Text, are forc'd themſelves to confeſs
as well as we (for they openly own) that Chriſt took
notice here onely of private Treſpaſſes. But whenever
Chriſt made any new Inſtitution, he omitted nothing that
was requiſite to its being and ſubſiſtency: here he onely
ſays, <hi>Tell it unto the Church;</hi> and if he neglect to hear
her, he gives the Complainant liberty to look on him as
a Publican: here's no penalty annext <hi>to the Contumacy.</hi>
St. <hi>Luke</hi> when he ſets down the ſame paſſage, recounts it
not with all thoſe particularities as St. <hi>Matthew</hi> does. The
other two Evangeliſts make not the leaſt mention of it;
who yet would ſcarce have paſs'd over a matter of ſuch
moment and neceſſity, had they known that Chriſt had
then firſt made any ſuch new Inſtitution. To which we
may adde, that the Apoſtles were all along firmly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Chriſt ſhould not die, or change the Jewiſh Rites;
nor did they here, by word or otherwiſe, declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
not to underſtand what Chriſt here taught them, or
ſhew any forwardneſs to aſk farther after it, or to wonder,
as if he had told them an unuſual and unheard of piece of
Doctrine. <hi>Peter</hi> onely wondered at this, that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to forgive his Brother ſo many times <hi>together:
Surely</hi> therefore they never took theſe words of Chriſt to
be inſtitutive of a new form of Government, which they
had never dreamt of before, but believed themſelves to be
taught (as truly they were) when <hi>and for what</hi> they
might without offence and ſcandal, accuſe or implead a
Brother Jew before an Heathen Magiſtrate. And at this
day 'tis rarely ſeen that Jews go to law with Jews before
Chriſtian Judges.</p>
            <p n="47">XLVII. But if any aſk me whether and how then can
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61349:28"/>
this Precept reach all men? whether it be of farther uſe
than for thoſe alone that live under an Unchriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy?
my anſwer is, That the firſt part of it, of labouring
a Reconciliation before we appeal to the Magiſtrate, <hi>or
go to law about the matter,</hi> belongs to all Chriſtians; but
the latter is of no <hi>force or</hi> uſe, but where true Profeſſors
live under an Unchriſtian <hi>or Antichriſtian</hi> Magiſtrate.
St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 6. v.</hi> 1. &amp; 4. therefore adviſes the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
to chuſe out ſome among themſelves who may judge
<hi>ſuch Controverſies betwixt man and man,</hi> that they <hi>GO
NOT TO LAW BEFORE THE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ST, that is, the Heathen
Roman Judges.</hi> Who doubts but that the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
might lawfully have conven'd <hi>a Chriſtian Brother that
had injur'd them,</hi> before the Roman and Gentile Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals,
if he had refuſed to ſtand to the Determination of
thoſe who were choſe from among themſelves <hi>to judge on
ſuch occaſions,</hi> or if he mended not upon their Sentence?
'Tis certain, that St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaw himſelf hardly preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by the Jews, appealed unto <hi>Caeſar, Acts</hi> 25. 11. which,
<hi>Acts</hi> 28. 19. he excuſes to thoſe Jews that lived at <hi>Rome.</hi>
But he that ſhall carefully compare <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. with
<hi>Ecclus</hi> 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. with this Chapter of St.
<hi>Matthew,</hi> will be able much more clearly and eaſily to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
this whole matter, and may obſerve how well all
hangs together; eſpecially if he diligently note the latter
part of Chriſt's and of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, which were juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
omitted in <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſticus,</hi> there being then no
occaſion for them, for that the Jewiſh Nation was not
then ſubject to any forreign Power, as they were in our
Saviour's and St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time to the Roman Empire.</p>
            <p n="48">XLVIII. And thus far, as I conceive, all will eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
that Chriſt ſpoke of a Church which was then in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
I mean, the Church in <hi>Judea;</hi> but quickly ſhall we
be divided again in our enquiry what Chriſt underſtood
by the word Church: for ſometimes it is put for the whole
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61349:29"/>
Congregation or Multitude <hi>gathered together;</hi> ſometimes
for the Senate, Council, or Elders, which were its Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.
Thus find we the Hebrew words to ſignifie a
Church, Company, or Congregation, (as <hi>Num. 35. 24, 25.
Joſh. 20. 6. Pſal.</hi> 82. 1. and elſewhere) which the Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuagint
renders by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Congregation. Now
there are Arguments of no little weight, <hi>to induce us to
conclude,</hi> that Chriſt in this paſſage of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> would
not have us underſtand by the word Church, the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
or <hi>Congregation of</hi> People, but the Jewiſh Senate or
Council, called ſometimes <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for, <hi>first,</hi>
'tis evident that Chriſt did not innovate any thing in the
forms of Judicature or Government which were admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
agreeable to the Law; nor did he himſelf, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
his Diſciples to do any thing contrary to what
<hi>Moſes</hi> had rightly inſtituted by Gods command. Now
<hi>Moſes</hi> did ordain, that ſuch Suits and Controverſies ſhould
be decided not by the Multitude, but by the Senate or
Sanedrim of ſuch and ſuch places; which at firſt was held
at the Gates of each City, <hi>where the Elders ſate to judge.</hi>
Had Chriſt thought of introducing any thing here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Inſtitution of <hi>Moſes,</hi> his Diſciples muſt needs
have been highly moved at it, who were all their lives
ſtrict obſervers of the Law. Let every man think with
himſelf what <hi>dust and</hi> Triumphs the Phariſees would have
rais'd, could they have in truth fixt ſo criminal <hi>an Action</hi>
upon him, that he in oppoſition to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> had
ſtir'd up the People againſt the Magiſtrate! what fairer
pretext could they have wiſh'd to lay Sedition to his
charge, than by proving upon him this attempt, to ſet up
the People againſt the Magiſtrate, contrary to Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination?
to commit to them the Examination of
Witneſſes? to give them a power to convene whom they
would before them? to grant them cognizance of Gauſes,
and power of Judicature? <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt commanded
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61349:29"/>
to tell it unto that Church, which had power to ſend for
and call before them the party accuſed; which might hear
the Cauſe, which might examine Witneſſes, (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he commands us in the ſecond place to take two or
three, that the Fact may be competently prov'd) and
laſtly, which might pronounce their Sentence <hi>and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
in the caſe. But every one muſt know, that theſe
things could not be done by the Croud, the Multitude,
without chuſing ſome ſet perſons who might manage and
moderate matters. (It muſt be a very ſmall Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>a very handful of men,</hi> who could be able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without the Elders, to diſpatch ſuch Cauſes: for
which reaſon ſome have rightly judg'd that this Precept
of Chriſt could not hold well, <hi>could be of little or no uſe,</hi>
but when the Church conſiſted of very few Members.)
But now ſince that they who thus preſide <hi>in theſe Affairs,</hi>
are in very truth nothing but the Senate, the Sanedrim,
<hi>the Seſſions of the Elders;</hi> it again follows, that Chriſt
commanded not to tell it unto the Multitude, but to the
<hi>Council or</hi> Sanedrim: and truly in Chriſt's time the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had not the power of chuſing their Magiſtracy and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.
We muſt needs therefore by <hi>the word</hi> Church
underſtand the Jewiſh Senate or Council; as 'tis plain
the Diſciples did, from what has been already ſaid.
Therefore if the meaning of the Church there, be <hi>all the
Members of it,</hi> the People; we are then to tell it unto
a Church which has <hi>right and</hi> authority to make choice of
ſuch a Senate or Council as was that of the Jewiſh Church;
but our Churches have no power to chuſe ſuch a Council
as the Jewiſh Sanedrim was: nay, in Chriſt's time the Jews
themſelves had not that liberty, as I told you juſt now.
We might adde, that when the Scripture ſpeaks of the
Multitude, it generally uſes the words People, Multitude,
Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or the like comprehenſive words; but
when any thing is related to be ſaid or done in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:61349:30"/>
or in all the Congregation. I need not tell you
that this form of ſpeech is uſual at this very day: for we
ſay, we have communicated the matter to ſuch a Kingdom
or State, when we have acquainted <hi>onely</hi> the King, Senate,
or Governing part of ſuch State or Kingdom: We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how this or that Nation has rewarded a man, when
the Repreſentatives onely in ſuch a Dyet or Parliament
hath been liberal-handed to them. 'Tis ſo common a thing
to uſe phraſes of this nature, that 'tis wonderful ſo few
ſhould have obſerv'd it.</p>
            <p>But the ſum of all is this: Chriſt alter'd not the Cuſtoms
of his time, nor introduced any Novelties or Changes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their <hi>Courts of Judicature, or Meaſures and Ways of</hi>
Judging; nor do his Diſciples betray any ſuſpition of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation
or Alteration: and therefore his Command is to
acquaint the Sanedrim, before their <hi>denier</hi> reſort to the
Heathen Magiſtracy.</p>
            <p n="49">XLIX. Now, 'tis evident from Holy Writ, (<hi>as well as
other Hiſtory</hi>) that the Sanedrim was the legal Magiſtracy
<hi>of the Jewiſh Nation,</hi> and that in Chriſt days they both
kept and us'd the power of the Sword. Many things in
the Narratives of the Paſſion of Chriſt, beſides other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonials,
evince as much: They ſend armed men to take
Jeſus; they proceed in examining Witneſſes, as the Law
requir'd (at leaſt they pretended ſo); they command
him to be ſet before them in Judgment; they delivered
him bound to <hi>Pilate,</hi> after they had firſt publickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd
him: they openly condemn <hi>Stephen,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to be ſtoned: they ſeize the Apoſtles, and put
them in the common Priſon; they cauſe them to be bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
after a general Conſult held about them: they give
Letters and authority to <hi>Paul</hi> to bring any that he found
of that way, bound to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for to be puniſhed. The
Jews themſelves, with the Elders and High Prieſt, that is, the
Sanedrim, ſay it in expreſs terms, by their Speaker <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus;</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:61349:30"/>
who accuſing <hi>Paul</hi> before <hi>Foelix, Acts 24. v.</hi> 2. adds,
v. 6. <hi>That they took him, and would have judg'd him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their Law, but that</hi> Lyſias <hi>came upon them, and
with great violence took him away out of their hands.</hi> And
<hi>Acts 23. v.</hi> 3. ſays <hi>Paul</hi> to the High Prieſt, <hi>Sittest thou to
judge me after the Law, and commandest me to be ſmitten
contrary to the Law?</hi> And afterwards, <hi>Acts 26. v. 10.
Paul</hi> confeſſes before King <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Feſtus,</hi> that <hi>many
of the Saints he ſhut up in priſon, having received authority
from the Chief Prieſts; and when they were put to death,
he gave his voice againſt them, and puniſhed them often in
every Synagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme; and</hi>
farther, <hi>perſecuted them into ſtrange Cities;</hi> ſtill acting
under the authority derived from the High Prieſts, as
when he was going to <hi>Damaſcus</hi> by their Commiſſion,
<hi>v.</hi> 12. I can't imagine but that <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <hi>Feſtus too,</hi>
knew well enough whether it was lawful or not for their
Council to do ſo; and ſure they would not have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
him in the manner they did, <hi>v.</hi> 34, &amp; 35. had not the
Authority he had been committed by, been warrantable:
for <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould have offended no leſs againſt <hi>Caeſar,</hi> than
againſt the Phariſees. For he who doth an unlawful act
by the permiſſion and command of them who have no
right nor authority to permit and command, tranſgreſſes
no leſs than they that command it: but no ſuch thing is
charg'd upon the Accuſers or Accuſed; but <hi>Paul</hi> is fully
acquitted, as one that <hi>hath done nothing worthy of death or
of bonds.</hi> And had not the Jewiſh Sanedrim had this
<hi>authority and</hi> liberty <hi>then leſt them, Pilate</hi> could not have
ſaid to them, <hi>Joh. 18. 31. Take ye him, and judge him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to your law:</hi> And when they anſwer, that <hi>it was
not lawful for them to put any man to death;</hi> this muſt be
underſtood either (as St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> interprets it) at the
time of that Feſtival, for fear of the People, or (as St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expounds it) of that kind of Death which
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61349:31"/>
they deſired that Chriſt ſhould die. With which latter
Opinion, the words of St. <hi>John</hi> which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
very well agree, <hi>to wit, That the ſaying of Jeſus might
be fulfilled, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould
die.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 55, 56. where
Chriſt ſays, <hi>I ſate dayly with you teaching in the temple, and
ye laid no hold no me; but all this was done, that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures
of the Prophets might be fulfilled.</hi> They took him
therefore at a time when, by reaſon of the Feaſt then at
hand, and for fear of the People, they could not put him
to death: vid. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26 5. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14. 2. Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they could not bear that he ſhould live any longer,
and they could not well take his life away themſelves, it
follows <hi>of courſe,</hi> that he muſt be deliver'd into the hands
of the Romans; that ſo all things which he had, (<hi>Mat.</hi>
24.) foretold his Diſciples, might be fulfilled; as the words
of St. <hi>John</hi> intimate, and as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree:
And thoſe <hi>Cries and</hi> Vociferations of the People,
<hi>Crucifie him, crucifie him,</hi> give farther Teſtimony to this
Interpretation.</p>
            <p n="50">L. By what has been ſaid, the falſity of that Affirmation
is apparently detected, which ſays, that the Sanedrim had
not the power of the Sword, that is, the authority of Life
and Death; and that <hi>Stephen</hi> was ſton'd tumultuouſly by
the Rabble, <hi>and not by Decree of the Council.</hi> For I think
I have proved beyond all contradiction, that ſuch a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
they had; and for St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s caſe, 'tis clear, that he
was not tumultuouſly ſlain, for that <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 12. he was ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
brought and accuſed before the Council; Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
were produced, though falſe ones, <hi>v.</hi> 13. they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him out of the City; and thoſe Witneſſes, as the Law
provides, caſt the firſt ſtones at him, as may be eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd
from their laying down their Clothes at <hi>Saul</hi>'s feet,
<hi>v.</hi> 58. The ſame too may be as fully proved out of <hi>other</hi>
Hiſtories: for <hi>Joſephus</hi> in his fourteenth book of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61349:31"/>
of the Jews (<hi>ch.</hi> 12. 16, &amp; 17. according to the Greek
Copies) tells us, That the Romans gave liberty to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and by name to the Jews who dwelt in or out of
<hi>Judea,</hi> to uſe their own Laws in things relating to Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and to live freely according to their own Rites and
Cuſtoms. And in that twelfth Chapter he quotes <hi>Strabo</hi>
for his Author, that he (writing of the City <hi>Cyrene)
ſays,</hi> they had there a Preſident <hi>or Chief Ruler</hi> who heard
and decided their Cauſes, and tranſacted all affairs, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
as if they had been an Independent State. That
alſo makes farther for us which we read, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 15. of
<hi>Gallio</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Achaia;</hi> where he tells them, that
if it be a matter of <hi>their Law,</hi> they <hi>may look to it.</hi> The
ſame <hi>Joſephus,</hi> lib. 16. ch. 4, &amp; 5. recounts how <hi>Herod</hi>
had obtained of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> that the Jews in <hi>Aſia</hi> might have
the freedom of enjoying the Priviledges before that time
indulg'd them by the Romans. I take occaſion to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this, becauſe ſome object that <hi>Herod deſtroy'd and</hi> ſlew
all the Sanedrim, and ſtript them of all Authority; as if
none had ſucceeded thoſe that were kill'd: How likely is
it that <hi>Herod</hi> ſhould take from them in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that
power of judging in matters relating to Religion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
therein according to their Law, who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd
to procure and preſerve the ſame to all the other
<hi>Aſiaticks?</hi> Beſides, the time of Chriſt's preaching fell not
under <hi>Herod</hi> or <hi>Archelaus,</hi> but under <hi>the Government of
Pilate:</hi> 'Tis certain that the Jews forced even <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf
to ſend again out of the City the Roman Standards (which
he had cauſed to be privately introduc'd) to prevent the
breach of Gods Commands of ſuffering any Image in the
City. <hi>And that</hi> they reſerv'd and continued this Power
to themſelves, to the very deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> may be
clearly gathered from <hi>Joſephus</hi> his Oration to the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
The Romans, ſays he (in his fifth Book of the Wars
of the Jews, <hi>ch.</hi> 26.) exact Tribute of us, for that our
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61349:32"/>
Forefathers have a long time been wont to pay it to theirs:
If in this you comply, they'll neither ſack this our City,
nor meddle with our Temple, but leave both you, your
Goods, and Families free, and the free uſe and enjoyment
of your ſacred Laws. <hi>Titus</hi> himſelf, after his having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the City, ſaid almoſt the very ſame to the Jews, <hi>lib. 6.
chap.</hi> 34. Whether therefore we conſult the Holy Writ,
or the Jewiſh Hiſtory, 'tis an undoubted truth, that that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedrim
which Chriſt commanded to tell it unto, had the
power of the Sword, the power of Life and Death, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
over thoſe who ſin'd againſt their Religion: (for in
Civil matters, and Cauſes of Right and Wrong, where the
Law had not ſpecified the Puniſhment, I do not queſtion
but that the Romans encroached and uſurp'd, if not all,
yet moſt of them, to themſelves, as is eaſily diſcernable
out of Hiſtory, and may well be conjectur'd out of <hi>Acts</hi>
18. <hi>v.</hi> 12.)</p>
            <p n="51">LI. And 'tis no ways repugnant to what we have ſaid,
that in <hi>Joſephus</hi> his Antiquities of the Jews, ſome of them
tell <hi>Albinus,</hi> that it was not lawful for the High Prieſt to
call the Sanedrim or Council, without his leave: For he
there, as an Hiſtorian, relates what others did; not that
he applauds or approves of the Fact thereby. Beſides,
<hi>peradventure</hi> the High Prieſt during the <hi>interregnum,</hi> that
is, whilſt <hi>Albinus</hi> (after the death of <hi>Feſtus</hi>) was no his
Journey <hi>thither,</hi> ought not to ſummon a Court for a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of that weight and moment, till the new Governour
confirm'd him in that Authority: for he had procur'd
that <hi>James</hi> the Lords Brother (who was vulgarly ſirna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the <hi>Just</hi>) ſhould be put to death; who being a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
well belov'd by all, many took it very ill <hi>at his hands:</hi>
for he was but newly got to that Dignity, and not <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
of, or</hi> confirm'd in it by the Roman Governour.
And <hi>Euſebius,</hi> in the ſecond of his Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,
<hi>chap.</hi> 23. tells us, that this High Prieſt ſnatcht at this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61349:32"/>
of the <hi>interregnum.</hi> But what's all this to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
Was not <hi>Archelaus,</hi> who was ſtiled King in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Herod</hi>'s laſt Will (and that by the Allowance and
Gift of <hi>Caeſar</hi>) was he not therefore King, becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
the Name and Authority of a King, till he had <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>'s
confirmation for it? And not the Magiſtrates of ſome
Cities (of which there are many in <hi>Germany</hi>) who are
ſubject to ſome particular Prince, not true and lawful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
becauſe on the death of the Prince they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd
to pray the Confirmation of their Priviledges from
the Succeſſor? But now that the High Prieſt had power,
after his Confirmation, to convoke the Judges of the Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim,
is clear enough, for that they do not ſay to <hi>Albinus,</hi>
that this ſummoning them was in it ſelf unlawful, but that
it ought not to have been done by him, without the <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
and</hi> privity of <hi>Albinus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="52">LII. It has now been fully and ſolidly prov'd, that, <hi>Tell
it unto the Church,</hi> ſignifies no more than Tell it unto the
Magiſtrate of thy People (or who is of the ſame Religion
with thy ſelf) before you implead your Brother in the
Heathen Courts, as St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 6. 5. hath incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
expounded it; where he commands them for this
cauſe to chuſe perſons out of themſelves to judge and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrate
their Quarrels. But now who doubts but that this
Precept holds not, where God hath bleſſed us with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> Magiſtracy, a Magiſtracy of the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
with our ſelves? Indeed St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in the ſecond
Chapter of Faith and Works, plainly enough informs us,
that he accounted Excommunication ſupplied the place
and defect of the viſible Sword, when the Church wanted
that <hi>external aid:</hi> for, as he would have it, <hi>Moſes</hi> his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
Tranſgreſſors with Death, and <hi>Phineas</hi> his ſlaying
the Adulterers, did typifie and prefigure the puniſhing
evil men by Degradations and Excommunications; that
is, at ſuch time as the material Sword, <hi>the Civil Temporal
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61349:33"/>
Power,</hi> ſhould be wanting in the Church. I remember
that ſome Modern Writers hold, that the Jews had and
retain'd this Cuſtom of Excommunicating, becauſe the
Sword was taken from them; (which I have prov'd by
irrefragable Reaſon, Argument, and Teſtimonies, to be
utterly falſe:) but were it but thus far true, it muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
follow, that there's no occaſion for Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in ſuch a Church which hath the Civil Authority
of its ſide: Nor is it requir'd as a thing obligatory to us,
to chuſe Judges or Arbitrators, other than the lawful Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatures
of the Land. <hi>Be it how it will,</hi> nothing can be
more certain, than that the word Church in this paſſage of
<hi>Matthew</hi> ſignifies nothing leſs than a Church-Senate, a
Council of <hi>Clergie-men or</hi> Eccleſiaſticks, endowed with
a Faculty, a Right or Power to ſhut out <hi>whom they pleaſe</hi>
from the Sacraments.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII. Two Objections yet remain: <hi>Firſt,</hi> How any
one can be ſaid to neglect to hear the Church, if that and
the Civil Magiſtrate, who hath the power of the Sword,
are the ſame thing? <hi>Secondly,</hi> How that paſſage of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and looſing, <hi>Mat. 18. v.</hi> 18. ſuits with this matter?
To the firſt, the Anſwer is intimated before, That the Jews
had not then power of judging in all matters, but almoſt
every thing that related not to Religion, belong'd to the
Roman Judicatures: And therefore Chriſt permits, that if
any one neglects or contemns the Authority of the Sane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drim
in ſuch matters, the injur'd perſon may proſecute his
Right before the Heathen Magiſtrate; in like manner as
if he were to ſue an Heathen or Publican. Beſides, many
caſes may occur, which the Law had not provided a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
<hi>and proper</hi> puniſhment for, or had not prohibited
under any penalty at all; in which caſe it may well be,
that the Offender may be diſmiſt without more ado than a
verbal <hi>chiding or</hi> admonition. Now if the Wrong Doer
does not yet leave wronging him, the party injur'd may
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61349:33"/>
ſeek farther ſatisfaction, and may again and again apply
himſelf to the Church or Magiſtrate to puniſh the other's
obſtinacy: But though this Anſwer hold true, yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ſeems, in my mind, more appoſite and ſuitable to the
purpoſe and deſigne of Chriſt, as well as to the ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
of time and place, and the like.</p>
            <p n="54">LIV. To the ſecond, there is as little difficulty in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
it an Anſwer: for ſince the manner of ſpeaking is
the ſame, and almoſt the ſelf-ſame words are here repeated
which are uſed by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. 'tis neceſſary that
they ſignifie either the ſame thing, or ſomething very like
it; but in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 19. to bind and to looſe ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to preach the Goſpel; whereby he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
in it, is looſed from Sin and from Death: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
can ſignifie here no more than the deſiring his Brother
to leave injuring him, and rather to become good and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate
to him; this being a thing acceptable unto God,
and he will ſurely puniſh thoſe that break this great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<hi>of Love and Charity. Now</hi> he that thus wins
upon his Brother by ſoft advice and entreaties to forbear
wronging him, and urging to him the <hi>revealed</hi> Will of
God, and what Wrath he has in ſtore for them that thus
offend; if his Admonitions have their effect, he hath
gained his Brother, that is, he hath looſed him: if they
return unſucceſsful, <hi>he is ſtill bound,</hi> the Wrath of God
remains upon him, in like manner as it doth upon him who
having heard the Word of the Goſpel preached unto him,
believes or diſbelieves it. But now that we might be ready
and forward to forgive them that repent, Chriſt labour'd
to perſwade us to it by that moſt appoſite Parable of <hi>the
Kings taking account of his ſervants, which he ſubjoyn'd
to this paſſage;</hi> whereby Chriſt's meaning and purpoſe is
mightily cleared, <hi>as to the ſence we have put upon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="55">LV. I cannot but infinitely wonder, how or why ſome
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:61349:34"/>
men do here expound this binding or looſing by driving
men from the Sacraments, and readmitting them thither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
when throughout the whole Bible theſe words are
never put for any ſuch matter, and the Apoſtles have
neither by word or otherwiſe diſcover'd that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
Chriſt in ſuch a ſence. There is extant a Precept of
Chriſt, that if any refuſed to receive the Goſpel, they
ſhould depart out of that houſe or City, ſhaking off the
duſt of their feet againſt them, <hi>Luke 10. 11. Mat.</hi> 10. 14.
which they put in practice, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 25. and 18. 6. But
that they ſhould deny any Sacrament to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
the Word, and were baptized unto Chriſt, and
embraced his Religion and Doctrine, we nowhere find it
either enjoyned unto, or practiſed by them, as hath been
before abundantly and firmly proved. But it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
at preſent to inform <hi>the World,</hi> that it can never be
made out by Holy Writ, that Binding is put for Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Believers from receiving the Sacrament; or Looſing
to ſignifie a Readmiſſion again of him who had been for
his ſins <hi>and contumacies</hi> debarr'd, and thus to re-engraft
him as 'twere into the Church anew.</p>
            <p n="56">LVI. Thus have I firmly and truly prov'd, that Chriſt
in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 19. treats not of Excluſion from Sacraments,
but of the charitable management and compoſure of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Injuries between <hi>fellow-brethren, men profeſſing the
ſame Faith.</hi> But others have ſeen this before, as well as
I; as St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his ſixteenth Sermon upon St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew;</hi>
and <hi>Theophylact,</hi> who (as no body can otherwiſe
doubt) borrowed this Opinion (as almoſt all he ſays be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides)
from <hi>Chryſoſtom.</hi> Among the more modern Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
<hi>D. Johannes Brentius</hi> writes many things in his
Comments upon this Chapter, very agreeable to what we
have ſaid.</p>
            <p n="57">LVII. 'Tis now requiſite that I ſhould ſhew that the
action of St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor. 5. 3, &amp;c.</hi> is nothing of kin to this
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:61349:34"/>
Excommunication. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Apoſtle appears to
have been a ſtrict obſerver of the Moſaick Law; againſt
which (as he anſwers for himſelf, <hi>Acts</hi> 25. 8.) he had
not at all offended: And, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. 18. and 21. <hi>v.</hi> 24, 26.
it appears, that he with other of the Apoſtles, complied
with the Ceremonies of the Law, <hi>and bore the Jews com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
in keeping them;</hi> and was ill ſpoken of by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi>
Jews, not for teaching the Gentiles that the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Law was not requir'd of them, but for teaching
the Jews which were among the Gentiles to forſake <hi>Moſes,</hi>
&amp;c. whereas all the believing Jews that were in <hi>Judea,</hi>
kept <hi>and were zealous of</hi> the Law, <hi>v.</hi> 20. But who knows
not that Chriſt changed not the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> in that
point of celebrating the Paſſover, which commands all to
come who were circumciſed? and therefore neither doth
he keep back that inceſtuous perſon, nor any other, from
communicating at the Lords Table, who would come and
profeſs the Chriſtian Faith. As to the Jews, 'tis a plain
caſe, who would never have ſuffer'd ſuch an Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
upon their Law, and their <hi>conſtant</hi> inveterate uſage
<hi>to the contrary:</hi> And who can well think that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
ſhould be in worſe circumſtances <hi>than they,</hi> as to this
purpoſe?</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. <hi>But again,</hi> if the delivery to Satan was no more
than a bare interdiction from the Sacraments till <hi>his</hi> repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
why did <hi>Paul</hi> excuſe himſelf to the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
with all that care and niceneſs? Why did he ſo near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
him, as 'twere, of what he had done? (as we read
he did, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4. and 7. <hi>v.</hi> 8.) Beſides, why were
the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſo overwhelm'd with grief, if they already
knew this to be the method and practice of the Church
in puniſhing ſinners, and that this was to be a laſting Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
<hi>for all ſucceſſions of Ages?</hi> they ſhould rather, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
have rejoyced that they had ſuch a Preſident and
Pattern given them to walk by for the future. If it were
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61349:35"/>
but a ſpur to Repentance, and an wholſome and ſafe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
againſt Damnation, why did their ſorrows run ſo
high? why were they not rather rejoyced? Chriſt tells
us, that the Angels of God rejoyce more over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
of one Sinner, than over ninety nine juſt perſons.
The <hi>Corinthians</hi> therefore could not have had the Spirit
of Chriſt in them, had they conceiv'd ſuch mighty ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
on ſeeing the Apoſtle do this and no more, and bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to recal an erring Brother into the right way again,
and ſave him from that damnation he was pulling down
upon his own head: But who can <hi>be ſo blind as</hi> not <hi>to</hi>
ſee that the Apoſtle ſtruck deeper than this comes to?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What need had the Apoſtle to write <hi>to them,</hi>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 8. that he does not repent, though he did repent?
or how indeed could he any ways repent him of what he
had done, if his purpoſe was to have it put <hi>dayly</hi> in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
every where, and in all Churches? or if it were but
a Temporary Secluſion from the Sacrament, and at longeſt
but till his repentance?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What occaſion was there that the <hi>Corinthians</hi>
ſhould uſe ſuch earneſt and powerful Interceſſions with
the Apoſtle on that Wretch's behalf, if they knew that
upon his repentance he ſhould ſtraitway be admitted into
their Fellowſhip again? But that they did earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
for him, 'tis evident from the Apoſtles words, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
2. 10. <hi>To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive alſo: for
if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your ſaeke
forgave I it in the preſence of Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> We find <hi>Paul</hi> in that ſecond Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 9. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing
himſelf, that one of his aims was to know the proof
of their Obedience; And in the ſeventh Chapter, <hi>v.</hi> 12.
he tells them, he did it <hi>that his care for them in the ſight
of God, might appear to them.</hi> How could he have ſaid
or writ thus, if he had commanded them no greater a
matter than that they ſhould trun away ſuch a one from
the Sacrament?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61349:35"/>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> How ſhall we ever make theſe words hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>Ye were made ſorry in a godly manner (or with
reſpect to God) that ye might receive damage by us in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</hi>
2 Cor. 7. 9. He tells them, they ſuffer'd no loſs,
damage, or detriment by that ſorrow of theirs, for
that their grief had been prevalent with him for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
that unhappy Wretch: without this they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
loſs, even the loſs of that <hi>inceſtnous</hi> perſon. But
pray what loſs had it been to them, if he had been onely
to be kept from the Sacrament till he repented?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly, Paul</hi> ſpeaks not there of the Lords Supper,
but of the whole Life of a Chriſtian; and therefore his
meaning muſt be, not to put him away from the Table of
the Lord, but from among them, <hi>that is, out of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> that
that little Leaven might not vitiate the whole Maſs. This
is ſuitable to the Apoſtles phraſe, and to the Figure of Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
but Excommunication cannot be eaſily accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
either to his or <hi>Moſes</hi>'s words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It muſt be obſerv'd, that he doth not ſay ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
that they <hi>themſelves, and they onely,</hi> when they are
gathered together in the Name of the Lord, or according
to Chriſts command, ſhould deliver him to Satan, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him of the Sacrament; but, <hi>I verily, as abſent in
body, but preſent in ſpirit, have judged already as though I
were preſent, concerning him that hath ſo done this deed,
in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Christ, when ye are gathered
together, and my ſpirit, with the power of our Lord Jeſus
Christ, to deliver ſuch an one to Satan,</hi> &amp;c. Plainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating,
that the power of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to intervene in this buſineſs; and therefore was a
matter of greater moment than a Temporary Amotion
from the Sacrament: Beſides, he ſays, that he himſelf had
already judged (though (perhaps by reaſon of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence)
he determin'd not to do it without them) he doth
not command the Church that they by themſelves ſhould
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61349:36"/>
do this, as if this were purely an Apoſtolical, not an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Power; <hi>an authority annexed to the perſons of
the Apoſtles, and not to any Church or other Order or Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of men:</hi> which are conſiderations not to be ſlurr'd
over with ſlight and contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We do not any-where read that the Apoſtle
commanded any ſingle perſon, or number of men, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
any one to Satan for the deſtruction of the Fleſh,
either whilſt he lived, or when he ſhould be dead and
gone; well knowing, that this was appropriated to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick
Power, and <hi>not to be delegated,</hi> not to be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to any other <hi>or leſs Authority:</hi> for as they had the
Power of Healing, ſo had they that of Wounding too, as
appears, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 5, 10. and 13. 11. for which reaſon we read
not of any ordained by the Apoſtles, that are commanded
to exerciſe this Extraordinary Power. And therefore the
Apoſtle is ever and anon threatning them with his coming
in power; with his being ſharp and ſevere upon them;
with his dealing with them according to the power given
him by God; with his coming to them with a Rod, <hi>and
the like:</hi> and commands to note thoſe by Epiſtle that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.
This is not a thing given in charge to the Elders;
that it may be without all controverſie, that this Power
was granted to the Apoſtles, and to none elſe. Of the
ſame import is that which we read, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menaeus</hi>
and <hi>Alexander,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> (not the Church, nor
the Preſbyters, nor any other perſons whatſoever) deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
unto Satan.</p>
            <p n="59">LIX. I have hitherto, by way of Argument, and from
Circumſtances, clearly evinced, that 'twas a thing of a
quite different nature, to deliver to Satan, and to ſhut
out from the Sacrament. Now proceed I to demonſtrate
the ſame truth from the words themſelves, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety,
<hi>tendency</hi> and nature of that whole paſſage: <hi>for,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Apoſtle does not ſay, Why did ye not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61349:36"/>
this inceſtuous perſon the Lords Supper? but why
have ye not mourned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. that is, why have ye
not by Mourning and Prayers put up to God, <hi>beſought</hi>
that he that hath done this deed, might be taken away
from among you, <hi>what way God ſhall best pleaſe?</hi> St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi>
in his third book againſt <hi>Parmen.</hi> explains the place
to the ſame ſence; and the ſame way doth he expound
what the Apoſtle, <hi>ch.</hi> 12. hath written of ſorrowing.
They alſo ſeem to be of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s and Truth's ſide
too, who ſuppoſe the Apoſtle to allude to 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.
&amp; 9, &amp; 12. From whence we <hi>may</hi> conjecture it to have
been an ancient Cuſtom among the Jews, to make inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
after enormous crimes, by faſting, Prayers, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
mourning, that the ſame, when detected, might be
brought to condign puniſhments as the Law requir'd.
Therefore at that time when the Church was deſtitute of
the Civil Authority, he admoniſhes them that they ought
to addreſs to God that he would (as might ſeem beſt to
him) take him out of the way; which was a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
thing from that which we call excommunicating a
man. But beſides, by what competent Author can it be
made out, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To take away from among
men,</hi> ſhould be a phraſe for debarring a man <hi>acceſs to</hi> the
Sacrament? In propriety of ſpeech he is ſaid <hi>è medio ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus,</hi>
to be taken away from among men, who is <hi>any ways</hi>
kill'd: for though a baniſhed <hi>or exil'd</hi> perſon may in ſome
ſence be ſaid to be driven away from among others, yet
in propriety of ſpeech, and as the Greeks commonly uſe
it, 'tis not ſo taken by them, at leaſtwiſe 'tis not to be
found in that ſence in Holy Writ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> But if the Apoſtles direction here be to have
him <hi>diſcommon'd and</hi> thruſt out of the Fellowſhip and
Converſe of the Faithful, what need was there of publick
mourning? he ſhould have been <hi>turn'd over and</hi> baniſht
to the Gentiles. But that's not conſiſtent with that other
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61349:37"/>
Clauſe, That his Soul may be ſaved; which (<hi>at least on
our Adverſaries principles</hi>) could never be out of <hi>the pale
of</hi> the Church. If you ſay he was onely debarr'd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Sacrament and private Commerce, he was
not then <hi>è medio eorum ſublatus; he was not taken away
from among them:</hi> for I do not think any man able to
make it out, that the Apoſtle order'd him to be kept from
the Sacrament alone, and from private Converſation, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity,
and Fellowſhip with them. This then is a mere
addition, a forc'd ſence upon the Apoſtles words, which
cannot be prov'd ever to have enter'd into his thoughts.
Truly I think that no man (who is vers'd in Scripture,
and the moſt ancient Expoſitors of it) can doubt, but
that the Apoſtle borrowed this paſſage, and the very words
that he expreſſeth himſelf in, from <hi>Deut. 17. 10. ch. 19. 20.
ch. 21. 7. ch. 22. 6, 11. ch.</hi> 24. 8. where <hi>Moſes</hi> puts the
words for cutting off the Offender by death, and for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe; and in all the alleadged places, <hi>Moſes</hi> keeps
to the ſelf-ſame words; Whereas in <hi>ch.</hi> 13. he puts
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> for <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but both in the ſame ſence. How is it
therefore poſſible that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here ſhould bear ſuch a
conſtruction, <hi>viz.</hi> to excommunicate, (as Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
now-a-days ſignifies?)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Context ſeems to prove that this Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
did not perſiſt in that <hi>piece of</hi> Wickedneſs: for in
<hi>v.</hi> 2 &amp; 3. of that fifth Chapter, 'tis, <hi>him that hath done
this deed;</hi> which ſhews he had, not that he then did, do
it. The Apoſtle therefore ſeems to deſigne the puniſhing
him for the Fact that he had committed, agreeable to the
Command of God, and to the Practice of every good
Magiſtrate: And indeed when he ſays, <hi>v. 4. That the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
may be ſaved,</hi> &amp;c. he ſeems to have been inform'd of
his penitence: for how could he otherwiſe have written
thus of a man who had given no proof how his Soul was
touch'd for ſo enormous a Wickedneſs?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:61349:37"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Apoſtle tells them, he had determin'd or
<hi>judg'd already to deliver ſuch an one unto Satan, for the
deſtruction of the fleſh, that the ſpirit may be ſaved in the
day of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Are we to ſeek for the ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>? In what prophane Author, or
in what place of Scripture, hath it a different ſence from
what 'tis here taken in, of giving, giving up, delivering,
permitting, yielding, <hi>and the like?</hi> And here we have,
firſt, the perſon giving him up, and the perſon to whom he
was ſo given, and he that was given: Nay, 'tis over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
added, why and for what purpoſe he was deliver'd
up. And as to the <hi>form of</hi> ſpeech, 'tis juſt as if I ſhould
ſay, I deliver <hi>over</hi> my Son to <hi>his</hi> Maſter, <hi>or I put him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſuch a Maſters hands,</hi> for Inſtruction, or for Diſcipline.
Who that ſhould hear a man ſpeak ſo, would not think
that he put his Son into the Maſters power, to be inſtructed
or corrected by him? He that would have inſtances of this
nature, let him turn to 1 <hi>Tim. 1. 19. Acts 27. 24. Mat.</hi> 5. 25.
and <hi>ch.</hi> 18. 34. and <hi>ch. 27. 2. Mark 13. 9. John</hi> 19. 16.
and that of <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 9. they ſhall deliver you up to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,

mortifying the Luſts of the Fleſh; but where-ever 'tis
found, 'tis put for the death of the Soul or Body (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

alſo ſay, that no extant Greek Author hath uſed it to that
ſence that ſome, as I have ſaid, put upon it; but we keep
to its acceptance in Scripture. The Apoſtle makes uſe of
it in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 3. and 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1. 9. and in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.
and the Verbal <gap reason="foreign">

'Tis therefore a poor Evaſion that ſome frame, ſuppoſing
<hi>Paul</hi> here to diſtinguiſh betwixt the affections of the Fleſh
and the Spirit: Since he here ſets the Deſtruction of the
Fleſh, or, <hi>which is all one,</hi> the Death of the Body, againſt
the ſaving of the Soul or Spirit; as both the genuine ſence
of the words, the drift and purpoſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:61349:38"/>
ſpeaks of this wicked one, as of one whoſe death was at

            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly and laſtly,</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. v. 6.
(which we tranſlate Puniſhment, but ought rather to be
rendered Cenſure</hi>) argues he was not expuls'd from the
Sacrament: for in its primitive ſignification 'tis put for
Chiding, Cenſuring, Reproving, or Rebuking, <hi>and the
like,</hi> (as Interpreters commonly tranſlate it) not for Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
Mulct, <hi>or Penance.</hi> There are yet two more
Reaſons left us; the one, That the Interdicting from the
Sacrament is nowhere in Scripture put for <hi>or ordained to
be</hi> Puniſhment. The other, that the words themſelves
plainly ſhew, that 'tis here put for Chiding or Cenſure;
which not one ſingle perſon alone, but many uſed towards
him: for, ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> there, ſufficient for ſuch an one is
this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this Cenſure (<hi>not as we read it, Puniſhment</hi>)
which was inflicted of many. He abſolves him from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but thoſe Comminations and Threats which many,
or <hi>peradventure</hi> the whole Church, <hi>all the Corinthian Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi>
had denounced againſt him, That he ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
over to Satan, to be by him <hi>buffeted, tormented,</hi>
kill'd. He had yet therefore onely experienced their
Threats: for <hi>Paul</hi> doth not abſolve him of part, but of
all <hi>that had as yet befallen him;</hi> and, as he ſays, this Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<hi>theſe Threats and Ratlings that had been rounded in
his ears,</hi> were ſufficient. Nay, he <hi>plainly</hi> intimates with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
that this was all that was done to him. We read of
this word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Mat. 16. 22. ch. 17. 18. ch. 19. 13. ch.</hi> 20. 13.
and in the other Evangeliſts; as alſo 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. (where

               </gap>, <hi>bear it company:</hi>) In all which places
'tis put for Reproof and Rebuking, or the like; but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
for Puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="60">LX. But here now it may be aſkt me, If the inceſtuous
perſon underwent no more than this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, this Cenſure
or Rebuke, how can he be ſaid to have been deliver'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:61349:39"/>
Satan, to be tormented and ſlain by him? Some of the
ancient <hi>Writers</hi> hold, that he was indeed deliver'd <hi>over</hi> to
be tormented with Diſeaſes, or the like, and ſo be gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
brought to deſtruction; but was releaſed and abſolv'd
aagain by the Apoſtle, before it had gone ſo far. If this
Anſwer be true, I ſee not but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> might here ſignifie
Puniſhment, (<hi>as indeed our Tranſlation has rendered it.</hi>)
But now though I do not deny but that this is a paſſible
Interpretation, yet I ſhall preſent you another as ſuitable
to the Apoſtles words: St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not reſolved to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
this man to the Devil by himſelf alone, but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have it done <hi>in a full Congregation,</hi> when the whole
Body of Believers ſhould be gather'd together for that
purpoſe. But when once the Church ſaw this deplorable
Creature ſo dejected and overwhelm'd with Sorrow, and
that Grief had almoſt already given him the Death that
they threatned, they <hi>reprieved him as 'twere, and</hi> deferr'd
pronouncing the Sentence, till they might learn the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
pleaſure, whether at their interceſſion he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the rigour of it, and reſtore him on his Repentance:
which if they could not prevail with him to do, they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
they will not longer be wanting in their Duty. Thus
came it to paſs that this poor Soul remain'd for ſome months
under great Terrors and Agonies of mind, till he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
the joyful intelligence of <hi>Paul</hi>'s remitting the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
That the matter was manag'd much after this
rate, may be plainly collected out of that ſecond Epiſtle to
the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="61">LXI. From what has been already alleadg'd, as well as
from what might yet be urg'd, 'tis ſo clearly and ſolidly
demonſtrated, that this delivering <hi>up</hi> to Satan was quite
another thing from that which we now-a-days call Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
or Suſpenſion from the Sacrament, that
ſure none but thoſe who are as defective in underſtanding,
as in love to the Truth, can have the face to deny it. I
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:61349:39"/>
ſaid juſt now, that ſome ancient Writers expounded this
place as we do: <hi>Auguſtine</hi> (whoſe Teſtimony I cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
is one of them; there is another paſſage of his in
his firſt Book, upon Chriſt's Sermon in the Mount, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring
with us; as doth alſo <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> and after him
<hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and his Compiler <hi>Theophylact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="62">LXII. Let us now take a ſhort ſurvey of thoſe other
places, which our Opponents flie unto for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.
Some lay a ſtreſs upon that paſſage of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, be
counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they who labour
in the Word and Doctrine:</hi> for hereby they fancy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
able to ſqueeze out a proof that there were ſome
Elders who did not <hi>labour in the Word;</hi> and on theſe
they beſtow another Office, to wit, that of inſpecting and
cenſuring our Manners and Behaviour, of being Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of our ſins and failings, of admoniſhing the Stubborn
and Refractory, of certifying their fellow-Elders, that is
(<hi>ſay they</hi>) the Church; and laſtly, (in conjunction with
theſe) of excommunicating ſuch as hear not (<hi>or obey not</hi>)
the Church.</p>
            <p n="63">LXIII. But we think it evident from the Writings of
the Apoſtles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> that Miniſters, Biſhops, and
Preſbyters or Elders (if Office, Function, and Miniſtry
be meant by thoſe two laſt, and not their Age) were all
the ſame in the Apoſtles time; and ſo that there was no
Preſbyter who was not a Teacher (<hi>or Preacher,</hi> as we now
call them) <hi>that is, who did not labour in the Doctrine:</hi>
unleſs any are deſirous to ſtretch this word to thoſe Judges
and Arbitrators of Suits and Controverſies mentioned
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4. (But we talk not of them at preſent, ſince
their Duty was of a quite different nature.) This Opinion
of ours, which we think grounded upon apparent truth,
hath both <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to vouch
for it:<note place="margin">Hieronym. <hi>upon</hi> Tit. <hi>chap.</hi> 1.</note> onely this latter ſays that Biſhops
were firſt nominated out of the Order of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61349:40"/>
Preſbyters. This therefore is the manner of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing;
as if I ſhould ſay, I love all Miniſters and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors,
but eſpecially thoſe who with unwearied Induſtry,
and a conſtant waking Care and Sedulity, feed the Sheep
committed to their charge. I love all ſtudious perſons,
but eſpecially thoſe who ſit to it night and day. I do not
now by ſaying thus, ſay that there are ſome Paſtors who
never feed their Sheep, or ſome Students who never ſtudy;
but I ſuppoſe thereby ſome more diligent than others,
though I do not ſay that any do more than they ought
to do, or than their Function requires of them. That this
is the genuine <hi>and true</hi> Expoſition of the Apoſtles mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and words, the ſubſequent words, <hi>v.</hi> 18. concerning
the reward, proves it: for 'tis in no ſort probable that
the ſame reward was at any time allotted in the Church
to them that did, and to them that did not teach; for the
firſt ſhould be charg'd with a double Duty, and the other
with but a ſingle one: yet the Apoſtle ſtiles them both
worthy of double honour. Beſides, the Apoſtle quotes
that paſſage of the Ox treading out the Corn, to prove
that Suſtenance is due to the Miniſtry: and the Participle
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> confirms <hi>our Expoſition;</hi> which ſignifies not barely
labouring, but wearying our ſelves with labour, or uſing
an extraordinary diligence therein:
And thus is it always taken in the

            <p n="64">LXIV. They ſay withal, that Chriſt did forbid <hi>to cast
Pearls before Swine, and to give things that are holy, unto
Dogs.</hi> I anſwer, Chriſt ſpeaks of them that deſpiſe <hi>thoſe</hi>
Pearls, and tread them under their feet, and turn again and
rend the Donors of them; that is, he ſpeaks of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61349:40"/>
of the Goſpel, with whom we have nothing to <hi>do in
this diſpute:</hi> for we meddle not with any here, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
who are rightly principl'd in that Doctrine, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the ſame, and are deſirous to be Partakers of the
Sacraments with their fellow-Chriſtians, though they live
not up to that Integrity that others do. Beſides, Chriſt
ſpeaks not there of Sacraments, but of the Doctrine of
the Goſpel, which ought not to be offer'd to Dogs and
Swine, that is, to ſuch as refuſe and trample it under feet;
of which nature is that Parable of the Pearl, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 45.
where Chriſt likens the Kingdom of Heaven to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man
who bought a Pearl of great price; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it makes nothing to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="65">LXV. Whereas again they remember us that St. <hi>Paul</hi>
gave it in charge to <hi>Timothy, 1 Tim. 5. 29. That them that
ſin he ſhould rebuke before all;</hi> We deny not the thing,
but <hi>deny</hi> that it relates to our purpoſe. I will not muſter
up multitudes of Arguments to prove it; this onely ſhall
I ſay, That 'tis beyond the wit of man to make it out,
that to reprove or rebuke any man before or in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of the Church, is the ſame thing with forbidding
him the Sacrament. Nay, they that object this, object it
to no purpoſe, unleſs they can ſhew it to be the ſame:
Who can prove that the Apoſtle ſo much as thought here
of interdicting the Sacrament? Again, the Apoſtle treats
not here of ſins that are committed openly, and in the
face of the world, but thoſe that ſin (ſays he) that <hi>is,</hi> that
perſevere &amp; continue in ſin, rebuke before all, that thereby
both he that hath ſinned, and others <hi>that ſaw it,</hi> may fear
with him, and do no more wickedly. He puts no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
here between little and great, <hi>venial and moral</hi>
ſins; much leſs between publick and private ſins. To
ſpeak once for all, 'tis a leaden Objection, and will melt
away like wax at the Fire of Truth, and vaniſh like the
ſmoak. Beſides, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words ſtand in perfect oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61349:41"/>
to this Excommengent: for he commands him that
ſins to be rebuk'd (not to be excommunicated) before
all, ſubjoyning it as a reaſon, that all may fear; as if he
ſhould ſay, If he will not repent and mend himſelf, at leaſt
others ſhall thereby learn to be and do better. Where
by <hi>him that ſins</hi> is not meant him that has left ſinning,
<hi>or him that had ſinned onely,</hi> but him that abides and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
<hi>to walk</hi> in <hi>the ways of</hi> ſin, and repented not after
admonitions and warnings given him: Him, I ſay, that
<hi>thus</hi> ſins, he charges <hi>Timothy</hi> to rebuke and reprove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
others; he does not give it in charge to him, to ſee
him excommunicated.</p>
            <p n="66">LXVI. Next, ſay they, the Apoſtle commands ſo far to
avoid the company of the Wicked, that he allows not the
liberty of making our common Meals with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.
11. <hi>With ſuch an one no not to eat;</hi> much leſs (conclude
they) would he have us eat the Lords Supper with them.
But I utterly deny the conſequence: for ſurely they are
of very different import, the prohibition of private fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities,
and the non-admiſſion to the Sacrament; and the
forbidding the one, is not a denial <hi>or diſallowance</hi> of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the former is a Civil <hi>or Political</hi> Puniſhment, the
latter Sacred; we have a Command for one, none for the
other; St. <hi>Paul</hi> explains the end and reaſon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
but we find no mention of either for the latter: nay,
the thing it ſelf is nowhere enjoyn'd, or ſo much as the
name <hi>of Excommunication</hi> once heard of in Scripture.
And that one may be without the other, the Phariſees are
a pregnant inſtance; who, that they might paſs with the
World for the greater Saints, would not approach the
Publicans, would not eat, drink, or aſſociate with them in
the common concerns of Life. (I can't at preſent recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
that I have read of the like <hi>Niceneſs</hi> in any others;)
but no man can ſhew me, whilſt the World laſts, that theſe
Publicans were denied admiſſion to the Sacrifices, to the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61349:41"/>
Temple, to the Paſſover, or <hi>any</hi> other Sacraments, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
they were <hi>but</hi> circumcis'd, and turn'd not Renegades
to their Religion. There are at this day ſome who ſhut
out all notoriouſly lewd and diſſolute perſons out of their
company; they will not live, nor entertain a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with them: which evinces, that this avoiding their
Company, <hi>and maintaining</hi> no Correſpondencies with
them, is rather a Civil than an Eccleſiaſtical Puniſhment,
and amounts not near to that of delivering over to Satan,
which ſome will needs have to be Excommunication.
The Apoſtle directs Good men to ſhun <hi>all</hi> Conſortſhip
with Ill, that Shame may haſten in them a Repentance:
The Interdiction runs not to the Ill, that they ſhall not
live among the Good, if any good men would give them
admittance. In private Converſations men talk of all
matters indifferently; and if a diſſolute Wretch find by
the freedom of his acceſs, that for all his Debaucheries he
is as much made of as ever, not onely himſelf is not amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
but his Company by degrees endanger'd: But where
a man ſees himſelf avoided, and that all ſhrink, flie, <hi>and
detest</hi> his ſociety, he can't but caſt a reflecting thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the occaſion, and enter into conſiderations of a better
life, that he be no longer the Scorn and Contempt of thoſe
that before embrac'd him with all the arms of Friendſhip.
And therefore as being debarr'd of private Commerce and
Converſation, frights us from ſome ſorts of Crimes and
Uncleanneſſes, ſo <hi>the indulgence of</hi> familiar <hi>and fair out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
Correſpondencies, feeds, pampers, and encourages
us in thoſe bad courſes. But theſe reaſons hold not in
the receiving or being denied the Sacrament; for frequent
Communicating at that Table, gives not vigour and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
to <hi>our</hi> Vices at the rate private <hi>Communications
and</hi> Familiarities do: for in the Churches or Chappels
where that is adminiſtred, no vain and worldly things,
<hi>nothing</hi> of private concern, is then tranſacted, but the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61349:42"/>
Word of God <hi>onely</hi> is there handled. There, when men
ſhall hear of a Chriſt that died for them, of a Chriſt that
invites to that Commemoration, and publick demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our acknowledgments and thankfulneſs for ſo
great a Benefit, and that none can be a worthy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant,
who hath not throughly and ſincerely examin'd
himſelf, and that thoſe who thruſt themſelves in unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
amongſt his Gueſts, do but eat <hi>and drink</hi> damnation
to themſelves: This will put men, that intend to approach
unto the Lords Table, upon a ſeriouſneſs of thought,
What is there exhibited; <hi>what is his concern in it;</hi> what
God requires of him, and how he may for the future ſo
regulate his life, that it may be acceptable in the ſight of
God, how debauched ſoever and villanous it were before.
He that has not theſe <hi>offers, theſe incitements and</hi> invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
is depriv'd of theſe invitations, grows ſtill the
worſe, <hi>to be ſure,</hi> no whit the better for it: which ſeems
to be the reaſon of Gods inſtituting and enjoyning ſuch
multitudes of Sacrifices, Offerings, Rites and Ceremonies.
But for certain the Apoſtle has nowhere order'd, that they
with whom he would not have good men to hold a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence,
ſhould be alſo put by <hi>or denied</hi> the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And when in another place, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 14. he
writes to have them ſignifie that man by Epiſtle who walks
diſorderly; (<hi>for the Marginal tranſlation in our Engliſh
Bibles ſeems to be trueſt in this place</hi>) he does not <hi>there</hi>
ſet the Elders upon excommunicating them, or ſuſpending
them the Sacrament. All which are evident proofs of
their miſtakes, who think Excommunication to have been
either here approved, allowed of, or deſign'd by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle.</p>
            <p n="67">LXVII. But to enforce the Objection, they tell us, 'tis
no leſs unfit that the Church, <hi>the Congregation of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
aſſembled in the Worſhip of God,</hi> ſhould be defil'd with
the <hi>Company and</hi> Communion of the Wicked; and that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:61349:42"/>
'tis therefore conſequently neceſſary that the Evil ſhould
in all accounts be ſerv'd and kept from the <hi>Pious and</hi>
Good. But I would return them this Anſwer: There is
no danger that the Wicked ſhould pollute <hi>or injure</hi> the
Good in the uſe of thoſe Rites and Ceremonies which are
of God's own inſtitution, whilſt they take not after them
in their natures, nor learn not their immoralities: for
neither the holy Prophets, Kings, or Judges, nor <hi>John</hi> the
Baptiſt, nor even Chriſt himſelf, nor yet his Apoſtles after
him, were ever defil'd by being preſent <hi>at the ſame Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
at the ſame Sacrifices, in the ſame Temple, uſing the
ſame <hi>Rites and</hi> Sacraments with men of the moſt debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
and profligate lives. Our Saviour was ſpotleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt
that Generation of Vipers, who were baptized with
him by <hi>John</hi> in the ſame Baptiſm. <hi>Judas</hi> neither polluted
Chriſt, nor the Apoſtles, nor the laſt Supper of our Lord, by
his preſence at it, though he was <hi>then</hi> a <hi>known</hi> Thief, and
had before laid the Plot for betraying his Maſter, and had
received the Pay for his pains. <hi>Again,</hi> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
does not bid us examine one another in the celebration or
receiving of the Lords Supper, and to look about us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any of the by-ſtanders, <hi>any of our fellow-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants,
be ſinful or unworthy,</hi> be ſuch as may derive any
Pollution or Uncleanneſs to us; but thus runs his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,
1 <hi>Cor. 11. 28. Let a man examine himſelf;
himſelf, he ſays,</hi> not others.</p>
            <p n="68">LXVIII. Hitherto have I effectually and truly prov'd,
that no circumciſed perſon was ever (before Chriſt's days)
prohibited thoſe Ceremonies and Sacraments which God
by the hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> had ordain'd amongſt them, upon
any delinquency in Morals, or <hi>Piety of</hi> Life: Nay, I have
withal ſhewn, that 'twas not lawful for any one whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
to forbid them; and I have by pregnant Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
from Scripture and Reaſon, made it out, that neither
Chriſt nor his Apoſtles taught or acted contrary. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61349:43"/>
               <hi>I think</hi> I have demonſtrated, that what our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
offer on their own behalfs, cannot maintain the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
they would build on it. So that now I ſee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther rubs, nothing that can ſhock this Concluſion;
That that Excommunication which ſhuts out Chriſtians
from the Sacrament for pure Immoralities, and the Vitiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their lives, was never ordained by God, but is a Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Invention of men: for ſo far is it from deriving
its original from Scripture, that <hi>the invention and trick of</hi>
it is rather declaim'd againſt and condemn'd there.</p>
            <p n="69">LXIX. If any yet reply, that at this rate we beſpatter,
we condemn whole ſhoals of pious Biſhops, who quickly
after the Apoſtles times began this excommunicating Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
I muſt tell them, 'tis one thing to ſpeak againſt an
Opinion, and another againſt the Aſſertors or Authors of
it. Many in our Age, of no leſs Piety than Learning,
have examin'd, have ſifted and confuted ſundry ancient
(and as I may ſay) Catholick Errours, <hi>Errours that crept
early into the Church: As for inſtance,</hi> the Limbus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum,
Purgatory, Praying to Saints, Exorciſms in Baptiſm,
Coelibacy of the Prieſthood, Unctions in Baptiſm and at
<hi>the point of</hi> Death, Prayers for the Dead, and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the Caſe how in queſtion; and yet I know not any
man that has it charg'd on him as a Crime, barely for that
he hereby condemns his Predeceſſors. If men will needs
labour to enforce this Excommunication upon the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
as a Law of Gods promulgation, I can never be
brought to commend it <hi>therefore;</hi> though at the ſame time
I cannot but highly praiſe and approve of their Zeal and
good Intentions, <hi>who first gave riſe to it:</hi> for their aim
was hereby to curb the reſtiff and unweildy humours of
vitious men, ſince they could not imagine a more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<hi>and effectual</hi> way of doing it: And very many (as
we ſee even to this day) walk on in this beaten and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Path, <hi>do it becauſe others before them did it,</hi> having
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61349:43"/>
never ſo much as taken it into their conſiderations, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be a matter that ſtands with holy Scripture <hi>or
no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="70">LXX. I cannot at preſent ſay much of the very time
when Excommunication had its firſt riſe; onely that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the latter end of the ſecond Century after Chriſt, I
meet with ſomething like it then attempted and ſet up.
For above one hundred and fifty years, I do not find any
one ſuſpended, or put by from receiving the Sacrament,
for unholineſs of life. They that are fuller vers'd in the
Hiſtory and Writings of the Fathers, may perchance ſpeak
better and clearer in this point. They that ſhall carefully
peruſe what <hi>Socrates</hi> in his fifth book of <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> Hiſtory,
<hi>chap.</hi> 19. has tranſmitted to us, I verily believe will, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much difficulty, confeſs with us that this Cuſtom of
Excommunicating had its firſt Epoch or Commencement
in the Church, about the time of <hi>Novatus:</hi> Yet <hi>Sozomen,</hi>
in his ſeventh book, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. pretends other cauſes for
its Inſtitution. Beſides <hi>which,</hi> we read that about the
year of the Lord 200. <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> admitted
not to the Lords Supper them who refuſed to forgive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries;
<hi>but</hi> I have obſerv'd, that till that time none were
denied the Communion but Hereticks, and ſuch as ſwerv'd
from <hi>or renounced</hi> the Chriſtian Faith. But be that how
it will, this is both certain and evident, that Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication
was <hi>first</hi> introduced into the Church for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
and puniſhment of Vice; and afterwards when the
Church had got the Sword into their hand, <hi>as well as the
Keys at their girdle;</hi> that is, when the Magiſtrates, <hi>Kings
and Princes,</hi> became Chriſtian, <hi>and ſubjected themſelves</hi> to
the Faith; yet did the Church-men not let go this power,
but continued the exerciſe of it by their Biſhops: partly,
for that the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Order was then believed to be <hi>of</hi>
Divine <hi>Right;</hi> partly, for that they could not but be fond
and tenacious of that Power which made them formidable
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61349:44"/>
to Kings and Emperours, and was therefore a morſel too
ſweet to be parted with without regret: And they eaſily
wrought others into a belief of Chriſts being the Author
and Inſtitutor of it, ſince themſelves had before ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
and ſo willingly ſwallowed it. Superſtition <hi>too,
in a little time,</hi> had aſcribed ſo much virtue to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
that it gave ſtrength to the Opinion; for 'twas
believed, and publickly owned by their Writings, that
there were ſome that could not die, till they had been
houſell'd and received the Sacrament. Either therefore
this Errour made men dread Excommunication, or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
led them into the Errour: for how facile
a thing was it to impoſe upon the Credulity of the illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and weak Vulgar, that Life was annext to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
and Death to the deprivation of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſince the denial of this to a ſinner, was the higheſt
and laſt Puniſhment that they ſaw inflicted on him?</p>
            <p n="71">LXXI. But for the Perſons that executed and denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
this Excommunication (as far as our Conjectures can
carry us in this affair) they ſeem to have been at firſt ſuch
Elders as we read of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 4. (who ſupplied the place
and defect of Magiſtracy in the Church) together with
the Miniſtry; but afterwards all this Authority was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
upon the Biſhops, who took cognizance of all Suits,
made up Differences, gave Judgment, and did every thing
that related to the deciſions of Right, and diſtributing
Juſtice betwixt man and man: as we perceive by the
Hiſtory of thoſe times, and by St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s complaining
of ſo much then lying on the Biſhops hands of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> affirms, that thoſe <hi>ſort of</hi> Elders whoſe
aſſiſtance was wont to be made uſe of in the Church on
all occaſions, were in <hi>vogue and</hi> authority when yet they
were deſtitute of Biſhops. And it appears by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
that theſe <hi>Elders</hi> were to have an Authority as to that
Employment <hi>of Judging,</hi> as long as the Church ſhould be
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61349:44"/>
under the preſſures of an Heathen Magiſtrate; which
gives us to underſtand, that as under a Chriſtian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that Employment <hi>would be uſeleſs, and</hi> was <hi>therefore</hi>
to ceaſe; ſo Excommunication (upon ſuppoſition that
they had exercis'd ſuch a thing before) yet ſhould it in a
Chriſtian Kingdom ceaſe. For we muſt note, that theſe
Elders were inſtead of <hi>Civil</hi> Magiſtrates, and manag'd
Civil affairs, and were no Eccleſiaſtical Judicature:
(which now-a-days is of a different nature from the Civil)
for 'tis plainly ſaid, that they were to deal in Suits and
Controverſies of Law, things relating to this Life and the
Concerns of it.</p>
            <p n="72">LXXII. 'Twould make a Volume to recount what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
the Church did hereby reap; moſt certainly
they can't be ſet out in a ſmall compaſs: for firſt, this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
made men to look for ſalvation from the
Sacrament; for thus they fram'd the Argument: The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
from the Sacrament draws down Death and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
(<hi>ſay they</hi>) therefore the Receiving of it gives
Life. They ſcarce could entertain a doubt of the truth of
the Antecedent, whilſt they were taught that this was ſo
dreadful, ſo Soul-deſtructive a puniſhment; <hi>and</hi> when
they thought themſelves, by being ſhut out from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to fall ſtraight into the very clutches of the Devil,
and be wholly at Satan's mercy: which has made it thought
by ſome, that they could not die, without being houſled,
as I ſaid before. This Errour grew and got ſtrength from
the many great and long Penances, the Solemnities of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and the like; amongſt which, none was more
prevalent, than that they would not adminiſter the holy
Euchariſt to them, till the very point of Death; and that
then they gave it them, 'twas <hi>of pure compaſſion,</hi> that they
might not go hence deſtitute of the Souls neceſſary food:
for if any (through whatever Accident) was ſo unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
he was held for a man damn'd <hi>and loſt to all Eternity;</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61349:45"/>
as if God would not forgive them their ſins who heartily
and ſincerely repent, and vouchſafe unto them <hi>everlaſting</hi>
life, unleſs theſe Elders ſhould adjudge them qualified for
the Lords Supper. What errour is there of a more dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable
and fatal conſequence? But another Fruit of this
was, that all the World now began to believe that 'twas
in the power of men to ſhut and open Heaven <hi>when and</hi>
to whom they pleaſed: and therefore the younger <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi>
would not eat his Dinner, becauſe having denied an
importunate Monk's Requeſt, he ſtood excommunicate by
him for his pains; and though the Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi>
told the Emperour that the Excommunication was inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
yet reſt, good man, he <hi>could not nor</hi> would not, till
the ſame hand abſolv'd, that had bound him. So <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
for eight months together kept an Elder from Church,
from Sermons, <hi>and all the acts of publick Worſhip:</hi> 'Tis
true, offended he had, but more pardonably than <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
himſelf, as any man, that has his eyes in his head, may ſee
upon the peruſal of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> his Hiſtory, and the Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicle
of <hi>Philip Melancthon.</hi> By theſe ſteps has the Roman
See encroached upon the Weſtern World, and made Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
Kings, and Emperours to lacky to her Luſt, <hi>and arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
ſway in pretended Spirituals.</hi> Dyed has been the
German Empire in the Gore of hundred thouſands that
fell a Sacrifice <hi>to this Roman Diana,</hi> to excommunicating
Popes, and excommunicated Emperours, Kings, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Religion ſhe has chopt and chang'd, mangled and
disfigured, debaſed and vitiated, at her pleaſure; none da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to queſtion her Canons, diſpute her Decretals, <hi>or look
her Bulls in the face; the whole World were Caligula's,
and durſt not ſhew their heads when ſhe ſent her Thunder of
Excommunication abroad.</hi> The God of Foxes ſpoken of
by <hi>Daniel, Dan.</hi> 11. 38. (if we weigh that paſſage aright)
ſignifies nothing but this Excommunication, or the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
men the uſe of Sacred things, eſpecially the Lords
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61349:45"/>
Supper: For this Excommunication acts a very God in
earneſt; 'tis to this day a God of Forces, <hi>a God</hi> who has
put all things, <hi>all the power of Heaven and Hell,</hi> under the
Popes <hi>feet.</hi> And there are not wanting now-a-days too,
another ſort of men <hi>acting upon the ſame Principles,</hi> who
would make all <hi>Humane Authority and the Civil Chriſtian</hi>
Magiſtrate, truckle to them, <hi>and dread their Cenſures, as
far as the Popes ignorant Votaries do his Bulls.</hi> But I hope
the time will come, when this God ſhall ſtand expos'd and
condemn'd for a falſe and feigned God, and be ſtript of <hi>all
its God-like terror and dread, and</hi> whatſoever may <hi>or has
ſo long</hi> plagu'd and enſlav'd the Church. In fine, this <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol
Excommunication</hi> had every where ſuch an Aſcendant,
that 'twas the conſtant Belief of the World, that they who
by <hi>Church-Cenſures and</hi> Interdictions from the Sacrament,
<hi>and publick acts of Worſhip,</hi> were denounced unworthy of
eternal Life, were thereby <hi>wholly</hi> fallen from divine Grace;
as on the other hand, ſaved muſt they needs be, whom the
Church <hi>received and</hi> would have ſo. Can we hope better
terms, or greater moderation, from our Modern Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
than the World has experienced in their Predeceſſors?
<hi>I fear</hi> he that ſhould expect it, would find himſelf deceiv'd,
and that he has but little weigh'd what either the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
or Experience might inform him of.</p>
            <p n="73">LXXIII. I ſee no cauſe why Chriſtian Rulers ſhould
not now-a-days do what God in the Jewiſh Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
requir'd of the Civil Magiſtrate: Do we conceit
that we can frame a better Model and Form of Diſcipline
in Church or State, than God gave to them? <hi>ſince</hi> we read
in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. that the Nations for this ſhould praiſe and
admire the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for their Wiſdom and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
evinc'd by thoſe Statutes and Judgments which
God had given them; yet God never taught them Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication:
But the Power of puniſhing the Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and reſtraining the looſeneſs and licentiouſneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61349:46"/>
was <hi>wholly</hi> in the Magiſtrate, whoſe duty 'twas, not
onely to animadvert on ſuch Crimes by the Rules that
God had in their Law preſcribed them; but the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the Externals of Religion, the Diſciplinary
part and Conſtitution, was in them. For 'twas not <hi>Aaron,</hi>
but <hi>Moſes</hi> that did this (God <hi>ſtill</hi> commanding it); and
we know this Juriſdiction was transferred over to <hi>Joſhua,</hi>
not to <hi>Eleazar;</hi> 'twas <hi>Joſhua</hi> on whom God laid that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction
of ſeeing the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> circumcis'd the ſecond
time, and not <hi>Eleazar, Joſh.</hi> 5. 2. and this was to be <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal,</hi>
without exception of one man; the Bad were to be
circumcis'd <hi>as well as the Good;</hi> and Bad there were, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
queſtion:</hi> And the keeping the Paſſover then was by
him too directed; nor was any perſon, that we there read
of, excluded from it for diſhoneſty of his life. The Ark
of God was carried from place to place, as he gave the
word; and in all things relating to Religion, he interpos'd
his Commands, as may be obſerv'd throughout the whole
book of <hi>Joſhua. Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> who had the charge of
Religious as well as Civil affairs, they offer'd <hi>and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
at the Altar</hi> as Prieſts; but as Judges they manag'd
both Church and State: for 'twas lawful for the High
Prieſts under the Old Teſtament, to meddle with <hi>the arts
of</hi> Government <hi>and Secular affairs,</hi> as they were the Types
of Chriſt our King and High Prieſt: but under the Goſpel
'tis another caſe, <hi>IT SHALL NOT BE SO WITH YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>,</hi> ſays
Chriſt. See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. which is pertinent to our purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="74">LXXIV. If we go <hi>farther</hi> to the Kings, the caſe is no
leſs plain: As to <hi>David,</hi> there's none can doubt it, ſince it
appears that he order'd all the Offices and Charges <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to God's Worſhip:</hi> he that pleaſes may read, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi>
from the 22th to the 27th Chapter. Then for <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
(who was a King and no Prieſt) he not onely built
the Temple, but dedicated it. To the ſame purpoſe is
that famous relation, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. of <hi>Jehoſaphat;</hi> which
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61349:46"/>
being well conſider'd, gives great light to the matter in
hand. So does that of the good King <hi>Hezechia:</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
the whole Old Teſtament witneſſes no leſs. If
therefore the State and Church was founded, inſtituted,
and eſtabliſhed upon ſo much Wiſdom; that which makes
the neareſt approaches to the Form and Model thereof (as
far as the preſent circumſtances and <hi>different</hi> ſtate of things
will allow) challenges at leaſt our Praiſes <hi>and Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if not our Imitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And therefore in whatever Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the Civil Magiſtrate is Chriſtian, Pious, <hi>and Orthodox,</hi>
there's no need of other perſons, who under another name
or title ſhould ſet a governing us, and <hi>call us to account,
or</hi> puniſh us <hi>for our miſdeeds,</hi> as if there were no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt a Believing and Infidel Prince. But (ſays
<hi>D. Wolfgangus Muſculus,</hi> in his common places <hi>de Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratu,</hi>
from whom I have <hi>borrowed and</hi> tranſcribed what
I ſaid laſt) 'Tis a moſt pernicious Errour, and big with
dangerous Conſequence, that ſo many think no better of a
Chriſtian Magiſtracy, than of an Heathen one, whoſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is to be allowed of no farther than meer Temporals. If
then Believing Governours had authority not onely to
interpoſe in the ordering religious matters, agreeable to
Scripture-rules, and to regulate the Offices and other the
Miniſterial parts about it, (which is the reaſon that <hi>Moſes</hi>
commands, that when they ſhould chuſe them a King, he
ſhould write him a Copy of the Law in a Book, and that
to be with him, and he to read therein all the days of his
life) but had alſo power to puniſh Vice in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
'Tis a needleſs fruitleſs attempt for men to be now-a-days
contriving <hi>and ſetting up</hi> new Models of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which levels Magiſtrates themſelves to the Rank and
Condition of their Subjects: for this Eccleſiaſtical Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
in point of Manners, hath no place of Holy Writ
to <hi>vouch for it, or</hi> ſet it up: not but that Civil Governours
will do well to adviſe in all Doctrinals with thoſe that <hi>are
learned and</hi> have labour'd in the Word.</p>
            <p n="75">
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:61349:47"/>
LXXV. But now in thoſe Churches whoſe miſhap 'tis
to live under a Profane Government (as in the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Turks and Papiſts) they ſhould make choice of
pious ſober perſons, who (agreeable to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand)
might arbitrate between conteſting Members,
might take up Quarrels, might do every thing of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
might chide and admoniſh debauched flagitious
men, and <hi>ſuch of</hi> the Miniſtry themſelves <hi>who walk diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly:</hi>
and if this avail not, then might they puniſh them,
or rather recal them to a better temper, by avoiding their
company, by debarring them of private Commerce, by
reprehending them publickly, or by ſome ſuch-like marks
of their diſpleaſure: but to thruſt them from that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which is of God's Inſtitution, when they are minded
to come, is more than any Church or man has a right to
do; for none can judge of the Heart but God alone. It
may chance that ſome ſparks of Piety and Remorſe may
kindle <hi>in a ſinners Soul,</hi> whilſt he ſits in the Aſſembly;
which it can be no hurt (nay, may be greatly good) to
cheriſh, ſince Religion forbids it not. And how can it
be (I would fain ask) but horrid, abſurd, and impious
to boot, to turn away any man from publickly and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
paying his Thanks to God, and commemorating
the Death of his Saviour, when he finds Impulſes from
within to do it, and would fain celebrate it with <hi>his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-brethren</hi>
the Church, and declares 'tis his hearty deſire
to be and continue a Member of it, and that he would
give publick teſtimony that his paſt life is irkſom to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

or imagine that any ſuch thing ſhould be enacted, but
requeſted by them from the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> without the
Clergies knowing of it. But that <hi>the Authority may be
the more authentick, and</hi> the thing clearer, I have been
content to compare the German Copy which was writ at
that Diet, with the Latine one ſent to the Pope (and which
<hi>Matth. Flac. Illyricus</hi> caus'd to be reprinted at <hi>Baſil,</hi> 1565.
with his Book <hi>De Sectis &amp; Diſſenſionibus Papiſtarum;</hi>)
and upon comparing both, to publiſh the entire Decree or
Act. Therefore among the 100 Grievances (which were
fuller expreſs'd at <hi>this Seſſion at</hi> Norimberg, than they had
two years before at <hi>Worms</hi>) this following is the 34th.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> Many Chriſtians at <hi>Rome,</hi> and in other places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
are by Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and their Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Judges, excommunicated for Civil cauſes, and on a
Temporal account; whereby many weak Conſciences are
diſturb'd, and brought to deſpair: ſo that upon a money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore,
and for the tranſitory things <hi>of this life,</hi> and very
often, for very trivial cauſes, are ſome brought into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of periſhing Soul and Body too, contrary to the Law
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61349:48"/>
and Command of God, beſides the loſſes they ſuffer in
Eſtates and Reputation <hi>thereby:</hi> 
               <q>Whereas no perſon
ought to be excommunicated, or held for ſuch, unleſs
he be convict of Hereſie, as the Holy Scripture bears
witneſs.</q> And therefore the Lay-ſtates of the Empire
beſeech your Pontificial Holineſs, that as becomes a godly
and religious Father, you would take away theſe Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Excommunication at <hi>Rome,</hi> or in the Roman Court,
and provide that the ſame be done every where elſe, by
the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Eccleſiaſtical Judges.
And laſtly, <hi>that your Holineſs</hi> would command, That no
perſon be excommunicated, or reputed for ſuch, for any
cauſe whatever, beſides the plain and prov'd Crime of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie
in matters relating to Religion; for that no perſon
ought to be ſeparated or removed from God and his
Church, for any Temporal cauſe or otherwiſe, or for any
other humane crime, except Infidelity or Hereſie. To the
ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Joh. Stumpias,</hi> in his ſecond Book
of his <hi>Chronicon Helvet. cap.</hi> 29. where he ſays, That the
Swediſh Clergy, about the year 1245. (when <hi>Henry Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of <hi>Turing,</hi> and after his death, <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
were choſen by the inſtigation of the Pope, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
to the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Conrade</hi>
his Son) taught with great conſtancy, among other things,
That never was there ſuch a Power granted to mortal man
under the Sun, to prohibit Chriſtians Spiritual Duties, and
the Worſhip of God; and therefore did they continue to
ſay Maſs (ſays he) though the Pope had interdicted them,
and denounced them Excommunicate.</p>
