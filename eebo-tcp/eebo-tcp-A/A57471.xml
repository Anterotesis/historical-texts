            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>REVEREND SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Have read over the Books you were pleased to lend me, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi>'s Theory of the Earth, and Dr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Essay toward a Natural Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of it: Both which entertain'd me with a great many new and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry notable Hypotheses, managed with a great deal of Art, Ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Learning; but in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion very ill grounded; many of their Notions being inconsistent with common Sense and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, with Scripture and Reason;
<pb facs="tcp:60989:3"/>
especially the Mosaick Account of the Creation, Paradise, and the Universal Deluge; and in some Particulars, Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi> seems inconsistent with himself.</p>
            <p>These following Chapters, (which I make bold to present to your Hand, and to give you the Trouble of perusing) will shew you wherein I cannot concur with these great Virtuoso's, and why I endeavour to establish a quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Notion of things; and do ground it upon such Philosophical <hi>Theses,</hi> as <hi>Moses,</hi> that great Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, has laid down as so many <hi>Postulata</hi> in his short, but most comprehensive System of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; the whole being a short and compendious Description of this World of Matter, and this World of Life wherein we live.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60989:3"/>SIR; I am so far from being big with a fond Concei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I know (Sir) that the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you have lately gain'd by searching into those occult Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Matter, being now added to your former Speculations about it; has made you the most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of determining all Differences, and solving the most difficult <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of this Kind. If you will be pleas'd therefore to correct with your Pen the Mistakes you meet

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF the learned Authors of the new Theories and Essays had but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Pains to have consider'd better of those great Advantages of Learning and Education which <hi>Moses</hi> (the greatest Philosopher that ever was in the World, and the first Describer of its Creation) had beyond any of those learned Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers of later date, who have writ upon the same Subject; they would have entertain'd a greater Venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Esteem for his short, but most comprehensive System; than for the larger Volumes of those common Philosophers and Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb facs="tcp:60989:7"/>
whose Writings are only the Product of their own natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; though set off with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Artifice of Words, and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of human Learning.</p>
            <p>The first Progress which this great Philosopher made in human Learning and Wisdom was in <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>'s Court, where he had his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, under the Tuition of his own Daughter, who having no Child of her own, design'd to adopt him her Son, and make him Heir apparent to that Crown: To which End he was by her Care instructed in all the Learning, Wisdom, and Philosophy of the <hi>Egyptians:</hi> And no doubt but some of the most learned amongst the Hierophanthae, who were the most skilled in the Knowledge of mystical as well as natural Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, were his Tutors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60989:7"/>He being thus qualified with the best Learning <hi>Egypt</hi> could then afford, the second Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he made was in the Family of his Kinsman <hi>Iethro,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as well a Priest as Prince of <hi>Midian,</hi> did not only discipline him in all the Rules of Policy, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and Government; by which he was fitted and prepar'd for being Captain General of that mighty Host of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which God design'd to deliver from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Yoak, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Conduct to settle in <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>; but also he was instructed by him in the Religion of his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, the Patriarchal Traditions concerning the Creation of the World, the Beginnings of things, and the Genealogies of Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which being best known to <hi>Adam,</hi> who coming immediately out of
<pb facs="tcp:60989:8"/>
God's Hand, did undoubtedly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it to his Son <hi>Seth, Seth</hi> to <hi>Enos,</hi> and so from Father to Son, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> from whom <hi>Iethro</hi> descended by a second Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>During his Time of Residence in <hi>Midian,</hi> which was forty Years, and most of that Time being spent in Contemplation: Its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed he wrote this System of the Creation, with the rest of his Book called <hi>Genesis,</hi> by the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance and Direction of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, who could not be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Patriarchal Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; himself being descended from a Patriarch of special Note.</p>
            <p>After these Gradations and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in all Kinds of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Learning, Wisdom and Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, God took him into his own Service, and was pleased by

use of Metaphors, Allegories, and other Sche matical Forms, which must needs be attended with some Darkness and Obscurity (these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were a Veil drawn over the Face of Divine Truth) and this might occasion <hi>Solomon</hi> to joyn the <hi>Words of the Wise,</hi> and their <hi>dark Sayings</hi> together.</p>
            <p>And this was not only the Practice of the sacred Writers; but of the learned Heathens, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially their Priests and Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; who undoubtedly did imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>Moses</hi> herein: but for different Ends and Purposes; for it did highly concern the Pagan Priests to hide and conceal their Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the Light; which like bastard Eagles would not endure the Tryal of it.</p>
            <p>But the holy Spirit might di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the holy Pen-men to observe
<pb facs="tcp:60989:9"/>
their Style for Reasons of greater and more weighty Moment.</p>
            <p>For the Divine Wisdom might see it fit in the Infancy of the World, to discover his Will and Mind in some things very suitable to the Capacities of the Men of that Age: And to reserve other things of great moment veil'd under Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories, and mystical Expressions until the Minds of Men were more opened and enlarged; for disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of those brighter Beams of Divine Truth.</p>
            <p>Yet that the Glories that were after to appear might not be wholly clouded; he order'd it so, that such a thin Veil shou'd be drawn over the Matter, as shou'd not more set off the Beauty, than stir Men up to a diligent Search after those Divine Truths.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:60989:10"/>If then a modest Attempt be made to ground a Philosophical Discourse upon some of these veil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mysteries, with Submission to Men of greater Learning, and better skill'd in mystical Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy: I presume that it will not be judg'd an Effect either of Pride or Vain-glory.</p>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> It may then be taken for a granted Principle, that by the six days work is meant the six distinct Productions; and by the Evening, and the Morning, is meant the Principles of Activity and Passivity, which were the Instrumental Causes of these Productions.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60989:25"/>
when the World was Created, was in the beginning of Time; or when Time first began to have a Being; for before the World was Created there was du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or <hi>Stabilis Aeternitas</hi> [as the Schoolmen express it] but Time being an equal mensuration of Motion, it and Motion began together.</p>
                  <p>From this grand <hi>Thesis</hi> we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, First against <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd by many Arguments to prove that the World, as it now stands in Matter and Form, was Eternal; which Hypothesis advanceth the World into an equality with God; makes it its own efficient Cause, Uncreated and Independent.</p>
                  <p>In the Second place this <hi>Mosaick The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> concludes against <hi>Plato</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; who, tho' he did positively as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, that God made the World; yet he did conceive that the Matter on which it did consist was Eternal and Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istent: By which Hypothesis he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes God to be an impotent cause, not able to create the World without Matter and Stuff to work upon.</p>
                  <p>These mistaken Principles in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy were occasion'd from the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the regular course of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; not considering that there might

                     <hi>Democritus</hi> and his Followers, who did not only conceit that Matter was Eternal and Pre-existent; but that the World had no efficient cause, but what was from Chance, or the casual motion of Matter; which consisting of infinite numbers of Atoms or little Corpuscles of different Figures, Natures and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which rainged about in a vast and infinite space; until at the last by Divisions, Separations and Mixtures occasioned by their contrary and mixt Qualities, and the innate Power of Sympathy and Antipathy, they at last setled into the Form and Figure of this World, which it can no more alter or vary from, than the active Fire be taught to change its Nature, and descend and Gravation to ascend and fly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <p>We may hence farther conclude, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> although neither the World as it stands, nor the Matter on which it consists did pre-exis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>For it cannot be imagin'd that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Besides the natural tendency of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Power, is Action; of Infinite Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is Counsel; of Infinite Goodness is Beneficence: We cannot therefore but conclude from these Natural Arguments, that God would from all Eternity fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the inclinations of his own Divine Perfections.</p>
                  <p>From this grand <hi>Thesis</hi> we may yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> futher conclude, that this Universal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the World was not created at one stroke, by an imperious <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> therefore tells us that God first created the Heavens, and then the Earth: Like as some mighty Monarch designing to build a spacious and most glorious Palace, first forms the Model of it in his mind; and having prepar'd his Materials, sets on work his Under-agents, who first of all lay the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and compleat his own Royal Apartments, then the Apartments of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60989:27"/>
his chief Ministers of State, after that Chambers for his Domesticks, and last of all Lodgings for his out Servants; and the Work being finish'd, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Model which he gave his Architects to work by, he gives it his Approbation. In like manner, the Great and Almighty Monarch of the Universe may be supposed, first to have laid the Foundations of those Super-Coelestial Regions of unaccessable Light, the Royal Chambers of his own most Glorious Presence; where he sits in great Majesty attended with an in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>numerable retinue of the most Noble Angels his Courtiers: After these he creates the highest of the Coelestial Spheres, in which he placed Thousands of Royal Mansions, where the Arch-Angels and Brighter Cherubins, the chief Ministers of State in that Coelestial Kingdom keep their residence: And these are the Morning Stars which <hi>Iob</hi> tells us [by way of <hi>Synecdoche</hi>] that met together, and the Sons of God that did shout for joy. After these God created the inner or lower Spheres, in which he placed innumerable numbers of bright, lucid and Aetherial Globes; wherein the inferior Angels and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60989:27"/>
Officers do inhabit, and these the Scripture stiles <hi>Ministring Spirits.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And these differ in Office, Power and Light, as they are placed in Spheres nearer, or at a distance from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Light: For as one Star differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from another Star in Glory, Light, Purity and Magnitude; So do their Heavenly Inhabitants: And so shall it be in the Resurrection from the Dead; for as Men improve here in Vertue, Goodness and the Divine Life and Light, so shall they be placed nearer, or at a distance from God, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Life and Light.</p>
                  <p>After the finishing of these Inner Courts of this Royal Palace, last of all God created this Material Globe or Outer Court; and made it the Center of the Universe: And it's built of the Rubbidge, Dross and Sediment of the whole Creation, and inhabited with the meanest of Creatures, and lowest degree of Life and Perfection, which may most properly be called God's out Servants; over which he has pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Man Deputy Lord Governour.</p>
                  <p>This Material Globe, tho it appears in its own dimensions to be o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And these are Earthquakes, Hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canes, Volcano's, violent Eruptions of the Subterranean Waters, as at <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood; Stagnations of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terranean Air, causing the Springs and Mineral Feeders to sink down into the Interior <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>As that Hypothesis of the Theorist wherein he conceits<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there was no Metallick Ores or Minerals in the Antediluian Earth, contradicts the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which <hi>Moses</hi> gives of <hi>Tubal-Cain,</hi> who was,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.

                  <p>Again, if the Mass of Fluid Matter,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> after the Deluge was over, did resettle according to the Rules of Specifick Gravity, the heaviest subsiding the lowest [as the Dr. asserts] why did not these small Grains of ponderous Ore subside the lowest, being heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Corpuscles of those <hi>Strata</hi> wherein they were lodg'd?</p>
                  <p>And to assert that they were born <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> up by the Waters of the Abyss rising up towards the Surface [as the Dr. sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth] is as inconsistent with Gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Levity, as for Feathers t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These Hypotheses being inconsistent both with Scripture and Reason; we shall take it for granted, that all these coagulated Concretions of Metallick Ores, were by the Plastick Spirit in Matter lodg'd in the Veins of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Strata,</hi> lying most open, and being

                  <p>These Mineral Spirits, by a Natural Motion and Tendency rising up to the Surface, as we observe Cream riseth up to the top of Milk, or as Oyl sloat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth above Water; the warm Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Aetherial Flame moving up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, Thickn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And this we call the naked Skin of the Earth or Fertile Soil.</p>
                  <p>This Skin or Fertile Soil, before it got any Coat or Cover upon it, was not only Tinctur'd and Colour'd with all those wate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And these gave not only the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Colours to the common and waterish Herbs, as Grass, Plants and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60989:81"/>
Flowers, but gave also the different Complexions to Birds, Beasts and Men.</p>
                  <p>And as the several Colours and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions were occasion'd by the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and temperament of the Mineral Spirits, so were their different Natures and qualities; for a cunning Chymist will Extract out of Herbs and Plants the several Kinds of Mineral Spirits, as well as out of the Mineral it self.</p>
                  <p>The Virgin Matter being thus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difi'd and prepar'd by the warm In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Enlivening Vegetations of the Aetherial Flame, and its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Skin Adorn'd and Beautifi'd with her great variety of Natural Paints: Those Seminal Forms or Plastick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Souls which were disseminated in her warm and moist Womb, and Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetically united to their belov'd Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, began to exert their Plastick Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and put forth spungy Strings and Roots; not only to fasten them to the Earth, but to suck in such Juices as were most proper for their Food and Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, which by their Seminal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues being digested into the Substance of a Plant, Herb or Tree, of such an Order, Figure and Temperament, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60989:82"/>
an Individual of that numerous Species of Vegetables; which began first to peep out of the Earth, as Corn out of the Furrows; and afterwards gradually increas'd to the highest De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Perfection and Maturity its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was capable of.</p>
                  <p>Thus the naked Skin of the Earth was cover'd with a Coat or Green Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, Beautifi'd and Adorn'd with Flowers of several kinds of Colours; and as the Passive Matter increas'd in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Heat and Modification, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd Vegetables of higher Degrees of Life and Perfection, as all kinds of Trees, from the lowest Shrub to the tallest Cedar or most robust Oak.</p>
                  <p>That these Productions were not brought forth all at once; but gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as the Passive Matter receiv'd high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Degrees of Heat and Modification, is apparent from our observing of those Annual Productions which every Season bringeth forth.</p>
                  <p>For there are some Vegetables of a Cold and Waterish Quality, whose Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Spirits are more Fine, Light and Active, which require only a smaller Degree of Heat to raise them, and these are the Productions of those Early
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60989:82"/>
Months, <hi>Ianuary, February</hi> and <hi>March:</hi> And these come to their Perfection and Maturity before <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May,</hi> which present us with an other Crop and order of Vegetables: and for this same reason, <hi>Iune, Iuly</hi> and <hi>August</hi> go further, and presents us still with different shows of Plants, Herbs and Flowers: And thus as the Sun increaseth in Heat, and the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Matter in degrees of Modification, we are presented with higher and more noble Productions.</p>
                  <p>The Seminal Forms of Vegetables, being now united to their material Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicles, and being grown up to their several Degrees of Perfection and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, they retain'd Seed in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and did Propagate their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kinds by scattering of their ripe Seed upon the Fertile Soil, which like the warm and moist Womb of a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Mother, dissolves them first into a Liquid Jelly, and then divides their parts into their several uses.</p>
                  <p>That the Seminal Forms of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were Originally disseminated in the Earth as in an Universal Fund or Promptuary, will be yet further evident by those Ocular Observations which
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:60989:83"/>
has been frequently made of Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without Seed; for take some quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Earth digg'd several Fathoms under Ground, and expose it to the Sun and Rain, and it will Spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously without any Seed bring forth common Grass and several Herbs and Plants</p>
                  <p>Again, we observe that particular Soils will produce, without Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Seed, Herbs and Plants pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to that kind of Soil and Earth, as Pavements do Naturally produce Knot-Grass,<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If it be object'd, that the smaller Seeds are disseminated over all by the Winds, and the greater Seeds scatter'd by Birds that feed upon them.</p>
                  <p>I answer that its commonly observ'd, when Earth is brought out of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies</hi> or other Remote Countries for Ballast to Ships, and cast forth upon some Ground in <hi>Italy</hi> or other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries at a great distance, it will put forth Foreign Herbs to us unknown: And it cannot be imagin'd that the Winds shou'd blow the Seeds of these Plants from the <hi>Indies,</hi> or that the Birds shou'd cross the Seas and scatter them at so great a distance.</p>

                  <p>Tho' the Earth was now Gay and Trim with a new Green Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Grass, Adorn'd with Painted Flowers, and pleasant Copices or Thickets of Young Trees; the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Matter was yet too Cold and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terish to draw down out of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Degree of Life any of the Sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60989:84"/>
Forms to Actuate and Inform it. The Almighty Power did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contract this dilated Aetherial Flame of Light into a Body, which <hi>Moses</hi> calls the Sun, that those Enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heats and Vital Incubations which flow from it, might be more Strong and Vigorous, and Penetrate deeper into the Cold Matter.</p>
                  <p>And God plac'd this Coelestial Fire at such a convenient distance from the Earth, that it might neither be too much scorch'd by being too near it; nor frozen, by being at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from it; but that it might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such a temperate Heat from it, as to excite its Seminal Vertues, and draw up its Juices into them, and thereby Ripen its Natural Fruits.</p>
                  <p>God gave to the Earth also a Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Motion, that by a just and regular turning about upon its own Cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re, it might have the benefit of Day and Night every Four and twenty Hours, so that no part of the Earth might be too much heated by theSun's presence upon it, or too long benighted by his absence from it; because as one side is Warm'd and Cherish'd by its Rays, it withdraws and turns to it its other side; and so
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60989:85"/>
by this just and regular turning about of the Earth, and an equal distribution of Day and Night, the active Animals get leave to rest, the over-heated Air to cool, and the gasping Earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover its fainting Vertues, which a continu'd Day wou'd soon Exhaust and Extinguish.</p>
                  <p>God gave also the Sun an Annual Motion, and has directed it into such a commodious Course, that it sheds forth its Enlivening Light, Heat and Influence over all the parts of the Earth, and by turns, gives all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries their Yearly Seasons.</p>
                  <p>And this gradual Increase and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Heat, answers all the Ends of Nature, both in the Vegetive and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal World much better than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Temperature and Equality of Heat, which the Theorist supposeth to have been in the An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ediluvian Earth.</p>
                  <p>After the Creation of the Sun, God reduc'd all those vast Fogs and water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Mists that rang'd about in the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary Spheres into a Body, which <hi>Moses</hi> calls the Moon, and he design'd it [as a Reverend and Learn'd Divine of our own has observ'd] to be for a Vicarious Light to the Sun, to supply
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60989:85"/>
his absence, and perform his Office in the lower World.</p>
                  <p>He plac'd the Moon in the lowest of the Coelestial Spheres, at such a conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

He gave also to the Moon so commodious a Motion, which it performs in every 28 or 29 Days, that when the Sun is Southward it moves Northward, and when the Sun moves Northward it's Motion is Southward, by which Motion the Cold and Darkness of the long Winter Nights are moderated, and these remote Regions under the Poles comforted with the Sun's Influence at Second-hand, when they want it at the First.</p>
                  <p>Thus by reducing of those waterish Fogs into the Body of the Moon, the upper Firmament or the Planetary Spheres were clear'd, and the Plan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The manner how they Propagate, is, first by Digging up the Sand where they intend to make their Nests, and then [not by Copulation or Penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of parts, but playing Cheek for Chole, and by Sympathetical Touches] the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male whones her Eggs, and the Male his Spawn, which mixing together falls down into these prepar'd Nests which they cover up with Sand, thereby se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it from the Winter Floods.</p>
                  <p>After this they return to their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Holds, leaving their Eggs to be Hatch'd by the Subterranean Heat, which continues in the Springs and Quick-sands until the <hi>April</hi> following; and then the Young Frie, being Hatch'd creep out of their warm Nests and Swim down the Waters in numerous Swarms or Shoals.</p>

                  <p>The East Wind blowing then Dry, by it's soft and easie Blasts did Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dense the Morning and Evening Dews into viscous and clammy Strings, which like Cobwebs hang upon every Thorn and spread themselves upon the Young Grass, till the Sun advancing towards the Meridian, sent down a warm Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon the Earth, and caus'd all these fine and tender Threads to draw together, and fashion themselves into little Nests, in which by a higher De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat were form'd little Eggs; which by another Degree of Heat took Life, and did Fly about in the open

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And first we Conclude from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Sense of the Text, that there was such a place upon Earth, as a Local Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise; and that this place, did as far exceed the rest of the Earth, in Fertili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Soil, and all the Products of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Gardens of the best Cultivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, exceed the common Fields.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We Collect from the Literal Sense, that this Terrestrial Paradise, in respect of <hi>Iudea</hi> or <hi>Midian</hi> [where we suppose <hi>Moses</hi> Writ this System of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on] was <hi>Eastward.</hi>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That in respect of the Heavens, its Situation was under the Aequinoctial Line.</p>
               <p>These two last Hypothesis's having no authority from the Sacred Scripture, we shall endeavour to ground them; not only upon the bare Account which

                  </gap>irst dry Land that appear'd after the Waters began to divide and decrease.</p>
               <p>We yet further subjoin, that as this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> middle Girdle upon the Earth, lies pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to that middle Circle in t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

adjoining Regions, received the first and largest Influence of the Sun's En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening Vegetation, and consequently were Stored with the first Products of Nature; as well Animals, as Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. So that in all probability, there might be Ripe Fruit in Paradise, before those other Regions towards the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks and Poles were drain'd from the Waters, or receiv'd the Sun's Vegetation according to their Natural Seasons.</p>
               <p>Again, as these Aequinoctial Regions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> produced all Kinds of Vegetables and Animals in the highest Degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection their Natures were Capable of: So they did, and do to this Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us not only the greatest plenty of the most Precious Stones, but also the most Valuable and Useful Metals, as Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this is not only evident from the <hi>Mosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick</hi> Account of the Rivers of Paradise; but the Experience of those Merchants, who being tempted by their Value, Trade thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Once more, as it is most probable, that these Aequinoctial Regions were the first dry Land, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the first Enlivening Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, and were honour'd
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60989:105"/>
with the first products of Nature; so it is most agreeable with Reason, that all the Regions upon Earth are more or less Paradisaical, as their Situations are nearer or at a distance from this middle Zone, and that from Paradise they were first Stock'd with the several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of Nature, and the several Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera of Animals; which began to Propagate their Kinds there, until the Earth was Replenish'd. Altho' its most probable, that they did degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from their Original Perfection as their Propagations were at a distance from Paradise.</p>
               <p>As from these Arguments we Collect <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> and Conclude, that the Terrestrial Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise was in respect of the Heavens Situated under the Aequinoctial Line; so in the last place, we Conclude that its particular Situation was in a middle between the Tops of the highest Mountains and the lowest Valleys. And we ground this Hypothesis upon the Account which <hi>Moses</hi> gives of the Course and Motion of that River which water'd Paradise: for this River un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly had its Rise from the Top or side of some of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Mountains, and took its Course first in one Rapid
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:60989:106"/>
Stream, through the midst of that most pleasant Dale, and then by divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it self into Four lesser Streams, they became the Heads of Four of the greatest and most noble Rivers in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which sliding down through the lower Dales, Plains and Valleys, of a great part of <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi>; at last empty'd themselves into the Main O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean at great distances.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The hight of its Situation gave it a most wholesome, delightful and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Air, together with the most ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and grateful Prospect over the rest of the Rising and Growing World.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This Paradisaical Dale, had all the advantages of a Natural Situation. For first of all, it must be necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that it had its Situation under the Skirts of the highest Mountain in those <hi>Eastern</hi> Countries, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it from the Cold Blasts of the <hi>Northern</hi> Wind, from whose lofty Top did flow that Rapid Mineral Feeder which took its Course through the midst of it.</p>

               <p>That these Hills were Beautify'd and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Adorn'd with all Kinds of Trees, which might gratifie the Senses with their fresh and beautiful Colours, always Green, and casting a most pleasant Shade and delightsome Fragrancy; in which the Active and Chearful Birds Sung their Morning and Evening An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems.</p>
               <p>That these Hills encompassed a large <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and spacious Plain, wherein did Spring up and Grow to Perfection all the Species of Herbs. Plants and Flowers that are to be found in the large Volume of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Inventory.</p>
               <p>In the middle of which Nature had Planted a most Curious Grove or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, wherein did Grow all Kinds of Fruit-Trees bearing the choise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The most remarkable Trees in this most pleasant Garden, were the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge, which [being taken in a Literal and Natural Sense] had their Names from

the Nature and Quality of the Fruit they Bore.</p>
               <p>The former (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Tree of Life Bore a wholsome Fruit, preserving both the growing Sensitive and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Life; and that so long as a Body compounded of Matter, consisting of contrary Qualities could last.</p>
               <p>The other (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Bore an unwholesome Fruit of a Poysonous Nature, which destroying the Excellent Frame and Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body, made it subject to Diseases and Pains, and last of all to Death and Mortality.</p>
               <p>As the former gave us the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Health, Life and Vigour, which Men are seldom sensible of, whilst that happy State continues. So the Fruit of the other gave us the Knowledge and sad Experience of an Unhealthy and Sickly Constitution of Body, and Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Death and Mortality; hence it had its Name of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge from the dear bought Experience of its Fruit.</p>

                  <p>The higher the Sun ascends in the Meridian, it strikes down these fiery <hi>Globuli</hi> with greater force upon the Earth and Waters; and consequently they rise higher, and èlevate the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours with them.

                  <p>BY Heat is not to be understood the Element of Fire, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his Followers conceited to be under the Concave of the Moon, [there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no such Element there] but by Heat is meant that Internal Heat and Fermentation which is in the Body of the Earth, and that Natural Fire which is originally and essentially in the Body of the Sun, the Vehicle of External Heat, which Streams out from every part of that Fiery Globe, giving Heat, Light, and enlivening Vegetations to the whole Material World, being within the Compass of its Fiery and Luminous Atmosphere.</p>
                  <p>These Streams of Heat and Light [which is only the shadow of Heat] be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Darted through the Regions of the Air in Strait Lines, and single Rayes, are not perceivably Hot or Cold, no more than the Light of a Candle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Sphere of its Heat; but being

doubled by multiplyed Reflections, and Reboundings from the solid Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Earth, does increase its Heat, as the Reflections are multiplyed and rebounded; which makes it hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against a Wall, than upon the plane Ground, and in the Vallies, than upon the Mountains.</p>
                  <p>We must therefore distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those single Rayes of Heat, which dart through the Air in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, which are neither perceivably hot or cold, and the Heat upon the Superficies of the Earth, which being contracted by an Artificial Glass, is R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>CHAP. III. Of Cold, the other efficient Cause of Meteors.</head>
                  <p>BY Cold is not meant a bare priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heat, as former Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers did conceit; but a real Body, of a Subtile Sublimated and Homogenous Nature, and of a cold and frigid Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Its proper place of Existence is between this Earths Atmosphere, and the Atmosphere of the Moon, which is our next Neighbouring Globe; and by the rising and falling of this main Body of Cold, are caused the several Changes and Alterations of the Weather with us.</p>
                  <p>The Cause of its Rising and Falling, is the pressures of these two Atmospheres between which it is plac'd: When the waterish Atmosphere of the Moon presseth it down, it causeth Storms and Tempests here upon this Globe; And when it Rises, it causes the same in the Moon.</p>
                  <p>The Rising and Falling of this Main Body of Cold, is sometimes also occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60989:120"/>
by its Dilating and Contracting of it self.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Suns Beams are hotter in their Reflections upon the Earth, than in the Sun it self, so these Cold Rays which are darted from this Main Body of Cold, being increas'd and multiply'd by Reflection from the Mountains and Rivers, are much colder than the Main Body of Cold in its own Sphere. These Reflected <hi>Globuli</hi> of Cold may be term'd the Lower or Ground-cold; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in Summer it penetrates the Earth, and in Winter it seldom rises higher than the Tops of the highest Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, unless when it joins with the Main Body, and then it causeth great Storms of Frost and Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Lower or Ground-cold, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Rear-guard and Van-guard of the Sun, always going before and following it; and its most perceivable in the Evening and Morning Twilights; especially, by Birds and Aerial Animals, whose Bodies do so sympathize with the Air, that they can more quickly perceive the Change of Weather (espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the rising of a Storm or Rain or Snow) than any of the Terrene Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; and this they commonly discover
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60989:120"/>
by their Flying high or low, or Flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together; or sometimes by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Notes or Voices. This occasion'd the Ancient Augurs to conceit them prophets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Essential Qualities and Effects of Cold in general, are Frigefaction, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation, and sometimes Petre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This lower Cold contracts and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it self, as it meets with Oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the contrary Quality of Heat and Fire.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. Of Comets, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AMongst the Fiery Meteors, all the former Philosophers reckon'd Comets to be the most Remarkable: And they gave such Dismal Accounts of the Dreadful Effects of them, that their very Appearance put the World under a great Consternation. But in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the World [according to the Old Proverb] was more affraid than hurt by them.</p>
                  <p>For that Comets are Fiery Mete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, and have such dreadful Effects following their Appearance, is a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake in Meteorology so palpable, that it needs no Confutation:</p>
                  <p>That which we call a Comet, being no more than a Star of a Fiery and Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Body, in Conjunction with an other Star of an Opake and Waterish Substance, or a Vast Coelestial Cloud, which by receiving into its Body the Bright Rays of the Luminous Star, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes Translucent, and appears to us in the Form and Figure of a Luminous
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60989:123"/>
or Fiery Globe; and by emitting Beams or Streams of Light, it appears to be a Fiery and Burning Meteor, which by the Meteorologists is call'd a Comet.</p>
                  <p>If this Conjunction and Interposition be Centrical, it sends forth its Beams of Light on every Side; and this we call a Bearded Comet.</p>
                  <p>If the Interposition be not Centrical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Luminous Star be higher or lower, or on one side, it sends forth a Beam or Stream of Light upward or downward, or to one side; and this Beam or Stream of Light, is call'd the Tail of the Comet.</p>
                  <p>The Appearance of this Comet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues until their different Motions have separated them.</p>
                  <p>A demonstration of this you may have several Evenings, when a black waterish Cloud interposeth between us and the Body of the Sun; if the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position be Centrical, the Sun's Beams stream out every way; if the Sun be higher, it sends forth its Beams of Light downward; if lower, upward, or to one side, according to the Interposition of the Cloud.</p>
                  <p>Against this Hypothesis, it may be Objected, that there is no such thing in
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60989:124"/>
Nature as an Opake Waterish Coelesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Body.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer, That th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Moon is an Opake Globe of a Waterish Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; and if its Natural Course and Motion was not within the compass of the Suns Atmosphere, it would be to us invisible: So there may be [for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that we know] Thousands of Opake Globes, within the Vast Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Coelestial Spheres, which are never visible to us, but when they fall into Conjunction, or Oppositon, with a Luminous Star: And when these Opake Globes are of a Round and Waterish Substance, they appear to us in the Form of Comets.</p>
                  <p>Again, it is most probable that all these New Stars, which have appear'd for some time, and then disappear'd, [which Astronomers have given such Remarkable Accounts of,] are only O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pake Globes, made visible for sometime, by their being in Conjunction or Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to a Luminous Star, and when their different Motions have separated them the Opake Star hath disappear'd.</p>

                  <p>The first beginning of Freezing is at the Waters, and this we call a Water Frost; its the Effect or Operation of the Morning Cold; which drawing down to the Waters in the Morning Twilight, and carrying the Vapours a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it, leaves a Waterish Hoar Frost upon the Ground behind it.</p>
                  <p>These Vapours lie upon the Waters until Nine a Clock; for by that time the Influence of Heat having warm'd the Waters, forceth them to remove their Quarters, first to the cold Tops of the Mountains, and thence to the cooler Regions of the Air, from whence they fall down in Showers of Rain about

                  <p>The Third Morning, the Cold trebles its force, and gains the Tops of the Mountains.
