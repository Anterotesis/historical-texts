            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Christmas, or Christs Day, or Christs Birth-Day.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N imitation of my great and glorious Lord and Master (Jesus Christ) in love to them that hate me, I am come to them that love me not. My Almighty Master was, is, and ever will be GOD, from whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was, is, or ever shall be hid; and he did not onely know, but commiserate the miseries of his enemies (most miserable mankinde) to whom he had often sent his Patriarks, Prophets, and other Messengers of Peace and prosperity, and how they were, and should be entertained in the world; God knew before, and all Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories of the sacred Volumes, or other Books of Eclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Writings will testifie.</p>
            <p>And as my good Master did know how coursely he should be dealt withall (by misbelieving hard hearted Jewes) yet he came on this Day, from whom I have my name of CHRISTMAS, or Christs Day: Even so, I come this 25. of December, though I know I shall be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly welcome to a great many; yet  I am sure that as many as love my Master, will rejoyce to see this Day: But as my sirname of Mas, there is much exceptions taken, by some that understand not what Mas, or Christmas mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</p>
            <p>I have heard Learned men say, that the word Mas doth
<pb facs="tcp:105900:2"/>
signifie some heavy or ponderous thing, as <hi>Massa</hi> is a Wedge of Gold or Iron, or any thing that is pressed or made into a lump of any thick matter of Dough, or Curds, Cheese, or such like; but my sirname of Mas is mistaken, for my name is <hi>Christi missi,</hi> or Christ sent, as being sent from God to us this Day. Christ had his Mission, he came not before he was sent (as himselfe said to his Disciples.) <q>He that believes in you believes in me, and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in me, believes in him that sent me.</q> Here it is plaine that my Master was sent, and as he was sent, so he sent his Apostles, and they gave mission to the succeeding Ministery, and they that were sent went, and none were so bold to intrude into the Ministery without his Mission or Commission of being sent: and so much concerning my name of Christmas.</p>
            <p>But I am more properly called Christs Day, for he himselfe did honour me with that Name, and though all dayes are his (for as he is God, he is the Antient of Daies) for whem the Jewes did speak of ABRAHAM, Joh. 8, 56, My Master sayd, <q>Before ABRAHAM was, I am, for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BRAMAM saw my Day, and rejoyced in it, and was glad.</q> He appointed me to be the peculiar Day of his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Birth; he was promised in Paradice, foretold and foreseen by the Patriarks and Prophets; proclaimed by Angels, with <q>Glory be to God in the highest, peace on Earth, good will towards men, <bibl>Luk. 11. 14.</bibl>
               </q> A Song or Christmas Carroll, of three parts, to God, to Earth, to Men, (Glory, Peace, &amp; Good will) a gracious Consort sung by celestiall Spirits, Angels, and a multitude of heavenly Souldiers, they sung and rejoyced all for our good, and not for their owne: Then let men sing Psalmes and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thems in Churches, and Hymns and Carols in our Houses, let us give glory to God on high, and he will give us peace below.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:105900:3"/>
Faith is very clear sighted, for ABRAHAM was more than two thousand yeares before Christ came in the flesh, yet (with the Eye of Eaith) he saw Me, he saw my Master and my Masters day, and rejoyced in it; and his rejoycing was approved of, but the Jews which rejoyced not were reprehended. The holy Patriark rejoyced, and Christ al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it, and he did dislike the unbelieving Jews that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced not. The Jewes did not (and do not) observe it, but all Christians did, doe, and will celebrate it and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it, for no Christian will strike, blot, or scrape Christs Day out of the Kalender.</p>
            <p>The Prophet Isaiah did write of Christs comming 600 years before he came, in these words, <q>Behold a Virgin shall conceive and beare a Son, and he shall call his name IMMANUELL, or EMANUELL, <bibl>Esay 8. v. 14.</bibl>
               </q> 
            </p>
            <p>And again in the 9. Chapter v. 6. <q>For unto us a Child is borne, and unto us a Son is given:</q>  He is born and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Son is given born of the blessed Virgin his Mother, and given by Almighty God his Father: a Child <hi>Natus,</hi> a gift <hi>Datus,</hi> Is borne, Is given: The Prophet saies not, was borne and given, but Is, which is ever, in the present Tense, Borne still in the heart, soule, and memory of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Christian. He that Was, and Is, and Is to come, Was borne a Child and is born a Child unto us, Was given a Son, and is given a Son unto us, this Day of my Masters blessed Nativity.</p>
            <p>In the second of S. Luke, v. 10 11. <q>Then the Angel said unto them, be not afraid, for behold I bring you glad tidings of great joy which shall be to all the people,</q>  a Saviour is born on this Day, Christs Day, Christs Birth-day, my day, Christmas day.</p>
            <p>The Angel appeared to the Shepheards, and told them newes of a Lamb, <q>the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the World: a Lamb that was come to save all
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105900:3"/>
the sheep of Israel that were lost,</q>     and lost everlastingly we should have been, had not this blessed Lamb come and redeemed us.</p>
            <p>And as he was a Lamb, so likewise he was a Shepheard, the true Shepheard, the chiefe Shepheard, 1 Pet. 5. 4. the good Shepheard, Joh. 10 11. 14. so we read that his Birth and Birth-day was first made knowne unto Shepheards. Indeed Shepheards were in odious and contemptible ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homination amongst the Idolatrous Egyptians, Gen. 46. 32. So was and is my Master Christs Name and Birth-day to the misbelieving Jewes, miscreant Turke, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarian, Schismaticall, out-side seeming Christians. This day he that was prophecied of to come, did come, and he that was promised is come; an Angell preached at his comming, and Quires and multitudes of blessed Spirits sung, when our Saviour came, who was, is, and ever will be, not only a Saviour, but salvation it selfe.</p>
            <p>He was the Word, and the Word was God, and God was the Word. Here God (the Word) was a Childe, a Babe, an Infant; and here the Word was not able to speak a word, Joh. 14. <q>And the Word was made Flesh, and dwelt among us, we saw the glory thereof, as the glory of the onely begotten Son of the Father, full of Grace and Truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>God sent his Son this day; note who he was that did send, and what it was that he sent: He sent first to us, that should in all humility have been Petitioners to him; we were enemies to God, to us he had sent often by his Messengers; but this Day he sent his Son, who was and is himselfe.</p>
            <p>Therefore let our deserved misery, and Gods undeser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved mercy, love and compassion, be thankfully remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred this day, and every day in all places, times, ages, and generations.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105900:4"/>
This Day, Mercy and Truth are met together, and Righteousnesse and peace have kissed each other, Truth shall flourish out of the Earth and Righteousnesse hath looked downe from heaven, Psal. 85.</q> Here was a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and happy meeting, here the Lord Chiefe Justice of Heaven and Earth, brings justice, truth, and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to judge, and mercy and compassion to save; here mercy shewed her selfe a good Mistris to misery: This Day he came in clouts that will come in Clouds. <q>And without controversie great is the Mystery of godliness, which is, God is manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angells, preached to the Gentiles, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on in the world, and received up in Glory, <bibl>1 Tim. 3.</bibl>
               </q> This was a great M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stery indeed; this was the summe and substance of all Tropes, Types, Figures, Shadowes, Sacrifices, Ceremonies, and the one and onely absolute fulfilling and accomplishment of all Prophesies. And in the first Chapter to the Hebrewes, verse 1, 2, 3. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith: <q>And at sundry times, and in divers places, God spake in the old time to our Fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; in these last dayes he hath spoken to us by his Son.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus my Master (who had no beginning) did begin this day to come and dwell amongst sinfull men; the Son of God, the King of Glory came this Day, and this Day was the first Day of Christianity to all Christians, and as many as have true faith in Christ.</p>
            <p>This was he to whom God the Father said, Psal. 2. <q> Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</q> And this was he that in the same Psalme was prophesied to say, <q> Lord I will preach thy Law, and declare thy Will.</q> The Evangelist S. Luke saith, Chap. 2. Ver. 12, 13. <q>And this shall be a sign unto you, you shall finde the Babe swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and laid in a Cratch, some read it in a Manger.</q> Here
<pb facs="tcp:105900:4"/>
is to be noted the great humility of my Master, that though he were Lord and maker of all, the first joyfull ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of his birth was, not brought to Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, or to Scribes, Pharisees, Lawyers, or Doctors; but he was gratiously pleased to be first declared to poore and humble Shepheards, and not to be borne in any mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent or stately Palace, or in the best room in the Inne: No, the Inkeeper had his Chambers filled with Guests more welcome and gainfull then Christ: There was no room for him in the Inne, therefore the Redeemer of mankind had entertainment in a Stable amongst Beasts, swadled and laid in a Cratch.</p>
            <p>Neither would he be borne in any great or glorious City, Jerusalem had not the honour to be graced with the Birth and first presence of the Son of God; in great Cities there hath ever been more misery than mercy, and more persecution than pity; therefore great Jerusalem was the place of his bitter death and passion, and little Bethlehem was honoured with his birth, as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied many years before, by the Prophet Micah, Chap. 5. in these words: <q>And thou Bethlehem Ephrathah are little to be among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that shall be the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in Israel, whose goings forth have been from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and from everlasting.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And Heb. 2. 16.<q> For he in no wise took the Angells<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> he took.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He took our nature (in the seed of <hi>Abraham)</hi> upon him, the nature of Angells he took not: He came this day to help us, who had most need of a Saviour; he gave to us not onely a dignity which he gave not to Angells, but also he gave himselfe for us, and sure we cannot take <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

My Master gave power to his Church to celebrate and to ordain and command the annuall celebration of his blessed Nativity, I have twelve dayes to attend me, and twelve moneths I do absent my selfe before I come again, the kinde or course entertainment, the courteous or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish usage to me, doth not, or cannot increase, or diminish my Masters glory; or adde to me, or take from me one minute of time; if men could be as faithfull and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as humble as <hi>David,</hi> as milde and meek as Moses, as zealous as <hi>Elias,</hi> as patient as <hi>Job,</hi> as solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous as <hi>Martha,</hi> and as devout as the blessed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> those gracious gifts have been, are, and will be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse unspeakable to such as are by supernall grace en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with them, but the profit of them is onely theirs that have them, for he that is rich in mercy, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by the piety-vertue, or merits of men; so that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Christian may truly say,</p>
            <q>
               <l>Lord the great love thou bear'st to me is thine,</l>
               <l>But all the profit of it's only mine.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So likewise if poore old Christmas day be made wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, I am not the richer or fatter, if I be ill entertain'd, I will neither be poorer or leaner: Let them make me a feasting or fasting day, all my joy or grief is not of long continuance, I am but a short day, and not far from the shortest day, and therefore their loves are but short to my Master, that will not rejoyce and be glad at the comming of his anniversary Birth day.</p>
            <p>The old yeare was before Christ, when misbelieving Iewes and Gentiles lived in the darknesse of ignorant I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry under the Law, (or without the Law) but the New yeare came when the Father of Lights sent my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster (the Light of the world) who by the glorious light of his Gospell expelled and dispersed the black clouds and mists of Egyptian blindnesse, and devillish Idolatry.
<pb facs="tcp:105900:5"/>
Therefore with the old year let is shake off our old faults, (the deeds of darkness) and with the new yeare let us be renewed in our minds, and follow the true light, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our maners, &amp; let our hearts be fill'd with praises &amp; thanksgivings, before our bellies be overfill'd with meat.</p>
            <p>There were lately some over curious, hot zealous Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who with a superbian predominance did doe what they could to keep Christmas day out of England; they did in divers places Preach Me for dead in Funerall Sermons, and labour'd tooth and nail to bury me alive in the grave of oblivion; they were of opinions, that from the 24. of December at night, till the 7. of January following, that Plumb-Pottage was meer Popery, that a Coller of Brawn was an obhomination, that Roast Beef was Antichristian, that Mince Pies were Reliques of the Whore of Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and a Goose, a Turkey, or a Capon, were marks of the Beast.</p>
            <p>In detestation of which superstitious diet, they assum'd to themselvs spirituall and temporall jurisdiction, power, and authority to search and plunder Pottage-pots, to ran sack and rifle Ovens, and to strip spits stark naked, and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly carry the pillage to be disposed of as they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, for the profit and edification of the righteous, and chastisement of the wicked.</p>
            <p>As there are many sundry Nations, so are there as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inclinations: the Russian, Polonian, German, Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, are excellent in the Art of Drinking, the Spaniard will Wench it, the Italian is revengefull, the French man is for fashions, the Irish man Usquebagh makes him light heel'd, the Welsh mans Cowss-boby works (by insusion) to his fingers ends, and translates them into the nature of lime-twigs, and it is said, that a Scot will prove false to his Father, and dissemble with his Brother; but for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish man he is so cleare from any of th<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

I am old and bold to tell the nose wise Brethren of these critick daies, that my great Master is King of Kings, &amp; Lord of Lords, whois the ancient of daies, who never had begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and never shall have end. And on this day, which is kept in a thankfull remembrance of his blessed incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 1652 years since, I [Christmas] have not failed to make my aniversary &amp; yearly progress into Christendom.</p>
            <p>When my Master Christ was graciously pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his unexpressible grory for mans unsupportable misery, when (in his mercy) he put off the Majesty of his Godhead, and took upon him our miserable Manhood, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his glorious Throne for a Maunger, when he laid by his immortall honour, and cloathed himselfe with our shame, to free all true believers from eternall damnation: Then (on his daies birth) my day began. Then on that day, and at that time, as the Shepheards were in the field, they were saluted with an Angel, and a multitude of the heavenly Host with a most celestiall Carroll.</p>
            <q>
               <bibl>Luk. 2.</bibl>
               <l> All glory be to God on the High'st,</l>
               <l>And on the Earth be Peace.</l>
               <l>Good will towards men, 'tis the will of Christ,</l>
               <l>Our joyes should never cease.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Thus was my good Master usher'd into the World, and for his sake, I with my followers (being 12 daies in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) honest <hi>Stephen</hi> &amp; true <hi>John,</hi> with my <hi>Innocents</hi> Pages, and all the rest have been welcom'd and joyfully enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ever since, by all sorts of people that have lov'd or do love and honour the memory of the birth-day of my gracious and glorious Lord and Master.</p>
            <p>But now of late the case is quite altred, Christ and Christmas are both alike welcome; and if the Saviour of Mankinde should come personally here amongst us againe, he were likely (through ignorance, malice, and madnesse) to be re-crucified: if Christmas may be so bold as to aske

those fiery spirited people the same question as my Master might have asked the Jews; for which of my good works that I have done do you stone me?</p>
            <p>So I may say to England, what harme have I ever done unto you? I am sure I never perswaded you to be so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable as to cut one anothers throats, and to starve and famish the poore (as you have done continually) and do still ever since you banished me from your territories, and it is to be feared that you will never be quiet, or have a happy Peace amongst you, till you do give me better wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for my Masters sake; he is the Prince of Peace, and his peace you will never have that do unthankfully dispise &amp; neglect to solemnize the day of his most blessed Nativity.</p>
            <p>It is a lamentable and too long a story to relate in what a pittifull quandary I and my followers have been in any time these twelve years, when we came into this Country: I was in good hope that so long a misery would have made them glad to bid a merry Christmas welcome: But wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or not welcome, I am come, and at my comming (a little before day) I heard the Cock crow merrily, which <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

This was no good news to me and my company; we had not been used to such uncomfortable breakfasts, which made us all search up and down the chief Cities for better chear, but my especiall mind was to try the curtesie of London, where I entred a fair house which had been an Aldermans, but it was now possest with a grave Fox-fur'd Mammonist, whom I found sitting over a few cinders to warm his gouty toes, (for no other part of him did need the comfort of a fire,) from head to heel he was fur'd like a Muscovite, and instead of a Bible he had a Bond in his hand, which he poard upon to see if it were forfeit or no; he seldome looked upward, but as it were riveted his eyes to the earth, as if he had been looking for a Mine: his keys of his treasure were hanged at his waste, and his clutches alwayes on them, and he no sooner espied me and my Company, but he cried Thieves, Thieves, and reviled his <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I could have answered him with divine Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Precepts, with many humane Histories and Examples concerning good house-keeping, and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hospitality; but every vertue (in this Age of Vice) is between two extremes, (as my Master was betwixt two Thieves) as liberallity is in the middle, but prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and covetousnesse are on each side of her, alwayes ready to spoil and devour her.</p>
            <p>All true Christians do know, that what reliefe soever is given to the poore, is lent unto my Lord and Master Christ, and he hath, is, and will be bound to see it paid with Heavenly interest; but he is a surety that few U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers will accept of.</p>
            <p>At my departure from this old Father Penny-wise, his

Sonne, (M. Pound foolish) desired his crabbed Sire to bid me stay and dine with him, at which the miserable Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudgeon was even half mad with anger, calling his Son spend-thrift, and prodigall Jack-an-Apes, saying, that if he bad me to dinner, that I with my followers, would take the boldnesse to sup with him, and lodge in his house till Twelftide was past, and that I would draw more Guests to his house then he had a mind to bid welcome, &amp; more Beggers to his gate then he had a mind to relieve.</p>
            <p>Thus was poor Christmas used, which made me and my men look blank upon the matter, and without bidding him farewell, I took a going welcome from him, and wandring into the Countrey up and downe from house to house, I found little or small comfort in any; some would only smile upon me, and (because I should not pisse at their doors) they would give me a cup of single, slender, lean, small Beer, or Ale, which had the vertue to cause a man to make an Alphabet of faces, for it would have war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a mans heart like pangs of death in a frosty morning. And as thinking or remembring former prosperities, doe make adversities seem the more heavy: So I call to minde the vigorous spirit of the Buttry, Nappy. Nut-browne, Berry-browne, Ale Abelendo, whose infusion and inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was wont to have such Aleaborate operation to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate &amp; exhillerate the vitals, to put alementall Raptures and Enthusiasms in the most capitall Perricranion, in such plenitude that the meanest and most illiterate Plow jogger could speedily play the Rhetorician, and speak alequently, as if he were mounted up into the Aletitude. This merry memory (or sad remembrance) of Ale, caused me to ask the reason of this alteration, to which question an honest Smith made this answer.</p>

            <p>Indeed (to speake truth) my best and freest welcome with some kind of Countrey Farmers, I will describe one for all the rest in Devonshire and Cornwall, where though both the Armies had been with them, and given them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall visits, insomuch that if the Cavaliers had taken their Horses, thee other Party made bold with their Oxen; if the one had their Sheep, the other plaid sweep-stake; so that (according to the Countrey phrase) great Crock, and little Chock, all was I go; yet as soon as they spied me, they saluted me with much love and reverend curtesie. The Good-man, with the Dame of the house, and all the rest of the men were exceeding glad to see me, and with all Countrey curtesie and solemnity, I was had into the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, there I was placed at the upper end of the Table and my company about me, we had good chear and free wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and we were merry without Musick.</p>
            <p>A, ha, quoth I, this piece of the world is well mended, our Dinner is better then our Breakfast, this was as Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas would have it, here is neither too much cost, nor too little meat; here is no surfeit on the one side, or hunger on the other; they are alwaies the best Feasts where the poor are reliev'd, for the rich can help themselves.</p>
            <p>After Dinner we arose from the Boord, and sate by the fire, where the Harth was imbrodered all over with roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
