            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There are two things put me upon this Preface: Fir≈øt, <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> and his Abettors's Inveterate Malice, calling me and others Old can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker'd Apo≈øtates, Vile Apo≈øtates, Self-condemn'd Apo≈øtates, Unruly Bea≈øts, Betraying <hi>Juda≈ø≈øes,</hi> Wolves, Dogs, Enemies of all Righteou≈øne≈øs, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, Devils Incarnate, Heathens, Athei≈øts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed their Books are ≈øo very Malicious and Defamatory, as well as their private Whi≈øperings and Backbitings, that ≈øome even of them≈øelves have been con≈øtrained to give me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Hands a Te≈øtimony in Writing again≈øt the unchri≈øtian Treatment which I have met withal; namely, <hi>T. Bird, J. Ellington, J. Ma≈øon, W. Bel≈øham,</hi> and above Twenty more Quakers belonging to <hi>Mildenhall</hi>-Meeting: And yet not wor≈øe Language than they have given the Publick Mini≈øtry; as Witches, Devils, Gormandizing Prie≈øts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as anon will appear. And whoever di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers their Errors, and di≈øplays them in their proper Colours, mu≈øt expect to meet with ≈øomething of this kind: And that being fore-≈øeen, have doubtle≈øs been taken for a tolerable Excu≈øe by abler Pens from ≈øtooping to ≈øuch an Undertaking as this: And thereupon I may the more rationally expect the more favourable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure for what might have been done better by the Learned; 'tis enough to me to be thought worthy in this great Work (of di≈øcovering the greate≈øt Here≈øie that ever ≈øprang up in our Age) to be as the Carpenter's Man, who≈øe Work is to hew off the rough and knotty pieces of the Timber, to make it more ready for better Workmen.</p>
            <p>To be Contentious I grant is an Offence the Scriptures condemn with no little keenne≈øs, whil≈øt it exhorts to contend earne≈øtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints. From whence I conceive, that though I contend again≈øt Quakeri≈øm with ≈øome Symptoms of Zeal, I am not therefore Contentious; nor though I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, yea, write again≈øt ≈øome Errors I formerly held, and upon Conviction have for≈øaken: I am not therefore a Self-condemned Apo≈øtate, as <hi>G. W.</hi> dreams. If you think me too ≈ømart in ≈øome pa≈ø≈øages again≈øt Per≈øons, 'tis again≈øt their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; if again≈øt their Opinions, I have from their own Books proved them Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and Bla≈øphemous, which ought to be reproved ≈øharply: And that their Opinions are ≈øo, I have never refu≈øed to make Proof of to their faces, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition when proved they would engage a Retractation; nay, ≈øometimes without any ≈øuch Engagement. <hi>See Quakeri≈øm Anatomized, p. 2.</hi> I cannot call Gall and Poy≈øon by ≈øweet and lovely Names, I mu≈øt alter my Style according to the Matter and Occa≈øion, or el≈øe all will be out of Tune, and no more Harmony than Harp and Harrow.

again≈øt the Papi≈øts, and most exqui≈øitely di≈øplayed their Errors; and yet they prote≈øted they were in Charity, and de≈øired nothing more than that they would have hearkened to them, and for≈øaken their Errors. And I do ≈øay, nothing would plea≈øe me better, than to ≈øee this People Condemn what is Erroneous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and per≈øevere in the Truth, and the Knowledge of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus Christ, True God, and Perfect Man in One Per≈øon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if any Object in favour of them, That though they do not Preach Chri≈øt without (unle≈øs ≈øince <hi>G. K.</hi> came over) as he is in Heaven above, nor believe him to be di≈øtinct from his Saints; nor Pray in the Name of Je≈øus to God the Father, thereby owning him in his Mediator-≈øhip; nor make Confe≈ø≈øion of Sin to God in Prayer, nor beg Pardon for the ≈øame: But look at Chri≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Light within, his Crucifixion within, his Interce≈ø≈øion within; nor a Bible to be ≈øeen in their Meetings, for they are above ≈øuch Carnal things. Yet they have among them many good Exhortations, and they own Chri≈øt to be the Word of God, the Power of God, the Wi≈ødom of God; will not this do? Suppo≈øing they mean all to be within, yea, Heaven and Hell, all within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>I am not un≈øen≈øible what little Arts they have u≈øed to bla≈øt my Reputation, that thereby they may ob≈øtruct the Service of my Books, but their Expectation hath failed them. Then they Indicted me in <hi>London</hi> for Printing without Licen≈øe, yet they do the ≈øame. But they ≈øay, I put up a Mock-Pillory; I grant I did, and that to ≈øhew what they actually de≈øerved upon their own Propo≈øals to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Did not they erect the Form and Figure of a Child's Penny horning Battle-door for the Bi≈øhops, Clergy, and Gentry to Learn the Engli≈øh of <hi>Tu</hi> and <hi>Vos?</hi> Signed by <hi>G.

            <p>THERE is ≈øcarce any Sect of People, how erronious ≈øoever they be, but they have ≈øome Advocates, and ≈øuch too as oftentimes may give ju≈øt occa≈øion for an Apology for writing again≈øt their Errors; and more e≈øpecially when they make ≈øuch fair Pretences to the Chri≈øtian Religion, as the Quakers of late have done, in divers of their Books, particularly that entituled, <hi>The Harmony of the Old and New Te≈øtament;</hi> wherein the Author prefixeth a twofold Preface, the one to the <hi>Chri≈øtians,</hi> the other to the <hi>Jews,</hi> premi≈øing two things, <hi>1≈øt,</hi> To wipe off ≈øuch A≈øper≈øions as have been ca≈øt upon them, as denying <hi>Je≈øus of Nazareth,</hi> and the Divine Authority of the Scriptures. Now, how far their Book will an≈øwer this End, unle≈øs they make an Ingenuous Retractation of their Errors, this Treati≈øe may ≈øhew. <hi>2dly, I have not</hi> (≈øays this Author) <hi>tran≈øcribed the whole of all tho≈øe Ver≈øes, which ≈øometimes is cited, but only ≈øo much as I conceive doth more immediately relate to,</hi> &amp;c.

And becau≈øe I would be as conci≈øe as may be, I ≈øhall recite their Books, which are generally of two ≈øorts, of two Stamps, and carry two contrary Faces, contrary Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in two Columns, that as in a Gla≈øs their Hearers, if they will but read, may behold the depth of Hypocri≈øie, which lye couch'd in their Leaders: Doctrines not only liable to deceive them, but the whole World, who take them to mean as they ≈øay; which makes me believe them to be the very Deceivers Chri≈øt foretold of <hi>Matt.</hi> 24 24. for though they come forth pretending to convert the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their Proofs that <hi>Je≈øus of Nazareth</hi> is the promi≈øed <hi>Me≈ø≈øiah,</hi> yet when the <hi>Jews</hi> come to know (as that they may by reading their Books, e≈øpecially their

O horrible Contempt! yea, ≈øuch as preach Chri≈øt without, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven above, are fal≈øe Mini≈øters, Devils, and Reprobates, which make a talk of Chri≈øt without. God's Chri≈øt is not <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from the Saints, ≈øays <hi>G. F.</hi> yea, the ≈øame Chri≈øt that was crucified and ro≈øe again, is within them, and not <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from them.

Yea, <hi>G.

They ≈øay 'tis Bla≈øphemy to call the Scriptures the Word of God; and that 'tis the Devil that ≈øo pleads: Yet they ≈øay of their own Epi≈øtles, <hi>This is the Word of God;</hi> judge which they preferr.

And as to you that are mi≈ø-led by your Teachers, I exhort you to read the Scriptures, and pray to God to open the My≈øteries of Salvation held forth in them, that ≈øo you may come to have your Judgments rectified. Likewi≈øe read G. <hi>K</hi>'s Ten Articles, which came providentially to my Hand, which being ≈øound and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox; I have expo≈øed them to publick view for general Service, de≈øiring from my Heart that you may receive them in the ≈øame love they were writ and now expo≈øed; yet if you will not hear me, nor receive them, I of all Men may bear with you, in that I once was as aver≈øe to Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the mo≈øt of you; but I obtained Mercy, in that I did not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully per≈øi≈øt again≈øt Conviction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <head>Some of the Principles of <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Friends.</head>
               <p>1. That Bodily Sickne≈øs and Death came in by the Fall. 2. That Chri≈øt has now in Heaven a Soul and a Body, that is not the Godhead, but the Temple of it, and mo≈øt gloriou≈øly united therewith. 3. That Chri≈øt's Body, that was crucified and buried without us, ro≈øe again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and is now in Heaven without us. 4. That the Man Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus will come again in that Body without us, to judge the <hi>Quick</hi> and the <hi>Dead.</hi> 5. That there ≈øhall be a general day of Judgment, that all the decea≈øed Saints are in expectation of. 6. That we get not the Re≈øurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Body, either in this mortal Life, or immediately after Death. 7. That Faith in the Man Chri≈øt without us, as he died for us, ro≈øe again, and is gone into Heaven, wrought in us by the Spirit of Chri≈øt, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øally nece≈ø≈øary to make Men true Chri≈øtians, and Children of God, born of the Free Woman, who have the Spirit of Adoption, crying <hi>Abba Father.</hi> 8. That Chri≈øt's Obedience and Righteou≈øne≈øs, which he performed in him≈øelf, without us, is imputed to us by Faith, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of Sins. 9. That Chri≈øt is not only God's Elect, but all that ≈øhall be ≈øaved from the beginning to the end of the World, are God's Elect, being cho≈øen in him (not only before they believe and repent, but) before the Foundation of the World. 10. That all and every one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chri≈øt (who are at age, and can ≈øpeak) ought to confe≈øs with their Mouths, in the hearing of ≈øome of their Fellow Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Fundamental Principles of their Chri≈øtian Faith, before they can be own'd to be Members of the Church, that by the ≈øame, as well as by a Good Life and Conver≈øation it may be known who are qualified to be Members of our Church: which is Aboundary Terms and Bond of our Union, the Spirit being the Principal: which may be ea≈øily done by <hi>An≈øwering</hi> to ≈øome plain <hi>Que≈øtions.</hi>

it attained through the Mercy of God in Chri≈øt Je≈øus, by Faith in the Merits of his Pa≈ø≈øion, and Obedience to his Precepts.</p>
               <p>Again <hi>G. W.</hi> ≈øays,  <q>
                     <bibl>Count. Conv. p. 29.</bibl> Not reading the Scriptures in our Meetings; for Wor≈øhip is no Proof that we have not a Spiritual Wor≈øhip, nor Evidence that we disbelieve the Doctrines contained in them.</q> 
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> I do not give it as the <hi>only</hi> Evidence, but as a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtration; yet if you did in good earne≈øt believe the Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chri≈øt in the Go≈øpel to be ble≈ø≈øed and holy, as you pretend, you would read the Scripture, and prefer the Bible before any other Book extant in the World; you would read the Scriptures in your Meetings, if any Book at all: and if you recommend any Book to your Friends beyond Sea, it would be the Scripture. But ≈øince you do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but in≈øtead thereof read and recommend your own Epi≈øtles, and that, as you ≈øay, for the ≈øpreading of Truth, this is a Demon≈øtration that you do not believe the Doctrine and Precepts of the Bible to be ble≈ø≈øed and holy; and an infallible Evidence, that you prefer your own Books, Papers, and Epi≈øtles before the Scriptures, unle≈øs you be arrant Cheats indeed, to read and recommend that which you know is wor≈øt, and hide and keep from them that which is be≈øt: which I can hardly think.</p>
               <p>And as impertinent as <hi>G. W.</hi> renders my Ten Rea≈øons, I find him not able to confute them.</p>
               <p>As for his Pretence to Pray after the manner Chri≈øt taught his Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I deny it, for it you kept to the manner, though not to the form, you would not be alone: But let the Reader ob≈øerve all the Prayers of <hi>Steph. Cri≈øp, R. A≈øhby, W. Bingly,</hi> and others, printed at the end of their Sermons, nay, all your Books extant in the World, and he will not find this pa≈ø≈øage, <hi>Forgive us our Sins, as we forgive them that tre≈øpa≈øs again≈øt us:</hi> No, nor yet after that manner; for though you mu≈øt needs know that you are Sinners, as well as others, and have tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed the Laws of God in both Tables <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Cage, p.</hi> 50.</note>, yet you can neither make Confe≈ø≈øion of Sin to God, nor beg Pardon for Chri≈øt's ≈øake: which not only ≈øhew, that you do not Pray after the Manner, but that you do not pray in the Name of Chri≈øt to God the Father, as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Interce≈ø≈øor between GOD and Man: which is an infallible Proof, that as you therein differ from the Faith and Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints and Martyrs, yea, all Prote≈øtant Churches to this day, ≈øo you do not believe the Doctrine and Precepts of the Bible to be ble≈ø≈øed and holy, which teach Men ≈øo to do: which is one Rea≈øon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that you warn, charge, and command your Di≈øciples to read and cau≈øe to be read in your Meetings, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but beyond Sea, your own Papers, Epi≈øtles, and Books, whil≈øt you not only lay a≈øide the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture

Thirdly,</hi> Becau≈øe you ≈øay it's Bla≈øphemy to call the Scriptures the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and yet allow your own Books that Title, giving forth, That what is ≈øpoken from the Spirit of Truth in <hi>any,</hi> is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and <hi>greater,</hi> que≈øtioning whether <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> be the fir≈øt Pen-man thereof. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A fourth Rea≈øon is, becau≈øe you deny the Ordinances of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, as <hi>Bapti≈øm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which the Scriptures teach, ≈øaying, <hi>Go teach all Nations, bapti≈øing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>this do in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c. Which the Apo≈øtles, Primitive Chri≈øtians, and Martyrs practi≈øed, who had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as much as you, and witne≈ø≈øed Chri≈øt's ≈øecond Coming as much as you. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Your laying a≈øide the u≈øe of the Lord's Prayer, both in Manner and Form, as afore≈øaid. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Your laying a≈øide the u≈øe of the Ten Commandments. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And the Apo≈øtle's Creed. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> If you que≈øtion, whether <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was the fir≈øt Pen-man of Sacred Writ, and what the Prophets ≈øpake true or fal≈øe; you, I ≈øay, cannot believe what you que≈øtion. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> You teach, that ≈øuch as preach Chri≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven above, are fal≈øe Mini≈øters: but the Scripture tells you, That <hi>Chri≈øt is ri≈øen,</hi> and ≈øits in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at the Right Hand of God in Heaven above. And, <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Becau≈øe you rob Chri≈øt of his Divine Attributes, and put them upon your <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied George Fox,</hi> calling him the Branch, the Star, the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øne≈øs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See your Epi≈øtle <hi>This is only to go among≈øt Friends</hi> largely recited in this Introduction, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. which notwith≈øtanding <hi>G.

I ≈øay, <hi>G.

whether they be ≈øincere, or which ≈øhall we take to be their Judgment in good earne≈øt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An≈øw.</hi> That they are not ≈øincere I have already given ten Rea≈øons, but that I may renew your memory, I will add one more, <hi>viz.</hi> In all their Meetings for Wor≈øhip of <hi>GOD</hi> they never read one Chapter of the Bible, nor one of the Epi≈øtles of the Apo≈øtles, for this thirty years; but 'tis fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with them to read their own Epi≈øtles, as herein I ≈øhall further ≈øhew; only one in≈øtance for the pre≈øent I may recite to confirm you in the truth of their practice, and by which you may mea≈øure great part of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, <hi>viz. Several Papers given forth for the ≈øpreading the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. p. 60, 61, 62. <hi>Friends, to you all this is the Word of the LORD, take heed of judging one another</hi>

                  <hi>: To you all this is the Word of the LORD, to ≈øpread over all: I charge you in the pre≈øence of the LORD GOD to ≈øend this (Epi≈øtle) among≈øt ALL FRIENDS AND BRETHREN EVERY WHERE to be read IN ALL MEETINGS: This is THE WORD OF GOD. G. Fox.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

Upon which I went to their Meeting in <hi>Mildenhall, Nov.</hi> 22. 1691. and there accepted of their Challenge, and told them, <hi>I had a Charge to exhibit again≈øt them, if they would ingage to vindicate them≈øelves and their Principles. Tho.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29553:16"/>
and told them, <hi>That if they did not an≈øwer me according to their Propo≈øition, that I ≈øhould expo≈øe them (which I was loath to do for the ≈øake of ≈øome amongst them).</hi> But no an≈øwer could I get: After which I printed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when my Book came out, I went again to their Publick Meeting, and renewed my Charge on the 20th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1692. and offered then to prove it again≈øt them, where was pre≈øent <hi>Sam.

               <p>Behold the An≈øwer of the≈øe Twelve Elders, is contained in le≈øs than half a Page; and how far their plain Say-≈øo will prevail again≈øt plain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, unle≈øs with their own infatuated Di≈øciples, let the wi≈øe in heart judge? And in an≈øwer to this ≈øaid Certificate, I do thus ≈øay, That to my knowledge, I have not ≈øet down one Line nor Word as theirs, that is not theirs, nor yet rai≈øed one Argument upon theirs, but may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be drawn from the Premi≈øes; and if they think I have, I with the like number will upon rea≈øonable notice meet them at any place within twenty Miles or more of my dwelling, and produce both Book and Page, and if they can ≈øhew me wherein I have wronged them, I will make them publick Satisfaction, on condition that if what I have wrote as their Principles, be by me ≈øo proved, that then they will condemn what is apparently Erronious; and as this will be a fair opportunity for them (if they think them≈øelves wronged, as they pretend) to clear them≈øelves from my Accu≈øations as they call them; ≈øo will they have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to manife≈øt <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> to be both wicked and malicious; yea, and I will al≈øo ≈øub≈øcribe to this their Sentance, if I do not clear my ≈øelf, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove my Charge again≈øt them.

And I have no other rea≈øon thus to believe, but that I know fir≈øt, 'tis their way to make a large Prote≈øtation of their avowed Innocency, when Guilty; and that ≈øecondly, I know they cannot but be con≈øcious of great guilt in denying and out-facing ≈øuch manife≈øt Truths, as in that half Page they have done.

                  <p>Now that this is a Fundamental Errour, and tends to overthrow the Chri≈øtian Faith, I ≈øhall prove by the Te≈øtimony of the glorious <hi>Angels,</hi> holy <hi>Apo≈øtles,</hi> yea <hi>GOD</hi> him≈øelf, recorded in Sacred Writ.

                  <p>This <hi>John Whitehead</hi> a≈ø≈øerted to Mr. <hi>Grantham,</hi> as he told me, and ≈øince <hi>J. W.</hi> acknowledged it in the Book and Place cited: But to do <hi>J. W.</hi> ju≈øtice, I ought to give you his Explanation; for according to <hi>G. W.</hi>'s. Doctrine, it ought to be ≈øo, though he him≈øelf walks by a clean contrary Rule. Well, let us hear <hi>J. W</hi>'s. Explanation in <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>I di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh between Christ, and the Body of Christ.</hi> But how far this mends his matter, I leave wi≈øe Men to con≈øider; for if he mean by this di≈øtinction to ≈øeparate the <hi>Godhead</hi> from the <hi>Manhood;</hi> or <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer thus; That though <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as he was <hi>GOD,</hi> he was from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with the Father before the World began, and by whom the World was made; yet as <hi>HE</hi> was the promi≈øed Seed, ordained of <hi>GOD</hi> to be Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, and manife≈øt in due time, <hi>HE</hi> was born of a Woman, became Man for our ≈øakes, made like unto us in all things, ≈øin excepted, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ≈øays, and was mortal, and ≈øuffered death on the Cro≈øs, but rai≈øed by the mighty Power of <hi>GOD</hi> the third day, and ≈øaw no Corruption; but in the ≈øame Body <hi>HE</hi> ro≈øe He a≈øcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now ≈øits at the right hand of <hi>GOD</hi> in Maje≈øty on high, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate; to whom, with the Father and Holy Gho≈øt, be Prai≈øe and Glory for ever. Yet I take <hi>J. Whitehead</hi>'s di≈øtinction according to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, and the Analogy of their Faith, to run thus: As for <hi>HE</hi> that was born of the Virgin, who was ≈ømote with the Palms of their Hands, buffetted, ≈øpit upon, crowned with Thorns, run through with a Spear, hanged on a Tree, this was not the <hi>CHRIST,</hi> this was only a Vail, a Garment, was Mortal; and nothing, ≈øays <hi>J. W.</hi> that was Mortal was called <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi> not properly at lea≈øt in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Opinion: for, ≈øays he, I di≈øtingui≈øh between <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the Church, and the Light in them the <hi>Christ;</hi> this I take to be his meaning. And that it may appear ≈øo, I will produce a Text out of their own Scriptures, I mean out of <hi>Jo≈ø. Coals</hi> Works, <hi>p.</hi> 332. in an≈øwer to <hi>John Newman</hi> about the Body of Chri≈øt, he thus expre≈ø≈øes him≈øelf, <hi>viz.  If by the Body of Fle≈øh that</hi> Chri≈øt <hi>had, he means his Church, which the Apo≈øtle ≈øpeaks of, which was the Body of which</hi> Chri≈øt <hi>was Head, and they Members of, then I am one with him: for his having that Body after his A≈øcen≈øion, I never denied, nor intend to do:‚ÄîAnd ≈øuch a Body we own</hi> Chri≈øt <hi>had after his A≈øcen≈øion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then it appears plainly, that they deny <hi>HIM</hi> to be <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ≈øuffered death on the Cro≈øs, in that they ≈øay nothing which was Mortal was called <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> and they ≈øay, the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Garment we can never call <hi>Christ:</hi> And when <hi>J.

between Chri≈øt and his Body, it doth appear by <hi>J.

So that the Light in the <hi>Quakers</hi> is the one only <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>Quakers</hi> the Body of <hi>Christ:</hi> And no other <hi>Christ,</hi> nor Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> do I by their Doctrine find that they own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon do Charge them to deny <hi>CHRIST</hi> who was crucified, dead and buried, but is ri≈øen, and in the ≈øame Body a≈øcended, and in the ≈øame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ≈øits at the right Hand of <hi>GOD,</hi> never more to die, <hi>but ever liveth it make interce≈ø≈øion for us.</hi>

                  <p>Reader, here is Matter enough to write a Volume upon, but having treated largely upon ≈øome of them in my la≈øt, I ≈øhall only touch briefly upon ≈øome of the Heads, and ≈øo leave them to the Con≈øideration of the wide World. Fir≈øt, Their pretence that <hi>≈øuch as have the ≈øame Spirit which rai≈øed up Je≈øus, are equal with GOD,</hi> I mu≈øt ≈øay 'tis horrible Bla≈øphemy: yet it ought to be charged upon them, until they publickly condemn the Book, which hath little el≈øe in it but Bla≈øphemy, and fal≈øe Doctrine, and railing on the Publick Mini≈øtry. However it never was corrected by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata, as is u≈øual, and hath gone for a Go≈øpel Truth above forty years, and as their Principle, if they believe as they write; and therefore I charge it upon them, until they condemn the ≈øaid Book. And ≈øecondly their Impudence, in ≈øaying, that <hi>if we will own the Writings of the Prophets and Apo≈øtles, we mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily own their Books:</hi> this is of kin to the re≈øt, <hi>i. e.</hi> Bla≈øphemy. And thirdly, for them to ≈øay, <hi>If Chri≈øt,</hi> the Light in them, <hi>≈øay, I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE, why may He not ≈øpeak?</hi> I an≈øwer: If they can work the ≈øame Miracles He did, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many Prophets that foretold of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s coming out of the North, as I ≈øhall, that foretold of Chri≈øt's coming, then I ≈øhall believe them. Fourthly, What horrible Bla≈øphemy is it to ≈øay, <hi>'Tis dangerous to read the Scriptures;</hi> and to call them <hi>Du≈øt, Death, Carnal, Serpents-meat;</hi> as likewi≈øe the Ordinances of Chri≈øt, and the Communion of Saints, which Chri≈øtians ought to hold and believe as an Article of their Faith. And then fifthly, to call the Publick Mini≈øters <hi>Witches, Devils, Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> &amp;c. is very pernicious. Such Books ought to be burnt, as <hi>Jacob Baker,</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi> once confe≈øt he would burn it. And ≈øixthly, for them to hold that <hi>they, and they ONLY, are in the Truth,</hi> 'tis the perfect Phari≈øee. But for them to write that <hi>G. Fox was before Confu≈øion, or the many Languages were,</hi> is mon≈øtrous: Such Bla≈øphemies ought to be po≈øted. As likewi≈øe <hi>Ja. Parnell</hi> to ≈øay that <hi>he was before Arguments was; and was come to the end of all Arguments,</hi> is notorious. And ≈øeventhly, ≈øo is it in <hi>G. Fox</hi> to ≈øay that <hi>he ≈øtands covered,</hi> and <hi>neither he nor his name known in the world.</hi> O what ≈øhall I ≈øay! was there ever ≈øuch wickedne≈øs! And yet here is nothing ≈øo bad, nothing ≈øo wicked, nothing ≈øo fal≈øe, ≈øo Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, ≈øo Bla≈øphemous. But <hi>G.

               <p>Reader, this Branch of the Charge is more than ≈øufficiently proved al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: but by rea≈øon of ≈øome little Argument which pa≈ø≈øed between me and <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> and <hi>John Cade,</hi> two of their Preachers, at the Meeting, when I exhibited the ≈øaid Charge, <hi>Nov.</hi> 20. 1692. touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and that thereby their ≈øhuffling, equivocating, and evading may be the more manife≈øt; and particularly <hi>G.

                  <p>Come, <hi>Sam.

                  <p> Well, if you will not accept of the Charge, nor ≈øet a time when to argue the Point, I ≈øhall proceed to read the ≈øecond part of my Charge, which is your denial of the Scripture, by calling it <hi>Death, Du≈øt,</hi> and <hi>Serpents-meat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

more general Truths, transform them≈øelves into the likene≈øs of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of <hi>Chri≈øt:</hi> But as <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Ye ≈øhall know them by their Fruits;</hi> and to me they were fir≈øt di≈øcovered by their fruits, as by my Book <hi>De Chr.

And this being a general Truth, and a Duty upon all Chri≈øtians, and no le≈øs than the Publick Mini≈øtry does, yea, and ought to exhort too: But ≈øtill, when all this is done, and I am as obedient to the Light as I can, yet 'tis but my duty, I mu≈øt not, as they have taught, place Salvation there; I ≈øay, as by the Publick Mini≈øtry I am in≈øtructed to obey the Dictates of my Con≈øcience, to ab≈øtain from Evil, and follow that which is Good, according to the Rule of <hi>GODS</hi> Word revealed in the Scripture; yet as they teach, and I believe, I ought not to lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my own Obedience for Salvation, and as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, account it ≈øufficient: But with that worthy Martyr, Dr. <hi>Robert Barns,</hi> ≈øay, <hi>Acts and Mon.</hi> p. 610. <hi>I believe in the holy and ble≈ø≈øed Trinity, that created and made all the World: I believe that without Man's Will or Power Chri≈øt Je≈øus was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Holy Gho≈øt, and took Fle≈øh of the ble≈ø≈øed Virgin</hi> Mary<hi>, that HE ≈øuffered thir≈øt, hunger and cold,</hi> [which as he was God he could not do; mark that old Friends] <hi>and other Pa≈ø≈øions of our Bodies, ≈øin excepted, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ≈øaying of St.</hi> Peter<hi>: And I believe that this his Death and Pa≈ø≈øion was the ≈øufficient Ran≈øom for</hi> [my ≈øins, and] <hi>the ≈øins of the whole World; and I believe that through his death he overcame ≈øin, death, and hell, and that there is no other Satisfaction unto the Father, but his Death and Pa≈ø≈øion only; and that no Works of Man did de≈øerve any thing of GOD, but only Chri≈øt's Pa≈ø≈øion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Ju≈øtification: For I know</hi> [≈øaid this humble Martyr] <hi>that the best Works that ever I did is impure and imperfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And according to the Faith of this worthy Martyr the Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters teach, and I believe; not but that Dr. <hi>Barns</hi> was a good Man, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed circum≈øpectly, had great regard to the Dictates of his Con≈øcience, and the Guidance of the Light, ab≈øtained from that which was evil, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that which was good, and every way, as became a good Man, as compleatly as the mo≈øt perfect <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> notwith≈øtanding their high boa≈øting; yet you ≈øee he did not lean upon his own De≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, but upon the Death and Pa≈ø≈øion of <hi>Je≈øus Christ,</hi> even the Merits of <hi>HIS</hi> Death, who ≈øuffered thir≈øt, hunger, and cold; who was born of the

Virgin, and made like unto us, ≈øin excepted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor did he pretend to a ≈øinle≈øs Perfection, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> vainly boa≈øt of, but humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the be≈øt Works that ever he did was impure and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and this made him rely and lean wholly upon the Merits of another, even the Sacrifice of that Immaculate Lamb, <hi>Christ Je≈øus,</hi> his Death and bitter Pa≈ø≈øion, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> never preach up as nece≈ø≈øary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Search all their Epi≈øtles read in their Meetings, hear all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, if ever you hear ≈øuch a Pa≈ø≈øage as came from this humble Martyr, I will be your Bond ≈ølave.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I given an additional Proof that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are of a different Faith from the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and all true Chri≈øtian Churches <note n="*" place="margin">I do except <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Friends, as in <hi>New Rome unmasked,</hi> p. 69, 70, 71.</note>; and when I came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand the≈øe their Fundamental Errours, which was after I had wrote three or four Books again≈øt them, in reproof of their Hypocri≈øie, about outward Ceremonies, Church Government, their pretending to preach, write, ≈øuffer, and do all things freely; when alas, it was all but a cheat! they took Money, Gifts, and Reward for all; nay ≈øometimes, as in the In≈øtance of <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> 10 l. where they ≈øuffered not 10 d. See <hi>New Rome,</hi> p. 54. to 68. I ≈øay, after I had thus been bru≈øhing at the out≈øide or skirts of Religion for ≈øome years, it plea≈øed <hi>GOD</hi> in mercy to open my under≈øtanding, and to ≈øhew me by the Rule of Holy Writ, and through the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of His Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> great and Fundamental Errours, and then I could not be ≈øilent, (but that too, for the ≈øake of many among≈øt them, who have a Zeal, I bear them record, though not according to knowledge) but was con≈øtrained to unmask their blind <hi>Guides,</hi> who have cau≈øed them to err: And if in my Zeal again≈øt their pernicious ways I ≈øeem to exceed, they of all People may bear with me. And now to the Trial, now to the Examination, Who are the true Mini≈øters and the fal≈øe? who are the Worlds Teachers?

                  <p>The≈øe Doctrines I charge upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as deduceable from their printed Books and Epi≈øtles, and from which Errours they can never purge them≈øelves, but by unfeigned Repentance, and a publick Retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Condemnation of the ≈øame.

                  <p>And now let me proceed to ≈øtrengthen what I have ≈øaid in the Di≈øco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of your Errours, who are called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and not only ≈øo, but by many Scripture Proofs demon≈øtrate and ≈øet forth to you the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Chri≈øtian Faith,</hi> which may be a means (if you will peru≈øe what I have wrote for your In≈øtruction) to ≈øhew you your great mi≈øtake, and that in Fundamentals too; and to inform your Judgments, and to clear up your Under≈øtandings in the Principles of the Chri≈øtian Religion. And as I have taken great pains herein, and thought no labour too much; ≈øo I do a≈ø≈øure you, nothing would more comfort me, than to ≈øee you humble, and to come to a ≈øight of your Errours, and to u≈øe the means appointed of <hi>GOD</hi> for your Relief: And therefore follow the Example of the ble≈ø≈øed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who were in great Errours, and thought them≈øelves not too good, nor too high, nor to holy to acknowledge their Mi≈øtakes and confe≈øs their Errours, as in my la≈øt Book I have at large ≈øhewed, from the Example of Dr. <hi>Robert Barns,</hi> Bi≈øhop <hi>Latimer, Martin Luther,</hi> and others, who in humility made Confe≈ø≈øion of their Sins, of their Errours, and of their ignorant Zeal; and then magnified the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of <hi>GOD,</hi> in di≈øcovering to them his ≈øaving health. And why ≈øhould you be over confident? why ≈øhould not you examin the Scriptures? Come try a little, lay all prejudice a≈øide; though you may not believe me, whom your Teachers have prejudic'd you again≈øt, yet believe the Scriptures I have quoted, and let my Arguments have place among≈øt you, ≈øo far as they are bottomed on the Authority of the Scriptures, and no further, I intreat you. I know you have been told much about <hi>G. Fox,</hi> of <hi>his coming out of the North, of his being clothed with Righteou≈øne≈øs,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:29553:31"/>
                     <hi>Prophe≈øied of,</hi> &amp;c. but alas! this is without bottom. Indeed, after he came out of the North, I know that <hi>J. Coal, J. Audland, Fra. Howgill, Edw. Burrough, Sol. Eccles, Jo. Blaikling,</hi> and abundance more, call'd him <hi>the Great APOSTLE,</hi> ≈øome <hi>that true PROPHET, whom</hi> John <hi>≈øaid he was not:</hi> others <hi>the Branch, the Star, the Son of Righteou≈øne≈øs,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations, and that his Life reached through us to the I≈øles afar off; and that his <hi>BEING</hi> and <hi>HABITATION</hi> was in the <hi>POWER</hi> of the <hi>HIGHEST,</hi> in which he <hi>RULED</hi> and <hi>GOVERNED</hi> in <hi>RIGHTEOUSNESS;</hi> and that <hi>HIS KINGDOM</hi> was <hi>ESTABLISHED</hi> in Peace, and that of the <hi>INCREASE</hi> thereof there was <hi>NEVER</hi> to be an end. And although the≈øe Men gave witne≈øs to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> yet not as the Prophets gave witne≈øs to <hi>Chri≈øt;</hi> for the Prophets foretold of <hi>Chri≈øt</hi>'s coming, of his Death and Sufferings, of his Kingdom and Government, of his Rule and Dominion; I ≈øay, the≈øe things, nay all that <hi>CHRIST</hi> did and Suffered the Prophets foretold of. Be≈øides, 'tis plain by <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Doctrine, Example and Practice, how he interfered with <hi>Chri≈øt,</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice in many things; particularly in his Book ≈øtiled <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpel Liberty, &amp;c.</hi> p. 7. where he calls the <hi>LORD</hi>'s <hi>PRAYER, OUR FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, &amp;c. the Common-Prayer,</hi> or <hi>A Common-Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> Printed 1668. by which Expre≈ø≈øions, and his and the Preachers Example, the u≈øe of that Prayer hath been wholly laid a≈øide by them, though it be ≈øo clear that all may under≈øtand it, ≈øo ≈øhort that any may learn it, ≈øo full as to take in all our wants, and ≈øo exact as to ≈øhew us what we ≈øhould be, as well as what we ≈øhould ask: O what a re≈øemblance it bears to the <hi>Author</hi> thereof! who was the <hi>highe≈øt,</hi> and <hi>lowe≈øt,</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> and the <hi>least, GOD</hi> and Man, who knew be≈øt what form of Prayer ≈øuted his Di≈øciples, and all that obey their Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> But it teaches one thing which <hi>G. Fox</hi> never taught you, nor do your <hi>Leaders</hi> teach you, nor do you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it your ≈øelves, that is, this Confe≈ø≈øion following, <hi>FORGIVE US OUR SINS, AS WE FORGIVE THEM WHICH TRESPASS AGAINST US, &amp;c.</hi> this your <hi>Teachers</hi> do not do, this they do not teach you to do, and this I pre≈øume is the main Rea≈øon why your <hi>Leaders</hi> have laid a≈øide this mo≈øt excellent Form of Prayer taught us by <hi>Je≈øus Chri≈øt</hi> him≈øelf, who is the <hi>wonderful Coun≈øellor,</hi> and be≈øt knew what was fitte≈øt for us. Again, your <hi>Teachers</hi> have laid a≈øide, and you al≈øo by their Example, the Apo≈øtles Creed, <hi>I BELIEVE IN GOD, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the Rule of Faith, (as well as the Scripture) and ≈øaith, it was in≈øtituted by <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>De Prae≈øcr.</hi> l. 1. c. 13. It is al≈øo called the Rule of Faith by <hi>Origen.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Chri≈øt.</hi> And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients quote this Creed, as well as Scripture, to confute Hereticks, and ≈øeems to have given it the ≈øame honour, becau≈øe it is indeed the ≈øame thing, called therefore the <hi>Compendium</hi> of the Go≈øpel, and the Epitome of the Holy Scripture.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29553:32"/>
And all this I could prove to you, if you had the Scriptures in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteem you ought to have, and would abide the Deci≈øion thereof, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it to be a ≈øufficient Rule to ≈øquare your Actions by, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect to Religious Exerci≈øes, and the Affairs of Human Life.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth it more and more appear, that as <hi>G. Fox</hi> and his <hi>Preachers</hi> would ≈øeem to ju≈øtle <hi>CHRIST</hi> out of his Place, and rob Him of his Honour, ≈øo hath their Doctrine and Example overturned the Exerci≈øe of the≈øe two Chri≈øtian Duties, as well as other <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> in≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and by his <hi>Apo≈øtles;</hi> and thereby have they declared to all the World, that they differ in Faith and Practice from the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Chri≈øtians, Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in all Ages; and the Rea≈øon is plain; for if they do not believe in <hi>HIM</hi> that was born of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> who ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and ro≈øe again; nay, cannot call Him <hi>CHRIST,</hi> but <hi>A Vail, A Garment, A Ve≈ø≈øel, &amp;c.</hi> How ≈øhould they ≈øay this Creed, if they do not believe that he is ri≈øen? yea, and that the <hi>SAME JESUS</hi> is a≈øcended, and now ≈øits at the right hand of <hi>GOD</hi> in the <hi>SAME BODY</hi> in which he a≈øcended, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 2. how ≈øhould they ≈øay this Creed, if they do not believe the Re≈øurrection of the Body out of the Grave at the day of Judgment? How ≈øhould they ≈øay or teach others to ≈øay this Creed? And therefore I exhort you to read the Scriptures, and though your <hi>Teachers</hi> have told you that <hi>F. Bugg</hi> is a <hi>Bea≈øt,</hi> a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Wolf,</hi> an Enemy of all Righteou≈øne≈øs, a <hi>Child</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> yea a <hi>Devil Incarnate,</hi> &amp;c. What then? did not the unbelieving Jews call <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> a <hi>Devil,</hi> and have they not called the Publick Mini≈øtry, yea all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out re≈øtriction or limitation, <hi>Thieves, Robbers, Witches</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> &amp;c. what then? never regard that, but as I ≈øaid, read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and take my advice no farther than the Scripture warrants it, and ≈øo far my Soul for yours, you are ≈øafe; but if your <hi>Teachers</hi> have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ≈øuch an ill opinion of me, as that you will not take my advice, as they have again≈øt the Publick Mini≈øtry, that you will not hear them, yet I am per≈øwaded what I have wrote will be of ≈øervice to your Children, yea and your Childrens Children; and if ≈øo, why ≈øhould I not proceed to di≈øcover your Errours? that ≈øo the blind may not always lead the blind, but that you may become wi≈øer than your <hi>Teachers,</hi> and ≈øee for your ≈øelves; I am now ≈øpeaking to you the hearers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have a zeal, I bear you record, though not according to knowledge, and your <hi>Leaders</hi> have been in≈øtrumentally the cau≈øe of your Errours and Blindne≈øs: O con≈øider of what I ≈øay, and be con≈øiderate and cool!

And that I may not leave this without a Pre≈øident, for I love to keep to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, pray take a view of one of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Prayers in print, I mean that perfect Phari≈øee <hi>G.

               <p>And though this Prayer contains near five Pages, yet not one word of Confe≈ø≈øion of Sin; not a word of begging Pardon for Chri≈øt's ≈øake; but like the proud Phari≈øee, <hi>Thou ha≈øt endued me with righteous Judgment, with Under≈øtanding, with Zeal:</hi> He is not as other men.

It is a true ≈øaying, and worthy of all men to be imbraced, that Chri≈øt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus came into the World to ≈øave ≈øinners, of whom I am the chief <hi>and principal.

               <p>O the Chri≈øtian temper and heavenly frame of this worthy <hi>Martyr,</hi> worthy our Imitation: Fir≈øt, He acknowledged him≈øelf <hi>a mi≈øerable ≈øinner,</hi> and therefore the fitter Object for Mercy. Secondly, O how he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Confe≈ø≈øion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who not only acknowledged him≈øelf a ≈øinner, but the <hi>CHIEF</hi> of ≈øinners, that thereby he might magnifie the rich Mercy of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Chri≈øt Je≈øus:</hi> He was not like <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> who in his <hi>Mu≈øick Lecture,</hi> p. 22. ≈øaid, <hi>I do affirm, that if</hi> John (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle) <hi>had ≈øaid he had been a ≈øinner, he had lied.</hi> No, no, this Martyr did not account St. <hi>Paul</hi> a lier, though he would have had as much rea≈øon; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> came not behind the chiefe≈øt of the Apo≈øtles: Well, but this is not all; but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was thus humbled to make this Confe≈ø≈øion, and thus joyful at this worthy ≈øaying, that <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> came into the World to ≈øave ≈øuch penitent ≈øinners, ≈øo this worthy Martyr re≈øolved to make it a Rule in Divinity, ≈øaying, <hi>And therefore with all my WHOLE POWER I teach, that ALL MEN ≈øhould ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SINS,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <head>The Conolu≈øion by way of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>FRiends, Let me exhort you to beware of the Doctrine of the Phari≈øees, [I mean of the <hi>Quakers</hi>] which is Hypocri≈øie. I have read of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øies of the <hi>Gno≈øticks, Nicolaitans, Donati≈øts,</hi> and others, but none ≈øeem to me to be tho≈øe Chri≈øt foretold of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>which ≈øhould, if it were po≈ø≈øible, deceive the very Elect,</hi> ≈øo evidently as the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for how have they prevailed; how have they deceived high and low, noble and ignoble? and yet to me it ≈øeems ea≈øie to write a Hi≈øtory of their ri≈øe, growch, and progre≈øs, of their Church Government, and that <hi>MONSTER, Womens Meetings,</hi> how, when, and by whom, and by what Authority carried on; and how the Spirit of Per≈øecution hath been among≈øt them from the beginning; ≈øixty ≈øix in number of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Party again≈øt ≈øixty ≈øeven of <hi>John Stoy</hi> and <hi>John Wilkin≈øon</hi>'s Party, <hi>Quakers</hi> again≈øt <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> Councel again≈øt Councel, until <hi>Geo. Keith,</hi> one of their mo≈øt Learned Preachers, hath been con≈øtrained to te≈øtifie again≈øt their Errours, charging them with <hi>Damuable Here≈øies</hi> and <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> yea, even <hi>≈øuch as no Chri≈øtian Society would tolerate.</hi> And I knowing the≈øe things al≈øo cannot but warn all People to beware of their Glo≈ø≈øings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable Paintings.</p>
               <p>For they will direct you to the Light, bid you be obedient to it; tell you 'tis ≈øufficient to lead you to Salvation; that its teaching is above <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> above <hi>Churches,</hi> above <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Scriptures:</hi> but in all this they act but the part of a Juggler, 'tis only to decoy you over to them; they do not ≈øo think that thus advi≈øe and coun≈øel you; for if you refu≈øe Conformity to their Orders and Pre≈øcriptions, alledging the Light, to which they directed you, doth not lead you thereunto; pleading to be left to the Grace of <hi>GOD</hi> in thy ≈øelf; they that thus at fir≈øt directed you to this Light, will now tell you your Plea is <hi>Sordid, Ranteri≈øm, and pernitious to the Chri≈øtian Religion:</hi> See their Book, ≈øtiled, <hi>A brief Examination of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty Spiritual, &amp;c.</hi> p. 3, 11. For as it is fal≈øe Doctrine to teach that the Light, being obeyed, is ≈øufficient to lead to Salvation; for then your Obedience is meritorious, and <hi>Chri≈øt</hi> died in vain; ≈øo do they not believe it ≈øufficient by their rejecting your <hi>Plea:</hi> wherefore be impartial in your ≈øearch, take the Apo≈øtles advice, <hi>Prove all things, ≈øearch the Scriptures, and hold fast that which is good. A wi≈øe man,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Solomon, will ≈øearch out a matter.</hi> And what is of more concern than the Chri≈øtian Religion. God of his mercy confound all Errours, and manife≈øt all Impo≈øtors and Deceivers, and give the Victory to his Truth, and Glory to his Name.</p>
