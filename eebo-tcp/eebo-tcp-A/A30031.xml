            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>There are two things put me upon this Preface: Firſt, <hi>Geo. Whitehead</hi> and his Abettors's Inveterate Malice, calling me and others Old can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker'd Apoſtates, Vile Apoſtates, Self-condemn'd Apoſtates, Unruly Beaſts, Betraying <hi>Judaſſes,</hi> Wolves, Dogs, Enemies of all Righteouſneſs, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil, Devils Incarnate, Heathens, Atheiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Indeed their Books are ſo very Malicious and Defamatory, as well as their private Whiſperings and Backbitings, that ſome even of themſelves have been conſtrained to give me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Hands a Teſtimony in Writing againſt the unchriſtian Treatment which I have met withal; namely, <hi>T. Bird, J. Ellington, J. Maſon, W. Belſham,</hi> and above Twenty more Quakers belonging to <hi>Mildenhall</hi>-Meeting: And yet not worſe Language than they have given the Publick Miniſtry; as Witches, Devils, Gormandizing Prieſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as anon will appear. And whoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers their Errors, and diſplays them in their proper Colours, muſt expect to meet with ſomething of this kind: And that being fore-ſeen, have doubtleſs been taken for a tolerable Excuſe by abler Pens from ſtooping to ſuch an Undertaking as this: And thereupon I may the more rationally expect the more favourable Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for what might have been done better by the Learned; 'tis enough to me to be thought worthy in this great Work (of diſcovering the greateſt Hereſie that ever ſprang up in our Age) to be as the Carpenter's Man, whoſe Work is to hew off the rough and knotty pieces of the Timber, to make it more ready for better Workmen.</p>
            <p>To be Contentious I grant is an Offence the Scriptures condemn with no little keenneſs, whilſt it exhorts to contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints. From whence I conceive, that though I contend againſt Quakeriſm with ſome Symptoms of Zeal, I am not therefore Contentious; nor though I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, yea, write againſt ſome Errors I formerly held, and upon Conviction have forſaken: I am not therefore a Self-condemned Apoſtate, as <hi>G. W.</hi> dreams. If you think me too ſmart in ſome paſſages againſt Perſons, 'tis againſt their Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; if againſt their Opinions, I have from their own Books proved them Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and Blaſphemous, which ought to be reproved ſharply: And that their Opinions are ſo, I have never refuſed to make Proof of to their faces, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition when proved they would engage a Retractation; nay, ſometimes without any ſuch Engagement. <hi>See Quakeriſm Anatomized, p. 2.</hi> I cannot call Gall and Poyſon by ſweet and lovely Names, I muſt alter my Style according to the Matter and Occaſion, or elſe all will be out of Tune, and no more Harmony than Harp and Harrow. Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> and other Reformers, they wrote ſmartly
<pb facs="tcp:29553:3"/>
againſt the Papiſts, and most exquiſitely diſplayed their Errors; and yet they proteſted they were in Charity, and deſired nothing more than that they would have hearkened to them, and forſaken their Errors. And I do ſay, nothing would pleaſe me better, than to ſee this People Condemn what is Erroneous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and perſevere in the Truth, and the Knowledge of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, True God, and Perfect Man in One Perſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But if any Object in favour of them, That though they do not Preach Chriſt without (unleſs ſince <hi>G. K.</hi> came over) as he is in Heaven above, nor believe him to be diſtinct from his Saints; nor Pray in the Name of Jeſus to God the Father, thereby owning him in his Mediator-ſhip; nor make Confeſſion of Sin to God in Prayer, nor beg Pardon for the ſame: But look at Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the Light within, his Crucifixion within, his Interceſſion within; nor a Bible to be ſeen in their Meetings, for they are above ſuch Carnal things. Yet they have among them many good Exhortations, and they own Chriſt to be the Word of God, the Power of God, the Wiſdom of God; will not this do? Suppoſing they mean all to be within, yea, Heaven and Hell, all within, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Inſomuch that if the Quakers do not come to this Reſult, to own the ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, that was born of the Virgin, ſmote with Palms of their Hands, Crucified, Dead, Buried, Roſe again, and in the ſight of the <hi>Galileans</hi> aſcended into Heaven, and publickly Condemn their Books, which Teach the contrary, they cannot deſerve the Name Chriſtian, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not unſenſible what little Arts they have uſed to blaſt my Reputation, that thereby they may obſtruct the Service of my Books, but their Expectation hath failed them. Then they Indicted me in <hi>London</hi> for Printing without Licenſe, yet they do the ſame. But they ſay, I put up a Mock-Pillory; I grant I did, and that to ſhew what they actually deſerved upon their own Propoſals to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Did not they erect the Form and Figure of a Child's Penny horning Battle-door for the Biſhops, Clergy, and Gentry to Learn the Engliſh of <hi>Tu</hi> and <hi>Vos?</hi> Signed by <hi>G. Fox,</hi> a Shoe-maker, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Was not this as great an Affront to them as mine could be to the Twelve Quakers? <hi>See Quakeriſm Withering,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p. 61.</hi> But how did they beſtir themſelves to Perſecute me? How did they run up and down to great Perſons, both on Foot, and by Coach, and all to Suppreſs me? And had they had a Jury of Quakers, I had been Caſt, but the Jury brought in the Bill <hi>Ignoramus, &amp;c.</hi> to the great Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Honourable Court. Thus did they begin here, as the Quakers did in <hi>Penſilyania,</hi> who Perſecuted <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Friends for their Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:29553:3"/>
Teſtimony, notwithſtanding their Pretences that the Lord hath laid it upon them not to go to Law, nor avenge themſelves, and that the diſpoſition of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not to ſeck Revenge; for (ſay they) ſuch as do are in the Fall, <hi>&amp;c. See an Account from the Children of Light, p. 19.</hi> And <hi>Smith</hi>'s <hi>Primmer,</hi> p. 79. Yet theſe Pretences are like the reſt of their Sophiſtry, for had they Power, few ſhould exceed them in Perſecution and Cruelty. For methinks I hear them ſay, Come, let us ſay, He is a Peſtilent Fellow, a mover of Sedition, we muſt uſe all the Arts we have to ſtop him; for he ſeems to follow the ſteps of <hi>M. Luther,</hi> that Apoſtate Adverſary of our dear Elder Siſter. And if he goes on, he will ſo unvail us, that all People will know us and our Intrigues: Come, let us beſpatter him, and cover him with ſome frightful Beaſt's Skin, and then ſet our little Curs to bait and worry him, to abuſe and beſpatter him in City and Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This I have found true, which leads me to the Second thing propoſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>THERE is ſcarce any Sect of People, how erronious ſoever they be, but they have ſome Advocates, and ſuch too as oftentimes may give juſt occaſion for an Apology for writing againſt their Errors; and more eſpecially when they make ſuch fair Pretences to the Chriſtian Religion, as the Quakers of late have done, in divers of their Books, particularly that entituled, <hi>The Harmony of the Old and New Teſtament;</hi> wherein the Author prefixeth a twofold Preface, the one to the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> the other to the <hi>Jews,</hi> premiſing two things, <hi>1ſt,</hi> To wipe off ſuch Aſperſions as have been caſt upon them, as denying <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> and the Divine Authority of the Scriptures. Now, how far their Book will anſwer this End, unleſs they make an Ingenuous Retractation of their Errors, this Treatiſe may ſhew. <hi>2dly, I have not</hi> (ſays this Author) <hi>tranſcribed the whole of all thoſe Verſes, which ſometimes is cited, but only ſo much as I conceive doth more immediately relate to,</hi> &amp;c. Very well: If then he contract the Scripture, and take what he conceives neceſſary to the Point in hand, I hope I ſhall have the ſame Liberty, and not liable to Cenſure for the ſame thing; a Fault the Quakers are too much guilty of. And becauſe I would be as conciſe as may be, I ſhall recite their Books, which are generally of two ſorts, of two Stamps, and carry two contrary Faces, contrary Doctrines, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Principles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in two Columns, that as in a Glaſs their Hearers, if they will but read, may behold the depth of Hypocriſie, which lye couch'd in their Leaders: Doctrines not only liable to deceive them, but the whole World, who take them to mean as they ſay; which makes me believe them to be the very Deceivers Chriſt foretold of <hi>Matt.</hi> 24 24. for though they come forth pretending to convert the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their Proofs that <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> is the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yet when the <hi>Jews</hi> come to know (as that they may by reading their Books, eſpecially their
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29553:6"/>
               <hi>Alcoran,</hi> namely, <hi>George Fox</hi>'s <hi>Journal</hi>) that they pretend to Miracles, to ſinleſs Perfection, to Infallibility of Judgment, and contempt of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, bringing their own Pamphlets in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition therewith. This, I ſay, will tend to harden them in their Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity; for <hi>ROME,</hi> their elder Siſter, pretends to Miracles, Perfection and Infallibility equal with them, if not beyond them; for they ſeem to vve with <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth</hi> and his Diſciples, and <hi>G. Fox</hi> and his Diſciples follow their Steps in a great meaſure, as the ſaid Journal and other of their Books will ſet forth. And though the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will confeſs to the miraculous Conception and Birth of <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth,</hi> yet, as Hiſtory ſaith, St. <hi>Kentegernes</hi>'s Mother beg'd of Jeſus that ſhe might imitate his Virgin Mother in the Conception and Birth of a Child. Accordingly, in a little time, ſhe finds her ſelf with Child, but often proteſted ſhe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew Man <note n="*" place="margin">A little like M. <hi>Fox,</hi> the Story you may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have hereafter more at large.</note>. And ſoon after St. <hi>Kentegerne</hi> was feign'd to be born. The <hi>Papiſts</hi> grant, That <hi>Jeſus</hi> faſted Forty days; 'tis ſaid St. <hi>Patrick</hi> did the like; and St. <hi>Ardan</hi> is ſaid to have faſted Fifty days. They grant, that Jeſus fed Five thouſand Perſons with Five Loaves and Two ſmall Fiſhes: St. <hi>Patrick</hi> is ſaid to have fed Fourteen thouſand with one Cow, two Stags, and two wild Boars, and that the next day the Cow was alive again. They grant, that Jeſus turned Water into Wine, but they pretend to turn Wine into Blood, and Bread into Fleſh, after a few words of Conſecration. They grant, that Jeſus, and his Diſciples in his Name, healed all manner of Diſeaſes. 'Tis ſaid, that St. <hi>David</hi> invited St. <hi>Kined</hi> to come to his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod; St. <hi>Kined</hi> excuſed himſelf, becauſe he was crooked and lame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon St. <hi>David</hi> prays him ſtreight and ſound. They grant, that Jeſus, and his Diſciples in his Name, caſt out Devils: 'Tis ſaid, that a Woman was diſpoſſeſt of ſeven Devils at <hi>Lauretto,</hi> by calling on the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for Help. They grant, that Jeſus raiſed the Dead: 'Tis ſaid St. <hi>Francis</hi> makes one dye, and afterwards raiſed him up, and reſtored him to Life again. I have read the like of St. <hi>David,</hi> St. <hi>Patrick,</hi> St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> St. <hi>Benno,</hi> and others. And the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in their Book ſtiled <hi>A Reply to the Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, &amp;c.</hi> ſay <hi>p.</hi> 14 <hi>Viſible Miracles have been done amongst Us, in the ſight of the World, &amp;c.</hi> The like Pretences are in their Epiſtle ſtiled <hi>This is only to go amongſt Friends,</hi> as anon will appear: See alſo <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>Journal,</hi> p. 307. <hi>And had a large Meeting at a Conſtable's Houſe, on whom the Lord had wrought a great Miracle,</hi> &amp;c. But mark, Reader, here is not the Name of this Conſtable, nor the Town where he dwelt, nor yet what Miracle it was, whether diſpoſſeſſed of a Devil; lame, and made to walk; dead, and raiſed again to life; deaf, and made to hear; blind, and made to ſee; no, nothing that may induce us to believe it: Beſide,

it is pretended to be wrought in 1666. and expoſed to publick view in Print 1694. which ſhews it to be a fabulous Story, and can only tend to harden the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially if they read the <hi>Quakers</hi> Golden Calf or Legend of Stories, <hi>viz. G. Fox</hi>'s <hi>Journal.</hi> And now I proceed to ſhew the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books to be of two ſorts, inſomuch, that 'tis hard to know what a <hi>Quaker</hi> is by his Writing; and yet forſooth all their Writings are pretended to be wrote by the ſpecial Motion of the Eternal Spirit, and are the Products of Infallibility; which is one main Reaſon they cannot retract any Error, how groſs and notorious ſoever.</p>

And that it may appear <hi>G. W. &amp;c.</hi> transform themſelves into every ſhape, behold their Books, ſee how they contradict each other, yet they'll juſtifie or excuſe all, condemn none. I have not taken a Paſſage or two only, but I have traced them in their moſt approved Authors. You ſee they call him that was born of the Virgin a <hi>Veſſel,</hi> a <hi>Garment,</hi> and ſay, they can never call him Chriſt, and that the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> belong to every Member in the Body as well as to Chriſt the Head; That his Diſciples loved his Perſon for the ſake of the Spirit which dwelt in him, or elſe what was his Perſon to them, more than another Perſon? O horrible Contempt! yea, ſuch as preach Chriſt without, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven above, are falſe Miniſters, Devils, and Reprobates, which make a talk of Chriſt without. God's Chriſt is not <hi>diſtinct</hi> from the Saints, ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> yea, the ſame Chriſt that was crucified and roſe again, is within them, and not <hi>diſtinct</hi> from them. G. <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſay, the Seed the Light is Chriſt, <hi>which cannot be that Body,</hi> becauſe not in any Man. In ſhort, they have acquitted the <hi>Jews</hi> and diſcharged <hi>Judas,</hi> and freed <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> of the horrible Crime of putting to death the Lord of Life and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry what they can; for as he was God he could not dye, neither could they ſpit upon him, ſcourge him, hang him on a Tree: but him that they call a <hi>Veſſel,</hi> a <hi>Garment,</hi> a <hi>Man,</hi> a <hi>Perſon,</hi> him they ſlew and hanged on a Tree. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 36. <hi>Know aſſuredly, that the ſame Jeſus whom ye cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and hanged on a tree, hath God made both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> Then not <hi>finite,</hi> but a ſufficient ſatisfactory Sacrifice for the Sins of the whole World. Thus have you made the Apoſtles falſe Witneſſes, who have charged the Jews with ſlaying the Lord of Life and Glory. As to the Sufferings of Chriſt, the Queſtion ſtill remains unanſwered: I know you now ſee cauſe to ſay his Sufferings were grievous Sufferings, ſweating drops of Blood, yea, great Sufferings. Thus far G. <hi>W.</hi> is got; but <hi>George,</hi> you know there is degrees of Greatneſs, there is <hi>magnus, major, maximus, great, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and <hi>greateſt</hi> of all.

find G. <hi>W.</hi> pinched, and in a great ſtrait, and knows not which way to wind him: Condemn <hi>Ed.

Can he err? No, they cannot give Evidence againſt themſelves, ſo not fit to be of a Jury, not fit for any place of Truſt in Government, not fit to have yea and nay paſs for an Oath. If ſo, then if the Jury be moſt Quakers, they'l never give it againſt themſelves: they are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial, they cannot be impartial, they are the greateſt reſpecters of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons this day on Earth. <hi>E. B.</hi> has ſaid, <q>The Sufferings of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is greater than the Sufferings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles:</q> which is horrid blaſphemous, yea, they thereby undervalue the Sufferings of the Lord of Glory, and exalt their own as greater Sufferings: This they cannot deny, nor this they cannot condemn; ſee the Fruit of Infallibility: having once ſpoken, whether true or falſe, a Lye or a true Story, both muſt be infallible, they cannot retract, they cannot confeſs their Sins to God, how then ſhould they retract, and acknowledge their Errors? No, not for a World: then down goes Infallibility, the principal Studd of their new kind of Popery.</p>

them before all the Books extant in the World?

               <p>Secondly, Do you think he values and prefers the Scriptures before all Books extant in the World?

But as for what <hi>G.

Yea, <hi>G.

They ſay 'tis Blaſphemy to call the Scriptures the Word of God; and that 'tis the Devil that ſo pleads: Yet they ſay of their own Epiſtles, <hi>This is the Word of God;</hi> judge which they preferr.

               <head>Some of the Principles of <hi>G. Keith</hi> and his Friends.</head>
               <p>1. That Bodily Sickneſs and Death came in by the Fall. 2. That Chriſt has now in Heaven a Soul and a Body, that is not the Godhead, but the Temple of it, and moſt gloriouſly united therewith. 3. That Chriſt's Body, that was crucified and buried without us, roſe again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and is now in Heaven without us. 4. That the Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus will come again in that Body without us, to judge the <hi>Quick</hi> and the <hi>Dead.</hi> 5. That there ſhall be a general day of Judgment, that all the deceaſed Saints are in expectation of. 6. That we get not the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Body, either in this mortal Life, or immediately after Death. 7. That Faith in the Man Chriſt without us, as he died for us, roſe again, and is gone into Heaven, wrought in us by the Spirit of Chriſt, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally neceſſary to make Men true Chriſtians, and Children of God, born of the Free Woman, who have the Spirit of Adoption, crying <hi>Abba Father.</hi> 8. That Chriſt's Obedience and Righteouſneſs, which he performed in himſelf, without us, is imputed to us by Faith, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins. 9. That Chriſt is not only God's Elect, but all that ſhall be ſaved from the beginning to the end of the World, are God's Elect, being choſen in him (not only before they believe and repent, but) before the Foundation of the World. 10. That all and every one of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Chriſt (who are at age, and can ſpeak) ought to confeſs with their Mouths, in the hearing of ſome of their Fellow Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the Fundamental Principles of their Chriſtian Faith, before they can be own'd to be Members of the Church, that by the ſame, as well as by a Good Life and Converſation it may be known who are qualified to be Members of our Church: which is Aboundary Terms and Bond of our Union, the Spirit being the Principal: which may be eaſily done by <hi>Anſwering</hi> to ſome plain <hi>Queſtions.</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not give it as the <hi>only</hi> Evidence, but as a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; yet if you did in good earneſt believe the Doctrines and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſt in the Goſpel to be bleſſed and holy, as you pretend, you would read the Scripture, and prefer the Bible before any other Book extant in the World; you would read the Scriptures in your Meetings, if any Book at all: and if you recommend any Book to your Friends beyond Sea, it would be the Scripture. But ſince you do nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but inſtead thereof read and recommend your own Epiſtles, and that, as you ſay, for the ſpreading of Truth, this is a Demonſtration that you do not believe the Doctrine and Precepts of the Bible to be bleſſed and holy; and an infallible Evidence, that you prefer your own Books, Papers, and Epiſtles before the Scriptures, unleſs you be arrant Cheats indeed, to read and recommend that which you know is worſt, and hide and keep from them that which is beſt: which I can hardly think.</p>

Bingly,</hi> and others, printed at the end of their Sermons, nay, all your Books extant in the World, and he will not find this paſſage, <hi>Forgive us our Sins, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us:</hi> No, nor yet after that manner; for though you muſt needs know that you are Sinners, as well as others, and have tranſgreſſed the Laws of God in both Tables <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Cage, p.</hi> 50.</note>, yet you can neither make Confeſſion of Sin to God, nor beg Pardon for Chriſt's ſake: which not only ſhew, that you do not Pray after the Manner, but that you do not pray in the Name of Chriſt to God the Father, as the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Interceſſor between GOD and Man: which is an infallible Proof, that as you therein differ from the Faith and Practice of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Saints and Martyrs, yea, all Proteſtant Churches to this day, ſo you do not believe the Doctrine and Precepts of the Bible to be bleſſed and holy, which teach Men ſo to do: which is one Reaſon. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In that you warn, charge, and command your Diſciples to read and cauſe to be read in your Meetings, not only in <hi>England,</hi> but beyond Sea, your own Papers, Epiſtles, and Books, whilſt you not only lay aſide the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29553:13"/>
as uſeleſs, but declare to all the World, they are Death, Duſt, and Serpents-meat, Beaſtly Ware, and that ſuch as preach out of it are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, <hi>Notable Conjurers. Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe you ſay it's Blaſphemy to call the Scriptures the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and yet allow your own Books that Title, giving forth, That what is ſpoken from the Spirit of Truth in <hi>any,</hi> is of as great Authority as the Scriptures and Chapters are, and <hi>greater,</hi> queſtioning whether <hi>Moſes</hi> be the firſt Pen-man thereof. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A fourth Reaſon is, becauſe you deny the Ordinances of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which the Scriptures teach, ſaying, <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptiſing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>this do in remembrance of me,</hi> &amp;c. Which the Apoſtles, Primitive Chriſtians, and Martyrs practiſed, who had the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as much as you, and witneſſed Chriſt's ſecond Coming as much as you. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Your laying aſide the uſe of the Lord's Prayer, both in Manner and Form, as aforeſaid. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Your laying aſide the uſe of the Ten Commandments. <hi>Seventhly,</hi> And the Apoſtle's Creed. <hi>Eighthly,</hi> If you queſtion, whether <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt Pen-man of Sacred Writ, and what the Prophets ſpake true or falſe; you, I ſay, cannot believe what you queſtion. <hi>Ninthly,</hi> You teach, that ſuch as preach Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and bid People believe in him, as he is in Heaven above, are falſe Miniſters: but the Scripture tells you, That <hi>Chriſt is riſen,</hi> and ſits in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, at the Right Hand of God in Heaven above. And, <hi>Tenthly,</hi> Becauſe you rob Chriſt of his Divine Attributes, and put them upon your <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied George Fox,</hi> calling him the Branch, the Star, the Son of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See your Epiſtle <hi>This is only to go amongſt Friends</hi> largely recited in this Introduction, <hi>p.</hi> 5, 6. which notwithſtanding <hi>G. W</hi>'s Denial is plainly proved to mean <hi>G. Fox;</hi> yet to ſtrengthen the ſaid Proof, ſee  <hi>J. Whitehead</hi>'s ſmall Treat. <hi>p.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>After theſe things, in the year 1648. God, who had compaſſion on his People, did cauſe a Branch to ſpring forth of the Root of <hi>David,</hi> which was filled with Virtue, for the Covenant of Life and Peace was with him, and he ſpread and ſhot forth many Branches, which did partake of the fatneſs of the Root; and the weary came to reſt under his Branches: In him alſo was the word of Reconciliation, which turned the Hearts of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and the Diſobedient to the Wiſdom of the Juſt.—And in the year 1655. I being a Branch of this Tree,</hi> (<hi>meaning</hi> G. Fox) <hi>the life of its Root cauſed me to bloſſom, and bring forth Fruit, for the Spirit of the Lord came upon me,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay, <hi>G. F</hi>'s ſaying that he riſe out of the North, was propheſied of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the recited Epiſtle ſaying, <hi>O thou North of</hi> England, <hi>who art reckoned barren,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>J. Whitehead</hi> ſetting the date of the riſing of this Branch and Star, 1648. and that in 1655. he alſo becoming a Branch of this Tree, 'tis manifeſt, that what I ſaid in <hi>New Rome unm.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p,</hi> 79, to 87. was not without warrantable ground, as by the coherence of their Doctrine doth manifeſtly appear. And ſince your Books thus interfere, let us prove,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29553:13"/>
whether they be ſincere, or which ſhall we take to be their Judgment in good earneſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That they are not ſincere I have already given ten Reaſons, but that I may renew your memory, I will add one more, <hi>viz.</hi> In all their Meetings for Worſhip of <hi>GOD</hi> they never read one Chapter of the Bible, nor one of the Epiſtles of the Apoſtles, for this thirty years; but 'tis fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent with them to read their own Epiſtles, as herein I ſhall further ſhew; only one inſtance for the preſent I may recite to confirm you in the truth of their practice, and by which you may meaſure great part of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, <hi>viz. Several Papers given forth for the ſpreading the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. p. 60, 61, 62. <hi>Friends, to you all this is the Word of the LORD, take heed of judging one another</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">(No, take heed of that; Judge all the World firſt, and call them all the Names you can invent.)</note>
                  <hi>: To you all this is the Word of the LORD, to ſpread over all: I charge you in the preſence of the LORD GOD to ſend this (Epiſtle) amongſt ALL FRIENDS AND BRETHREN EVERY WHERE to be read IN ALL MEETINGS: This is THE WORD OF GOD. G. Fox.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Pray obſerve firſt the deſign of ſending their Books up and down, it is <hi>TO SPREAD TRUTH;</hi> and this might be done as well by recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the reading of the Scriptures, or ſome Portion thereof, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they do believe the Doctrine and Precepts contained therein be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and bleſſed; unleſs they will ſay, their Books have a greater meaſure of holineſs then the Scriptures, which in the beſt ſence they muſt believe, unleſs they cheat the World moſt abominably, to ſend them that which they know to be worſe, or leaſt for their profiting.</p>
               <p>Secondly, You may obſerve what a Charge is given, <hi>viz. I charge you in the PRESENCE of the LORD GOD to ſend this Epiſtle amongſt all Friends</hi> what to do, namely, for a Publick Liturgy or Form of Divine Service, <hi>viz. To be read in ALL MEETINGS.</hi> Well, what Authority had <hi>G. F.</hi> to impoſe this upon the poor People, namely, <hi>This is THE WORD OF GOD.</hi> Now if they do believe the Doctrine and Precepts contained in the Bible to be holy and bleſſed, why do they not charge their People to read ſome part of the Scriptures for their Inſtruction; but alas! they have diſputed againſt the <hi>Scripture</hi> being <hi>the Word of GOD;</hi> but now you ſee they ſtile their own Nonſence to be <hi>THE WORD OF GOD,</hi> and charge their poor ignorant People as ſuch, to receive it, and as ſuch, to read it, and as ſuch to ſend it up and down into all the Countries, and all Places; and who dare gainſay the mighty Power of <hi>G. Fox</hi>? <hi>Who</hi> (as <hi>Ioſ. Coal</hi> ſays) <hi>hath his habitation in the power of the Higheſt, who rules and governs in righteouſneſs, and his Kingdom is eſtabliſhed in peace, and the increaſe thereof
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29553:14"/>
is without end:</hi> and to this <hi>W. Penn</hi> ſays <hi>well done,</hi> or <hi>very well,</hi> in his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of this Idolatrous Letter of <hi>J. C.</hi> to <hi>G.

               </p>
               <p>Now therefore the beſt method that I know of, to try whether there be any ſincerity in theſe cunning Sophiſters, <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>IS</hi> to take <hi>William Penn</hi>'s method with the Papiſts, who after he had ſhewed their pretence to one thing, when they were really for another, firſt ſaid, W.

P.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whoever obſerves theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> turnings and windings in all their Juglings and Ledjerdemain, will find they tread the ſame Path, tho' in another manner; for who will, or can pretend more plainly to own the Precepts and Doctrine of the Bible to be holy and bleſſed; and yet in other Books ſay 'tis <hi>duſt</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> the <hi>Serpents Meat,</hi> and that to preach out of them is <hi>Conjuration,</hi> and that the Miniſter of the <hi>Letter</hi> is the Miniſter of Death, and that 'tis dangerous to read the Scriptures, and ſo in moſt things they look two ways, <hi>JANUS</hi> like, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that for <hi>W. Penn</hi>'s four Inſtances of the Papiſts Hypocriſie, I could eaſily give you forty of theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> two-fac'd Practices, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one way and rowing another: in ſhort, ſee <hi>W. P.</hi>'s. Method, and if you would underſtand theſe <hi>Quakers</hi> aright, uſe it, <hi>viz. p.</hi> 35. <hi>To conclude,</hi> (ſays <hi>W. Penn</hi>) <hi>if we would not receive a Thief until he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, let the Papiſts firſt Recant his volumous Errours, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo ſay I, let the <hi>Quakers</hi> firſt condemn their Errours, and theſe their Books, which contain them, and manifeſt their ſincerity touching the Precepts
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29553:14"/>
and Doctrines of the Scriptures, <hi>SO</hi> as to recommend the reading ſome Portion thereof in lieu of their own Epiſtles; I ſay let them firſt Recant what is really erronious, ſecondly, condemn the Books, thirdly, make a a ſolemn profeſſion of ſome certain and neceſſary Articles of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, and then, and not whilſt then, they ought to be reputed as Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As to what <hi>G. W.</hi> offers in his <hi>Charitable Eſſay,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 2, 3. in your Vindication about you Creed cited by me in <hi>New Rome,</hi> &amp;c. rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms what I ſay, then otherwiſe, as will more fully appear by comparing the ſame with what followeth in this Diſcourſe; as well as ſhew <hi>G. W</hi>'s. twelve Aſſiſtants their great Errour and Miſtake: And in anſwer to them, and their blind, falſe, and implicite Certificate, I do affirm that what I have quoted as the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I will prove theirs, and what I now quote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Title of <hi>ERROURS</hi> and <hi>CONSEQUENCES,</hi> and in other places, are the <hi>Quakers</hi> own Books and Writings, neither do I wrong them: And if the twelve will ingage under their Hands, either to prove what they can juſtifie by Scripture, and condemn under their Hands what they by Scripture cannot juſtifie; I will take the like number and meet them on a Months notice at <hi>Biſhop Stafford,</hi> which is more than half way, and by the Teſtimony of Scripture let the matter be decided; and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe this, for ſhame complain no more of being wronged, neither let your Drudge <hi>G. W.</hi> as in his <hi>Just Inquiry, &amp;c.</hi> p. 14. ſays as he doth, <hi>viz. THE LIBELLER HAS SHAMEFULLY MISREPRESENTED US:</hi> as is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual with you and all Hereticks to complain of being wronged and miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As for inſtance:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Tell the Papiſts of worſhipping Images, praying to Saints, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, that they believe their own Traditions (or Epiſtles) as firmly as they do the Bible, that they believe Tranſubſtantiation, Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as drawn up by <hi>Pius</hi> the Fourth, according to the Decrees and Canons of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> and the <hi>CONSEQUENCES</hi> of theſe their erronious Principles, and they will tell you they are <hi>MISREPRESENTED.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Tell the <hi>Arians</hi> that they are Enemies to the Divinity of Chriſt, they will tell you they are <hi>MISREPRESENTED;</hi> for ſay they all that we contend for, is only for ſuch a moment of time, as may make good the Relation of a Father and a Son.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tell the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> that they made two Perſons in Chriſt, and they will tell you they are <hi>MISREPRESENTED;</hi> for all they deſigned was to avoid the Blaſphemy, in calling the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of God.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Tell the <hi>Eutychians</hi> their Errour in ſaying there was but one Nature in Chriſt, and they will tell you they are <hi>MISREPRESENTED;</hi> for (ſay they) we do not mean thereby to deſtroy the Properties of the Humane Nature, but only to aſſert that its Subſtance was ſwallowed up by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:29553:15"/>
And therefore in all Complaints of this Nature, it is neceſſary to come to particulars, and to examin with care and diligence the matter complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, and then to give Judgment in the Caſe; and therefore I cannot be thought to miſrepreſent you, nor wrong you, if I charge you with Particulars, and thoſe Particulars too taken and fairly quoted, not out of ſuch Books as have been wrote againſt you, (which yet might be true e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) but out of your own approved Books wrote by your moſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Writers ſolemnly profeſſing to all the World I would not wrong you, nor miſrepreſent you, nor, to my knowledge, have I done it; if you think I have, I have given you a fair opportunity to make it appear, if you will meet me on the Condition aforeſaid; and if you can ſhew me wherein I have, I further ingage to do you Juſtice by a Publick Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And by theſe Meaſures I have proceeded from firſt to laſt, and by the help of <hi>GOD</hi> I am reſolved ſo to continue as long as I have to do with you. But one thing by the way I would have you take notice of, and that is this, If it were enough to be Accuſed, then none would be Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; ſo on the other hand none would be guilty, if it were enough to complain of being miſrepreſented.</p>

                  <hi>EDw. Burrough</hi> long ſince put forth a Challenge in the Name of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> that they would gladly be manifeſt to all the World; and in order to it, and to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from ſome Imputations caſt upon them, they propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to meet and Diſpute with any, whether Prieſts or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of any Perſwaſion, yea, or any one of them, at any Place, and at any Time, and for what Number they pleaſed, as by me recited in my laſt <hi>New Rome unmasked, &amp;c.</hi> p. 2. Upon which I went to their Meeting in <hi>Mildenhall, Nov.</hi> 22. 1691. and there accepted of their Challenge, and told them, <hi>I had a Charge to exhibit againſt them, if they would ingage to vindicate themſelves and their Principles. Tho. Brew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi> then preſent, <hi>bad them Anſwer me with ſilence.</hi> So then I read the Charge to them, conſiſting of ten or twelve Errours, as in <hi>New Rome, &amp;c.</hi> p. 3, 4, 5. and left a Copy of the ſaid Charge with them,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:29553:16"/>
and told them, <hi>That if they did not anſwer me according to their Propoſition, that I ſhould expoſe them (which I was loath to do for the ſake of ſome amongst them).</hi> But no anſwer could I get: After which I printed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when my Book came out, I went again to their Publick Meeting, and renewed my Charge on the 20th of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1692. and offered then to prove it againſt them, where was preſent <hi>Sam. Cater</hi> and <hi>John Cade,</hi> two of their Preachers: But ſtill they refuſed to debate the matter with me, or to argue the Point fully. <hi>I told them I did not come to diſturb them; but if they would ſet a time, either <hi>S. C.</hi> and my ſelf ſingly, or let him take two, four, ſix, or ten, and I would take the like number, and we would appoint a convenient time and place.</hi> This they refuſed, and to this day have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined any ſuch method, though propoſed by them in print; and now at laſt I have received a ſingle ſheet, ſtiled, <hi>A Charitable Eſſay, &amp;c.</hi> which neither they, nor I can call an Anſwer; only in <hi>p.</hi> 8. Twelve of the <hi>Duakers</hi> ſums up in groſs four Particulars by way of Certificate, and at the end thus concludes; <hi>viz. Whereupon we do in the holy fear of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, and in behalf of the ſaid People, declare and teſtifie, That all theſe and all other his</hi> (F. Bs.) <hi>Accuſations of the ſame kind, or depending thereupon, are utterly falſe, wicked, and malicious, and never ſo believed, ſo ſaid, nor ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by us as charged againſt us, but contrary to our Perſwaſion, Principle, and Profeſſion, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold the Anſwer of theſe Twelve Elders, is contained in leſs than half a Page; and how far their plain Say-ſo will prevail againſt plain Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, unleſs with their own infatuated Diſciples, let the wiſe in heart judge? And in anſwer to this ſaid Certificate, I do thus ſay, That to my knowledge, I have not ſet down one Line nor Word as theirs, that is not theirs, nor yet raiſed one Argument upon theirs, but may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be drawn from the Premiſes; and if they think I have, I with the like number will upon reaſonable notice meet them at any place within twenty Miles or more of my dwelling, and produce both Book and Page, and if they can ſhew me wherein I have wronged them, I will make them publick Satisfaction, on condition that if what I have wrote as their Principles, be by me ſo proved, that then they will condemn what is apparently Erronious; and as this will be a fair opportunity for them (if they think themſelves wronged, as they pretend) to clear themſelves from my Accuſations as they call them; ſo will they have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to manifeſt <hi>Francis Bugg</hi> to be both wicked and malicious; yea, and I will alſo ſubſcribe to this their Sentance, if I do not clear my ſelf, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove my Charge againſt them. But, as a ſign that they do not think nor believe themſelves ſo wronged, as they pretend, although I do not pretend to their Art of Propheſying, yet I do, and dare paſs my word that they will never meet me, and ſubſcribe the Condition afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.

And I have no other reaſon thus to believe, but that I know firſt, 'tis their way to make a large Proteſtation of their avowed Innocency, when Guilty; and that ſecondly, I know they cannot but be conſcious of great guilt in denying and out-facing ſuch manifeſt Truths, as in that half Page they have done. As to <hi>G.

However, ſince they would not accept of the ſaid Challenge; nor yet meet me according to my frequent Propoſals, nor anſwer my Book, but come only out with a ſingle ſheet, and tell their People, this is an Anſwer to <hi>F.

it doth not take notice of the twentieth part thereof: I ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to prove upon them what I have Charged them with, and that out of their own approved Books, and Arguments deduceable from them.

                  <p>By which 'tis plain that they deny <hi>HIM</hi> that was born of the Virgin to be <hi>CHRIST;</hi> for though they ſeem to own ſomething which appeared in the Body, as by the ſequel of the matter you will perceive, yet 'tis plain, and ſelf-evident, that they call <hi>HIM</hi> that was born of the Virgin, that ſuffered Death on the Croſs, who was ſmote with the Palms of their Hands, ſpit upon, buffetted, and run through with a Spear, died, was buried, roſe again the third day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but a <hi>Garment,</hi> a <hi>Vail,</hi> a <hi>Figure, &amp;c.</hi> For ſay the <hi>Quakers, There was plainly HE, and the Body in which HE came; there was plainly the outward Garment and the inward Life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And

this we declare to all Mankind we can never call this Body; this Garment that was thus ſubject to be ſmote, to be buffetted, to be periſhed, to be crucified, &amp;c.

                  <p>Now that this is a Fundamental Errour, and tends to overthrow the Chriſtian Faith, I ſhall prove by the Teſtimony of the glorious <hi>Angels,</hi> holy <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> yea <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf, recorded in Sacred Writ.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:29553:18"/>
for us ſinners, who believe and hope for Salvation through his Merits, Death, and bitter Paſſion, and the imputation of his Righteouſneſs, who was foretold by the Prophets, and in due time was manifeſt. And this is <hi>HE</hi> that <hi>Iſrael</hi> by Faith drank of, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> teſtified of, whoſe hands handled, and eyes ſaw; and we by Faith do now behold, and by <hi>HIS Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Comforter,</hi> whom <hi>HE</hi> promiſed to ſend, are inabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And this I further teſtifie, That from <hi>Adam</hi> to the days of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> there never was a Man ſaved but by Faith in this <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> or Son of <hi>GOD,</hi> nor ſince to this day, nor will be to the end of the World, but by this <hi>SAME JESUS</hi> who was thus born, who ſuffered death, who thus roſe again and viſibly aſcended; for ſo ſay the Scriptures: <hi>There is not another Name given under Heaven by which men ſhall be ſaved, but by the Name of JESUS:</hi> even as St. <hi>Peter</hi> often, and very emphatically illuſtrates, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This <hi>SAME JESUS.</hi> And this Jeſus the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not call <hi>CHRIST;</hi> for though I grant this was <hi>H.

                  <p>This <hi>John Whitehead</hi> aſſerted to Mr. <hi>Grantham,</hi> as he told me, and ſince <hi>J. W.</hi> acknowledged it in the Book and Place cited: But to do <hi>J. W.</hi> juſtice, I ought to give you his Explanation; for according to <hi>G. W.</hi>'s. Doctrine, it ought to be ſo, though he himſelf walks by a clean contrary Rule. Well, let us hear <hi>J. W</hi>'s. Explanation in <hi>p.</hi> 39. <hi>I diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between Christ, and the Body of Christ.</hi> But how far this mends his matter, I leave wiſe Men to conſider; for if he mean by this diſtinction to ſeparate the <hi>Godhead</hi> from the <hi>Manhood;</hi> or <hi>Humanity</hi> of <hi>CHRIST,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thus; That though <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as he was <hi>GOD,</hi> he was from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and with the Father before the World began, and by whom the World was made; yet as <hi>HE</hi> was the promiſed Seed, ordained of <hi>GOD</hi> to be Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, and manifeſt in due time, <hi>HE</hi> was born of a Woman, became Man for our ſakes, made like unto us in all things, ſin excepted, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, and was mortal, and ſuffered death on the Croſs, but raiſed by the mighty Power of <hi>GOD</hi> the third day, and ſaw no Corruption; but in the ſame Body <hi>HE</hi> roſe He aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and now ſits at the right hand of <hi>GOD</hi> in Majeſty on high, as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate; to whom, with the Father and Holy Ghoſt, be Praiſe and Glory for ever. Yet I take <hi>J. Whitehead</hi>'s diſtinction according to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Doctrine, and the Analogy of their Faith, to run thus: As for <hi>HE</hi> that was born of the Virgin, who was ſmote with the Palms of their Hands, buffetted, ſpit upon, crowned with Thorns, run through with a Spear, hanged on a Tree, this was not the <hi>CHRIST,</hi> this was only a Vail, a Garment, was Mortal; and nothing, ſays <hi>J. W.</hi> that was Mortal was called <hi>Chriſt;</hi> not properly at leaſt in the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Opinion: for, ſays he, I diſtinguiſh between <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Body of <hi>Christ,</hi> which is the Church, and the Light in them the <hi>Christ;</hi> this I take to be his meaning. And that it may appear ſo, I will produce a Text out of their own Scriptures, I mean out of <hi>Joſ. Coals</hi> Works, <hi>p.</hi> 332. in anſwer to <hi>John Newman</hi> about the Body of Chriſt, he thus expreſſes himſelf, <hi>viz.  If by the Body of Fleſh that</hi> Chriſt <hi>had, he means his Church, which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, which was the Body of which</hi> Chriſt <hi>was Head, and they Members of, then I am one with him: for his having that Body after his Aſcenſion, I never denied, nor intend to do:—And ſuch a Body we own</hi> Chriſt <hi>had after his Aſcenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus then it appears plainly, that they deny <hi>HIM</hi> to be <hi>Chriſt</hi> who was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſuffered death on the Croſs, in that they ſay nothing which was Mortal was called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and they ſay, the bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Garment we can never call <hi>Christ:</hi> And when <hi>J.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29553:20"/>
between Chriſt and his Body, it doth appear by <hi>J.

                  <p>Reader, pray obſerve; Firſt they diſtinguiſh between <hi>Christ</hi> and the Garment he wore, meaning his Body, (which ſuffered on the Croſs) which bodily Garment they cannot call <hi>Christ.</hi> 2. They teach that the Names <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Christ,</hi> do not ſo properly belong to <hi>HIM</hi> that was born of the Virgin, ſuffered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to ſomething in the Body, the Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which they ſay is in themſelves. 3. And that the Light in them is the ſame <hi>Christ</hi> which ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 4. That the Body of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is like ours, of <hi>AN EARTHLY PERISHING NATURE.</hi> 5. That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which was Mortal was called Chriſt; and conſequently not <hi>HE</hi> that was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> who ſuffered on the Croſs as an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifice. 6. That <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath no other Body but His Church ſince his Aſcenſion, proved out of their own Books, which they ſay are given forth by the Eternal Spirit. So that the <hi>Light</hi> in the <hi>Quakers</hi> is all the <hi>Chriſt</hi> they own; and they being (in their own e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem) Believers, and conſequently the Church, Chriſt hath no other Body, ſo the <hi>Quakers</hi> are all and all. 7. That the Fleſh of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is but a <hi>Figure.</hi> Thus have they, what in them lye, overturned the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity: for <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo far from being a <hi>Figure,</hi> that all <hi>Figures</hi> and <hi>Types</hi> ended in Him, and <hi>HE</hi> the Subſtance of them all, as I ſhall ſhew by the Propheſies of the Holy Prophets in two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns.</p>

rather than to trace him in his crooked Path, I ſhall chooſe to make it appear that the Fruits, Effects, and Conſequences of theſe and the like Errours are very dangerous, in hopes, that as it will tend to ſtrengthen my Charge of their not owning <hi>CHRIST,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>Reader, Here are ſome of the Conſequences of their erronious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in denying the <hi>LORD</hi> that bought them; for after they had er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning the Faith, and made ſhipwrack of a good Conſcience, and denied <hi>Chriſt,</hi> how ſoon did they contemn the Scriptures, profane his Ordinances, revile his Miniſters: with deſign, no doubt, as by the ſequel we may perceive, to exalt their own Horn. I could not well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſome few of their dreadful Names given to the Publick Miniſtry in general, as elſewhere I have obſerved: But before I ſum them up, let me add a few more of their Conſequences, and a little obſerve what good Names and Divine Attributes they gave to each other; for as none ever came near them for railing and reviling, ſtigmatizing and abuſing their Oppoſers, as if Hell was broke looſe; ſo never did any People exceed them in magnifying each other, exalting one another to the Sky: nay, had they ſtudied many years, they could have ſcarce found out worſe words for their Oppoſers, (and better, and finer; and dilicater words, high praiſes, and magnifying expreſſions for themſelves) and even ſo they have done by the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> calling them <hi>Duſt, Death, Carnal, Husk, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents meat,</hi> and the like contemptuous Names; whilſt they have invented moſt excellent Names for their own Nonſenſical Pamphlets and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Books, fit to corrupt a Nation, and deſtroy a Country; as <hi>THE WORD OF THE LORD, A MESSAGE FROM THE MIGHTY GOD, THE WORD OF GOD, A LIVING TESTIMONY,</hi> and a hundred other ſuch like Titles they give to their confuſed Nonſence to take the eyes and ears of the weak and unſtable.</p>

                  <p>Reader, here is Matter enough to write a Volume upon, but having treated largely upon ſome of them in my laſt, I ſhall only touch briefly upon ſome of the Heads, and ſo leave them to the Conſideration of the wide World. Firſt, Their pretence that <hi>ſuch as have the ſame Spirit which raiſed up Jeſus, are equal with GOD,</hi> I muſt ſay 'tis horrible Blaſphemy: yet it ought to be charged upon them, until they publickly condemn the Book, which hath little elſe in it but Blaſphemy, and falſe Doctrine, and railing on the Publick Miniſtry. However it never was corrected by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata, as is uſual, and hath gone for a Goſpel Truth above forty years, and as their Principle, if they believe as they write; and therefore I charge it upon them, until they condemn the ſaid Book. And ſecondly their Impudence, in ſaying, that <hi>if we will own the Writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, we muſt neceſſarily own their Books:</hi> this is of kin to the reſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> Blaſphemy. And thirdly, for them to ſay, <hi>If Chriſt,</hi> the Light in them, <hi>ſay, I AM THE WAY, THE TRUTH, AND THE LIFE, why may He not ſpeak?</hi> I anſwer: If they can work the ſame Miracles He did, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as many Prophets that foretold of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s coming out of the North, as I ſhall, that foretold of Chriſt's coming, then I ſhall believe them. Fourthly, What horrible Blaſphemy is it to ſay, <hi>'Tis dangerous to read the Scriptures;</hi> and to call them <hi>Duſt, Death, Carnal, Serpents-meat;</hi> as likewiſe the Ordinances of Chriſt, and the Communion of Saints, which Chriſtians ought to hold and believe as an Article of their Faith. And then fifthly, to call the Publick Miniſters <hi>Witches, Devils, Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers,</hi> &amp;c. is very pernicious. Such Books ought to be burnt, as <hi>Jacob Baker,</hi> a <hi>Quaker,</hi> once confeſt he would burn it. And ſixthly, for them to hold that <hi>they, and they ONLY, are in the Truth,</hi> 'tis the perfect Phariſee. But for them to write that <hi>G. Fox was before Confuſion, or the many Languages were,</hi> is monſtrous: Such Blaſphemies ought to be poſted. As likewiſe <hi>Ja. Parnell</hi> to ſay that <hi>he was before Arguments was; and was come to the end of all Arguments,</hi> is notorious. And ſeventhly, ſo is it in <hi>G. Fox</hi> to ſay that <hi>he ſtands covered,</hi> and <hi>neither he nor his name known in the world.</hi> O what ſhall I ſay! was there ever ſuch wickedneſs! And yet here is nothing ſo bad, nothing ſo wicked, nothing ſo falſe, ſo Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, ſo Blaſphemous. But <hi>G. W.</hi> can ſalve it, he can vindicate or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it; nay, more then ſo, he can procure twelve Witneſſes to ſay, <hi>We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

are perjured Perſons in the eye of the Law, and deſerve to be Pillored. And thereupon I charge them with Perjury, with falſe-witneſ bearing, until they by publick retraction repent, and give Satisfaction. For as you will ſpare none, neither Ox nor Aſs, old nor Young, no more will I; I will not ſpare, nor my eye ſhall not pity Friend or Foe, which comes up with falſe Evidence, yea ſo falſe, as if they ſhould ſay black is white, and white is black. I muſt ſay, that as <hi>T. G.</hi> hath no need to depend on <hi>G. W.</hi> and that he muſt know, that <hi>G. W.</hi> hath as little love for him, as for ſome he hath wrote againſt, yet I am ſorry to ſee his Name there. As for the others, many of them have their dependency on the <hi>Chair;</hi> and <hi>G. W</hi> being therein, I marvel not at them, provided their Teſtimony had been true; but I am ſure it is notorious falſe; nay, and that they themſelves know it to be falſe, I will give the World a <hi>SIGN,</hi> which is this; If they know and be conſcious to themſelves that their Evidence is falſe, they will not come forth, according to my Propoſition in this Book made, to meet me; but if they be not conſcious to themſelves of falſe Evidence, [how falſe ſoever it is] they will come forth to clear themſelves, and be glad I give them the opportunity; and by this <hi>SIGN</hi> they ſhall be proved.</p>
                  <p>Come on you twelve Maſter-Builders, can you read theſe ſixteen In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and not bluſh, (when you behold your Certificate) and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the firſt, third, fifth, and eleventh; as alſo the firſt, ſecond, and third Errours: I ſay, can you read the Paſſages taken out of your own Books, wrote by your moſt eminent Preachers, and yet affirm you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaid ſo, wrote ſo, believed ſo, nor taught ſo, and not bluſh? and be horribly aſhamed?

And can you ſubmit your Necks, your Intereſts, and all to ſuch a <hi>Make-bate,</hi> ſuch a continual <hi>contentious Scribler,</hi> who in nine Months wrote three Books againſt me; and ſince I wrote my laſt, hath wrote three more againſt me and others. Are you not ſenſible what pretences he makes in his Books to <hi>Charity,</hi> to <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> to <hi>Sincerity,</hi> and yet void of all? Have you not taken notice of his late little Book (about the great Diviſions amongſt the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Penſilvania)</hi> intituled, <hi>The Chriſtian Doctrine and Society of the Quakers,</hi> &amp;c. wherein he carries two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in one Hood, hold with the Hare and run with the Hound, as the Proverb is; writes againſt writing; that's his main deſign: And if wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting be a fault, who more guilty than <hi>G.

               <p>Thus, Reader, I have given a few Inſtances of their way and manner of ſending their Epiſtles to be read in their Meetings, both in <hi>England, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Mariland,</hi> and were it needful, I could give you a hundred more; which ſhews that they give their own Writings the preferrence, as well as that they lay aſide the uſe of the Scriptures in their Meetings; and no marvel if the Scriptures be <hi>Death, Duſt, Carnal, Serpents meat,</hi> and if it be Conjuration to preach out of them, and if the Miniſters of the Scriptures be Miniſters of Death, and if it be dangerous to read them; as were they (as by the <hi>Quakers</hi> eſteemed) <hi>Duſt, Death, Serpents-meat,</hi> it were ſurely dangerous to read them; for who would feed upon <hi>Dust,</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Serpents-meat;</hi> this could no way nouriſh nor ſtrengthen, but corrupt, poiſon, and putrifie the Minds of ſuch as are moſt exerciſed in reading them; and that ſo it is, in their Judgment: For if it were wholeſome to read them, and that they believed <hi>them to be given forth by Divine Inſpiration,</hi> as they to the Parliament have pretended, to ſerve a Turn, why do they not read the Scriptures, or ſometimes a Chapter, or ſometimes one of the Apoſtles Epiſtles in their Meetings? as that they do not, nor never did; nay, I challenge all the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever their Miniſters recommended ſo much as one Chapter to be read in any of their Meetings for Worſhip theſe forty years, much leſs charged them in the preſence of the <hi>LORD GOD</hi> to read ſuch a Chapter, or ſuch an Epiſtle, as wrote either by the <hi>Prophets</hi> or <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> And if they cannot, let it be a <hi>Sign</hi> for ever that they deny the Scriptures, firſt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thrown on them, and next by their practice of laying them aſide, and reading their own Epiſtles; and let it reſt upon Record, as a witneſs againſt their deep Hypocriſies, and let it be a Teſtimony againſt the falſe Pretences and Perjury of the twelve falſe Witneſſes.

               <p>Now had the Chriſtian People of <hi>England</hi> been as tame as the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> they had an opportunity put into their hands, to have had a new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, a new Religion, a new Goſpel, yea, and a new ſort of Maniſters too, ſuch as they are; yea, all new; new Meeting-houſes, as fine as ſome Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: For if this Epiſtle, which was ſent to be read <hi>IN ALL STEEPLE-HOUSES,</hi> and elſewhere, yea, <hi>TO GO THROUGH THE WORLD,</hi> had taken place, we ſhould have had all things turned upſide down: A new Chriſt too, and a new Scripture too; not one made of <hi>Duſt, Death, Serpents-meat,</hi> but one given forth by infallible <hi>G. Fox,</hi> who as he ſaid himſelf, <hi>(News coming up out of the North, &amp;c.</hi> p. 1.) was <hi>Written from the Mouth of the Lord, from one who is naked, and ſtands naked before the Lord, clothed with Righteouſneſs, whoſe Name is not known in the World, riſen up out of the North, which was propheſied of, but now it is fulfilled.</hi> And p. 20. <hi>Clap your hands and be glad, for the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>will reign, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be taken from you pretended</hi> Rulers, Judges, <hi>and</hi> Juſtices, Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers <hi>and</hi> Conſtables; <hi>all this Tree muſt be cut down, and Jeſus Chriſt will rule alone.</hi> I ſay, had this ſuper-excellent Epiſtle of <hi>G.

Fox,</hi> no not ſo much as an outward Judge, and outward Juſtice, an outward Lawyer, or an outward Conſtable; all things ſhould have been new: And why not? if <hi>G.

Witneſs a Letter from <hi>Barbadoes</hi> to him by one of their ableſt Miniſters, namely <hi>Ioſiah Coal,</hi> and which they juſtified; ſee <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> p. 44, 45, 46. viz. <hi>Dear</hi> G.

more general Truths, transform themſelves into the likeneſs of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But as <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their Fruits;</hi> and to me they were firſt diſcovered by their fruits, as by my Book <hi>De Chr. Libertate,</hi> &amp;c. and that intituled, <hi>The painted Harlot ſtript and whipt,</hi> &amp;c. does appear: And ſecondly by their falſe Doctrine and pernitious Principles, as by my Book, <hi>New Rome unmasked,</hi> &amp;c. alſo appears: For in my young years I was carried away by their diſſimulation, and being long trained up and educated in their way, and they often, as a Decoy, exhorted us <hi>to obey the Light and Spirit of GOD in our own hearts, and to obſerve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of our Conſciences; to abſtain from evil, and purſue what was good, and to follow the leadings and guidance of the Light within, which was ſufficient to lead to Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. And this being a general Truth, and a Duty upon all Chriſtians, and no leſs than the Publick Miniſtry does, yea, and ought to exhort too: But ſtill, when all this is done, and I am as obedient to the Light as I can, yet 'tis but my duty, I muſt not, as they have taught, place Salvation there; I ſay, as by the Publick Miniſtry I am inſtructed to obey the Dictates of my Conſcience, to abſtain from Evil, and follow that which is Good, according to the Rule of <hi>GODS</hi> Word revealed in the Scripture; yet as they teach, and I believe, I ought not to lean up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my own Obedience for Salvation, and as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do, account it ſufficient: But with that worthy Martyr, Dr. <hi>Robert Barns,</hi> ſay, <hi>Acts and Mon.</hi> p. 610. <hi>I believe in the holy and bleſſed Trinity, that created and made all the World: I believe that without Man's Will or Power Chriſt Jeſus was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Holy Ghoſt, and took Fleſh of the bleſſed Virgin</hi> Mary<hi>, that HE ſuffered thirſt, hunger and cold,</hi> [which as he was God he could not do; mark that old Friends] <hi>and other Paſſions of our Bodies, ſin excepted, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſaying of St.</hi> Peter<hi>: And I believe that this his Death and Paſſion was the ſufficient Ranſom for</hi> [my ſins, and] <hi>the ſins of the whole World; and I believe that through his death he overcame ſin, death, and hell, and that there is no other Satisfaction unto the Father, but his Death and Paſſion only; and that no Works of Man did deſerve any thing of GOD, but only Chriſt's Paſſion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Juſtification: For I know</hi> [ſaid this humble Martyr] <hi>that the best Works that ever I did is impure and imperfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And according to the Faith of this worthy Martyr the Publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters teach, and I believe; not but that Dr. <hi>Barns</hi> was a good Man, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed circumſpectly, had great regard to the Dictates of his Conſcience, and the Guidance of the Light, abſtained from that which was evil, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that which was good, and every way, as became a good Man, as compleatly as the moſt perfect <hi>Quaker</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> notwithſtanding their high boaſting; yet you ſee he did not lean upon his own Deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, but upon the Death and Paſſion of <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> even the Merits of <hi>HIS</hi> Death, who ſuffered thirſt, hunger, and cold; who was born of the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:29553:28"/>
Virgin, and made like unto us, ſin excepted, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor did he pretend to a ſinleſs Perfection, as the <hi>Quakers</hi> vainly boaſt of, but humbly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that the beſt Works that ever he did was impure and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and this made him rely and lean wholly upon the Merits of another, even the Sacrifice of that Immaculate Lamb, <hi>Christ Jeſus,</hi> his Death and bitter Paſſion, which the <hi>Quakers</hi> never preach up as neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. Search all their Epiſtles read in their Meetings, hear all their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, if ever you hear ſuch a Paſſage as came from this humble Martyr, I will be your Bond ſlave.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I given an additional Proof that the <hi>Quakers</hi> are of a different Faith from the <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and all true Chriſtian Churches <note n="*" place="margin">I do except <hi>G.

Cater,</hi> 10 l. where they ſuffered not 10 d. See <hi>New Rome,</hi> p. 54. to 68. I ſay, after I had thus been bruſhing at the outſide or skirts of Religion for ſome years, it pleaſed <hi>GOD</hi> in mercy to open my underſtanding, and to ſhew me by the Rule of Holy Writ, and through the Aſſiſtance of His Holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Quakers</hi> great and Fundamental Errours, and then I could not be ſilent, (but that too, for the ſake of many amongſt them, who have a Zeal, I bear them record, though not according to knowledge) but was conſtrained to unmask their blind <hi>Guides,</hi> who have cauſed them to err: And if in my Zeal againſt their pernicious ways I ſeem to exceed, they of all People may bear with me. And now to the Trial, now to the Examination, Who are the true Miniſters and the falſe? who are the Worlds Teachers?

                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> who teach that he that hath the ſame Spirit which raiſed up Jeſus Chriſt, is equal with <hi>GOD;</hi> and which Spirit they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to have, and by it give forth their Epiſtles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore of the World, great Deceivers, and horrible Blaſphemers.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>Quakers,</hi> who teach that <hi>Joſiah Coal,</hi> being dead, is <hi>AS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CENDED,</hi> and that <hi>IN Edw.

                  <p n="8">8.

The <hi>Quakers,</hi> who teach that they have a Spirit beyond all the Fore-fathers, and thereby know not only who are Saints, who are De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and who are Apoſtates; but alſo that none need to give them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning or judgment in any Caſe, or on any Occaſion, but that at <hi>ALL TIMES</hi> they are furniſhed both with Diſcerning and Judgment, are of the World, Deceivers, Deluders, and Impoſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe Doctrines I charge upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as deduceable from their printed Books and Epiſtles, and from which Errours they can never purge themſelves, but by unfeigned Repentance, and a publick Retracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Condemnation of the ſame. And 'tis to be feared their Pride is ſo great, and that they are ſo fixed upon their Principle of Infallibility and Perfection, that they cannot, but will rather ſtrive to cover and gloſs over things. However, I preſume I have given a fair Deſcription of the Worlds Teachers: and now let me tell you who are the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
                  <p n="16">16.

                  <p>But <hi>E. B.</hi> ſays, <hi>p.</hi> 233.—<hi>I do believe there was never ſuch a Generation of Teachers as theſe</hi> [i. e. Prieſts] <hi>are; that ever took ſuch wicked courſes; to their ſhame</hi> (ſays <hi>E. B.</hi>) <hi>do I rehearſe it.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is very uncharitable, as well as falſe in Fact: and it looks the worſe, in that 'tis rehearſed by ſuch a Generation of Teachers as are amongſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who exceed all that ever went before them, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtianity, the Papiſts <hi>ONLY</hi> excepted, both in Idolatry, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, and Superſtition, yea, and other groſs Enormities, of which I could give a large Liſt: a few for Example ſake I ſhall mention, as in the <hi>Cage,</hi> where I have laid Superſtition and Immorality together, heaps

As firſt, for any kindneſs, you will not ſay, <hi>I thank you,</hi> but which is tantamount, <hi>I accept of thy love.</hi> You will not put the Hat off, but nod, bow, or conjue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> crying out againſt fine Clothes, dainty Diſhes, lofty Horſes, Coaches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> until you could get them; yea the <hi>Woe</hi> (ſaid you) was to ſuch as ſo did: But now who exceed you in fine Clothes, [except a little Lace or Ribbons, which for croſneſs ſake you forbear] dainty Diſhes, lofty Horſes, goodly Houſes, brave Coaches, fine Perriwigs, and what not? nay, even both Miniſters and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: witneſs <hi>London, Briſtol, Stoak, Erith, Northampton,</hi> and many other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

Nay further, as a Fruit of your Doctrine, that the Name <hi>JESUS</hi> and <hi>CHRIST</hi> do as properly belong to your Believers, as to <hi>HIM</hi> that ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> you do give the Name of <hi>Emmauel</hi> and <hi>Allalujah</hi> to your Children: As to <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> it was by the Prophet foretold to belong to <hi>CHRIST</hi>; Iſai. 7. 14. <hi>Behold, a Virgin ſhall conceive and bear a Son, and ſhall call his Name EMMANUEL</hi>; <hi>which, being interpreted, is GOD with us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> Cap. 1. verſ. 23.

                  <p>And now let me proceed to ſtrengthen what I have ſaid in the Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of your Errours, who are called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and not only ſo, but by many Scripture Proofs demonſtrate and ſet forth to you the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> which may be a means (if you will peruſe what I have wrote for your Inſtruction) to ſhew you your great miſtake, and that in Fundamentals too; and to inform your Judgments, and to clear up your Underſtandings in the Principles of the Chriſtian Religion. And as I have taken great pains herein, and thought no labour too much; ſo I do aſſure you, nothing would more comfort me, than to ſee you humble, and to come to a ſight of your Errours, and to uſe the means appointed of <hi>GOD</hi> for your Relief: And therefore follow the Example of the bleſſed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> who were in great Errours, and thought themſelves not too good, nor too high, nor to holy to acknowledge their Miſtakes and confeſs their Errours, as in my laſt Book I have at large ſhewed, from the Example of Dr. <hi>Robert Barns,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Latimer, Martin Luther,</hi> and others, who in humility made Confeſſion of their Sins, of their Errours, and of their ignorant Zeal; and then magnified the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>GOD,</hi> in diſcovering to them his ſaving health. And why ſhould you be over confident? why ſhould not you examin the Scriptures? Come try a little, lay all prejudice aſide; though you may not believe me, whom your Teachers have prejudic'd you againſt, yet believe the Scriptures I have quoted, and let my Arguments have place amongſt you, ſo far as they are bottomed on the Authority of the Scriptures, and no further, I intreat you. I know you have been told much about <hi>G. Fox,</hi> of <hi>his coming out of the North, of his being clothed with Righteouſneſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:29553:31"/>
                     <hi>Propheſied of,</hi> &amp;c. but alas! this is without bottom. Indeed, after he came out of the North, I know that <hi>J. Coal, J. Audland, Fra. Howgill, Edw. Burrough, Sol. Eccles, Jo. Blaikling,</hi> and abundance more, call'd him <hi>the Great APOSTLE,</hi> ſome <hi>that true PROPHET, whom</hi> John <hi>ſaid he was not:</hi> others <hi>the Branch, the Star, the Son of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many Nations, and that his Life reached through us to the Iſles afar off; and that his <hi>BEING</hi> and <hi>HABITATION</hi> was in the <hi>POWER</hi> of the <hi>HIGHEST,</hi> in which he <hi>RULED</hi> and <hi>GOVERNED</hi> in <hi>RIGHTEOUSNESS;</hi> and that <hi>HIS KINGDOM</hi> was <hi>ESTABLISHED</hi> in Peace, and that of the <hi>INCREASE</hi> thereof there was <hi>NEVER</hi> to be an end. And although theſe Men gave witneſs to <hi>G. Fox,</hi> yet not as the Prophets gave witneſs to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for the Prophets foretold of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s coming, of his Death and Sufferings, of his Kingdom and Government, of his Rule and Dominion; I ſay, theſe things, nay all that <hi>CHRIST</hi> did and Suffered the Prophets foretold of. Beſides, 'tis plain by <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Doctrine, Example and Practice, how he interfered with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Practice in many things; particularly in his Book ſtiled <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Liberty, &amp;c.</hi> p. 7. where he calls the <hi>LORD</hi>'s <hi>PRAYER, OUR FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, &amp;c. the Common-Prayer,</hi> or <hi>A Common-Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> Printed 1668. by which Expreſſions, and his and the Preachers Example, the uſe of that Prayer hath been wholly laid aſide by them, though it be ſo clear that all may underſtand it, ſo ſhort that any may learn it, ſo full as to take in all our wants, and ſo exact as to ſhew us what we ſhould be, as well as what we ſhould ask: O what a reſemblance it bears to the <hi>Author</hi> thereof! who was the <hi>higheſt,</hi> and <hi>loweſt,</hi> the <hi>greatest</hi> and the <hi>least, GOD</hi> and Man, who knew beſt what form of Prayer ſuted his Diſciples, and all that obey their Doctrine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it teaches one thing which <hi>G. Fox</hi> never taught you, nor do your <hi>Leaders</hi> teach you, nor do you pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice it your ſelves, that is, this Confeſſion following, <hi>FORGIVE US OUR SINS, AS WE FORGIVE THEM WHICH TRESPASS AGAINST US, &amp;c.</hi> this your <hi>Teachers</hi> do not do, this they do not teach you to do, and this I preſume is the main Reaſon why your <hi>Leaders</hi> have laid aſide this moſt excellent Form of Prayer taught us by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who is the <hi>wonderful Counſellor,</hi> and beſt knew what was fitteſt for us. Again, your <hi>Teachers</hi> have laid aſide, and you alſo by their Example, the Apoſtles Creed, <hi>I BELIEVE IN GOD, &amp;c.</hi> which <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls the Rule of Faith, (as well as the Scripture) and ſaith, it was inſtituted by <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>De Praeſcr.</hi> l. 1. c. 13. It is alſo called the Rule of Faith by <hi>Origen.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients quote this Creed, as well as Scripture, to confute Hereticks, and ſeems to have given it the ſame honour, becauſe it is indeed the ſame thing, called therefore the <hi>Compendium</hi> of the Goſpel, and the Epitome of the Holy Scripture.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29553:32"/>
And all this I could prove to you, if you had the Scriptures in that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem you ought to have, and would abide the Deciſion thereof, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging it to be a ſufficient Rule to ſquare your Actions by, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Religious Exerciſes, and the Affairs of Human Life.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth it more and more appear, that as <hi>G. Fox</hi> and his <hi>Preachers</hi> would ſeem to juſtle <hi>CHRIST</hi> out of his Place, and rob Him of his Honour, ſo hath their Doctrine and Example overturned the Exerciſe of theſe two Chriſtian Duties, as well as other <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> and by his <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> and thereby have they declared to all the World, that they differ in Faith and Practice from the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Chriſtians, Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> in all Ages; and the Reaſon is plain; for if they do not believe in <hi>HIM</hi> that was born of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and roſe again; nay, cannot call Him <hi>CHRIST,</hi> but <hi>A Vail, A Garment, A Veſſel, &amp;c.</hi> How ſhould they ſay this Creed, if they do not believe that he is riſen? yea, and that the <hi>SAME JESUS</hi> is aſcended, and now ſits at the right hand of <hi>GOD</hi> in the <hi>SAME BODY</hi> in which he aſcended, according to <hi>Acts</hi> 2. how ſhould they ſay this Creed, if they do not believe the Reſurrection of the Body out of the Grave at the day of Judgment? How ſhould they ſay or teach others to ſay this Creed? And therefore I exhort you to read the Scriptures, and though your <hi>Teachers</hi> have told you that <hi>F. Bugg</hi> is a <hi>Beaſt,</hi> a <hi>Dog,</hi> a <hi>Wolf,</hi> an Enemy of all Righteouſneſs, a <hi>Child</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> yea a <hi>Devil Incarnate,</hi> &amp;c. What then? did not the unbelieving Jews call <hi>Chriſt</hi> a <hi>Devil,</hi> and have they not called the Publick Miniſtry, yea all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſtriction or limitation, <hi>Thieves, Robbers, Witches</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> &amp;c. what then? never regard that, but as I ſaid, read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and take my advice no farther than the Scripture warrants it, and ſo far my Soul for yours, you are ſafe; but if your <hi>Teachers</hi> have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſuch an ill opinion of me, as that you will not take my advice, as they have againſt the Publick Miniſtry, that you will not hear them, yet I am perſwaded what I have wrote will be of ſervice to your Children, yea and your Childrens Children; and if ſo, why ſhould I not proceed to diſcover your Errours? that ſo the blind may not always lead the blind, but that you may become wiſer than your <hi>Teachers,</hi> and ſee for your ſelves; I am now ſpeaking to you the hearers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who have a zeal, I bear you record, though not according to knowledge, and your <hi>Leaders</hi> have been inſtrumentally the cauſe of your Errours and Blindneſs: O conſider of what I ſay, and be conſiderate and cool! I am not angry as ye ſuppoſe: If I be ſharp, 'tis my zeal for the Truths of the Goſpel, which your <hi>Teachers</hi> have defaced. And therefore bear with me; I pity you, I lament for you, whether you believe it or not. They tell you <hi>that none was ever converted to GOD by outward and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal

                  <hi>SILENCE THAT HERE FOR BEARETH.</hi> For I am not now, as <hi>M. Luther</hi> once ſaid, writing againſt the Papiſts, <hi>picking at the Rind, but plucking at the Root,</hi> even at the Foundation of your Errours, and that makes you angry, and fret, and chafe: But all is to no purpoſe; no peace ſo long as the whoredoms of <hi>Jezebel</hi> remain. Repent therefore and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend, that is the way to find mercy with <hi>GOD.</hi> Retract and renounce your Errours by ſome publick and general Act, and that is the way to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence the Pens of <hi>HIS</hi> Servants; or elſe it will be as Mr. <hi>Penyman</hi> lately told you in your Meetings in <hi>London,</hi> viz. <hi>That a fire is kindled that cannot be quenched, for the burning is of the great and mighty GOD.</hi> But why do I talk of Repentance, ſince in Scripture I find Confeſſion is the fore-runner of Repentance, and Confeſſion you cannot abide, as I have already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: For let any man read a thouſand of your Epiſtles, and they ſhall not find one Confeſſion of Sin, nor asking Pardon for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake: And let any man go to a thouſand of your Meetings, and they ſhall never hear any one of your Miniſters make Confeſſion of Sins, and beg Pardon for the ſame; which is enough, if no more could be ſaid againſt you, to prove you of a different Faith and practice from the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles, Saints</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and all good Chriſtians to this day; as well as to ſhew that you are in the ſteps of the Phariſees: Read <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 11, 12. <hi>The Phariſee ſtood and prayed thus with himſelf, O. GOD, I thank thee that I am not as other men, Extortioners, Unjuſt, Adulterers, or even as this Publican: I faſt twice in the week, I give tythe of all I poſſeſs, &amp;c.</hi> Here is the perfect <hi>Phariſee</hi> and the perfect <hi>Quaker,</hi> in perfect Unity: Here is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Sin, here is no asking Pardon for Sin, nor no ſmiting upon the Breaſt, ſaying, <hi>God be merciful to me a poor ſinner,</hi> as the Publican did. And that I may not leave this without a Preſident, for I love to keep to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact, pray take a view of one of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Prayers in print, I mean that perfect Phariſee <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> in his Book <hi>Judgment fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. Thou knoweſt, O Lord, that though thou haſt endued me with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Spirit, and with Faith, Patience, and Rejoycing under all my Sufferings and Tribulations for thy Names ſake—yet Thou haſt alſo endued me with a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of righteous Judgment, Underſtanding and Zeal for thy holy Name,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And though this Prayer contains near five Pages, yet not one word of Confeſſion of Sin; not a word of begging Pardon for Chriſt's ſake; but like the proud Phariſee, <hi>Thou haſt endued me with righteous Judgment, with Underſtanding, with Zeal:</hi> He is not as other men. And read all their printed Papers, and you will find them of the ſame tendency, and not like the Prayers of <hi>GOD</hi>'s People in any Age or Generation, as in my laſt <hi>New Rome, &amp;c.</hi> I have largely made appear from the Example of the <hi>Prophets, Apoſtles,</hi> and worthy <hi>Martyrs:</hi> To whom let me add one Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29553:37"/>
of worthy <hi>Thomas Bilny,</hi> as in <hi>Fox</hi>'s <hi>Acts and Mon.</hi> p. 467, 468. <hi>O mighty power of the moſt High, which I alſo MISERABLE SINNER have often taſted and felt,</hi> &amp;c. And when this Prayer was ended, he in the next Page goes on thus: <hi>Verily when the New Teſtament was firſt ſet forth by</hi> Eraſmus<hi>—I bought it by the Providence of GOD, and at the firſt read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I remember, I chanced upon this ſweet Sentence of St.</hi> Paul, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. It is a true ſaying, and worthy of all men to be imbraced, that Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus came into the World to ſave ſinners, of whom I am the chief <hi>and principal. This one Sentence, through GOD</hi>'s <hi>Inſtruction, did ſo exhilerate my heart, being before wounded with the Guilt of MY SINS—And THERE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE with ALL MY WHOLE POWER I TEACH that ALL MEN ſhould firſt acknowledge their ſins, and condemn them; and afterwards hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>O the Chriſtian temper and heavenly frame of this worthy <hi>Martyr,</hi> worthy our Imitation: Firſt, He acknowledged himſelf <hi>a miſerable ſinner,</hi> and therefore the fitter Object for Mercy. Secondly, O how he rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at the Confeſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who not only acknowledged himſelf a ſinner, but the <hi>CHIEF</hi> of ſinners, that thereby he might magnifie the rich Mercy of <hi>GOD</hi> in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> He was not like <hi>Solomon Eccles,</hi> who in his <hi>Muſick Lecture,</hi> p. 22. ſaid, <hi>I do affirm, that if</hi> John (the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle) <hi>had ſaid he had been a ſinner, he had lied.</hi> No, no, this Martyr did not account St. <hi>Paul</hi> a lier, though he would have had as much reaſon; for St. <hi>Paul</hi> came not behind the chiefeſt of the Apoſtles: Well, but this is not all; but as St. <hi>Paul</hi> was thus humbled to make this Confeſſion, and thus joyful at this worthy ſaying, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came into the World to ſave ſuch penitent ſinners, ſo this worthy Martyr reſolved to make it a Rule in Divinity, ſaying, <hi>And therefore with all my WHOLE POWER I teach, that ALL MEN ſhould ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR SINS,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhewed the practice of the <hi>Martyrs;</hi> and if you read the Scriptures in the Margent, you may find it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the practice of <hi>GOD</hi>'s People from the <note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 2, 3 &amp; 90.

And that drank Wine, eat dainty Diſhes, wore Silk and Velvet, that had Waiting-men and Waiting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maids, that rode in Coaches, and high and lofty Horſes, &amp;c.</hi> ſince 'tis now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for the <hi>Quakers</hi> to call and be called Maſter and Miſtreſs, Sir, and to drink Wine, eat dainty Diſhes, were Silk and Velvet, and Perriwigs, &amp;c. to ride in Coaches and as lofty Horſes, and rich Houſes as any Body (your Circumſtances conſidered) and to have Waiting-men and Waiting-maids. Doth not this argue an Apoſtacy? Or is it only <hi>lawful</hi> to the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and under the <hi>woe</hi> in others?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 2. Why do you refuſe to pay two pence or four pence towards the reparation of the Militia Arms, and yet can pay ten ſhillings towards carrying on a vigorous War againſt the French King? Is not this like your pretending it unlawful to fight, and yet excite, ſtir up, and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>Oliver,</hi> his Officers and Army to fighting? ſaying, <hi>O</hi> Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel<hi>, thou ſhouldſt have invited all Nations on Earth to come in and joyn with thee. Let thy Soldiers go forth with a free and willing heart, that thou maiſt rock Nations as a Cradle, &amp;c.</hi> more largely recited in <hi>Battering Rams, &amp;c.</hi> p. 3. Do you not in both theſe Inſtances delude the World? or like the Phariſees of old, ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Query</hi> 3. Why do you refuſe giving reſpect to your Superiours, when at the ſame time you exact it of your Servants and Apprentices, making them ſtand bare headed before you in your Houſes and Shops: Is not this Hypocriſie?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 3. Why do you make ſuch a noiſe againſt all other Miniſters, calling them Hirelings, when you take money not only for preaching, writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but for ſuffering, as in the caſe of <hi>Sam. Cater,</hi> who
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29553:38"/>

               <p>

               <p>

And ſince you ſay, <hi>We have Thouſands at our Meetings, and none of us dare ſpeak, a word, but as we are eternally moved of the Lord:</hi> A true Account, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 18.

               <head>The Conoluſion by way of Exhortation.</head>
               <p>FRiends, Let me exhort you to beware of the Doctrine of the Phariſees, [I mean of the <hi>Quakers</hi>] which is Hypocriſie. I have read of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies of the <hi>Gnoſticks, Nicolaitans, Donatiſts,</hi> and others, but none ſeem to me to be thoſe Chriſt foretold of, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>which ſhould, if it were poſſible, deceive the very Elect,</hi> ſo evidently as the <hi>Quakers;</hi> for how have they prevailed; how have they deceived high and low, noble and ignoble? and yet to me it ſeems eaſie to write a Hiſtory of their riſe, growch, and progreſs, of their Church Government, and that <hi>MONSTER, Womens Meetings,</hi> how, when, and by whom, and by what Authority carried on; and how the Spirit of Perſecution hath been amongſt them from the beginning; ſixty ſix in number of <hi>G. Fox</hi>'s Party againſt ſixty ſeven of <hi>John Stoy</hi> and <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi>'s Party, <hi>Quakers</hi> againſt <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> Councel againſt Councel, until <hi>Geo. Keith,</hi> one of their moſt Learned Preachers, hath been conſtrained to teſtifie againſt their Errours, charging them with <hi>Damuable Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Doctrines of Devils,</hi> yea, even <hi>ſuch as no Chriſtian Society would tolerate.</hi> And I knowing theſe things alſo cannot but warn all People to beware of their Gloſſings and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveable Paintings.</p>
               <p>For they will direct you to the Light, bid you be obedient to it; tell you 'tis ſufficient to lead you to Salvation; that its teaching is above <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> above <hi>Churches,</hi> above <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Scriptures:</hi> but in all this they act but the part of a Juggler, 'tis only to decoy you over to them; they do not ſo think that thus adviſe and counſel you; for if you refuſe Conformity to their Orders and Preſcriptions, alledging the Light, to which they directed you, doth not lead you thereunto; pleading to be left to the Grace of <hi>GOD</hi> in thy ſelf; they that thus at firſt directed you to this Light, will now tell you your Plea is <hi>Sordid, Ranteriſm, and pernitious to the Chriſtian Religion:</hi> See their Book, ſtiled, <hi>A brief Examination of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty Spiritual, &amp;c.</hi> p. 3, 11. For as it is falſe Doctrine to teach that the Light, being obeyed, is ſufficient to lead to Salvation; for then your Obedience is meritorious, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> died in vain; ſo do they not believe it ſufficient by their rejecting your <hi>Plea:</hi> wherefore be impartial in your ſearch, take the Apoſtles advice, <hi>Prove all things, ſearch the Scriptures, and hold fast that which is good. A wiſe man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, will ſearch out a matter.</hi> And what is of more concern than the Chriſtian Religion. God of his mercy confound all Errours, and manifeſt all Impoſtors and Deceivers, and give the Victory to his Truth, and Glory to his Name.</p>
