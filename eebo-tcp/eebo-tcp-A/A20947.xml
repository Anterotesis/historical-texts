         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16210:6"/>
which cut our time into a thouſand
pieces, wee ſhall finde, that each
of them takes from vs one part of
our life, leauing vs no time but
that which wee gaine by theft; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
ſome houres for to examine
our ſelues in ſecret, and to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
our mind with religious thoughts.
Theſe ſolitary meditations haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in them to employ our wits.
For the firſt Subiect which doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
it ſelfe to our peruſall, is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the vanity and miſery of
humane life, not for to molest vs any
way, while we are in it, but to prepare
our ſelues to depart well out of it. No
man can aſpire as hee ought to the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
life, which doth not contemne this
preſent, neither can any man contemne
this preſent, which doth not well know
it: and the way truely to know it, is to

remoue it farre from vs, to withdraw
it from our heart, and to baniſh it
from our affection; For worldly
goods beeing neere at hand, doe both
dazell the Minde, and distract the
Iudgement.</p>
            <p>But let vs firſt enquire, before we
proceede, of ſome one that hath paſſed
this way. King <hi>Salomon</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> entring into
that meditation doth write, that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is moſt vaine, all is vanity.
That great and mighty King, who
had riches without example; peace,
without trouble; glory, without enuy:
who was obeyed of his Subiects, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected
of his Neighbors, and raigned
forty yeeres, which was a ſufficient
time to content his minde, in ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
buildings, in multitude of Horſes,
in all variety of ſtudies and Sciences,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16210:7"/>
who had trauerſed his ſpirits through
all the ſecrets of Nature, euen from the
Cedar vnto the Hyſop. Neuertheleſſe,
in the concluſion of all, conſidering how
theſe ſweets are confected with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe,
how there is little conſtancie
in theſe things, how there is ſmall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
in all this trauell, hee makes this
the cloze of all his actions, That all is
vanity and affliction of ſpirit But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Solomon</hi> had proued theſe
things,<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 14.</note> hee learned that leſſon of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>
his father, which is written in the
39. <hi>Pſalme, Truely euery man is
nothing but vanity, he walketh in
a vaine ſhadow, and diſquieteth
himſelfe in vaine: hee heapeth vp
riches, and knoweth not who
ſhall gather them.</hi> Let vs therefore,
according to the rules of ſuch excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
men, enter into that meditation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16210:7"/>
and taking that Inſtrument out of

the two excrements of nature,
and there hee is nouriſhed for a time
with the moſt impure bloud of all: hee
is there ſubiect to be bruiſed by the leaſt
fall of his Mother. His birth is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
inſomuch that women bluſh to bee

               <p>The beaſts and birds are brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the world, either couered with haire,
feathers, or wooll; not ſo much as the
ſeedes and corne of the ground, but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath cloathed them with eares and
huskes, man onely excepted: for hee
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16210:8"/>
being once come from his mothers
wombe, ſeemeth no other thing then
the ſimilitude of a poore worme, that
commeth creeping out of the earth, his
cloathing is bloud onely, wherein he is
bathed and couered, which ſignifieth
no other thing but the image and figure
of ſinne.</p>
               <p>The beginning of his life is with
ſorrow: for at comming into the world,
weepings and wailings doe accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him, which are as meſſengers and
fore-ſhewers of his calamities to come;
the which becauſe hee cannot expreſſe
in words, he witneſſeth by teares.</p>
               <p>Hee is borne immoueable, and tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
into his owne filth. Other liuing
creatures are no ſooner out of the
wombe, but they fall on their feete and
are ready to goe; nor out of the ſhell,
but they runne for meate. The worme
(be hee neuer ſo little) as ſoone as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath brought him out of the earth,
beginneth to crawle and creepe, and to
ſeeke for foode: The little Chicken, as
ſoone as hee is out of the ſhell, is found
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:16210:9"/>
cleane, &amp; runneth after the Hen, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
when he is called: hee picketh and
eateth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee feareth the Kite, and flyeth
danger, being guided onely by nature.
But behold, Man, ſo ſoone as hee is
come into the world, is like vnto a little
Monſter, and a lumpe of fleſh, which
will let himſelfe bee eaten of other
beaſts, if he be not ſeene into; and dye
for hunger, before he can finde his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
breſt, and will as ſoone eate poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
as good meat, and handle hot iron,
before hee can diſcerne the good from
the euill.</p>
               <p>Thus Man beeing brought into this
miſerable world, and plunged in the
gulph of miſeries, he then requireth to
haue nouriſhment, and cloathing, to
comfort the infirmity of his nature; but
behold, he is ſubiect vnto ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that hee is glad to gaine it with the
ſweate of his browes: Whereas other
liuing creatures do finde all things rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
prepared for them, Man onely hath
need of habiliments; for he that is the
moſt noble in the world, is aſhamed to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:16210:9"/>
ſhew his nakedneſſe, and therefore hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
himſelf vnder the ſpoiles of other

then all the beaſts together; to
which the obſcureſt fogges or euening
dewe doe no hurt. They neuer bleed at
the noſe, although they goe alwayes
declining towards the earth. They are
ignorant what the Catarre, Calcull, and
diuers ſorts of Agues meane.</p>
               <p>Man onely is capable to diſcerne
theſe differences, and to feele their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
for if there be any beaſts which
are more afflicted with diſeaſes, they
are ſuch as liue limited within the
precinct of ſome houſe, and ſo receiue
it by contagion. But ſome will obiect
that Man hath reaſon aboue the beaſts:
which is indeed the reaſon of his tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in winning him to practiſe dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
and pernitious deſignes; to bee
ſubtle in contentions, to ioyne himſelfe
into other mens affaires, and being once
ſatisfied, to ſtirre vp an artificiall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite,
and a deſire to drinke without

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:16210:10"/>
is, but we are much more ſenſible of ill
then good; and that griefes doe more
diſturbe vs, then pleaſures can content
vs. Scarce can we thinke of an abſolute

The onely meane to appeaſe

them: If any do but touch one of their
toyes, they ouerturne all the reſt for
deſpite, The loue &amp; reſpect which they
giue to their puppets, are eminent ſeeds
of Idolatry. Such are the infants that
are begotten of the beſt of men: A
graine of corne winnowed from the
chaffe, produceth corne with chaffe; a
man circumciſed, begetteth an infant
vncircumciſed.</p>
               <p>Therefore you may ſee by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
of your children, the image of
your corruption.</p>
               <p>Wee haue already diſcourſed vvhat
perils and dangers man hath at his firſt
comming into the world, and in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancie.
Now therefore let vs conſider
vvhat he is when he is ſprung vp,<note place="margin">Of Youth.</note> and

increaſe then decreaſe in miſeries:
for this is the time of mans life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Nature doth raiſe againſt him a more
furious combate; for now his bloud
beginneth to riſe, the fleſh prouoketh
him to his owne pleaſure, the vvicked
world eſpieth him, the Diuel tempteth

as it is impoſſible but that which is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailed
with ſo many vices, and ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of none, in the end is diſcomforted
and ouercome. For in the body of
youth, ryot, libertie, and deliciouſneſſe
aboundeth: for all the vices in the
world (ſaith <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi>) doe
there plant their ſiege. O how many
perſons in this age are corrupted vvith
too much pleaſure, lulling themſelues
aſleepe, in the lap of ſuch as ſeeke to

which ſeekeſt by thy inticing flatteries,
to deliuer vs to an enemie, farre vvorſe
then the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> which is the Diuell
himſelfe! Such pleaſures are like vnto
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:16210:11"/>
guilded pils, which vnder their exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
beauty include bitterneſſe. They
are alſo like vnto freſh Riuers, that end
their courſe in the Sea, loſing their
ſweet relliſh in an ocean of ſaltnes. True
zeale cannot flouriſh vnder ſo nice and
delicate a gouernment; nor can the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
knowledge of God (which is a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall
gift) be ſubiected to the belly, it
cannot remaine amongſt ſwine; that
habitation is onely agreeable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
who, by the permiſſion of Ieſus
Chriſt, hauing entred into a Herd of
ſwine, compelled them to runne head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to their owne ruine: and who (as
it is recorded in the holy Writ) nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth
prodigall children vvith the
husks of pleaſures, in ſtead of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

               <p>It behooueth the Husbandman, when

to lop the o're-weighty branches, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards

Likewiſe, it is neceſſary for Parents, to
reforme &amp; correct the vices that raigne
in Youth, leſt afterwards it returne to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:16210:12"/>
their ſhame and reproach. But there are
at this day many fathers and mothers,
who for not hauing well inſtructed
their children in their youth, doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
much ſorrow and griefe in their
age: a iuſt reward for ſuch Parents, who
(although they be ſaid to be nouriſhers
of the bodies) are the deſtroyers of the
ſoules of their children.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ely</hi> was grieuouſly puniſhed vvith
his children, for that hee did not ſo
ſharpely chaſtice them, as their offences
did require, what ſhall become of thoſe
fathers and mothers, which in ſtead of
correcters, are the childrens corrupters?
Such Parents may well bee compared
to Apes, which kill their yong ones by
too much claſping them between their
armes, and keeping them ſo deare; and
this is the cauſe that ſo many fall into
the hands of the Hangman, which is to
them reformer and correcter.</p>
               <p>Many there bee, that in ſtead of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
good exhortations to their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
doe ſhew them firſt themſelues
naughty and wicked examples. For the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:16210:12"/>
firſt commandement that they giue
them how to liue well, is to blaſpheme,
ſweare, exerciſe gluttony and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to ſpoile the ſubſtance of their
youth; to bee fornicators, and to kiſſe
women and maidens in their preſence.</p>
               <p>There bee alſo many mothers heere
that learne their Daughters to Dance,
to vſe Rhetorick termes, to haunt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies,
to ſcoffe and flout, to paint and
colour their faces, to decke their fingers
with Rings, and their necks with Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels,
as though they were Iewel-ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
pretending to keepe a ſhop: but in
the end it will happen to them, as it did
to the Prophet <hi>Dauid, 2. King.</hi> 13. &amp; 15.
<hi>whoſe ſinne was puniſhed in his children,
which were moſt of them ſo wicked, that
the one of them defloured his owne Siſter,
and the other killed his Brother, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
ſought the death of his owne Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and chaſed him out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient Philoſophers maintained
this argument, that all ſinnes commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

fraile and mortall fleſh, by the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof, the life taketh end; but

frequent publike places, that he haunt
the company of thoſe that are touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones,
for to know the good from

what paines ſoeuer man taketh for his

all to the end that he may get ſomwhat

               <p>Theſe infelicities are the occaſion

ſaying; And in the end I found my

               <p>But now touching the vnhappy ſtates
of wicked Princes, vnto whom three
kindes of people are moſt agreeable and
familiar. The firſt are flatterers, which
be the chiefe enemies to all vertue, and
they that impoiſon their ſoules with a
poiſon ſo peſtiferous, that it is contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
to all the world: their Princes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
they call Prudence; their crueltie,
Iuſtice; their wantonneſſe, Loue; their
fornications, Pleaſures and paſtimes: if
they be couetous, they call it good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry;
if they be prodigall, they call it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16210:16"/>
liberalitie. So that there is no vice in a
Prince, but they cloake it vnder the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of ſome vertue.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort are ſuch, who neuer
reſt night,<note place="margin">The inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters if new Patents.</note> but in the morning they
bring in ſome new inuention or other,
how to taxe and draw money from the
poore people; and generally all their
ſtudy is imployed to bee waſtefull, and
prodigall in the exactions and miſery of
the poore Commons.<note place="margin">Enuious, &amp; inſatiable Courtiers.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third and laſt ſort are ſuch, that
vnder the cloake of kindneſſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie
(counterfetting good men) haue
alwaies their eyes fixed vpon other
mens liuings, and make themſelues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
of Vices.</p>
               <p>They inuent wicked &amp; falſe deuices,
not only how to get other mens goods,
but oftentimes their liues, who before
God are moſt innocent.</p>
               <p>Behold, heere you may well ſee the
manifold miſeries that compaſſe Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and States of Princes: Heere are
the thornes that they receiue, in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of their brightneſſe and royall
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:16210:17"/>
dignity, which ought like a Lampe to
giue light to all the world: but when it
is eclipſed or darkened with any vice,
it is more reproachfull in them then in
any other priuate perſon whatſoeuer:
for they ſinne not onely in the fault
which they commit, but alſo by the
example which they giue.</p>
               <p>The aboundance of honours &amp; plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
that Princes enioy, ſerueth as a

good. If we conſider what the Romane
Emperours were, (which hath been the
moſt flouriſhing Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth in the
vvorld) vvee ſhall finde them ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
with vices, and all kinde of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that I doe almoſt abhortre to ſpeake
of their corrupt and defiled liues. What
was the eſtate of their Common-wealth,
before that <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius</hi>

<hi>Cataline</hi> and <hi>Catulla</hi> did perturbe it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

it; before that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Marcus

<hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Caligula</hi> did defame it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that <hi>Domitian</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praue
it? For although they made it rich
vvith many Kingdomes, yet were the
vices they brought with them, greater
then the Kingdomes they gained. For
their goods and riches are conſumed,
yet their vices remaine vnto this day.
What memory remaineth of <hi>Romulus</hi>
that founded the Citie of <hi>Rome?</hi> Of
<hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> that erected the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll?
Of <hi>Aurus Marius,</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed

ſhew what felicity remaineth in high
eſtates, who are more ſubiect to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults
of Fortune, then any other earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
creature? For many times the thred
of life breaketh, when they thinke leaſt
of death, and then the infamy of thoſe
that bee wicked, remaineth written in
Hiſtories, for a perpetuall memorie
thereof. The which thing all eſtates
ought more to regard a thouſand times,
then the tongue that ſpeaketh euill,

Princes Courts a certaine Noble cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie,
where, vnder the colour of
Greatneſſe, is the higheſt Seruitude,
and thoſe gilded chaines that fetter
mens minds. He which will liue heere,
muſt alwayes be masked, and prepared
in one houre to conuert himſelfe into
twenty ſeuerall ſhapes, to entertaine
many ſeruants, but no friends. Their
innocency is accounted meere ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie;
and to affirme any thing, is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
the ſame. There are two ſorts of
people in the Court which hate one
the other, each knowing of it: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
there is alwayes an emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
betwixt them, which ſhould
firſt attempt any point of Honour, to
doe the other ſeruice, and bee the laſt
that ſhould end it. But ſuch ridiculous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16210:19"/>
complements are like vnto Anticke
actions. Enuy, which doth ſupplant and
deceiue his neighbour, or that doth
ſnarle in ſecret, is there perpetually, and
to appeaſe it, there is no way but by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie.
Vices and degenerate actions, are
eſteemed among Courtiers, as precepts
and part of their compoſition. Not to
bee corrupted by them, there requireth
more faith then a graine of Muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed.
As Crowes build their neſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the higheſt boughes, ſo doth the
diuell among the higheſt of men, where
ſpreading his wings, he clocketh for his
little ones,<note place="margin">New Duels doe adde to one much reputation: for as it is a ſhame for a man to come into the world; ſo they hold it an honour to ſend him out of it.</note> which are his Vices, becauſe
there they remaine more expoſed to
the ſight, and neuer appeare but vvith
authoritie. There alſo ſhall you ſee Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualiers,
who out of their gallant diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will kill one the other, vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of a word: a manifeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
that their life is not much worth,
ſith they will ſell it ſo good cheape.
Notwithſtanding theſe kinde of men,
that are in theſe occaſions ſo valiant,
do fly away, when they ſhould ſuffer the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:16210:19"/>
leaſt thing for Gods cauſe. Surely many
ſuch are required to make one good
Martyr for the holy Goſpell.</p>
               <p>There be ſome kinde of Courtiers ſo
ſubtill and crafty, that they doe play as
the Fiſherman, who as ſoone as he hath
gotten any thing in his Net, giueth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
the Court, and goeth his way. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſome there be that play all out: and
other that remaine vntill they become
wondrous rich, and in the end they are
made to reſtore all backe againe.</p>
               <p>There are alſo others that doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but inuent meanes to inlarge their
owne treaſures, and become vvealthy
with ſpoiling poore people. Princes
doe by them many times as wee doe by
our hogges; wee let them fatten, to the
end we may eate them afterwards: ſo
likewiſe are they ſuffered many times
to enrich themſelues, to be diſpoſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
when they are fat: and one
that is new come, oftentimes is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in their places.</p>
               <p>By this you may ſee, that Courtiers
oftentimes doe ſell their liberty, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:16210:20"/>
rich, for they muſt obey all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;
they muſt frame them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
to laugh when the Prince laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
to weepe when hee weepeth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue
that which hee approueth, and
condemne that which he condemneth.
They muſt alter and change their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
to bee ſeuere, with thoſe that are
ſeuere; ſorrowfull, with thoſe that are
ſorrowfull, and in a manner transforme
themſelues, according to the nature of
him whom they will pleaſe, or elſe they
ſhall get nothing. To bee briefe, they
muſt frame themſelues according to his
manners &amp; nature, and yet many times
one little offence ſtayneth all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
they haue done in the life before.</p>
               <p>Many in Princes Courts put off their
caps to them, whom they would gladly
ſee cut ſhorter by the head, and often
bow their knees to do them reuerence,
whom they wiſh had broken their
neckes.</p>
               <p>Here you may ſee the life of a great
number of vicious Courtiers, which is
no life, but rather a lingring death:

to age, they bring nothing from thence
but gray heads, their feet full of Gouts,
their backes full of paine, their hearts
full of ſorrow, and their ſoules filled
with ſinne.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:16210:21"/>
Firſt, knowing that all the actions of
Magiſtrates paſſe before the eyes of the
common people, whoſe iudgements in
matters of State be but ſimple, yet haue
they a certaine ſmell or ſauour to know
the good from euill. Wherefore thoſe

               <p>Therefore it behooueth that the life

               <p>Now wee haue ſhewed and ſet forth

put into the ballance the errours and

               </p>

               <p>Some Magiſtrates are corrupted by

diligent in rich mens cauſes, but you

               <p>The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> cryeth out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

infinite number of diſſentions that
chanced, were conſtrained to ordaine
certaine Magiſtrates in their countrey,
whom they called Reconcilers of the
married ones: the office of whom was
to ſet agreement betweene the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and the Wife. The <hi>Spartanes</hi> and
<hi>Romanes</hi> had alſo ſuch like lawes and
orders amongſt them: ſo great was the
inſolence and raſhneſſe of ſome wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
towards their Husbands.</p>
               <p>In this age there are but few, I thinke,
can beare patiently the charges of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
or can endure the vnbridled rage
of ſome women: and to ſpeake truth
vvithout flatterie, if thou takeſt her rich,
thou makeſt thy ſelfe a bond-ſlaue; for
thinking to marry thine equall, thou
marrieſt a commanding Miſtris. If thou
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:16210:25"/>
takeſt her foule, thou canſt not loue her;
if thou takeſt her faire, it is an Image at
thy gate to bring thee company. Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is a Tower that is aſſailed of all the
vvorld, and therefore it is a hard thing
to keepe that, when euery one ſeeketh
to haue the key. This is the concluſion,
riches cauſeth a woman to bee proud,
beauty maketh her ſuſpected, and hard-fauourednes
cauſeth her to be hated.
Therefore <hi>Diponares</hi> hauing taſted the
Martyrdomes of marriage, ſaid, that
there were but 2. good dayes in all the
life of marriage; vvhereof the one was
the wedding day, vpon which is made
good cheere, the Bride freſh and faire,
and of all pleaſures, the beginning is
moſt delectable. The other good day
is, when the woman dyeth: for then the
Husband is out of bondage and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.
Yet for all this, a woman is to
a man a neceſſary euill, and one vvhom
hee cannot well liue without; ſeeing
that there is nothing more hard to find
in this world then a good woman, a
good Mule, &amp; a good Goat, being three
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:16210:26"/>
vnhappy beaſts. And to conclude,
there is nothing more piercing then her
outragious words; more to bee feared
then her boldneſſe; more cruell then her
malice, nor more dangerous then her
fury: beſides many hurtfull diſcommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of their Huſwifery.</p>

               <p>BVt of all the miſeries that happen to
Man in this world, theſe hereafter
following, are the greateſt.</p>
               <p>And firſt, let vs conſider of Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
wherewith many men are ſo
farre ouercome, that they will hazard
their life to win a little money; that is,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:16210:28"/>
to loſe their beeing, for to gaine the
meanes to bee: which miſſe the end to
obtaine the acceſſories; as he which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his Sword to buy a ſheath; or his
Horſe, to haue ſome prouender; and to
gaine worldly pelfe, not to ſerue his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
but rather for himſelfe to ſerue
it; to haue riches as one hath a Feauer,
which doth more poſſeſſe the grieued,
than the grieued it. To bee like vnto a
greedy dogs, which lying vpon hay, &amp;
not eating it himſelfe, will ſnarle if any
other commeth neere vnto it. O miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
people, that liue poorely, to dye
rich! that are moſt couetous in their
declining age, which is to prouide for a
tedious iourney, when it is euen fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.
But a man that feareth God, for
to auoid ſo great an inconuenience, will
conſider in himſelfe, what is the worth
and eſtimation of ſuch droſſe: and will
conceipt, that theſe things are oft giuen
to wicked men, as ſeducers of mindes
from true piety, and the diuine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the Almighty; who ſheweth
vs what eſtimation wee ſhould haue of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:16210:28"/>
riches, in giuing largely to the wicked;
within whoſe breſts it doth fall, as a
purſe into a ſtinking priuy. Ieſus Chriſt
doth giue vs an example what repute is
to be had of it, in committing his purſe
to <hi>Iudas,</hi> when as he gaue his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to his faithfull Apoſtles. And if hee
had thought wealth to haue beene the
true felicitie, no doubt he would haue
gathered it more abundantly: but hee
had not ſo much, where to lay his head
on. He hath willed vs to loue pouerty
by his example: And the great King of
the World will deſpiſe all things, that
ſhall entice vs to affect the contrary. A
little wealth will ſuffice vs to liue well,
and leſſe to dye happily.<note place="margin">1. Tim. 6.</note> Godlines with
contententment is great gaine: we are
come naked into the world, and naked
ſhall we goe out; peaceable pouertie is
much better than troubleſome riches.
But man is ſo fooliſh, that he had rather
draw water out of a great diſturbed Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
with difficulty and perill, then from
a little cleere brooke, with facility and
eaſe; had rather take a great maſſe of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:16210:29"/>
gold with torment and danger, then a
little with peace and ſecurity; &amp; in fine,
he will bee nothing the more ſatisfied.
Moreouer, he thinketh that to bee loſt,
which was neuer gayned by him: This
kind of Auarice is alwayes linked with
enuy. If peraduenture a man loſe his
worldly fortunes, (according vnto that
which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: That riches beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
her to her wings) it doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
diſtract humane ſence; for, to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacke
a couetous perſon, is to flay his
skin from his body; to take from him
his riches, is to depriue him of his heart;
ſince that ſuch doe wholy deuote both
heart and affection to their wealth.</p>
               <p>Who euer ſaw the ſinne of couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

then at this day? for all the Cities, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces,

and auarice. This is the world
which the Prophets did fore-ſhew, that
men ioyne houſe to houſe, and land

alone dwell vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:16210:29"/>
Couetouſneſſe is the well-ſpring of
miſeries:<note place="margin">Couetouſnes the ſource and originall of all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes and abomination.</note> for from thence proceed war

From Couetouſneſſe proceed
Murders, Treaſons, Thefts, Vſuries, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearings,
the corruption of witneſſes,
&amp; peruerting of Iudgements; from Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes,
the tedious delayes in Law,
and lingring of Suites doe proceede;
And to be ſhort, from thence commeth
all kind of wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>This grieuous ſinne is growne ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
among men, that many liue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mercy, in ſuch ſort, that now wee
may ſee the ſtreets full of poore beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
naked and cold with pouerty; with
an infinite number of baniſhed women,
driuen out of their Countries, bearing
their children in their armes; wanting
that which couetous men hoord vp
with ſuch cares, that they rather make it
their god, and will rather let a poore
body dye at their gates, then refreſh him
with food.</p>
               <p>Therefore let vs now leaue theſe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked

men,<note place="margin">Of Enuie, that cruell, abominable, and bloudy vice, which doth gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly raigne now in this our degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate age.</note> Idolaters of their treaſures,

in the holy Scripture, and ſpeake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Vice, which is called <hi>Enuy;</hi> a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady
wherwith many minds in this new
world are grieuouſly afflicted.</p>
               <p>The time is now come, that the whole
earth is nothing but a very place of the
Enuious: a vice which is the oldeſt of al
vices, and hath bin vſed in the worlds
infancy: The experience thereof, was
approued in the firſt Age, in <hi>Adam</hi> and
the Serpent, in <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Iacob</hi>
and <hi>Eſau,</hi> in <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and his Brethren, in
<hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> in <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Mardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,</hi>
the which purſued not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for their riches, but for the enuy
that the one bore to a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>other. But all this
is nothing to the enuy which is vſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men at this day: which wicked
vice not onely raigneth among the
common ſort, but alſo amongſt the
higher: for when they are mounted to
the top of Fortunes wheele, and thinke
peaceably to enioy the fauour of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
behold, ſuddenly the enuy of ſome
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:16210:30"/>
other conſpires againſt them, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
them to bee diſdained and caſt
out of fauuor. Therefore I thinke there
is no other meanes to auoid Enuy, then
to auoid Dignity and Rule: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is, that we are the children of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,
and he that leaueth moſt goods, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth

how people did then affect Comedies,

which ought to flouriſh in one, to ſome

               <p>Alſo there are ſome, that when they

So that their life is a continuall

               <p>Philoſophy and the Sciences haue

Ignorance is neuer without ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie:
And in concluſion, when we

and is of ſmall vſe. For Man cannot by

Oaſts, but few friends, promiſing to
learne much in their iourney, vvhen
as oftentimes they returne more foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
then they went; and perchance
hauing circuited the earth, doe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully
bequeath their body to it,
for a concluſion to their perfected reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions,
as flyes when they haue paſſed
many times round about the Candle, at
length enter into the flame, after they
haue ſeene ſo much land there, onely
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16210:34"/>
require a handfull for to couer them.
With this vanity are they iuſtly afflicted,
which make long Voyages towards
ſome Saint, for to deſire that they may
get children, when it may be, at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
ſome officious neighbour hath
diſcharged them of that care.</p>
               <p>Yet ſome againe, perchance, wil ſay,
that our Ciuill Vertues haue ſome
things that are of more conſequence.
But heere out of this alſo doth bud an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
vanity, ſeeing that thoſe vertues
haue no mention but by Vices: for
Choller giues an edge to Valor; Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize
doth make a man to bee more
circumſpect and wary; Ambition, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice,
and Enuy, are as ſtings to ſtudie
and induſtry.<note place="margin">Such minds incite whores ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then chaſte and vertuous women.</note> The feare of an ill report
in many women, is the cauſe of chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
many are ſober out of a couetous
humour; other for neceſſity: friendſhips
are contracted, either for the deſire of
pleaſures, or for the hope of profit.
The firſt being no otherwiſe then a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
broker; nor the laſt then a Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize.
Religion it ſelfe doth often ſerue
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:16210:35"/>
for a cloake to ſuch couetous perſons:
for many follow Ieſus Chriſt (in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſart,
only to haue bread, which is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
their vnderſtanding only to the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp; the chiefe of vertues, onely to the
meaneſt of vices: but I know not which
is worſe, either to fly away from Chriſt,
or to follow him for gaine; to ſerue him
for money, or to ſerue the diuell for
gaine; whether it doth ſeeme moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious,
or ignominious towards God,
either to leaue his Sonne Ieſus Chriſt,
or in following him wrongfully, to
make him a Vallet to our concupiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences.
What can theſe vertues then be,
that march vnder the pay of the diuell?
Surely this is alſo a great vanity, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
corruption. Wherefore ſome (not
perceiuing any thing in the world,
which is exempted out of this vanitie,
and that vices &amp; impietie haue infected
all ſorts of eſtates and conditions in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
life) doe thinke to wreſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
out of it, by confining their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
to ſome deſart, and condemning
their minde to a perpetuall care:
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16210:35"/>
where beeing ſecluded from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
they liue in continuall ſilence,
neuer ſpeaking but with God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>This ſolitary humour in many, doth
proceede from a brutiſh conceit; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
from a weake ſpirit, vncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of humane ſocietie; in others,
from an ambition to bee remarkeable
for ſome extraordinarie profeſſion,
and in others out of diſcontent-and
enuy, that they are wearied in
ſwimming againſt the current of this
worldly ſtreame; and in hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
all things ſtill contrarie to their
deſire. Notwithſtanding, I doe not
doubt, but that there bee ſome which
doe imbrace this ſort of ſolitary life, to
baniſh themſelues from the vices of this
world, and to ſerue God with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
But ſuch are much deceiued,
who willing to forſake the world, doe
returne farther into it by other meanes,
and are aſſaulted by worſe temptations:
for then paſſionate griefes, curious co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations,
peeuiſh idleneſſe, Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacall
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16210:36"/>
humours, deſpaire, preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſelfe-admiration, doe inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
glide into mens ſpirits, vnder the
profeſſion of an extraordinary ſanctity;
all which doe render the ſpirit diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
of an inſolent melancholy, and
preſumptuous deuotion, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
degenerateth into madnes, and
want of ſenſe.<note place="margin">With good reaſon S. Auſtin ſaid, That Man pleaſeth God the beſt, that, circled with beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in the mids of Princes magnificent Palaces, could fly their allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> A ſolitary man, in the
extremity of his griefes and ſadneſſe,
hath no body to comfort him: and
comparing himſelf with none but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
hath this conceit, that hee is ſome
excellent thing. But then luſtfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
doe doubly burne within him: For
man is of this nature, that he thinketh
thoſe things moſt beautifull, which are
fartheſt remote from him. So S. <hi>Ierome</hi>
being in the middeſt of a Deſart, and
in his greateſt abſtinencie, doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
that his minde was then amongſt
the Dances, &amp; Ballads of yong maids;
and that he did burne with incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and deſire. Beſides, the Diuell fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Ieſus Chriſt into the Deſart,
doth plainely ſhew that hee did iudge
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:16210:36"/>
that place moſt conuenient for temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.<note place="margin">A notable compariſon to confound the folly of men, who thinke to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, by rendring and making themſelues Anchorites and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites.</note>
Then if the Sonne of God was
aſſailed by the Diuel in the Deſart, how
ſcapeth an Hermite, or ſecluded per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that can neuer be exempted? Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſureſt way for a man to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
himſelfe from the world, not with
his feet, but with his affection: to expell
it altogether from him &amp; his heart, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
otherwiſe that departing from this
world, notwithſtanding hee carrieth it
with him. For as it is poſſible to bee
worldly and vicious, liuing farre
from the world: So it is poſſible to
leaue the world, without flying into
a Deſart, and to liue alone in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of company; to be within a Court
or Palace, ſpectator of vanity and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
without participating of them; and
in the middeſt of a babbling multitude,
to talke only with himſelfe, &amp; to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
his thoughts with God. And in
the meane time, to imploy his indeuors
to the edification of the Church, ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
out his hand to the erroneous, for
to re-guide them into the right way of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:16210:37"/>
Saluation, rather then to hide his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
in the earth, and to cut himſelfe
cleane off from the body, and all ciuill
ſocietie, as an vnprofitable member. So
did the Apoſtles and thoſe glorious
Lampes, which haue inlightened the
Church of God, and which ſhine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
vs to this day, they beeing
dead.</p>
               <p>I know well, that the opinion of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotle,</hi>
in the beginning of his Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques
is true, that hee which is of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie
diſpoſition, is either of a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine,
or very baſe ſpirit, becauſe that he
doth eſtrange himſelfe from all ſociety,
either for that hee hath vertues more
then humane; or that hee is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible,
and meane, in reſpect of
Man, that he is vnworthy to approach
neere him. But let him know which
doth affect ſolitarineſſe, becauſe he doth
ſurpaſſe all men in vnderſtanding and
vertue, that he ought to repell that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and to condeſcend by humilitie
and meekeneſſe, to the imperfections of
others, labouring for the good of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16210:37"/>
Church or Common Wealth, either by
word or worke: For what are all thoſe
perfections more then ſhaddowes, and
obſcure traces of thoſe perfections that
are in Ieſus Chriſt;<note place="margin">Non quaere-Chriſtus Ieſus glari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſuam omnia.

tooke vpon him our ſhape, and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
among men, that thereby he might
ſaue them, and winne ſoules to heauen.
Therefore to conclude this point, If to
flie from the World bee a vanity, how
much more to follow it? If vices and
torments do harbour in the deſart, how
much more in preſſes and throngs of
people? Truely, if vanity bee in euery
place, let vs ſay, that all is torment and
affliction of Spirit.</p>

               <p>BVt in the meane time that man is

endeauouring nothing all dayes of
his life, but to riſe, and to goe to bed, to

While he is thus buſied with ſuch

all deſire: But if any doe peraduenture
gaine that time they deſire, to haue it
prolonged to the vtmoſt; this age (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as Grapes which haue loſt their

without queſtion, the moſt vnhappy for
thoſe men that are worldly, as no the

godly: For worldly men in this age are
doubly poſſeſt with way wardnes; their
feare and diſtruſt doth increaſe, their
iudgement waxeth weake, &amp; begins to
diminiſh: Wherefore we do wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call a melancholy humor, wiſedome;

this vnprofitable &amp; weariſome trauell,
behold the approch of death, before he
hath learned to liue, much leſſe to dye:
The moſt part beeing taken out of this
world before they know to what end
they entred in; they would willingly
prolong the date of their life, but death
admits no compoſition: for it hath feet
of wooll, but armes of iron; it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth
vnſenſibly, but hauing taken once hold,
it neuer looſeth her prize. To this pace
or ſtep, man commeth ſo ſlowly as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly

to ſettle himſelfe here, yet is
forced at laſt to yeeld vnto Death; and
yet by no meanes may bee knowne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what manner hee ſhall end his life.
Some there bee that are forced to dye
by hunger; others, by thirſt; others,
by fire; others by water; others, by

are torne in pieces by wilde beaſts; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

Man knoweth not his end; when hee

periſheth.</p>
               <p>What a dreadfull ſight is it, to ſee

will recite a tale for truth, which hee
knoweth to be moſt falſe, and that ſo

               <p>A Husband that knoweth his Wife
to be deformed, notwithſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>How many bee there which beleeue
in a Religion, becauſe they will beleeue
it, which conteſt againſt their owne
ſenſe, which ſay among themſelues, that
ſurely is abſurd, and not agreeable
with the Scripture, I will haue it thus,
and will beleeue ſo. This is to haue a
conſtrained beliefe, not to haue his will
ſubiected to Religion, but Religion to
his will.</p>
               <p>The infirmitie of mans iudgement
doth eſpecially ſhew it ſelfe in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for what he thinketh touching the

               </p>
               <p>This is alſo a vanity of vanities, and an

               <p>Our ſelues which haue the true Word
of God for a rule to frame our actions
by, are not exempted: and our folly

               <p>Some doe record in the Emperor <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius,</hi>
a great ſimplicitie, and childiſh
weakeneſſe: that hauing a Hen, nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by him, <hi>Rome,</hi> which he did cheriſh,
and ſo infinitely affect, that when one
came vnto him, and ſaid that his <hi>Rome</hi>
was loſt, he anſwered very ſorrowfully,
Alas! ſhe was here but euen now. But
the other replying, ſaid, And it pleaſe
your Highnes, I ſpeak not of a Hen, but
of your Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which hath

                  <note n="*" place="margin">A Simile worthy of obſeruation.</note> The Emperor hearing this, was
ſomewhat comforted, thinking that
loſſe to bee more tolerable.</p>
               <p>Such is our ſimplicitie, wee will not
ſuffer one to touch our riches, but<note n="a" place="margin">Wee are ſo rooted in this worlds abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a minute of worldly pleaſure, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heauens euerlaſting ioyes, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible and immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</note> we
will indure any to entice vs to Vice;
to ſeduce vs into errour, and to poiſon
our ſoules.</p>
               <p>It is a great folly to refuſe a medicine,
becauſe the Phyſician is not eloquent:
Why doe wee not then make account
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:16210:54"/>
and eſtimation of the preaching of the
Goſpell, if the Preacher bee not elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
ſeeing that the holy Goſpell is
the medicine of our ſoules?</p>
               <p>Is it not then an extreme brutiſhnes,
for ſome vicious perſon to ſlighten
the holy Writ, becauſe it is not ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Flowers of Rhetoricke?
What is the reaſon then, that the Word
of God doth pleaſe vs, if it be not dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
with Flowers, and compoſed with
Art, ſeeing that it is that ſacred worke,
and Doctrine of Reconciliation with
God? Wee doe not receiue willingly
the correction of our Parents, if it bee
not very milde. This is alſo a vanity,
diſtaſte, and childiſh humour.</p>
               <p>Touching our Iudgement which we
haue of others, either in eſteeming, or
contemning them, it is moſt vaine, and
ridiculouſly ignorant.</p>
               <p>For if there be a queſtion about bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
wee account him moſt ſtrong,
which can carry the heauieſt. On the
contrary, about quarrels wee eſteeme
him the moſt valiant, which can beare
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:16210:54"/>
nothing; attributing force and valour
to weakeneſſe and impatience.</p>
               <p>In matters of ornament, we doe not
iudge of the goodneſſe of a ſword, by
the beauty of a ſcabberd: nor of the
metall of a Horſe, by the faireneſſe of
a Bridle and Saddle.<note place="margin">Men ought not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded not reſpected for their gallant and gorgeous apparell on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but more for their vertues.</note> Why doe we then
meaſure our eſtimation of a man, either
by his good or bad apparell? And if it
be neceſſary that we ſalute one for the
ſtuffe of his cloathes which he weareth;
why doe wee not ſalute the ſame ſtuffe
in the Shops? Why doe wee iudge diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
in the eſtimation of vaine and
triuiall things; when as in a matter of
ſuch importance, as of the eſtimation of
man, we are moſt voide of reaſon? So
ſome doe reſpect a Merchant, or Rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer,
becauſe hee ſummeth vp ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly
his accounts, when hee liueth in
ſuch faſhion, that he cannot giue an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

               <p>Some labour to till their Gardens,

               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:16210:55"/>
Wee are much vaine and childiſh in
our feares, as in any other thing. For as
little Infants doe play with fire &amp; burne
themſelues, but feare when they ſee
their Father comming, masked with a
frowning countenance towards them:
So men deſiring to dally with pleaſures,<note place="margin">Man Iull'd in the Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, knowes not how to get out.</note>
becauſe of their luſtre, at the length
loſe themſelues amongſt them: yet
notwithſtanding they feare God their
Father, when he commeth vnto them
vnder the maske of afflictions or death.</p>
               <p>Alſo man doth ingender in himſelfe
either fooliſh or pernicious feares.</p>
               <p>Some one being iealous that his wife
doth affect others, endeuoureth to eſpy
and ſearch out that which he feareth to
finde: and by this meanes angreth her
ſo, that ſhe ſeeketh to be reuenged, in
ſuch nature which hee formerly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>
               <p>Some other fearing to liue without

his body to ſome cruell torment,
and ſtaineth the memory of him with

               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:16210:55"/>
Some other feareth the want of
riches,<note place="margin">The cuſtome of the world.</note> but hee ſhall want it, and dye
without it.</p>
               <p>Some againe feareth he ſhall die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
marriage,<note place="margin">Marriage without loue and meanes, breeds the moſt wofull experience of a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life.</note> but God well obſerues
that time, and by wedlocke will make
him twice miſerable.</p>
               <p>When I conſider what humane wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is, I finde it agreeable to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
of Moles, which digge vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground
with much dexteritie, but
are blind when they come into the
Sunne.</p>
               <p>So wee haue much skill in earthly
affaires, to ſell, to couenant, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
any one.</p>
               <p>But take one of theſe men vvhich is
is moſt ſubtill in theſe things,<note place="margin">Worldlings moſt wiſe in knowing the way to get riches: but to ſeeke after the riches of Heauen dull Animals.</note> and bring
him to the brightneſſe and light of the
holy Goſpel, and there he is altogether
blind, and of a ſelfe-conceit will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
ſo.</p>
               <p>For during the time that hee doth
foreſee future euents, and alterations of
eſtate, hee is ignorant of his owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
while that he diſcourſeth on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16210:56"/>
the affaires of Kingdomes, hee is a
Slaue to the Diuell: And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
that blind iudgement of his,
dareth conteſt againſt the Euer-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
GOD, the folly and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the children of darkneſſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Diuine wiſedome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Light; and the diſcretion of
man, againſt the Prouidence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.
For the wicked do couer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
with ſilence, craft, and diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
Like vnto little children, which
think that they are ſufficiently hidden,
when their eyes are cloſed; Beleeuing
that no body ſeeth them, when they ſee
no body. But in the meane time, God
perceiueth them both naked, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered;
yea, better then they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.
For God is not onely all hand,
in holding and conducting the whole
Vniuerſe: but alſo all eye, in ſeeing and
diſcerning all things in it. The thickeſt
bodies are to him tranſparant; and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
it ſelfe, is to him light: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> doth iuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
that fooliſh wiſedome in the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16210:56"/>
94. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>Vnderſtand
ye vnwiſe among the people, and ye fooles,
when will ye be wiſe? He that planted the
eare, ſhall he not heare? or he that formed
the eye, ſhall he not ſee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, in this place he calleth them
vnwiſe, not which are fooles, and run
vp and downe the ſtreetes: nor thoſe
priuate and particular men, which are
without Office; nor the heauy-ſpirited
Commons; but ſuch as are crafty, and
manage affaires with dexterity, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
by their ſagacity, to couer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
from the wiſedome of God: or
to dazle the eyes of his prouidence ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred:
Like vnto the moſt dangerous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
which are vnder the appearance of
Coldneſſe: So the moſt ridiculous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
is that which lieth vnder the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of wiſedome.</p>
               <p>It behoueth alſo the Faithfull to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
his meditation, and to be a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the actions and thoughts of men,
and of all the vnprofitable labours of
his life: For it is in humane life, as in a
Faire, where there commeth two ſorts
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:16210:57"/>
of people; one for to buy and ſell, the
other onely to ſee.</p>
               <p>Man that feareth God, is like to one
of thoſe which come to ſee: he is not
there idle, and to ſearch nothing, but to
contemplate the worke of God, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
actions.<note place="margin">Omnia ſub ſole vanitas.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But he may ſay (when he hath ſeene
all the delights that the curious vanity
of men can ſhew forth)</p>
               <p>O how many things are there in this
world, which I haue nothing to doe
withall? What if during this contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation,
ſome one doth iuſtle or throng
vpon him, or if one cut his purſe, that it
doe afflict, or depriue him of any thing?
All that ſuch a one will doe, is, to goe
out of that company; and knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
to be a ſtranger in this world, will
trauell toward his Country, where that
Celeſtiall Habitation is; preſſing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
(as the Apoſtle ſaith) towards
the marke, for the price of the high cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of God, in Chriſt Ieſus.</p>
               <p>If the world contemne him, hee will
contemne that contempt, as knowing
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:16210:57"/>
himſelfe better then the world, and to
be called to a better hope:<note place="margin">Happy the man that followes this bleſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> hee will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme
the promiſed allurements of the
world, vaine; the occupations of men,
baſe and importunate: and, according
to the example of <hi>Mary,</hi> in the tenth
of <hi>Luke,</hi> he will chooſe the good part,
which ſhall not bee taken from him:
concluding all his meditations after the
ſame maner as <hi>Salomon</hi> doth in the end
of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes: The end of all is the feare
of God, and the keeping of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
for in it is comprized the ſumme
of mans beeing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now therefore after all this medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
let vs reſt our ſelues vpon theſe two
Maxime's and Propoſitions, which are
the true foundation that zeale is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
vpon.</p>
               <p>The firſt is, for to loue God, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth
to contemne the world.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, that for to contemne
the world, it is neceſſary for the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to know his own worth, nobleneſſe,
and excellencie of vocation.</p>
               <p>The firſt Maxime is taken out of S.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:16210:58"/>
                  <hi>Iohn,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle: <hi>Loue not the
world, neither the things that are in the
world:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any man loue the world, the loue of
the Father is not in him: For all things
that are in the world (as the luſt of the fleſh,
the luſt of the eyes, and the pride of life) is
not of the Father, but is of the world: And
the world paſſeth away, and the luſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
but he that fulfilleth the will of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth
for euer.</p>
               <p>Nothing doth ſo farre ſeparate vs
from the loue of God, as our affection
to the world; ſeeing that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for to admoniſh vs, doth call the
world, The Kingdome of the Diuell.</p>
               <p>But as the Moone hath no light but
from the Sunne; ſo, our ſoules haue not
any light, but by the regard of God;
and by a conſequent, neither more nor
leſſe: But euen as the Moone doth loſe
her light, when ſhe is hidden within the
ſhaddow of the earth; ſo alſo doe our
ſoules loſe their brightneſſe, (for they
are called in the holy Scriptures, <hi>The
children of light</hi>) when they moleſt and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:16210:58"/>
wrap themſelues within the ſhadow of
earthly things, cares and worldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcences:
which wee ought to tread
vnder our feete, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the Church; which, as it is
vvritten in the 12. of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi>
hath vnder her feete the Moone; that
is, the mutable inſtabilitie of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
things.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe Ieſus alſo would
that the penny ſhould bee reſtored to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe that it had his Image
on it.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore then giue our
ſelues to God, ſeeing that we beare his
owne Image.</p>
               <p>But the inconuenience is, that wee
doe often aboliſh the Image, in rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
it againſt the earth, and polluting
our ſoules with worldly thoughts and
deſires.</p>
               <p>That wee may therefore contemne
the earth, and all that the world doth
promiſe, it requireth that wee come to
the ſecond point, which is, to know per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
what the worth and excellency
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16210:59"/>
of the faithfull is. For when as men by
an vnfriendly amity, and cruell well-willing,<note place="margin">The world's a Where, full of deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſse.</note>
doe ſollicite ſome one to doe
ill, which hath the feare of God, and
to offend his Conſcience, in offending
God, it behooueth the faithfull to think
in himſelfe:<note place="margin">There is no true friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong good men, very ſcant in this Age.</note> What? I that am a Child of
God, and am of a celeſtiall nobleneſſe;
that am one of the firſt-borne, whoſe
names are regiſtred in Heauen! ſhall I
eſteeme the promiſes of the world,
which when they are moſt certain, they
are too baſe for mee to meditate on?
To delude the ſonne of a Prince with
an Apple; To entice with Siluer the
Sonne of the King of Heauen: to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
his Father; and after the example
of <hi>Eſau,</hi> to ſell my birth-right for a
meſſe of pottage? Such perſwaſions
ſhall not by any meanes poſſeſſe mee:
God will not afflict me vvith ſo great a
blindneſſe. We are vnworthy to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of CHRIST, if wee doe not
eſteeme our ſelues to be better then the
world.</p>
               <p>Was it not for the loue of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:16210:59"/>
that the world was framed?<note place="margin">God in his infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ruinates the building of ſinne in the body, to re-build the Soule an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting Manſion in Heauen.</note> Will
not God ruinate it againe, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edifie
for them a faire houſe in Heauen,
where ſhall bee the fulneſſe of glory?
For this Heauen or climate, is inferiour
to the worth and dignity of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of God.</p>
               <p>You that feare God, and truſt in his
Sonne, know, that it is you that vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prop
the world, and that nouriſh the
wicked in it.</p>
               <p>Therefore the enemies of God are
bound in obligation to you. For hee
doth conſerue the world out of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
which he hath towards his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
and elect, whereof ſome are mixed
among the euill, and others are yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne.
It is written in the ſixt of the
<hi>Apocalypſe; That</hi> GOD <hi>doth attend,

               </p>
               <p>And therefore this is one of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
why that Chriſt doth call the
faithfull, The ſalt of the earth; which is
as much as a little part amongſt men,
which conſerueth the reſt, and delayeth
their deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:16210:60"/>
For God conſerueth the ſinfull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the good, to the end that they
ſhould ſerue as medicines to them; and
that the might and power of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries
might ſerue to compell vs to
the feare of God, and to truſt in his
promiſes.</p>
               <p>Such being the excellency of Gods
elect aboue the reſt: it behooueth vs to
reſpect the pleaſures, riches, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the world, as things that are
moſt ridiculous, and as the painted king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
which the Diuell ſhewed vnto
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Like thoſe which from the higheſt
part of the Alpes,<note place="margin">The Alpes be inexaſible high &amp; great Mountains, which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide France from Italy.</note> doe looke into <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pania,</hi>
where the greateſt Cities ſeeme
like vnto little Cottages; how much
leſſe and baſe will they ſeeme then, if
they were diſcerned from Heauen?
From thence therefore it behooueth
that the faithfull contemplate humane
things, and that hee tranſport inſtantly
his heart to Heauen, ſince that there is
his treaſure.</p>
               <p>And conſidering from thence the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16210:60"/>
Palaces of Princes, hee will eſteeme
them as habitations of Ants, and the
turbulent murmuring of men, as the
buzzing of an angry ſwarme of Bees,
and contemplating from thence, vvhat
things are moſt great and apparant in
the earth, he wil ſay, <hi>The vanity of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all is vanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That holy glory will not hinder
Chriſtian humilitie. For wee knowing
the worthineſſe of our ſelues, doe finde
our dignity in <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Repentance doth humble vs, Faith
doth exalt vs.</p>
               <p>If we are nothing before God, wee
are ſomewhat in God, &amp; in his fatherly
affections.</p>
               <p>And therefore in this the faithfull are
contrary to worldly men: for they doe
lift their eyes to heauen by too much
pride, but preſſe downe their heart on
the earth with Auarice and Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency:
whereas the godly on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie,
hath his eyes vpon the earth by
humilitie, as the Publican which durſt
not lift his eyes to Heauen, but hath his
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16210:61"/>
heart in Heauen by faith and hope.
The contempt of this world pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
not out of a loue to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,

produce and bring forth cruell ſorrows

whoſe minde will bee ſo extremely

expreſſed: which may eaſily bee proued
by the continuall experience that wee
haue in worldly things; by this Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,
the greater the contentments are,
the more extreme is the diſpleaſure and

euen as gaine and profit produce fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings

that there is no life, although ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:16210:65"/>
and to adde my opinion to it, I hold,

according to the maxime of

is, is, that this worlds happineſſe and
ioyes are temporall, and limited; and in
the other World, eternall and infinite.</p>
            <p>But to returne to our condition: to
make it appeare vnto you all together
wretched &amp; miſerable; we muſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how time playes with it; ſomtimes
raiſing vs as it were to proſperity, &amp; in a

it ſerueth for a Marke to aime and
leuell at, and an habitation and lodging
of all euils: For hope deceiues our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
vanity flouts it; ambition
mockes it; vices are her beloued chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
and vertues her greateſt enemies:
pleaſure cheates her; the fleſh tempts
her; riches commands her, as her So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:16210:65"/>
and finally, the Diuell main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
a continuall warre with her vntill
her end.</p>
            <p>Let vs iudge then if pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy
become vs well, conſidering all
theſe our infirmities and defaults. Wee
muſt not therefore wonder,<note place="margin">Humilitie, the Queene of Vertues.</note> if Humility
bee the Queene of all other vertues,
ſith Arrogancy hath beene, and is ſtill
Princeſſe of Vices.<note place="margin">Pride, the Princeſse of Vice.</note> I hold opinion with
that worthy Philoſopher, which in one
leſſon only taught all ſorts of Sciences,
comprehended &amp; abridged in that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable
precept and inſtruction of <hi>Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſce
Teipſum;</hi> and truely who in that
knowledge is not ignorant, and that in
knowing himſelfe, will auow that hee
doth not perfectly know himſelfe. The
way that we leade to arriue at this bleſt
iourneys end vnto which wee aſpire, is
moſt long and tedious. So that it vvere
much better for vs to arme our ſelues
with a generous reſolution, to forſake
the world, before it doth leaue and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
vs; for the ſooneſt we can, will
bee late enough, to execute ſo glorious
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:16210:66"/>
an enterprize: For when I thinke and
behold the miſerable ſtate of this tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie
world, and how it is infected
with all ſorts of execrable ſinnes, a
trembling horrour vnties my bodies li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatures,
my very knees beat together,
and I could vnfainedly wiſh my ſinno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wy
ſtructure, to be transformed, into a
lumpe of ſnow, that the ardour of my
ſoules vexation, might diſſolue it into
penitentiall teares: for men do act ſinne
with an auaritious appetite, and all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties
of abominations are lifted to
their Arcticke point. Doth not Satan
coyne them ſo faſt, as men would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
put them in practize? Did pride
euer ſo ſtrut it vpon the Tiptoes, as
now it doth?</p>
            <p>Can the Diuell, out of his ſhape of
faſhions, lay open more Antike-like
formes then are forged on the Anuill
of mans inuention? In Court, the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
are hardly diſtinguiſht from their
followers. In Citie, the Merchant is
not knowne from his Factor. In Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
the Gentry cannot be deſcryed or
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:16210:66"/>
deſcribed from the Ruſticke; and in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
the body publike is ſo ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpred

As for Knight and Taylor, there
goes but a paire of Sheares betwixt
them. How many miſ-ſpend and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely

            <p>Moſt men carry their wealth about
with them, not as <hi>Bias</hi> did, in learning
and vertue; but vpon their back in gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
apparell. Women doe ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
ſophiſticate their beauties, that
one (though <hi>Linceus</hi>-ſighted) can hardly
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:16210:67"/>
iudge, whether they poſſeſſe their own
faces, or no? and, which is more than
moſt lamentable, euery ſnowy-headed
Matron, euery toothleſſe Mumpſimus,
that one may ſee the ſun go to bed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
the furrowes of her forehead, muſt
haue her box of odoriferous <hi>Pomatum,</hi>
and glittering <hi>Stibium,</hi> wherewithall to
parget, white-lime, and complectionate
her rumpled cheekes, till ſhe lookes as
ſmugge as an hanſome painted Cloſe
ſtoole, or rotten poſte. But as for them
that lap vp their bodies in the pleaſant
miſts of aromaticke perfumes, let them
withall ſwallow this Pill: Within a
ſweet and ciuet lurking body, often is
impriſoned a loathſome ſtinking ſoule.</p>
            <p>Murther is accounted but manly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge,
and the deſperate Stabber cares
no more to kill a man, then to cracke a
Flea. Vſurie and Extortion are held
laudable vocations; Couetouſneſſe is
ſtiled thrift; Luxury and whoredome
are reputed but youthfull trickes: And
as for Drunkenneſſe, why that's a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
recreation: Doe not men purſue
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:16210:67"/>
it with ſuch inordinate affection, that
they oft neglect their functions, bid
farewell to that domeſticke care they
ought to entertaine; diſlodge that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
prouidence which ſhould be ſhut
vp in the Cabinet of their reaſonable
part, and ſolely proſtitute themſelues
to quotidian carouſing, till their breaths
ſmell no ſweeter then a Brewers apron,
whileſt their families are wrung and
grip't in the clutches of pouerty, lockt
vp, and impriſoned from thoſe neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
ſupplements, which ſhould keepe
both breath and body together at vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
This is a worthy Fathers opinion:
That a man poſſeſſed with a Diuell,
may be thought to be in a more hopeful
ſtate then a Drunkard: for albeit that
he be poſſeſſed, yet is it compulſiuely,
and againſt his will; but the Drunkard
wholly adopts and dedicates himſelfe,
with all the powerfull faculties of his
ſoule, voluntarily to the ſeruice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan.
S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> likewiſe deſcribes
three fearefull properties in a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard:
It confounds nature, ſaith he, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:16210:68"/>
grace, and conſequently, incurres
Gods wrathfull indignation to be pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out vpon the imbracer thereof.</p>
            <p>Swearing, and blaſpheming Gods
great and glorious Name, is reckoned
for a morall vertue, the grace of birth
and honour, the cognizance of an high-bred
ſpirit.</p>
            <p>What Chriſtian can refraine, (that
hath any ſparke of Diuine intellect in
him) to vnſluce the flood-gate of his
eyes, and let his melting heart guſh
through with teares; when in the ſtreets
he ſhall heare little Children, ſcarce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to goe, or ſpeake, to be vnderſtood;
volley foorth moſt fearefull oathes, and
with ſuch procliuitie, as if they had bin
tutored in their mothers wombes;
whileſt their parents ſtanding by, offer
not to check them, with ſo much as a
ſowre reproofe; but ſeeming rather to
ſolace themſelues in their Childrens
ſinnes, and delight in their owne dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
like thoſe who dye in a <hi>Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
laughter? If the penall Law of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovicus</hi>
were put in practice; who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16210:68"/>
one ſweare, ſeared vp his lips with
an hot iron) ſcarce ten, in as many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,
but would be glad to be in league
with the Apothicaries lippe-ſalue. How
many miraculous Iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts hath God
ſhot out againſt the blaſphemers of his
ſacred Name; whoſe inſtances would
be too prolixious? What ſinne can be
more damnable, &amp; yet more practiſed?
None can ſooner plunge the ſoule into
the implacable gulfe of perdition, and
yet no ſinne, by intentiue endeuour,
more eaſie to be cropt off, and weeded
vp: for that it is no incidentall iſſue of
naturall corruption, but an accidentall
monſter, inegndred of corrupted cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.
A learned Father confeſſeth, That
at euery other word he once vſed to
ſweare, but at length, endeuouring to
locke vp the doore of his lips, to ſet
watch before his tongue; imploying
diuine aſſiſtance therein, and entreating
moreouer his friends to ſmite him with
the rod of reprehenſion; in forty daies
he vtterly loſt the abuſiue vſe thereof:
So that now, ſaith he, nothing is more
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:16210:69"/>
eaſie to me, then not to ſweare at all.</p>
            <p>It is recorded, that <hi>Lewis</hi> the 7. King

Should not then euery Chriſtian labour
to ſet a watch before his mouth, &amp; keep
the doore of his lips, that no rebellious
words ſalley forth againſt his Creator?
If not for feare of temporall Iuſtice,
yet, leſt the God of Iuſtice ſhould brand

appeare triumphantly in the skies, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt
mighty-winged clouds of deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

troupes flocke together, all turning vp
their wondring eyes, to gaze vpon their

afreſh thy paſt committed ſinnes,

Then, O then, will it be too late to wiſh

be reduced to a nullity. What will it

In fine, how will thy ſoule tremblingly

            <p>O thou Vſurer, and thou that grindeſt

Whoſoeuer thou art that canſt preſerue,

            <p>Then O thou gorbellied Mammoniſt,

Then O thou Canker-worme of

            <p>Then will you wiſh (though then too

The ſoundeſt Method therefore, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent

Winds, the breath of his Noſtrils; the
Lightening and Tempeſts, the troubled

his Frownes; that the Heauen is his
Throne; the Earth his Footſtoole: that
he is all in all things; that his omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

ſnaffle vs from ruſhing into damnable
actions, if we vnremoueably ſeat them
in our memories.</p>
            <p>Make then a couenant with thine

on earthly graſſe, ſurfeit on the ſugared
Pils of poyſonous vanities, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibly
hurle downe thy better part
into the gulph of irreuocable damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if not for thy ſelfe ſake, yet iniure
not thy Creatour, who halh drawne
thee by his owne patterne, moulded
thee in his owne forme; and, to make
thee eternally happy, hath infuſed his

by the Philoſophers confeſſion, is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
celeſtiall, no naturall traduction,
and in that reſpect another calls it an
arrachment, or cantell, pulld from the
celeſtiall ſubſtance which cannot ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
it ſelfe within a lumpe of fleſh:
Euen as the beames of the Sunne,
though they touch the earth, and giue

life to theſe inferiour creatures, yet ſtill
reſide in the body of the Sunne whence
they are darted: So thy ſoule, though
it bee ſeated either within the filme of

yet it will ſtill haue beeing whence
it hath its beginning.</p>
            <p>Remember then thy Creatour in the
dayes of thy youth, call vpon him
while it is called to day; for as the Poet
no leſſe ſweetely then diſcreetly ſung,
Who knowes ore night that hee next

            <p>What thanke is it to pardon our

in preuenting him; For as <hi>Iphicrates</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
his Generall, (who asked him
why hee ſurrounded his ſouldiers with
a Wall, when there was no feare of
foe-mens approach?) A man cannot
be too prouident in preuenting obuious
and occurrent dangers. So canſt thou
not bee too cautelous in repelling the
perillous ſtratagems of the Diuels aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults:
therefore may I cloze vp the
precedencie with that worthy ſaying
of a more worthy <hi>Epigrammatiſt,</hi> No
man needes feare, that feares before
hee needes. O cleanſe and purifie thy
heart then by earneſt prayer and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
ciaculations, which is made the
loathſome cage of ſinne, the ſilent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of diabolicall cogitations, and
the diſmall dungeon of malignant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that the Spirit of grace may
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16210:80"/>
there finde harbour, and take delight
to bee thy inmate.</p>
            <p>Remember, O thou mighty man,
that ſwelling titles of Honour are but
the leaues of vanity.</p>
            <p>Remember, O thou rich man, that
terrene and tranſitorie pleaſures are like
the Bee, though they yeeld honey, yet
carry they a ſting, and are but as the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
of the earth, more delectable in
ſhow, then durable in continuance.</p>
            <p>Remember, O thou extortioner, thou
cruell man, thou Murtherer, thou A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer,
thou deceitfull man; thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcionably
deteineſt the hirelings
wages; and thou that acteſt inexora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
villanies ſecretly in the darke, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned
from the worlds dull eye, that
if the Eagle can diſcerne, as one hath it,
the Hare vnder the Buſh, and the Fiſh
vnder the Waues, much more can God,
who is the Creator of creatures, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
the cloſet of thy heart, with his
all-ſeeing eye, and diſcerne thy clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
ſinful practices before, and in their
very conception, and for them hee
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:16210:80"/>
will bring thee to iudgement.</p>
            <p>Remember, O thou that ſwayeſt the
Sword of Iuſtice, to ſtrike or ſaue, as
thou art ſuggeſted by thine owne ends,
profits, or affections, that though thy
couert proiects be not envulgard to the
worlds generall eye; yet a day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelation
will come, when all thy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and priuate practices ſhall bee ſtript,
euiſcerate, and laid as apparantly open,
as the ſheepe vpon the Gambrell.</p>
            <p>But now with reuerence and Doue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
humilitie to you (which are <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uahs</hi>
Embaſſadors) the light of the
world, and ſalt of the earth, doe I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
my ſpeech, muſtered vp in the
meaneſt and mildeſt ranke of words.
O, I could wiſh that all of you ſtood
without the liſt of that reprehenſion of
Vices, which once an ancient and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Hiſtorian twitted the Monkes of
<hi>Canterbury</hi> with. Some riſe early in the
morning, to ſee their hounds purſue the
prey, but not to pray: ſome delight
to catch Fowles, but not Soules; ſome
take pleaſure to caſt a Dye well, but not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16210:81"/>
caſt to die well. Doth the wilde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aſſe
bray, ſaith <hi>Iob,</hi> when he hath graſſe; or
loweth the Oxe when he hath fodder?
But I dare not ſay, No more doe ſome
of you preach, when you haue once got
a Benefice. If there bee any that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
Religion with their Lord, preach
the praiſe of their Patrons; preaching
in the Pulpit, chatter in their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
ſuiting their Linſie Wolſey pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
with their ſeuerall ends: O let
thoſe remember how God met with a
miſchiefe that notorious <hi>Nestorius,</hi> who
for his temporizing inconſtancie, ſet
wormes a worke to eate out his tongue.
O let them looke into the Story of one
<hi>Hecebolus,</hi> a Sophiſter, who accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating
his profeſſion to the faſhions of
the Emperours, fained himſelfe in the
dayes of <hi>Conſtantius,</hi> to be a moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent
Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>But when <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata was
Ruler, preſently he turned Paynim, and
in his Orations proclaimed <hi>Iulian</hi> a
god. And when <hi>Iulian</hi> was dead in
<hi>Iouinians</hi> time, hee would haue turned
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16210:81"/>
backe to Chriſtianitie. Wherevpon for
his mutabilitie and lightneſſe in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
his horrid conſcience draue him
to the Church gates, and there hurling
himſelfe flat, cryed and bellowed with
a lowd voice, Trample me vnder your
feete vnſauoury ſalt that I am; entirely
wiſhing out of his ſoules agony, that he
had neuer ſeene the light; or at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
his tongue had been riuetted to
the roofe of his mouth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly and indefinitely to all; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
ſo to liue, as you ſtill may bee
prepared for the ſtroke of Death: then
will you deſire to be diſſolued, and to
ſleep in peace recluſiuely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſea of earthy carefull miſeries, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
cleerely by the ſpirituall eye of
vnderſtanding, that mans life is a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare,
becauſe it is ſhort and a warfare,
for that it is ſharpe, and that worldly
delights are deceitfull, and of no dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie;
like the water-Serpent, no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
bred, but dead. Collecting likewiſe
out of humane experience, that the beſt
life is but a weary and tedious pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:16210:82"/>
&amp; feeles no touch of true ſolace,
till at the euening of his dayes he lodge
at the Inne of death: for death is the
path of life, a Gaole-deliuery of the
ſoule, a perfect health, the hauen of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
the finall victory of terreſtriall
troubles, an eternall ſleepe, a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body, a terrour to the rich, a
deſire of the poore, a pilgrimage vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
a thiefe of men, a ſhadow of
life, a reſt from trauell, an Epilogue to
vaine delight, a conſumption of idle
deſires, a ſcourge for euill, a guerdon for
good: it diſ-burdens vs of all care, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manacles
and frees vs from vexation,
ſolicitude and ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Of all thoſe numberleſſe numbers
that are dead, neuer any one returned
to complaine of death, but of thoſe few
that liue, moſt complaine of life. On
earth euery man grumbles at his beſt
eſtate.</p>
            <p>The very elements, whereby our
ſubſiſtence or being, as the ſecondarie
cauſe, is preſerued, conſpire againſt vs:
the fire burnes vs; the water drownes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:16210:82"/>
vs: the earth annoyes vs; and the aire
infects vs; our dayes are laborious, our
nights comfortleſſe; the heat ſcorcheth
vs; the cold benummes vs; health ſwels
vs with pride; ſickneſſe empaleth our
beauties; friends turne Swallowes;
they will ſing with vs in the Summer of
proſperitie, but in the winter of tryall,
they will take wings and be gone. Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
brand our reputations with depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
imputations; and the enuious man
hurleth abroad his gins to enſnare our
liues: who would then deſire to liue,
where there is nothing that begets con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent?
for this world is a Theater of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,
a Chaos of confuſions, an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
of miſchiefe, a Tyrant to ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
a breaker of Peace, a Fauorite of
Warre, a friend of Vices, a coyner of
Lies, an Anuile of Nouelties, a table of
Epicuriſme, a furnace of Luſt, a pit-fall
to the rich, a burthen to the poore, a
Cell of Pilgrims, a den of Theeues, a
calumniator of the good, a renowner of
the wicked, a cunning Impoſtor, and a
deceiuer of all.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:16210:83"/>
How is the progreſſe of poore proud
mans life violently agitated (like the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>Euripus</hi>) with contrarious motions?
The pleaſure of the wyly world thus
inueigles him; Come vnto mee, and I
will drowne thee in delight. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of the luxurious fleſh thus
ingles him; Come vnto me, and I will
infect thee; the Diuell he whiſpers this
in his eare, Come vnto mee, and I will
cheate and deceiue thee: But our ſweet
and ſacred Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, with
perſwaſiue inducements thus intreates
him; Come vnto me (I pray thee) that
art heauy laden, and I will receiue and
exonerate thee, and with the mighty
arme of my mercy and compaſſion
lift off that vnſupportable loade, which
cruſheth downe to Hell thy groaning
ſoule.</p>
            <p>Study then to liue as dead to the
world, that thou maiſt liue with God:
for the iuſt man is ſaid, neuer to liue till
after death. Endeuor thy ſelfe to march
faire through this worlds Labyrinth,
not to ſquander and looke aſquint vpon
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:16210:83"/>
the <hi>Circean</hi> allurements thereof. But
without turning either to the right
or left hand, runne ſtraight on in that
Eclipticke line, which will conduct thee
to that celeſtiall Ieruſalem, where (with
that immaculate Lambe Ieſus Chriſt)
thou ſhalt enioy pleaſure without pain;
wealth, without want; reſt, without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
ioy without griefe; and immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue
felicitie without end.</p>
            <p>Moreouer the contempt of the world,
born of the loue of God, ſhall at length
grow to hatred of the world, when
that beſides the vanity and miſery of it,
he ſhall contemplate the miſchiefe and
enmitie againſt the Almighty vvhich
there raigneth; when beſides that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
which ſome doe lay open to the
view of all, hee will repreſent to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
the iniquities which are cloſely
kept, and the Treaſons, Adulteries,
Murthers, which are priuately and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kingly
committed, when he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the vials of Gods wrath and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
powred generally vpon all
man-kinde: for in the conſideration of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:16210:84"/>
this world, it behooueth vs to leaue out
no part of it, but to obſerue all manner
of nations and people: amongſt which
there are many Pagans, which not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a conſequent, but alſo by expreſſe
profeſſion, adore the deuill. The Eaſt
<hi>Indies</hi> dedicate their temples to him, and
reuerence him with all reſpect. The
Weſt <hi>Indies</hi> are afflicted and tormented
ordinarily with euill ſpirits. In moſt
part of the North, lurking deceits, and
aſſuming ſtrange ſhapes, are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
among the Inhabitants. Sorcery
is there an ordinary profeſſion, and the
Diuell reigneth without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
In that Countrey which did once
flouriſh, where the Apoſtles had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſo happily the holy Ghoſt, the
Churches are now changed into Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,
and Temples of Idolatry. In the
Weſt, the head of the viſible Church is
become an earthly Monarch, and banks
are erected in thoſe places, where, in
times paſt was the Houſe of God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
thoſe erroneous and enuious
people are ſcattered the Iewes, which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:16210:84"/>
blaſphemed againſt Ieſus Chriſt, and
hauing perſecuted him in his life, doe
iniuriouſly wrong him after his death.
The Countrey from whence came De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
and Orders for Religion, hath in
it publike Brothel-houſes, and Sodomy
is there an vſuall cuſtome. Here it is
alſo, where doubts in Religion that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
a mans faith, are decided in the
middeſt of corruption. There onely
remaineth in the world a handfull of
people which ſerue Ieſus Chriſt in
truth and verity; and they can ſcarce
receiue breath in this ayre which is ſo
contrary to them; beeing here as fiſhes
without water; as the remainders of
great Maſſacres; as pieces of boords
ſcattered after the breaking of a great
veſſell; and yet neuertheleſſe, among
theſe few that are ſubſtracted out of the
reſt of the world, corruption doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
as a Canker or Vlcer, Quarrels,
Vanity, Superfluity in Apparell, Aua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
Ambition; Sumptuouſneſſe, which
ſpendeth fooliſhly, doth infect the one
part of this ſmall troupe; for GOD
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:16210:85"/>
is ill ſerued in priuate families, their
almes are cold, they pray ſeldome, and
reade neuer: IN briefe, a contagion of
vices by conuerſing with our aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
doth infect vs, which is the firſt
ſteppe to ſuperſtition; for errour creeps
in to vs by vice, and ſpirituall fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by corporall. If therefore where
God is moſt purely knowne, hee bee
there ill ſerued, how much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the reſt of the world? If vices
doe harbour in the Sanctuary, how
much more in the body of the church
and habitation of the wicked? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Chriſt doth rightly call Satan,
The prince of the world; and <hi>Peter</hi> doth
iuſtly write in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts,</hi>
Saue your ſelues from that peruerſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
for Satan lieth in ambuſh for
vs all. This age is infectious, vices are
like vnto glue, temptations ſtrong, our
enemies mighty, our ſelues feeble and
ignorant, and the way of ſaluation nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and full of thornes; And few there
bee (ſaith Chriſt) that finde it: And
thoſe which finde it, doe not alwayes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:16210:85"/>
keepe it; but many hauing knowne the
trueth, doe leaue it, and returne to their
vomit. Let vs know then a place ſo
dangerous, that wee may paſſe by as
ſtrangers, which doe not onely paſſe,
but alſo runne from it, flying from the
world, to come vnto God, for wee ſhall
neuer haue repoſe, vnleſſe wee reſt our
ſelues vpon him. The heauen moueth
alwayes, and yet it is the place of our
reſt. On the contrary, the earth reſteth
alwayes, and yet it is the place of our
motion. The Quadrants and Horolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
imitate the motion of heauen; but
the faith of the beleeuers doth imitate
the Reſt which is aboue all. <hi>Vlyſses</hi> did
more eſteeme the ſmoake of his owne
houſe, than the flame of anothers; How
much more then would he eſteeme the
flame of his owne chimney, than the
ſmoake of anothers? Wee are heere
ſtrangers, this is not our houſe: our ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
is in heauen. Let vs compare
the ſmoake of this ſtrange houſe, and
the darkeneſſe of the earth, with the
beauty and ſplendor of our owne dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:16210:86"/>
which is the in Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen:
Here is the reigne of Satan, there
the Kingdome of God; here is a val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley
of teares, there the height of mirth;
here wee ſowe in ſorrow, there wee
reape in ioy; here wee ſee the light of
the Sunne through two little holes,
which are called the eyes; there wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
light from God on euery ſide, as
if wee were all eyes. Therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
God is all in all; to him be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and glory in this world,
and in the world to
come. <hi>Amen.</hi>
