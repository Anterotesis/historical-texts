            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

whose long stay in viewing

great a good liking of the painters

which then chaunced to <hi>Apelles,</hi> for his Portraites.
For since the world hath vnderstood, (I know not how)
that your Honor had willinglie voutchsafed the acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance
of this worke, and at conuenient leisures fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rablie

haue oftentimes and earnestly called vpon mee, to put it

what your Lordship with some liking had alreadie peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
And therewithall some of them said (either to yeeld

your Honour his due prayse, for soundnes of iudgement;
or to please me, of whome long since they had conceiued

But how bold soeuer I haue bene, in turning out this my

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ourteous Reader, if anie thing herein either
please or profitte thee, afforde me thy good
worde in recompence of my paines: if ought
offend or hurt thee, I desire that thou forget
the one, and forgiue the other. This toye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
liked, the next may prooue better; being
discouraged, wil cut of the likeliehood of my trauaile to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But by that meanes all will be well, and both parties pleased.
For neither shall I repent my labour in the like, nor thou be
anie more troubled with my faultes or follies.</p>
            <p>Yet for this once I hope thou wilt in respect of my trauaile
in penning these louepassions, or for pitie of my paines in
suffering them (although but supposed) so suruey the faultes
herein escaped, as eyther to winke at them, as ouersightes of
a blinde Louer; or to excuse them, as idle toyes proceedinge
from a youngling frenzie; or lastlie, to defend them, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is nothing <hi>Praeter decorum</hi> for a maiemed man to halt in
his pase, where his wound enforceth him, or for a Poete to fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
in his Poëme, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his matter requireth it. <hi>Homer</hi> in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the swiftnes of the winde, maketh his verse to runne in
posthaste all vpon <hi>Dactilus:</hi> and <hi>Virgill</hi> in expressing the stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
downe of an oxe, letteth the end of his hexameter fall
withall, <hi>Procumbit humibos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore if I roughhewed my verse, where my sense was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled,
whether through the nature of the passion, which I
felt, or by rule of art, which I had learned, it may seeme a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
fault; or if it were so framed by counsell, thou mayest
thinke it well donne; if by chaunce, happelie.</p>
            <p>Yet write I not this to excuse my selfe of such errours, as are
escaped eyther by dotage, or ignorance: but those I referre to
thy gentle curtisie and fauourable construction, or lay manie
of them vpon the Printers necke, whom I would blame by his
owne presse, if he would suffer me.</p>
            <p>As for any Aristarchus, Momus, or Zoilus, if they pinch
me more then is reasonable, thou courteous Reader, which
arte of a better disposition, shalt rebuke them in my behalfe;
<pb facs="tcp:11902:4"/>
saying to the first, that my birdes are al of mine own hatching,
and that my onelie ouermuch hast made <hi>Sol</hi> angrie in theire
Birthday; to the second, that although <hi>Venus</hi> be in my verse,
yet her slipper is left out; to the last and worst, that I rather
take vpon me to write better then <hi>Chaerilus,</hi> then once suppose
to imitate <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ouer long, as well for the feare I had to be bitten by
such as are captious, as for the desire I haue to please thee that
art frendlie. But since I now wel remember me, that nothing is
more easlie let flowne, nothing soner dispersed, nothing later
recalled backe againe, then the bitter blast of an euill spoaken
man, and that he, whome it shall hurt, hath no recure but by
patience; I will set it behinde my heele, as a hurt remedilesse,
or els, when it comes, salue it vp with patience.</p>
            <p>In the meane space (curteous Reader) I once againe craue
thy fauourable iudgement: and so, for breuitie sake, abruptlie
make an end; committing the to God, and my worke to thy
fauour.</p>

            <head>Iohn Lyly to the Authour his friend.</head>
            <p>MY good friend, I haue read your new passions, and they
haue renewed mine old pleasures, the which brought
to me no lesse delight, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue done to your selfe
commendations. And certes had not one of mine eies about se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
affaires beene watchfull, both by being too too busie had
beene wanton: such is the nature of persuading pleasure, that
it melteth the marrowe before it scorch the skin, and burneth
before it warmeth: Not vnlike vnto the oyle of Ieat, which
rotteth the bone and neuer ranckleth the flesh, or the Scarab
flies, which enter into the roote and neuer touch the rinde.</p>
            <p>And whereas you desire to haue my opinion, you may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that my stomake is rather cloyed, then quesie, &amp; therfore
mine appetite of lesse force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mine affection, fearing rather
a surfet of sweetenes, then desiring a satisfying. The repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of Loue, wrought in me a remembrance of liking, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
the very vaines of my hearte, I could finde nothing but
a broad scarre, where I left a deepe wounde: and loose stringes,
where I tyed hard knots: and a table of steele, where I framed
a plot of wax.</p>
            <p>Whereby I noted that young swannes are grey, &amp; the olde
white, you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g trees tender, &amp; the old tough, young me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amorous,
&amp; growing in yeeres, either wiser or warier. The Corall in the
water is a soft weede, on the land a hard stone: a sworde frieth
in the fire like a blacke ele, but layd in earth like white snowe:
the heart in loue is altogether passionate, but free from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
altogether carelesse.</p>
            <p>But it is not my intent to inueigh against loue, which wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
account but a bare word, &amp; that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reuerence as the best God:
onely this I would add without offence to Gentlewomen, that
were not men more supersticious in their praises, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are
<pb facs="tcp:11902:5"/>
constant in their passions: Loue would either shortly be worne
out of vse, or men out of loue, or women out of lightnes. I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
none but by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture, nor commend any but by lying,
yet suspicion is as free as thought, and as farre as I see as neces<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sary,
as credulitie.</p>
            <p>Touching your Mistres I must needes thinke well, seeing
you haue written so well, but as false glasses shewe the fairest
faces, so fine gloses ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the baddest fancies. Apelies painted
the Phenix by hearesay not by sight, and Lysippus engraued
Vulcan with a streight legge, whome nature framed with a
poult foote, which proueth men to be of greater affection then
iudgement. But in that so aptly you haue varied vppon wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
I will not vary from you, for confesse I must, and if I
should not, yet mought I be compelled, that to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oue were the
sweetest thing in the earth: If women were the faithfullest, &amp;
that women would be more constant if men were more wise.
And seeing you haue vsed mee so friendly, as to make me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with your passions, I will shortly make you pryuie to
mine, which I woulde be loth the printer shoulde see, for that
my fancies being neuer so crooked he would put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in streight

                  <p>The Author in this Passion taketh but occasion to
open his estate in loue; the miserable accidentes
whereof are sufficiently described hereafter in the
copious varietie of his deuises: &amp; whereas in this
Sonnet he seemeth one while to despaire, and yet
by &amp; by after to haue some hope of good successe,
the contrarietie ought not to offend, if the nature
&amp; true qualitie of a loue passion bee well conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
And where he mentioneth that once hee scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
loue, hee alludeth to a peece of worke, whiche
he wrote long since, De Remedio Amoris, which he
hath lately perfected, to the good likinge of many
that haue seene and perused it, though not fully to
his owne fancy, which causeth him as yet to kepe
it backe from the printe.</p>

the hidden spitefull deceyte of Diana, by whom it
was laied in her way, as Strozza writeth. And hee
enlargeth his inuention vppon the french prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biall
speech, which importeth thus much in effect,
that three things proceed from the mouth, which
are to be had in high account, Breath, Speech, and
Kissing; the first argueth a mans life; the second,
his thought; the third and last, his loue.</p>

abideth more vnrest and hurt for his beloued, then euer did
Laeander for his Hero: of which two paramours the mutuall
feruency in Loue is most excellently set foorth by Musaeus
the Greeke Poet. In the second part he compareth himselfe
with Pyramus, and Haemon king Creons Sonne of Thebes, which
were both so true hearted louers, that through Loue they
suffered vntimely death, as Ouid. metam. lib. 4. writeth at large
of the one, And the Greeke Tragedian Sophocles in Antig. of
the other. In the last, in making comparison of his paynes
in Loue to the paines of Orpheus descendinge to hell for his
Eurydice, he alludeth to those two verses in Strozza,

                  <p>Aetna, called in times past Inesia, as Volaterranus witnesseth, is
a hollow hill in Sicilia, whose toppe burneth continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
the fire being maintained with a vaine of brimstone, and
other such like Mineralles, which are within the said Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.
Which notwithstanding, the bottome of the hill is
verie pleasant, as well for the aboundance of sweete fruites
and flowers, as for the number of freshe springes and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.
The Poetes faine, that when Iuppiter had with
his thunderboltes beaten downe the Gyantes of the earth,
which rebelled against heauen, he did forthwith couer and
oppresse them all with the weight of this hill Aetna. These
thinges being well considered, together with the verse of
Horace;

In the second, he excuseth his fault vpon the maine force

thought good to strike his beloued with the other. But her
brest was so hard, that the shaft rebounding backe againe,

                  <p>This Passion is of like frame and fashion with that, which was
before vnder the number of XLI. whetherto I referre the
Reader. But touching the sense or substance of this Passion,
it is euident, that herein the Authour, by layinge open the
long continued grieuesomnes of his misery in <hi>Loue,</hi> seeketh
to moue his Mistres to some compassion.</p>
               </argument>
               <l>MY humble sute hath set my minde on pride,</l>
               <l>Which pride is cause thou hast me in disdaine,</l>
               <l>By which disdaine my woundes are made so wide,</l>
               <l>That widenesse of my woundes augmentes my paine,</l>
               <l>Which Paine is cause, by force of secreate iarres,</l>
               <l>That I sustaine a brunt of priuate Warres.</l>
               <l>But cease deere Dame to kindle further strife,</l>
               <l>Let Strifes haue ende, and Peace enioy their place;</l>
               <l>If Peace take place, Pitie may saue my life,</l>
               <l>For Pitie should be show'ne to such as trace</l>
               <l>Most daung'rous wayes, and tread their stepp's awry,</l>
               <l>Or liue in woes: and such a one am I.</l>
