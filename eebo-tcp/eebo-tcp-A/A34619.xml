            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BY Encouraging the <hi>Translating</hi> of useful Books, the <hi>French Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> have made an Universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
<pb facs="tcp:54443:5"/>
upon Learning. They have by this Method possest themselves of the Wit, Wisdom, and Experience of all Ages and Climates.</p>
            <p>'Tis no Scandal to take Example by an Enemy, in what is Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable; and our imitating them in this Practise is one way of making Reprizals. I confess, that Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from <hi>French</hi> Originals, are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Advantage of common <hi>English</hi> Readers; but they being the Generality, the Benefit is Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: For which Reason it is not below the Dignity of our Court and Nobility to Countenance such Endeavours.</p>
            <p>'Twas upon this Account that I presum'd to Offer the following Translation to Your Lordship's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, in order to its Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.

            <p>This Piece may be thus Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to our Countreymen, and find that welcome Entertainment which a <hi>Vseful History</hi> deserves. It likewise gave me an Opportunity (as Zeal is always Officious) of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (in some measure) the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect I am oblig'd to Entertain for Your Lordship, as an Eminent <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi> of the Muses. But if I were an utter Stranger to them, I have at least an <hi>Englishman</hi>'s Right of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering my small Tribute of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments among the Crowd of Your Admirers. 'Tis impossible for Sublimest Wits to say what they
<pb facs="tcp:54443:6"/>
ought upon this Theme, and for the Meanest not to say something; since the ablest Panegyrist in At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting Your Character can only speak the Sense of Nations. Even Foreign Courts are sufficiently Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Your Worth; and if any are so little Civiliz'd as to be Strangers to Your Name, they may inform themselves where-ever Good Sense or Gallantry are in any Esteem. 'Tis both Your Happiness and Merit to be Admir'd Abroad, and Belov'd at Home.</p>
            <p>Your Lordship appears so much a Favourite of Heaven and Nature, that I can never think of You with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out calling to Mind that <hi>Horatian</hi> Character of the Roman <hi>Tibullus</hi>; I know not how the Description squar'd with Him; but if it were then a Complimen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:54443:7"/>
the Successor. Courage, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, Magnificence, Justice and Liberality, are deriv'd to You with Your Blood, and, with relation to the Publick, true <hi>English</hi> Principles are Yours by Inheritance. You are happy in Examples of Your Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, and more happy in Personally maintaining the Honour and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of so Illustrious a Family. You preserve with their Greatness, their Condescention and Affability.</p>
            <p>Generous Actions are Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; and when You dispense Your Favours, Your Judgment as well as Generosity is exerted. Want and Merit are ever the Objects of Your Compassion. You have the Art of supporting Grandeur without For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; even Business it self by a peculiar Felicity, sits easie upon You. You manage the Hurry of Affairs with that Tranquility, that is scarce
<pb facs="tcp:54443:7"/>
to be found in the Cell or Cloyster. Your Method resembles that of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whose greatest Progresses are carry'd on with Serenity: The shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowest Streams are always the most noisy; the deeper the Current, the greater the Silence. Your Retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment again is never unactive; and he that follows You to your Retreat, shall find you,

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Life of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> has been inquir'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so long since, that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering my disability to answer the Publick Expectations, for want of all the Memoirs that I stood in need of (for it would require an Age to get 'em all) I design'd to have set forth a Collection of all the Printed Relations of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns, wherein the Prince had commanded in chief, of the Battels he had won, the strong Holds of which he had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master, and of such other Pieces which I had taken care to get together; to which purpose no diligence was omitted, though some of 'em were become very scarce. And there is no question to be made, but that such a Rude Collection alone would have been very grateful. For Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would have been glad to see such a
<pb facs="tcp:54443:9"/>
Prospect of the Atchievements of so great a Hero as the Prince of <hi>Conde;</hi> and the greatest part of those Pieces, though printed long before, would have been No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties to many People. Nevertheless, considering that if those Pieces were read successively according to the Order of Time, and shap'd into a Methodical Form of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, they would please much better, I determin'd to take that course. So that when you find entire the greatest part of those Relations which have already appear'd, and of which some begin already to be quite out of print, you will find an Abstract of the Life of that great Personage suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently guarded with the Circumstances of Relation, and the Principal Matters that compleat his History. We are to inform the Reader farther, That by the Assistance of Particular Memoirs which we receiv'd from several Officers who had serv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Prince, and Letters written by Persons who had free access to <hi>Chantilli,</hi> there are many Circumstances here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned which were never Printed, nor are any other where to be found.

               </note> that tho' the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> has been dead for so many Years, yet no Body attempted any sooner to write his Life.</p>
            <p>He was a Prince whose Life was intermix'd with so many Varieties and Changes of Fortune,<note place="margin">1621.</note> who signaliz'd himself by so many great and glorious Actions, and whose retiring from Business had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing so Heroick in it, that it must be thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that such a History, delightful in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Knowledge of it, could not choose but be acceptable, when inlarg'd into particulars. And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54443:11"/>
it would be so much the more kindly entertain'd, in regard the Publick is encourag'd to believe that some Body will undertake it. For my part I have neither Memoirs anow, nor Ability sufficient to Enterprise so great a Work; so that I shall not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to presume so far. The Design which I propose to my self, is only to collect together such Relations, as have been made from time to time, of the most remarkable Actions of this Prince, and to tack these Pieces in such a manner, one to another, as to make an Epitome of his Life, from his Birth to the time of his Decease: to the end, the Reader may have a view of the Battels which he won, or wherein he signaliz'd his Courage; the Sieges of the Towns which he took, and of the Consequence of those great Victories, to which indeed the Monarchy of <hi>France</hi> is beholding for her Grandeur.</p>

                  <hi>The Birth of the Prince of</hi> Conde.</note>
               <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> the II. of that Name, that is to say, the Hero of whom I am now to speak, was born at <hi>Paris,</hi> the 8<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year, 1621. <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. his God-Father, gave him his own Name, and while his Father liv'd, he bore the Title of Duke of <hi>Enguiens.</hi> This Young Prince was Grand-Son to <hi>Lewis</hi> the I. that famous Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who after the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> II. put himself at the Head of the Male-contents, in the Civil-Wars about Religion, for those Reasons which are known to all the World; and Son of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Monmorenci.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Lewis</hi> I. Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was slain after a most execrable manner, by a Captain of the Duke of <hi>Anjou</hi>'s Guards, <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. who to preserve his Crown, found himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to renounce his Religion, was desirous that the Young <hi>Henry</hi> should be bred up in the same Principles which he had embrac'd himself, and had begun both to practise and profess. To
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54443:11"/>
which purpose, he was put into the Hands of those who were made choice of for his Education. And such extraordinary Care was tak'n to infuse into this Young Prince an early good Opinion and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for the Catholick Religion, that never was any Prince more Zealous then He for the Roman Worship. Insomuch, that it may be said of him, that he was born for the Re-establishment of the Catholick Religion, which the Prince, his Father, would have rooted out of <hi>France</hi>; that he only li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd to defend it; and that he was the Ornament and Glory of it.</p>
            <p>It may be readily conjectur'd by this Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,<note place="margin">1629.</note> that Prince <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Bourbon</hi> was no less desirous that his Son, the Duke of <hi>Enguien,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>His Studies.</hi>
               </note> should be brought up betimes in the knowledge of a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of which himself was in some measure the Support and Column. And he had a Passion so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary for it, that so soon as he arriv'd to be 8 Years of Age, his Father sent him to <hi>Bourges,</hi> to the Colledge of Jesuits, where he was committed to the Tuition of two Persons of that Order, the most able and learned that could be found. Thus the Young Prince continu'd Three Years in that House, going regularly every day to his Form or <hi>Classis,</hi> as well as the Rest of the Inferiour Schollers. And in regard he had a quick and piercing Wit, a retentive Memory, and a great number of Natural Endowments, his Tutors understood so well to cultivate his Genius, that at Twelve Years of Age he was able to discourse of Religion after a very rational manner, and at Thirteen Years of Age, he had improv'd himself so perfectly in his course of Phylosophy, that he maintain'd several <hi>Thesis</hi>'s and Arguments in publick, with that subtlety and solidity that he became the wonder of all that heard him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:54443:12"/>Certain it is, that this Great Prince was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Receptacle for all manner of Sciences and Learning, but his predominant Passion led him to a Martial Life. For that reason he was desirous to understand the Art of War, so soon as he found himself in a Condition to undergo the Fatigues and Hardships that attend it. And he no sooner set forward in that Illustrious Career, but he made surprizing Progresses. His most Early Years were remarkable and signaliz'd with all the happy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages that usually accompany the Infancy of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Men; and the Accomplishment of 'em was so quick, that People had hardly time to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish the Effects from the Hopes.</p>

            <p>All People imagin'd, that upon the Death of that Minister, the Face of Affairs would have strangely alter'd; and that <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. who had been as it were a Slave for twenty Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would take that opportunity to break his Chains.

               </gap>rdinals Death, that now he should begin to be a King, had not however the Courage to shake off so base and ignominious a Yoke; and notwithstanding the aversion he had for the Memory of that Cardinal, he saw himself constrain'd, through his own Cowardliness, not only to dissemble one part of his Sentiments, but to authorize the Disposal, which that Minister had made by his last Will, of the Principal Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and most important Preferments in the Kingdom. In a word, the Kindred and Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> enjoy'd all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which he had procur'd 'em, altogether as pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably after his Death, as they did in his Life-time. And Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who was the only Person of all his Creatures, in whom he most confided, and who was most deeply engag'd in his Interests, was made choice of to Succeed him in the Government of Affairs.

               </gap> according to all probability, there was some Prospect of a suddain Change. For <hi>Lewis</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:54443:14"/>
XIII. had so long labour'd under a decaying and languishing Distemper, that there was no hope of any Cure, and then all People believ'd that so soon as the Queen, or the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> cam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter'd themselves in vain. For Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> who fore-saw every thing that could happen, and who moreover had very powerful Reasons to side with the Queen, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his Authority by that means, made use of all his Power over the King, to infinuate into his mind, that it behov'd him of necessity to declare that Princess Regent.</p>
            <p>The King was no way dispo'd to follow the Cardinals Advice. For besides the little Kindness which he had for the Queen, he was so ill satisfi'd with her Conduct, in regard of the Tyes which he believ'd she had with the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> by the Mediati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dutchess of <hi>Chevreuse,</hi> who was fled for Sanctuary to <hi>Brussels</hi>; and he was otherwise so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posess'd, that out of the design which the Dutchess had to Marry the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> she had had a hand in the Conspiracy of <hi>Chalaes,</hi> Grand Master of his Wardrobe, who would have assassinated him, that tho' he gave great Credit to the Cardinals Advice, yet he would not give him any positive Answer touching that Matter. And indeed the King was at a great loss which way to turn himself. There was no Body could pretend to the Regency, if the Queen were Excluded, or oblig'd to have a Partner; and both the Queen, and the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> were equally hateful to him. But Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> would not be so put off. For in regard he sooth'd the Queen with every thing that could flatter her Hopes, he lost no time either in sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King, or causing him to be importun'd in Favour of that Princess. And the better to bring about his Design, and that at the same time he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54443:14"/>
might have the greatest part himself in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of Affairs, he took a Resolution to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Conditions, so little to the Queens Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. who saw himself just drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping into his Grave, thankt him for having disin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd him out of that Irresolution, wherein he had hesitated so long. For in short, altho' he consent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at last, that the Queen should be declar'd Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent; yet the Power which he gave her was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly limited, that Princess not being able to undertake any thing of her self, without first im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting the Business to the Counsel, of which the Cardinal was to be the Chief, and where things were to be carrid by Plurality of Voices.</p>
            <p>But how disadvantageous soever these Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to the Queen, the King however thought he had done enough, and the Queen, and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, who had their Prospects, and their Ends, were highly satisfid that Things were brought to that point.

that day depended the good or bad Fortune of the Regency. For in short, had the Duke lost that Battel, it would have been impossible for <hi>France</hi> to have stopp'd a Torrent, which would certainly have delug'dall <hi>Champaigne, Picardy,</hi> and the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Consideration of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dangers would have terrify'd any other Person but the Duke of <hi>Enguien.</hi> However, never did any General appear more Sedate, or more Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted. He lay the Night preceding that famous Battel, as if he had not thought of any such thing as fighting, and slept so soundly, that they were forc'd to wake him the next Morning. This Prince, who by that Battel open'd the way for so many others; upon that Occasion acted not only like a Man of his Birth, but like a Common Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer. He was in all places where danger appear'd. He receiv'd several Shot in his Cloaths, and in his Boots; he had a Horse wounded under him, with Two Musket Bullets; and he underwent all the Hazards and Fatigues of Combat, with so much gaiety, and a Look so chearfully unconcern'd, that he was the equal wonder as well of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as the <hi>French.</hi>

               <hi>Don Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco de Melos,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> had re-taken <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>La Bassee,</hi> and won the Battle of <hi>Hannecourt.</hi> The Designs which were laid were vast; nor was his Ambition satisfid with re-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king only those Places which <hi>Spain</hi> had lost. He foresaw that the King's Death would occasion great Troubles in <hi>France,</hi> and the Physitians had all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd his Distemper incurable; and every body was studying to make their best Advantages of the ensuing Minority. The <hi>French</hi> also, who were wont to loose by their Dissentions all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which they us'd to get in their Foreign Wars,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54443:16"/>
were about to have furnish'd <hi>Melos</hi> with a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opportunity to extend his Conquests.</p>
            <p>Upon these Considerations he alters his design of Besieging <hi>Arras,</hi> the Preparations for which had taken him up all the Winter, and he resolvd to attacque <hi>Rocroy</hi>; as being a serviceable Post that gave him an Entrance into <hi>Champaigne,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fit to make a Place of Arms, that lay conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for all his Enterprizes. In a very short time after, <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. dyed, and his Death divided all the Court, as <hi>Melos</hi> well foresaw. The Cabals that were secretly held to get the Regency, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>France</hi> with a General Revolution. All the States of the Kingdom were unwilling to fall again under a Ministry like that of Cardinal <hi>Richlie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> The great Lords and Peers could not be easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to buckle before a Minister, who possess'd a Station, of which every one thought themselves more worthy then himself. The Magistrates were unwilling to depend upon any Person, but the King, in the Exercise of their Duties, and could not brook the receiving Laws from a private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And as for the People, they never fail to charge upon the Counsels of the chief Minister, all the Taxes and Impositions which have been layd upon 'em; and generally all Men are inclin'd to envy the Fortune. and hate the Person of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</p>
            <p>Thus the Remembrance of what was past be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Odious, and the future was to be fear'd; the Present was full of Trouble, and therefore great Care was to be taken of the Kingdom under so great a Change. All People wish'd for a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more Gentle and Free, but no Body agreed upon the means to bring it to pass.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the King, before his Death, had nominated and appointed the Persons that were to compose the Council of the Regency. He had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54443:17"/>
also, at the same time, given the Command of his Armies to the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi>; but to curb and moderate the Early Flames and Heats of Youth, frequently transported with desire of Glory, he gave him the Marshal <hi>de l' Hospital</hi> for his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General and Counsellour. But notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this same Settlement of Affairs, and all the Intreagues at Court, the Queen was declar'd Sole Regent with Absolute Power.</p>
            <p>There was some likelyhood at first, that she would have call'd the Bishop of <hi>Beauv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is</hi> to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry; and she had also some thoughts of procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a Cardinals Cap for him upon the first Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But that Prelat, instead of managing himself prudently and cautiously in the dawn of Favour, went about to ruine all those that <hi>Richlieu</hi> had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd, and by that means drew upon himself a great number of Enemies. Now while he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably endeavouring to overturn all which that Minister had done, <hi>Mazarin</hi> took his Advantage of the whole, and made his Leagues with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that were in most Credit with the Queen. They whom the Bishop sought to pull down had recourse to the Cardinal's Protection. The Q. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fearing least he should create her a great deal of Trouble, took distaste at his Services; finding the Cardinal, at length, much more fit to supply the Place of Chief Minister. And they in whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ided, perswaded her to make this choice so that she resolv'd to send the Bishop back to his Diocess, and openly to declare her Inclinations to the Cardinal.</p>
            <p>At first she met with great Obstacles; the very Name of <hi>Cardinal</hi> dreaded the minds of Men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd past Mischiefs to their Memory, and caus'd 'em to fear worse for the future.

In short, the Grandees, the Parliament, and the People, submitted to the Queens Choice, and all Authority bow'd under the Ministry of Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> tho' he were a Foreigner, and that his Enemies publish'd him to be Originally a Subject of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was a Nation that had no Kindness for the <hi>French</hi>; and tho' but a little before he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd under an Eclipse far distant from so splendid an Elevation.</p>
            <p>The Duke had carry'd himself imprudently in the management of the Enterprize against the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and the Dutchess believing her self more Crafty, and more in the Queens Favour, scorn'd his Submissions.

had put himself into <hi>Arras</hi> at the beginning of the Winter, and had a considerable Body in that place. The Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> stay'd Three Weeks in <hi>Amiens</hi> in expectation of the Forces that were to meet there, and to penetrate the Designs of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: He had also sent <hi>Gassion</hi> to <hi>Dourlens,</hi> with Orders to observe 'em more narrowly.

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> muster'd as many men as possibly he could draw together near <hi>Amiens,</hi> and sent Orders to those that were more remote to join him in his March.

            <p>And now the Prince began to be impatient of coming to a Battel, choosing rather to hazard all, then to bear the ignominy of seeing a Town lost at the beginning of his Command. But in regard the Marshal <hi>de l' Hospital</hi> was altogether averse to this Design, the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> thought it requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to bring that about by Policy, which he was unwilling to over-rule by his Absolute Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>For this Reason he discover'd himself to no Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but <hi>Gassion</hi> only; who being a Man that made slight of the most dangerous Attempts; he had soon brought the Business to the point which the Duke desir'd. For under pretence of putting Men into the Place, he had insensibly drill'd on the Marshal <hi>de l' Hespital</hi> so near the Enemy, that it was not in his Power to avoid a Battel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:54443:18"/>The Army march'd forward to <hi>Guise,</hi> which was a place the most exposd of the Frontiers, and which might have been with ease reliev'd by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But the <hi>French</hi> Vanguard was hardly lodg'd in <hi>Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> was inform'd that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were past by <hi>Landrecies,</hi> and <hi>Capelle,</hi> and that they made long marches toward the <hi>Meuse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This made the Prince believe they had some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign upon the Garisons in <hi>Champaign</hi>; and he had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to fear that he should not be able to overtake <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los,</hi> till the intrenchments of his Camp were finish'd, and perhaps not till he had taken some one of those places, which he knew to be ill furnish'd with Men and Amunition. This foresight caus'd him to send <hi>Gassion</hi> before, with a Body of two thousand Horse, to observe the designs of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>; and to put the Dragoons and Fuzeliers in such places as had most need.</p>
            <p>All this while the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> contriv'd his March with all speed, and the Troops which <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Upon which the Prince laid all thoughts aside, but those of speedily succouring that Place, when the news was brought him that <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIII. was Dead. Perhaps upon the same occasion, any other then the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> would have laid aside his Design of relieving <hi>Rocroy.</hi> His high Quality, his Affairs, the interest of his Family, the advice of his Friends recall'd him to the Court. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, he preferr'd the General Good before his Private Advantages; nor would his eager per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of Honour permit him to take a moments Consideration.

For <hi>Gassion</hi> had march'd with that speed, that being arriv'd at the entrance into the Wood of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> in a very short time after they had posted themselves before the Place, he had put in a hundred and fifty men into it, and had observ'd by the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ituation of the Places, that the whole Success of the Enterprize consisted in passing the Lanes, and presenting the Army in Battel Array between the Wood and the Town.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rocroy</hi> is seated in the midst of a Plain environ'd with Woods so thick, and full of Boggs, that which way soever you go to it, 'tis impossible to avoid very long and incommodious Lanes, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Passes. 'Tis true, that on that side next <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagne,</hi> there is not above a quarter of a League of Wood, and the Lane it self, which is very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of it self, grows broader and broader after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; and the Plain is discover'd by degrees. But in regard the Country is full of heathy Ground, and very Boggy, there is no marching but in small Companies, till you come near <hi>Rocroy</hi> it self, where the Ground insensibly rising is much more dry then in the Wood; and affords a spacious Field sufficient for the drawing up two great Armies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melos,</hi> being arriv'd the 10<hi>th</hi> of <hi>May</hi> before the place, had divided his Army into six Quarters, made his Entrenchments, and plac'd the principal of his Forces on that side next the Lanes and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Passes, contenting himself to secure the rest by the general disposal of his Men; to the end
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54443:19"/>
he might spare that time which is usually employ'd in raising a Circumvallation. Besides these precauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he had observ'd in the Enemies Posts, he found that they had placd a great Body of a Guard upon the Road to <hi>Champagne</hi>: And his Sentinels, and his Scouts were so well laid, that nothing could enter into the Plain but they must have knowledge of it. His Army was compos`d of Eight thousand Horse, under the Leading of the Duke of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> and Eighteen thousand Foot, Commanded by the Count of <hi>Fontaine,</hi> among which were the Select Spanish Infantry.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Enguien,</hi> being inform'd of all these things, call'd together all the Officers of his Army at <hi>Rumigni,</hi> and after he had lay'd before 'em all that <hi>Gassion</hi> had inform'd him, he declar'd that 'twas his resolution to do all that could be done for the relief of <hi>Rocroy,</hi> to which purpose he would pass the narrow Lanes with all the speed he could. That if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> undertook to defend 'em, they must be oblig'd to leave their Quarters ungarded, and consequently there would be a way left open for the Relief, which he intended to put into the Town; or if they suffer'd him to pass the Lanes without fighting, it would prove other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to their advantage, so that the Army having room and space enough in the Plain, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might be induc'd to come to a Battle; or at least that the <hi>French</hi> might be able to take Posts, and fortifie themselves, till they could amply provide for the Relief of the Besieged.</p>
            <p>At last, the Prince told 'em, that the King was dead, and that at such a Conjuncture of trouble and Confusion, it behov'd 'em to hazard all, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then loose the Reputation of the Armes of <hi>France.</hi> That for his part, there was not any thing which he would not venture, to prevent the taking of <hi>Rocroy.</hi> Thereupon they all conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               </note> and so the Enterprise would end in a bickering within the Wood; that in the mean time relief might be put into the Town; and that the Army not being engagd beyond the Pass, it would be easie to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, without coming to a General Battle.</p>
            <p>Upon this a resolution was taken to march di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly toward <hi>Rocroy</hi>: and the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> advanc'd the same day as far as <hi>Bossu,</hi> and dispos'd the Order of his Battle, to the end that every one might prepare himself for an Action, the success of which was of such importance to his Glory and the safety of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Army was compos'd of Fifteen Thousand Foot, and Seven Thousand Horse, and they were to fight upon two Lines, supported by a Body of a Reserve; the Command of which was given to <hi>Sicot.</hi> The Marshal <hi>de l' Hospital</hi> took care of the Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Carbines, the Dukes Guards, and those of the Marshal <hi>de L' Hospital,</hi> together with the remainder of the Dragoons and Fuzeliers were plac'd on the right and left side of the Wings. These Orders being given, the Duke sent away the Baggage to <hi>Aubenton,</hi> and whatever else was useless in a day design'd to fight, and march'd in Battle Array, to the entrance of the Wood.</p>

               </gap>cour which <hi>Gassion</hi> had put into it, the <hi>French</hi> would hardly have had time to raise the Seige. The Garrison was so weak and ill provided, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made no attempt but what succeeded. And indeed they had been rightly inform'd of the bad condition of the place, which made 'em believe that the Town could never hold out till the arrival of any Succour, in regard the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> was at such a distance from them.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> Army was reinforcd by degrees with little Bodies of men which joynd them in their march, which was the reason that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not discover their Strength: besides that Intelligence was hard to come by, in regard the Country was all <hi>French.</hi> So that <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>los</hi> never knew the true number of the Duke of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guien</hi>'s Army, till the very day that they enterd the Pass.

               <hi>Melos</hi> was constrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d to a quick deliberation, whether he should defend the Pass, or whether he should stay in the Plain till they came to Attack him. 'Tis true there was nothing more easie for him to have done, then to have disputed the passage of the <hi>French</hi> Army, by planting his Infantry in the Wood, and supporting them with a good Body of Horse. It was also in his power, by a good management of the advantages which he had of the Woods and Boggs, to have found work enough for the <hi>French</hi> Army with one part of his men, and to have pusht forward the reducing of the Town with the other, which could not have held out above two days longer. This seem'd to be the most certain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54443:21"/>
Course, and every body thought that <hi>Melos</hi> would have taken it. But his Ambition was not be to limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the taking of <hi>Rocroy.</hi> He imagin'd that the winning of a Battle would open him a way into the very Bowels of <hi>France</hi>; and the Victory which he had won at <hi>Honnecourt,</hi> put him in hopes of the same good Success before <hi>Rocroy.</hi> Besides that in hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Fight, he thought he could venture no more then the least part of his Army, and some Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Towns. Whereas by the defeat of <hi>Enguien,</hi> he propos'd to himself infinite advantages, in the beginning of a Regency not well settl'd.</p>
            <p>Upon these considerations <hi>Melos,</hi> who according to the <hi>Spanish</hi> genius, let go the Present, out of an extraordinary greediness after the Future, resolv'd upon a General Battle. And to the end he might the more easily induce the D. of <hi>Enguien</hi> to it, he stay'd for him in the Plain, and made not the least Effort to dispute the Passage of the Narrow Lanes. Not but that <hi>Melos</hi> might have been constrain'd to have done that by Force, which he did of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; in regard that while he stood consulting, the time was almost over for debate. For the formost Troops of the Dukes already appear'd, and the <hi>French</hi> Army had already past the Lanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Melos</hi> could draw all his Quarters together. Nevertheless, had he done in time what he ought to have done to oppose his passage, the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> would have been hard put to it to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orc'd him; in regard there is nothing so difficult as to get clear of long incumbrances of Woods and Marshes in the sight of a Potent Army drawn up in a Plain. However it were, we find that <hi>Melos</hi> had prepar'd himself for a General Battle, since he took all the care he could to get his Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and had sent for <hi>Beck,</hi> who was gone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oward the Palatinate, to joyn him with all speed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54443:21"/>The Duke march'd in Battalia, drawn up in two Columns, from <hi>Bossis</hi> to the entrance of the Pass; while <hi>Gassion</hi> rod before with a Party of Horse to observe the Enemy; and finding the Pass defended with no more then an ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Gaurd of Fifty Horse, he repuls'd 'em, and brought the Duke word how easily he had made himself Master of the Pass.</p>
            <p>In this place it was that the Duke thought it convenient to speak his mind more plainly to the Marshal <hi>de l' Hospital,</hi> because the Marshal saw, that if they advancd forward into the Plain, it would be impossible to avoid a Battle. <hi>Gassion</hi> also usd all his Rhetorick to engage him to it, but still the Marsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l oppos'd him. But the Duke put an end to the Dispute, and told him in a Commanding tone, that he would take the event upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Upon that the Marsh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l no longer contested, but put himself at the Head of the Saquadrons which he was to Command. He then causd the right Wing to advance through the narrow Passes, lodging the Infantry in the most difficult places, to secure the passage of the rest of the Army. At the same time also he advancd with a Party of Horse to a small rising ground, within half Canon shot of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> So that if <hi>Melos</hi> had then Chargd the Duke he had certainly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated him. But immediately the Duke so well cover'd that rising ground, with the Squadrons which he had about him, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not discover what was done behind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Melos</hi> could not imagine that so great a Body of Horse, would have advanc'd so far without being seconded by Infantry; however; all he did was only to try by slight Skirmishes, whether he could open a way to see behind the Rear of the Squadrons: but not being able to break through, he began to think of nothing else but puting his men into Battalia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54443:22"/>Thus both Generals concurr'd in one and the same Design<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> The Prince made it his whole business to pass the Woods, and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>los</hi> labour'd only to unite his seperated Quarters together. The place which the Duke made choice of for the field of Battel was wide enough to range his whole Army in the same order as he had contriv'd before. The ground was there somewhat more raisd then in the parts adjoyning, and extended it self insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into all the rest of the Plain. There was a great Bogg upon the lefthand, and the Wood not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very thick in that part was no hindrance to the Squadrons from drawing into Order. Just op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to that Eminency which the Duke possessd, there was another rising Ground almost resembling it, where the <hi>Spaniards</hi> planted themselves, and made the same Front as the <hi>French,</hi> and between the two Battels a hollowness ran along in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Valley.</p>
            <p>By the situation of this place 'tis easie to judge, that neither of the two Parties could attack each other without ascending. Nevertheless, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> had this advantage, that upon the declensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their rising ground and before their Left Wing, there grew a Cops of Underwood, which descended a good way into the Valley, where it was an easie thing for them to plant Musketeers to gall the Duke as he marchd toward 'em.</p>
            <p>The Two Generals labour'd with extraordinary Diligence to Marshal their Troops as they came se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally up, and instead of Skirmishing, as is usual when Two Armies meet, they spent their whole time in ordering their Men.</p>
            <p>All this while, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Canon annoy'd the <hi>Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of his Army, the Enemy play'd furiously with their Canon, that had it not been for their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Resolution, the <hi>French</hi> could never have kept the Ground which they posess'd. There were above three Hundred Men that day slain and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Canon Shot, among whom the Marqui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About Six a Clock in the Evening, the <hi>French</hi> Army had pass'd the Defile, and the Body of the Reserve being got clear of the Wood, advanc'd to the Ground which was assign'd it. The Duke also, unwilling to give the <hi>Spaniards</hi> any longer time to secure their Posts, prepar'd to begin the Fight; and the Order of March was given throughout the whole Army, when an unlucky Accident not to be foreseen had like to have put all into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Confusion, and given the Victory to <hi>Melos.</hi>

But the Prince having supply'd the void space of the first Line. with some Troops of the second, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> stopt; which shew'd that they had no other intent then to gain Ground to range their second Line.</p>
            <p>There are certain Critical Minuits in War, that flie away with the winged swiftness of Lightning, if a General has not a piercing Eye to watch 'em, and a presence of Mind to seize upon the Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Fortune never sends 'em again; nay, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times she turns with Indignation against those that were so blind as not to lay hold of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. The Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> therefore sent to Command <hi>la Ferte</hi> back again, so that the Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment re-pass'd the Bogg, with all speed, and before Night, the whole Army was re-settl'd in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Posts. Thus, this Accident did but only delay the Battel, and wrought no other Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, only that it gave the <hi>Spaniards</hi> time to spread themselves more at large, and put themselves into somewhat better Order then they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>The Night was very dark, but the Forest being near, the Souldiers kindl'd such a vast number of Fires, as enlightn'd all the Plain, and both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were surrounded with an Enclosure of Wood, as if they had been to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ight in a Box. Their <hi>Corps du Guards</hi> were so near each other, that there was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54443:23"/>
no distinguishing the <hi>French</hi> Fires from the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and both Camps seem'd to be but one.</p>
            <p>So soon as it was Day, the Duke gave the signal to March; and the Duke himself, at the Head of his Cavalry, charg'd a Thousand Musqueteers, which the Count of <hi>Fontaines</hi> had lodg'd in the Wood; and tho' they fought in a place, as it were intrench'd by Nature, and advantageous for Foot, the Attack was so Vigorous, that they were all cut to pieces upon the Place. However, for fear the Squadrons should be Disorder'd, and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, by crossing the rest of the Wood, where that Infantry was Defeated, the Duke, with the second Line of the Cavalry, turn'd to the Left, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Gassion</hi> to lead the first Line about the Wood upon the Right. Thereupon, <hi>Gassion</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Squadrons, marching under the Covert of the Wood, and Charg'd the Enemies Cavalry in Flank, while the Duke attack'd 'em in Front.</p>
            <p>All this while, the Duke of <hi>Albuquerque,</hi> who commanded the Left Wing of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> knew nothing as yet of the first Action, nor had he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen that he might be Attack'd in two places at once. For he rely'd upon the Musqueteers that were lodg'd in the Wood, and cover'd his first Line; to that finding himself in some Disorder upon this Attack, he thought it proper to oppose some Squadrons against <hi>Gassion,</hi> by whom he was ready to be surrounded. But there is nothing so dangerous for a General, as to make great Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before a Potent Enemy just ready to assail him. For those Squadrons, already tottering, were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at the first Charge, and all <hi>Albuquerques</hi>'s Troops overturn'd one another. The Duke see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 'em flie, commanded <hi>Gassion</hi> to pursue 'em, and turn'd short against the Foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54443:24"/>Marshal <hi>de l' Hospital</hi> fought not with the same Success, for having gallopp'd his Horse upon the Enemy, they were out of Breath before they came to join. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> therefore stood firm to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive 'em, and broke the <hi>French</hi> upon the first En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter. The Marshal, after he had fought with an extraordinary Valour, had his Arm broken with a blow of a Pistol, and had the Misfortune to see all his Wing betake themselves to headlong flight. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> follow'd their Blow vigorously, cut some Battallions of Infantry to pieces, gain'd the Canon, and never stay'd till they came within sight of the Reserve, which put a stop to their Victory.</p>
            <p>While the two Wings fought with such unequal Success, the <hi>French</hi> Infantry march'd against the <hi>Spanish.</hi> And already some Battallions were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. But <hi>Espenan,</hi> who commanded the Foot; understanding the Misfortune that had befallen the Left Wing, and seeing that all the <hi>Spanish</hi> Infantry stay'd for him in good Order, and with a more then ordinary fierceness in their Countenances, thought it convenient not to be too rash, but to hold the Enemy in play with light Skirmishes, till he saw which of the two Cavalries had the better.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown all the <hi>Walloon</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Foot, and the <hi>Italians</hi> had betaken themselves to flight, when he perceiv'd the Rout of the Marshal. Then the Prince clearly saw that the Victory depended wholly upon the Troops which he had with him; and therefore giving over the pursuits of the Foot, he march'd behind the <hi>Spanish</hi> Battallions, against their Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which gave Chase to the Left Wing of the <hi>French</hi> Army; and finding the Enemy Disorder'd by the pursuit, he easily put 'em to a total Rout.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:54443:24"/>
               <hi>La Ferte Seneterre,</hi> who was taken Prisoner in the Rout of the Left Wing, where he fought with an extraordinary Courage, was found wounded in several places, and rescu'd by the Duke. Thus the Right Wing of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> enjoy'd their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory but a short time. They that pursu'd were now forc'd to flie themselves; and <hi>Gassion</hi> meeting 'em in their flight, put the greatest part of 'em to the Sword.</p>
            <p>Of all <hi>Melos</hi>'s Army, there now remain'd only the <hi>Spanish</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oot; and they were serrid in one Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy together near the Canon. More then that, the good Order which they kept, and their sower Looks, shew'd that they would sell their Lives at a dear Rate. They were commanded by the Count of <hi>Fontaines,</hi> who was one of the greatest Captains of his Time, and tho he were forc'd to be carry'd in a Chair, because of his Infirmities, yet he would be every where giving Orders.</p>
            <p>But the Duke understanding that <hi>Beck</hi> was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with Six Thousand Foot toward the Entrance of the Wood, never stood to consider whither he should Charge the Infantry or not, tho' he had but a small number of Horse with him. The Count of <hi>Fontaines</hi> also stood him with a brave Resolution, not suffering his Men to Fire till the <hi>Fernch</hi> were within Fifty Paces of him. But then his Battallion open'd, and of an Instant a Discharge of Sixteen Canon, laden with Cartouches, saluted the <hi>French</hi> Infantry, which was accompany'd with a showre of small Shot, as thick as Hail. This was such a terrible welcome that the <hi>French</hi> were not able to brook it, so that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had had but Horse to have follow'd their Blow, the <hi>French</hi> Foot could never have been rally'd.</p>
            <p>But having no Horse to disturb 'em, the Duke soon rallyd 'em again, and brought 'em on to a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond attack; which had the same Success as the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54443:25"/>
former: and in short, he charg'd those <hi>Veterane Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> Three times without being able to break 'em. But then the Body of the Reserve came up, and several Squadrons returning from the pursuit of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Horse re-joyn'd the Prince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s Body. And then the <hi>Spanish</hi> Infantry being surrounded on every side, and overlay<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d with Multitude, was constraind to give way to Number. So that the Officers layd aside all Thoughts of any longer defending them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but by the motion of their Hats made a sign of calling for Quarter.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Prince advancing to receive their Parole, and give them his, the <hi>Spanish</hi> Foot thought that the Prince had been going to make another Attack upon 'em, and upon that mistake discharg'd a full Volly at him, which was the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test danger he was in, during the whole bloody Work of the Day. Which his men perceiving, and attributing it to the Treachery of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> chargd 'em on every side without expecting any Orders, and reveng'd the Risco which their General had escapd, with a most dreadful Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> pierc'd into the midst of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Battallion, killing all that stood in their way, and notwithstanding all that the Duke could do, gave Quarter to none, but more especially to the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> who are usually more Merciless then the <hi>French</hi> The Prince flew about every where, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Souldiers to give Quarter: The <hi>Spanish</hi> Officers also, and likewise the Common Souldiers, crowded about him for shelter, and <hi>Don George de Castelui,</hi> Camp-Master, was taken by his own hand. In short, all that could escape the Fury of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ran in heaps to beg their Lives of him, and beheld him with Admiration.</p>
            <p>So soon as the Prince had given Orders for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the Prisoners, he made it his Business to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54443:25"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Fugitives, told the Duke, that <hi>Beck</hi> made no haste to come out of the Forest, only contented himself to pick up the shatterd Wrecks of the Defeat. That he had done it in so great Disorder, and with so little Knowledge of the Advantages he might have made of the narrow Passes of the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, that any one might plainly perceive that the Terrour of <hi>Melos</hi>'s Men, had struck his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the same dismay. In a word, after he had savd some remnants of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army, he retreated with an incredible precipitancy, leaving behind him two pieces of Canon.</p>
            <p>The Duke finding his Victory absolutely secure, fell upon his Knees in the midst of the Field of Battel, commanding all his Men to do the same, and gave God Thanks for his great Success. And certainly all <hi>France</hi> was no less obligd to pay her Thanksgivings to Heaven, and her Thanks to Him. For assuredly it may be said that for many Ages, <hi>France</hi> had never won a Battel more Glorious, nor of greater Importance.</p>
            <p>And indeed great Actions were perform'd on both Sides. The Valour of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Infantry can never be sufficiently applauded. For it is a thing but rarely heard of, that after the Rout of an Army, a Body of Foot deprivd of Cavalry, ever had the Resolution, in open Field, not only to stand One but Three Attacks, without being so much as stirr'd; and it may be truly said, that if the Reserve had not come up, the Prince as Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as he was over the rest of the Army, could never have broken that stout and Courageous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:54443:26"/>One extraordinary Action of the Regiment of <hi>Velandia</hi> was remarkable. In the first Onset which the Duke made on that Regiment, the Musketeers being cut in pieces, and the Body of Pikes being surrounded on every side by the <hi>French</hi> Horse, they made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low retreat, in a Body, to the Gross of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Infantry.</p>
            <p>When the Left Wing of the <hi>French</hi> was broken, Word was brought to <hi>Sirot</hi> that he should save the Body of the Reserve, and make his escape; that there was no other remedy, in regard the Battel was lost. To which he answer'd, without being mov'd in the least, <hi>'Tis not yet lost, because</hi> Sirot <hi>and his Companions have not yet fought.</hi> In short, his Courage contributed very much to the Victory. But by the report of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themselves, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing appeard so worthy of Admiration as the Presence of Mind, and Sedateness of the Duke, in the hottest Fury of the Battel: particularly when the Enemies left Wing was broken; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of greedily following the pursuit, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently turnd upon their Infantry. By which reserv'd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness he kept his Men from breaking their Order, so that he was in a Condition to assail the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cavalry who thought themselves Victorious. <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> won Eternal Honour, and the Duke gave him great Marks of his Esteem. For upon the Field of Battel it self, he promisd to procure him a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal of <hi>France</hi>'s Battoon, which the King granted him some time after.</p>
            <p>Of Eighteen Thousand Foot, of which <hi>Melos</hi>'s Army consisted, there were above Eight Thousand slain upon the Place, and near Seven Thousand Prisoners. The Count of <hi>Fountaines,</hi> Camp-Master General, was found dead near his Chair, at the Head of his Men. The Loss of him was a long time after bewaild by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> applauded his Courage, and the Prince himself said,

            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> also lost Eighteen Pieces of Canon, and Six Battering Pieces, Two Hundred Colours of Foot, and Sixty of Horse.

            <p>His Cavalry re-join'd him in the same Place, but the Foot were utterly ruind, and the following Campaigns made appear the Vastness of the Loss, which <hi>Spain</hi> could never yet repair. So true it is, that a good Army of Foot cannot be too carefully preservd, whether in War or Peace; seeing it is not in the power of the greatest Kings, in a long time to recover a lost Body of Old Officers and Souldiers, accustom'd to fight together and endure the Fatigues of War.</p>
            <p>The Duke, after he had stayd at <hi>Rocroy</hi> Two days, led his Army to <hi>Guise,</hi> the same way that he came. There he rested some days, during which the Prince prepard every thing ready to enter the Enemies Country. For in regard the Magazines had been only provided for the Defensive part, there was a necessity of Storing up Provisions and Ammunition, in the most advancd Places of the Frontiers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54443:27"/>
               <hi>Flanders</hi> lay open on every side; which way soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Duke had a Design to Lead his Victorious Army, there was nothing to oppose his Passage. He might either attack <hi>Mets,</hi> or the Towns upon the <hi>Scheldt,</hi> or the <hi>Moselle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was also great probability that all these Enterprizes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> might prove extreamly Beneficial.

So that there wanted both Time, Money, and Negotiations, to vanquish the Mistrusts and Jealousies of the <hi>States-General,</hi> and engage em to lend their Ships; so that the Duke gave over that Design.</p>

any thing more Advantageous then the Siege of <hi>Thionville,</hi> to the end that by possessing himself of this Place, he might hinder the Enemies Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication between <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and by this Conquest settle the posture of his Affairs, against the next Campaign, for greater Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>It was easie to furnish his Army with Subsistance on that side next <hi>Champaign.</hi> All Preparations ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for a great Siege had been Stord up there during the Winter.

But the Kings Death having overturnd all those Projects, and the Army in <hi>Italy</hi> being too weak to keep the Field, <hi>Meilleray</hi>'s Forces were parted into Two Bodies. One part pass'd the <hi>Alps</hi> under Viscount <hi>Turenne,</hi> and the other commanded by the Marquiss <hi>de Gesvres,</hi> servd under the Duke. Nevertheless, it requir'd time to fetch out of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,</hi> all the Ammunition and Train of Artillety. And therefore the Duke would not encline toward <hi>Thionville,</hi> for fear General <hi>Beck</hi> should reinforce it with Men.

            </p>
            <p>He sent strong Parties from <hi>Binch,</hi> to the Gates of <hi>Brussels,</hi> and struck a Terror into the Cities that lay most remote. But at length, word being brought him that every thing was ready in <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign</hi> for the Siege, and that the Marquiss of <hi>Gese<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> was arrivd with the Body under his Command; the Duke set forward from <hi>Binch,</hi> and return'd by the way of <hi>Barlemont</hi> and <hi>Mauberge,</hi> re-entring into the Plain of <hi>Roeroy,</hi> through the same Pass, thorough which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> retreated after the loss of the Battel.</p>
            <p>Upon his departure, he sent away <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>All these things were executed according to the Duke's Orders. Nevertheless <hi>d' Aumont,</hi> and <hi>de Gesvres</hi> did not arrive before <hi>Thionville,</hi> till Two days before the Prince. For, notwithstanding the great falls of Rain, and the Hardships which the

Foot suffer'd in their March, he was but Seven days marching between <hi>Binch</hi> and <hi>Thionville</hi>; choosing some of his way through the Country of <hi>France,</hi> the more to conceal his Design, and passing the <hi>Meuse</hi> at <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This Town is Seated upon the Banks of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selle,</hi> on <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> side; not above Four Leagues below <hi>Metz.</hi> The Plain where it is Seated is very fertile; and Border'd on Two sides with little Hills cover'd with thick Woods. The Advantage of the Place, and Beauty of the Country, was the reason that great Expence and Art had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow'd upon the Fortifications of it. It had been all along in the Possession of the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> only when it was taken by the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the II. till the First Treaty of <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The <hi>Moselle</hi> secures it wholly on the one side; so that on that side there is only one Rampart termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in a right Line. The remaining Circuit is fortifi'd with Five great Bastions, lin'd with Free-Stone, and Two Demi-B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>stions at the Two Ends that re-join the River. The Mote is large, deep and full of Water. The Counterscarp is very broad, and the Courtins cover'd with Five Half Moons; and before the Gate on that side next to <hi>Cirque,</hi> stands a great Horn-work. The Country round about it is so plain and level, that there is no approaching the Town without being expos'd to great and small Shot; and the adjoining Hills command the Plain in several Parts, which makes the raising a Circumvallation difficult. There were Eight Hundred Foot in the Town, and Store of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54443:29"/>
Ammunition and Provisions when the Duke sate down before it.</p>
            <p>So soon as the foremost Troops began to enter the Plain, he caus'd the Commander <hi>Grancy</hi> to pass the River, with the Cavalry, to hinder the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of any Relief, before the Quarters were as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd. This <hi>Grancy,</hi> had commanded at the First Siege in 1639. and was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ully acquainted with the Situation of the Places and Passes, through which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could steal in Relief. But many things happen in War which all the Prudence of a General, and his Principle Officers, cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>While <hi>Grancy</hi> pass'd the River, the Prince stay'd in the Plain, and as his Forces came up, order'd 'em to be posted in all the Avenues which were most to be suspected; referring till the next day the Appointment of their several Quarters, and the Settlement of the Camp. The whole Army also stood to their Arms all that Night, without hearing the least News of the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> Yet by break of day word was brought to the Duke, that a Reinforcement of near Two Thousand Men was got into the Town, through the Count of <hi>Gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y</hi>'s Quarters.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Count had plac'd his <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> with all the Care imaginable; besides that he visited all the Posts himself, with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Vigilance. Nor had he had any Alarum all the Night long. However, an Hour before day one of his Parties brought Two Country-Men to him, who affirm'd that some <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss'd the River at <hi>Cirque,</hi> and that they march'd along the Bank of the River, and got into <hi>Thion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e</hi>; and they told their Story with so many Circumstances, and so much Probability, that <hi>Grancy</hi> believ'd 'em. At the same time therefore he chang'd the Order of his Guards, and leading
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54443:29"/>
all his Forces to that Place which the Peasants had describ'd to him, he left but Two Regiments to Guard the Post toward <hi>Mets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In short, Two Thousand Men had pass'd the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at <hi>Cirque,</hi> but they took another way, then that which the Peasants Information mention'd. For, instead of keeping close to the River, they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a compass round about the Wood to enter into the Plain on that side next <hi>Metz.</hi> And indeed the <hi>Spantards</hi> perform'd their Business with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Diligence and Courage, so that by peep of day they were discover'd, marching directly to the Half-Moon; so that the <hi>French</hi> Guards, astonish'd at this Alarum, Charg'd the Relief too late, and with some Disorder. And whether the <hi>Spaniards</hi> perform'd any Exploit more remarkable then usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or whether the Guards were remiss in their Duty, that Reinforcement enter'd <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>onville</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any loss.</p>
            <p>The Duke was not a little displeas'd at the News; he saw it would much retard the taking of the Place, and by Consequence delay those other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests which depended upon this, if it did not quite put 'em off till the next Campaign. A place like <hi>Thionville</hi> well fortifi'd and defended by a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Garison, could not be carry'd in a small time, nor without a great Loss of Men. But all these Inconveniencies did not hinder the Prince from continuing the Siege: On the contrary, he apply'd himself to it with so much the more Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, as the peril and difficulties were the greater which he had to surmount. He foarded the River that he might be able to assign his Souldiers their Posts on that side, and he order'd Two Bridges of Boats to be made both above and below the Town. After he had Lodg'd his Men also in Two little Villages on that side next <hi>Lorraine,</hi> he appointed the Guards, and mark'd out the Place where he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54443:30"/>
would have the Line of Circumvallation drawn along; which done, he re-pass'd the River to give the same Orders on <hi>Luxemburgh</hi> side.</p>
            <p>Immediately he divided his Army into Five Quarters. The greatest Body of his Horse he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd in a Meadow, along the River, on that side next <hi>Mets</hi>; where <hi>Gassion</hi> was also Quarter'd to Command 'em. The Head Quarters were taken up near <hi>Gassion</hi>'s, in a small Village, almost a Mile from the Plain, upon the Bank of a Rivolet which crosses it, and which falls into the <hi>Moselle</hi> at the Foot of the Counterscarp of <hi>Thionville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There the Duke Lodg'd himself, with the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Body of the Infantry, and extended his Camp into the Plain, as far as the Foot of the Mountains; and the Regiments of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lves upon the rising Grounds, near the Woods, with which the Hills were cover'd.</p>
            <p>There was one much higher then the rest, which Commands not only all the Plain of <hi>Thionville,</hi> but all the Hills that lie round about it. The Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of that place constrain'd the Duke to settle there a Powerful Quarter; for which the Camp was mark'd out in the middle of the Hill, and <hi>d' Aumomt</hi> had the Command of it. <hi>Dand<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>res</hi> undertook with his little Army to Guard that side next to <hi>Cirque,</hi> from the River to the rising Grounds. <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luau</hi> and <hi>Sicot</hi> had the Care of all that lay beyond the River, in regard <hi>Grancy</hi> was fallen Sick, and had left the Camp.</p>
            <p>So soon as the Quarters were dispos'd, the Duke order'd the Line of Circumvalation to be cast up, and large Forts to be trac'd out upon the rising Grounds, which commanded the greatest part of the Plain. At the same time he also secur'd his Line

with Redoubts, supplying the weakest parts with sharp pointed Piles of Wood; and Pallisadoes.</p>
            <p>All this while the Convoys arriv'd from all parts with Amunition and Provisions; and for twenty days together that the Circumva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the other side, the Besieged prepar'd all things necessary for their Defence; and while their Infantry was imploy'd in raising new Works, and repairing the Old, their Cavalry Sally'd out every day to annoy the Besiegers.</p>
            <p>The Sally which they made two days after the Division of the Besiegers Quarters, was so vigorous that they came on so far as the Duke of <hi>Engui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> The Plain was every day full of Skirmishes, and some of them happen'd to be such obstinate Conflicts, that as many men were lost on both sides as in many more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ble Encounters. But the last was the most vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous of all. For at the time that the Duke was providing a great number of Gabions and Faggots near a Chappel in the midst of the Plain; the Besieg'd, resolving to see what he was doing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Afternoon was almost spent in skirmishing, when the Duke incens'd to see the Enemy keep the Plain so long, commanded <hi>Dandelot</hi> to drive 'em into the Town. <hi>Dandelot</hi> perform'd his Orders with extraordinary Courage, but with great precepitancy, for that he could not be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd but by a small number of Volunteers: the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:54443:31"/>
Skirmishers also gave way upon the first Charge that he made, and retreated under the Counterscarp of the Town, but then the Squadrons that were to s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond 'em advancing, <hi>Dandelot</hi> found himself sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded on every side, and he had been taken, but for a small Guard of thirty Troopers led by <hi>Mous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saye,</hi> who rescu'd him out of the hands of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>However those Squadrons still prest upon <hi>Dande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lott</hi> and <hi>Moussaye,</hi> with so much vigour, that they could never have made good their Retreat, had not the Duke ran to the main Guard, and brought it on himself in all hast to their relief. <hi>Gerze</hi> and <hi>Dandelot</hi> were wounded; and so the <hi>Spaniards</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd after an obstinate Combat.</p>
            <p>However all this could not prevent compleating the Circumvallation, nor fortifiing the Camp with all things requisite, the Duke being every where present, as well to encourage the Workmen, as to observe what places were most proper to make his Attacks. And after due consideration he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd upon two; Both upon the Face of one of the two Bastions, that lookt toward the middle of the Plain, to the end that being near together, they might the more easily support each other.</p>
            <p>There was a wide space left between the two openings of the Trenches, and that space lessend, as the Trenches advanc'd toward the Town: One of these Trenches cover'd it self to the Right, and the other to the Left, and the Regiments of <hi>Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the night time two Great Shouldrings of Gabions were rais'd, which cover'd two places of Arms, wide enought to contain each a hunderd Horse; for that they stood in need of Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Trench, to support it against the terrible Sallies of the Enemy. The same Night the Duke order da long Line to be drawn, and two Redoubts to be begun, Spacious enough to lodge a hunderd
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54443:31"/>
Men: and in all the returns of the Lines he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd large places of Arms to be made, and that that Trench should be carry'd on with all speed; so that maugre the continual firing of the Besieged it was advancd the fourth Night within two hundred Paces of the Counterscarp.</p>
            <p>In that part the Duke resolv'd to have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between the two Attacks, which were already in good forwardness. And instead of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Communications with the usual Line, he joyn'd 'em together with a large Battery of four and twenty Pieces of Cannon. The diligence of the Officers was so great, that the sixth Day after the Trenches were open'd, the Cannon began to play upon the Town. In the same place of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication also, the Two Batteries took a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent way, and separated at some distance one from the other, to turn themselves toward the Face of the two Bastions which were opposite to 'em.</p>
            <p>On the right Hand of the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi>'s Trench, stood a Mill, upon the Rivolet already mention'd, which was fortifi'd with a good Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sado, and wherein the Besieged had planted some Musketeers, who very much annoy'd the carrying on of the Trenches, in regard they had a view of 'em behind. Ther upon, the Duke resolving to clear that Post the same Night, which was the Seventh after the opening of the Trenches, order'd it to be Stormd, notwithstanding the obstinate Resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Besieged, and their continual Firing from the Rampart and Counterscarp. And before Day, this Lodgment was join'd to the Trench by a Line, and the Mill serv'd the Besiegers, instead of a Redoubt, against the Sallies out of <hi>Mets</hi>-Gate.</p>
            <p>At the other Attack, the Line was carry'd on with equal Diligence; but the Eighth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>Day the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged made a furious Sally upon <hi>Dandelot,</hi> who was
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54443:32"/>
upon the Guard, with the Regiment of <hi>Harcour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</hi> And while all the Cavalry that belong'd to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged fought against the Horse that seconded the <hi>French,</hi> their Infantry powr'd upon the Head of the Works, and forc'd the Out-guard to retreat to the Battery. Thereupon, <hi>Dandelot</hi> who was in the other Attack near the Prince, marchd along the Counterscarp to Succour the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ench</hi>; so that the Besiegd, fearing to be intercepted, retreated in great haste. The Horse-Guard also being rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcd with some Cavalry from the Camp, repell'd the Town-Cavalry to the very Barricados of the Gate, and the Infantry was forc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d back by <hi>Dandelot</hi> to the Counterscarp.</p>
            <p>But the more the Duke labour'd to advance the Works, the more the Besieged re-doubl'd their Efforts. For before the Besiegers were got to the Counterscarp, they had cut in the <hi>Glacis</hi> a second Covert-way well Pallisado'd, and more difficult to take, then that of the Counterscarp; in regard the Defence it obtain'd from the Town was nearer, and had a greater power to cut off those that came to attack it. Nevertheless, the Ninth Night, this new Covert-way was carry'd on two sides. But it cost the Lives of a great many Men, and it was impossible it should be otherwise, when Men are to be Lodg'd at the Foot of a <hi>Glacis</hi> of a Counterscarp open on every side to the Enemies Defence. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rest, <hi>Perseval,</hi> who had the Leading of the Duke's At<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ack was here mortally wounded.</p>
            <p>This Lodgment of great Importance being made, they labour'd in the next place to Lodg themselves upon the Counterscarp; to which purpose, upon the Tenth Night Musketeers were planted on the Right and Left to support the Enterprize, which was put in Execution the Eleventh Day. They who understand what belongs to War agree, that there is nothing more difficult in Sieges then Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54443:32"/>
upon Counterscarps, when the Besiegers are resolv'd to carry it by the point of the Sword, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of making use of the longer delays of Sap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping and Mining. That of <hi>Thionville</hi> was very strong, by reason of the breadth of it, and the Traverses which the Besieged had made in it: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, that it was not an easie thing to choose out a Place proper to make a Lodgement; for whether you made it opposite to the Face of the Half-Moon, or the Bastion, the Besiegers Works must lie open to one of those two Fortresses.</p>
            <p>But notwithstanding all these Difficulties, a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution was taken to force the Covert-way in those Parts which lookt toward the Face of the Bastion. For the Duke was of Opinion that while the two Trenches gave their Onsets both at a time, they that defended the Counterscarp would give way, for fear of being enclos'd betwee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the two Attacks, and so the Lodgement might be made by Shouldrings, high-raisd, to cover 'em against the Defenses of the Bastions, and the Half-Moon.</p>
            <p>Upon the Night appointed for this Attack, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenan</hi> commanded the Right, and <hi>Gesvres</hi> the Left; and so soon as the Signal was given, their Men marchd directly to the Palisado's; at what time the Granadeers, that were foremost, fir'd their Granadoes so furiously, that the Besieged could not make much Resistance; but observing in their Retreat, that they who oppos'd the Marquiss of <hi>Gef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Espenan,</hi> who met with no other Opposition then that of the Half-Moon and Bastion, began his Lodgement; but <hi>La Plante,</hi> who perform'd the Duty of an Engineer in that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54443:33"/>
Action, was wounded, while he was tracing out the Work. This Accident put those that carry'd the Materials into Disorder; for the Line was but half drawn; no Body knew where to throw the Faggots, nor how to go about to begin the Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And indeed, a good Ingeneer, is as one may say, the Soul of an Attack; nor can they be too much valu'd who have both Courage and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to acquit themselves well of such an Employment.</p>
            <p>To this part therefore the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> flew, and set all the Tayl of the <hi>French</hi> at work to carry empty Barrels, Faggots, Sacks of Earth, while some of the Officers trac'd out the Lodgment as well as they could. In this Lodgment, such as the Disorder would permit 'em to make; Fifty Men secur'd themselves before Day-break, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more strongly fortifi'd themselves with Blinds and <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Two pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wood five or six foot long, set up an end upon a Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse five or six foot one from the other, the Spaces being fill'd with Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins.</hi>
               </note> Chandeleers, in such Places where they saw themselves expos'd. Thus the Duke became Master of the Covert-way; nor could the besieged any longer defend their Traverses between the two Attacks.</p>
            <p>The Nights following, they did nothing but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their Lodgments; to the end they might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the point of the Half-Moon and the Bastions. But so soon as they had lodgd themselves before the Face of the Half-Moon, the D. gave Orders for making a Descent into the Mote: He also caus'd a vast number of Faggots to be thrown into it to fill it up, and at the same time the Miners went down. But the besieged had made a little Lodgment with Barrels of Earth upon the <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>A way three foot broad, at the foot of the Rampart, between the Rampart &amp; the Moate.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Berme</hi> of the Half-Moon, which sometimes with Bombs, sometimes by stroak of Hand hindred the Miners from Lodging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. The Duke therefore seeing that unless he could destroy the Lodgment upon the <hi>Berme,</hi> with his Canon, it would be impossible to secure the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54443:33"/>
caus'd a Battery to be rais'd of Four Pieces of Canon, against the Face of the Half-Moon, which ruin'd the Lodgement upon the <hi>Berme</hi> in a short time.</p>
            <p>The Works of the other Attack were advanc'd very far, and the Lodgments were enlarg'd in such a manner to the Right and Left, that the Batteries design'd to ruine the Flanks were rais'd almost the same day. The Lodgments clos'd together at the head of the Half-Moon, and in less then Eight days the Counterscarp was secur'd. And then it was that they began their Descents into the Moat, just opposite to the Faces of the Bastions; and the Duke orderd the Materials to be got ready for building Galleries.</p>
            <p>This is a Work long and difficult, when the Moat is wide and deep, like that of <hi>Thionville.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the Impatience of the <hi>French</hi> will not permit 'em to use all the Precautions which the Art of War requires for the sparing the Lives of Men. Till the Siege of <hi>Hesdin,</hi> they contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with only filling up the Moat, by throwing Faggets into it at hap-hazard, without covering themselves either above or in the Flanks. The Marshal <hi>de Meil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eray</hi> who commanded at that Siege, being assisted with all things necessary to procure his good Success, and having in vain attempted all the usual ways to Pass the Moat made use of a means till then unknown in <hi>France.</hi> For <hi>Courteilles</hi> found out the Invention of a Gallery of Bavins, so inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niously contriv'd, that it was fortifi'd with a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and Parapets like a Gallery of Earth.</p>
            <p>With such Galleries as these it was, that the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> past the Moat of <hi>Thionville.</hi> For he order'd a great number of <hi>Bavins</hi> to be brought to the Tayl of the <hi>French,</hi> where he had Men rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to carry 'em continually to the Head of the Works. So that as soon as the Descents were in a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54443:34"/>
little forwardness, he began his Work in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. He order'd <hi>Bavins</hi> to be thrown into the Moat, till they came to be five or six foot high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Water. When the Heap of Bavins was rais'd so high as he would have it, they finish'd the Sapping for entrance into the Moat. Six Men went into the Sapping, and secur'd themselves against the Face of the Bastion, behind the Heaps of Faggots<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and so soon as they were secure, they began to range the Bavins, to the Right and Left, in order to make the Parapets, enterlacing 'em sometimes long ways, sometimes a cross, and sometimes a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the ends, to render the Work more Solid. Now as the foremost Workmen dispos'd the Bavins, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers thrust 'em together with Forks; and the Men appointed to fetch 'em from the Tayl to the Head of the <hi>French,</hi> threw 'em without ceasing into the Moat. Afterwards they plac'd all the length of the Gallery, Blinds and Chandeleers, to the end that the Workmen might not be seen from the top of the Rampart. They also carry'd on their Works by degrees toward the Wall, at what time the besieged were amaz'd to see a heap of Faggots insensibly crossing the breadth of their Moat, and yet not to be able to discover the Persons that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd the Work. Moreover, while these Galle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were finishing, Batteries were rais'd against the Flanks of the Bastions. The Canons also were so well ply'd, that the Great Shot from the Town, no longer annoy'd the Works; besides, that the besieged were constrain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Battery rais'd to break their Lodgement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Berme</hi> of the Half-Moon, had so shaken the Rampart, that it was an easie thing to make a Lodgment there without Springing a Mine. For
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:54443:34"/>
which reason the besieged despair'd of being able any longer to defend the Half-Moon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had made a Mine in that part where they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>So soon as that Post was secur'd, the Duke or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd 'em to go on with other Lodgements upon the Gorge of the Half-Moon. Which done, a Battery was rais'd against the Curti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At the same time that the Bridges were building, the Duke orderd holes to be made with Canon, which he planted at the bottom of the Covert-way, to fix the Miners in the midst of the Faces of the Bastions; and these holes being wide enough to lodge two Men, he orderd the Miners to be wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>On the other side, the Besieged omitted nothing on their part to hinder the Progress of these Works; for besides their continual firing with their Small-sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So soon as the Galleries were finishd, and the Mines had play'd, the Duke caus'd an Assault to be given, with an Intention to try whether they could make a Lodgement upon the top of the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. The Conflict was very sharp on both sides, but the Besiegers were repuls'd with Loss. The Duke therefore perceiving that the Mine had only beaten down the Lining of the Wall, which was not sufficient to Lodge themselves upon the Bastion, made a little Lodgement only at the Foot of the R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ine which the Mine had made.</p>

               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:54443:35"/>In the same place also he began another Mine to fetch down the Earth of the Bastion; but it was a difficult thing to carry on new Mines, in regard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>However, the Miners finishd two little Mines, under each of the two Attacks, and the Besiegers prepar'd for a considerable Effort. So that after an obstinate Combat at the Attack on the Right Hand, notwithstanding the Bombs, Granadoes and Stones that flew from the besieged, the Besie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers made themselves Masters of the top of the Breach, but they were constrain'd to quit it a quarter of an hour after, not being able to stand the firing from an Intrenchme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the two little Mines not springing at the same time, the Marshal of <hi>Gesvres</hi> went on at the noise of the first, so that as he was just going to fall on with several Officers, they were overwhelmd with the Ruines of the second Mine. The Loss of so brave a Commander cool'd the Courage of those that were under him.

To which purpose he order'd his Forces to March with all the speed imaginable; but all his haste prov'd Fruitless. For that City was in so bad a Condition to hold out, that it was Surrender'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he arriv'd. However, this Accident, which the Duke did never expect, no way disheartend him; for since he could not relieve the Town, he was now in hopes to join, and Fight the Enemy, and no less confident of Victory. He had no De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign however to retake the Place, nor to force the Imperialists; for that his Forces were not strong enough to undertake those Enterprizes: But he thought he might repair himself by a Battel, for the Loss of a Town which he had not time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue. The Design was great and hazardous, and there was something more formidable that present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it self to his Eyes then at <hi>Rocroy.</hi> He had not only to Fight against Men, but inaccessible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, against Innundations and Precipices, on the one Side; on the other, against an impenetrable Wood, at the bottom of which was a large Bogg; against Rivers and Prodigious Entrenchments; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Forts rais'd up and down in every Place; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Timber, Trees cut down, and laid athwart most deep and dreadful Roads; and in a Word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst one of the Greatest Captains of the Age. Nevertheless, not all these Obstacles together were sufficient to daunt this Youthful Hero. Nothing would content him but a Battel, wherein he prov'd Victorious; tho the Victory was not so considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the Number of the Slain, as for the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Conquests that ensu'd. For the Field of Battel, as barren as it was, in appearance, was worth whole Provinces to <hi>France,</hi> through the Conduct of this General; so well he understood to make the best of his Advantages.

               </gap>'d with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Natural Eloquence, which was very perswasive in Councils of War, and which drew others to be of his Opinion; but his Conduct did not always answer his Elegant Discourses; for Wine causd him to commit great Errors, and many times put him out of being in a Condition to Command. He had Quarter'd the Foot at <hi>Tutlinghen,</hi> without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any Care to prevent their being Surprizd, and he had embroyl'd himself with all the <hi>German</hi> Princes. So that the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> and <hi>Lorrainers,</hi> fell upon him before he had the least Intelligence of their March, and <hi>Iohn de Wert</hi> having enforc'd him to Surrender, with all his Men, all the Officers were Prisoners of War.

            <p>As soon as the News of this arriv'd at Court, <hi>Turenne,</hi> had Orders to rally together the shatter'd Remnants of that Army, and take upon him the Command of it; and he spent all the Winter in bringing it into better Order; but notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> had Intelligence of it at <hi>Amblemont,</hi> near <hi>Mouzon,</hi> and receiv'd Orders from the Court to joyn the <hi>German</hi> Army, and endeavour the Relief of the Town.

            <p>By the way, the Prince understood that <hi>Friburgh</hi> was Surrender'd to the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> that <hi>Turenne</hi> was Encamp'd not far from em, and that <hi>Mercy</hi> made no shew of having any design to change his Station.

                  </gap>y</hi> was Posted in a place thus Advantageous; and in regard he was one of the greatest Captains of his time, he had omitted nothing to make the best of the Situation. His Army consisted of Eight thousand Foot, and Six thousand Horse. He had extended his Camp all along the Rivolet; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that Defence, and the Advantage of the Woods and Boggs, he had fortifi'd it, toward the Plain, with a large Entrenchment. Nor was there any way to get at him but by the road that leads from <hi>Brisack</hi> to <hi>Friburgh</hi>; and by consequence, there was a necessity of passing by the Foot of that Mountain which defended the best part of his men. And for that reason, this great General had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd all his Industry to secure that part of his Camp from being forc'd.</p>
            <p>Upon the sloping of the Mountain toward the Plain, he had rais'd a Fort with Pallisadoes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had put Six hundred Men, together with his Artillery; by which means he assur'd himself of that part of the Mountain which was most easie of Access. From thence he carry'd on a Line, a long a Wood of Firr-Trees, still ascending to the top, where it was impossible to be past. This Line was defended by Redoubts, at the distance of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces one from the other; and to give those that design'd to molest him still more trouble, he had laid all the whole length of the Line, a great Number of Fir-Trees, the Branches of which
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54443:41"/>
were half cut, and inter-twisted one within ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and were as Effectual for the same use as <hi>Friesland</hi> Horses.</p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Great Beams of Timber with Stakes driven into 'em, bearing their points outwards, resembling a Hedg-hog.</hi>
               </note>Between this Mountain which the <hi>French</hi> Army met with upon the Right Hand, and another that lay nearer <hi>Friburgh,</hi> there was a Hollowness, which gave entrance into the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Camp, but to come at it, there was a necessity of going a great way about, and to pass through Places which had never been view'd. This part was naturally fortifi'd, by a large and deep Innundation of Water; and <hi>Mercy</hi> thought it sufficient to cut down a great number of Trees, and lay athwart that Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. In short, never was an Army Encamp'd in a stronger Situation, and better Entrenchd.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> was resolv'd to drive <hi>Mercy</hi> out of it, and he prepar'd for his Attack in this manner. He march'd with all his Army against the Line, at the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ran along the Wood of Firr-Trees, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Fort upon the Left hand, and making it his sole business to carry the Redoubts that defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; to the end, that having gain'd the top, which commanded all the rest, he might make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self Master of the Fort, and so descend in Battel Array into the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Camp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turenne</hi> was to make his Onset where the Trees lay that defended the Vally, and provided that both Onsets were made at the same time, there was great Hopes, that the Enemy being busied in two Places at once, would be hard put to it to defend themselves; and that if they should happen to be forc'd on that side next the Water, the Duke co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming down from the High Grounds, and <hi>Turenne,</hi> at the same time, entring the Plain, <hi>Mercy</hi> would not be able to withstand 'em.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:54443:41"/>So soon as the Forces were all arriv'd, the Duke gave Order that they should prepare over Night to fight the next Morning: and <hi>Turenne</hi> having a great Compass to fetch, set forward before break of day; but the Difficulties which he met with in his March retarded the Onsets which both Armies should have made at the same time.</p>
            <p>The Duke dispos'd of his Men, in this manner. His Infantry was compos'd of Six Battallions, each consisting of Six hundred Men. <hi>Espenan,</hi> Camp-Marshal, was commanded to make the first Assault, with two Battallions of the Regiments of <hi>Persan</hi> and <hi>Enguien.</hi> The Count of <hi>Tournon,</hi> put himself at the Head of the Regiments of <hi>Conti,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarine,</hi> to Second <hi>Espenan.</hi> The Duke reserv'd two Regiments to himself, to be imploy'd as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion shall require, and Marshal <hi>Grammont, Martin, L' Eschelle,</hi> and <hi>Mauvily,</hi> remain'd about his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. <hi>Palluau</hi> Seconded the whole Attack, with the Regiment of Horse of <hi>Enguien,</hi> and the Gentlemen were posted at the Entrance into the Plain, in a very close Place, to hinder the <hi>Bavarians</hi> from flanking the Infantry.</p>
            <p>To come at the Enemy there was a necessity of clambring up a very steep side of a Place, cross a Vineyard, wherein were Walls, at such a distance, about four foot high, that serv'd the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> instead of Entrenchments. However, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Men got up into this Vineyard, and drave the <hi>Bavarians</hi> into their Entrenchments of Firr-Trees, behind which they fir'd with more then ordinary fury. Nor could the <hi>French</hi> Infantry force those Trees, so entangl'd one within an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as they were, without loosing a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Men, and breaking their Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:54443:42"/>The Duke therefore, who was advanc'd to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and part without, neither flying, nor moving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. They began also to slide along the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Camp, toward the Right hand, and fall upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em at the top of the Mountain. But the Prince, who had observ'd before that that same part was not to be forc'd, rightly judg'd that the Success of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise depended more upon carrying the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Line in the middle.</p>
            <p>For that reason, he resolv'd to renew the Assault with what remaind of the first Regiments, tho he had no more then two with him self, and those discourag'd by what they had seen then Fellow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, at first it seem'd a piece of Rashness, with two thousand repuls'd Men, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the forcing of three thousand well En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench'd, and puft up with the Advantage the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> had got. But it was impossible otherwise to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingage and bring off those that had got beyond the Entrenchment of Fir-Trees. For in abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, the Duke must have been forc'd to have retreated with Vexation, to have fail'd in his Enterprise, and Sacrific'd in vain the best part of his Infantry: Besides that, all the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army would have fallen upon <hi>Turenne,</hi> not having any other to oppose.</p>
            <p>The Prince consider'd all these things in an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; alights from his Horse, and putting himself<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rther among the Mountains. But the Road which gave him entrance into this Valley was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult, by reason of the Boggs, of which the Woods are full. Besides, that the Front of the Army being once engagd in these Woods, and having pass'd the Rivolet that runs along by 'em, the Rear-guard would be expos'd to the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> without any possibility of being reliev'd by their own Men.</p>

To this purpose, in regard the Horse could not march but one and one, and for that many times the men were forc'd to alight and lead their Horses, the Prince order'd a great body of Infantry, at the Tayl of the Army, to support the Rear of his Cavalry; he also plac'd little Bodies of Musketeers, upon the Wings, to defend the Passes through which the <hi>Bavarians</hi> might come to charge 'em.</p>
            <p>By break of day, <hi>Turenne</hi> set forward with his Army, which compos'd the Vanguard that day. The D. took care to bring up the Rear, and kept himself in view of <hi>Mercy</hi>'s Army till all his Men were past; and after he had in this manner cross'd the Woods and Boggs, rejoin'd his Vanguard at <hi>Langsdelinghen,</hi> the <hi>Bavarians</hi> not making the least attempt to dispute his Passage over the River, or his Entrance into the Wood.</p>

               <hi>Mercy</hi> observing the March of the <hi>French,</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily apprehended their design, and as he was one of the most politick Generals in the World, he presently judg'd that his safety consisted in preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Duke, and not in disputing the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of the Pass. Nor indeed had he more then just so much time to retreat before the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Troops of the <hi>French</hi> Vanguard could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take him; and doubtless, this was that which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derd him from falling upon their R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Upon notice of <hi>Mercy</hi>'s March, the Duke ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten'd his own as much as it was possible. But he had Mountains almost inaccessible to cross that he might shorten his way, besides that his Men were extreamly tir'd.

               <hi>Mercy</hi> no sooner discover'd the foremost Battal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of the <hi>French</hi> Vanguard upon the top of the Mountain, but he rightly judg'd that the whole Army was behind.

Squadrons sustain'd the shock of the <hi>Bavarians,</hi> till the rest of their Cavalry enter'd Pell Mell into the Defile. At length <hi>Roze</hi> left no more then two of the four Squadrons to defend the Pass, who after an incredible Resistance, seeing their Fellows out of danger, threw themselves into the Precipice upon the Left Hand, through Places that never had been pass'd before by Men nor Horses.</p>
            <p>This was a vigorous Action of <hi>Roze,</hi> and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ag'd with all the Art which it was possible to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> discover'd upon the Neighbouring Mountains the Bodies that drew into Order by degrees, and that the Duke was advancing to second <hi>Roze</hi>'s Cavalry. For in regard he was afraid of nothing so much as of coming to a General Battel, he rather chose to let those Squadrons escape, then enter too far into the Defile.</p>
            <p>In a word, the Duke observing from the Top of the Hill this valiant Action of <hi>Roze,</hi> and what a Condition he was in, had rally'd as many Men as he could get together about his Person, with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to bring him off. He was already got within the space of enclos'd Ground between the two Defiles, at what time <hi>Roz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> rejoyn'd him. And thus the Resolution of the Duke, and the Prudence of <hi>Mercy,</hi> were in part the cause of that Honour which <hi>Roze</hi> acquir'd by his Retreat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mercy</hi> at the same instant began to make his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat likewise, but withal that good Order which could be expected from a Great Captain, who would never be constrain'd to a Battel, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood how to take his Advantages when oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offer'd 'em. Nevertheless, he quitted his Artillery and his Baggage, and leaving some Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons to dispute the Passage out of the Defile, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>While <hi>Mercy</hi> thought of nothing else but to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten and secure his Retreat, the Duke rally'd his Men together with a Resolution to follow him; but it prov'd a thing so difficult to do, that before he could get his Army in a Body together, the <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> had gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thereupon, the Duke being quite out of hopes to overtake 'em return'd the same way he came, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On the one side was to be observ'd a Courage which not being to be daunted either with the badness of the Weather, nor the disadvantages of Ground, hazards all for Victory, and proves Victorious at length. On the other side, behold a Prudence which nothing could shake, that made the best of every thing for defence, yet still accompany'd with extraordinary Valour.

However, this may be truly said, that a General who quits his Artillery and Baggage may be said to be beaten, and that the Honour of the Retreat cannot be thought to be compleat, unless he saves all. It may be also said that all <hi>Mercy</hi>'s Prudence could never have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> had sent away the Count of <hi>Tournon,</hi> he return'd toward <hi>Landsdelin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen,</hi> where his Cannon and Baggage stay'd for him. And then he thought of nothing more then of what Advantages he might make by <hi>Mercy</hi>'s Retreat. 'Twas the opinion of the Principal Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:54443:49"/>
that he should retake <hi>Friburgh</hi>; that their March into <hi>Germany</hi> was only to relieve that Place, and consequently it ought to be the first Fruits of their Victory. That the <hi>Bavarians</hi> had not been able to level their Lines, that they were already far remote, that there was but a slender Garrison in the Place, ill provided of all things, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fi'd with the ill Success of the Combats which they had beheld from their own Ramparts.</p>
            <p>But the Duke was of Opinion, that 'twas of greater Consequence to undertake the Siege of <hi>Philipsburgh,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Not but that the Siege of <hi>Philipsburgh</hi> was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult; in regard it requir'd a long March to lie down before it; because the Infantry was much lessend in number, and for that their Mony was spent, and Provisions were to be brought a great way; but the Duke contemning these Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the Siege of <hi>Philipsburgh</hi> was resolvd upon. To that purpose he sent <hi>Champlastreux,</hi> the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of his Army to <hi>Brisack,</hi> to bring away ten battering Pieces, in Boats, which would be also farther serviceable to lay a Bridge over the <hi>Rhine.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Night being come, the Souldiers prepar'd to Storm the Fort. The Duke march'd thither through the Woods, while <hi>Tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ennne</hi> approachd it over small Damms that are rais'd athwart the <hi>Mersh.</hi> But the Duke could not get thither till break of day, because the way he had chose was long and difficult.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:54443:51"/>
               <hi>Bamberg,</hi> not having Foot sufficient, sent for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town both the Men and every thing else that was provided for the defence of the Fort; so that <hi>Turenne</hi> finding it quitted took Possession of it, and fortifid it with all things necessary against the Attacks of the City.</p>
            <p>After that, the Duke minded nothing but to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his Circumvallation. He caus'd Forts and Redoubts to be rais'd in all places where the Ground was proper, and cut down the Trees in the Boggs to stop up the High-ways. <hi>Turenne</hi> met not with so many Obstacles in the Fortifying his Quarters; for he made use of a great Flood of Water that ran along from one end of his Camp to the other, which he made a good defence by adding a Parapet to it. So that the Circumvallation was finish'd in four days, and the Camp enclosd on all sides from <hi>Knaud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Bridge of Boats arriv'd, laden with Canon, Ammunition and Provisions. In twenty four Hours it was laid over against <hi>Germe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheim</hi> and <hi>Knaudenheime. Germesheim</hi> is a small City of the <hi>lower Palatinate,</hi> seated upon the Banks of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> fortifi'd with Bastions of Earth and a drie Moat, on that side next <hi>Spire,</hi> but full of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on that side next <hi>Philipsburgh.</hi> The taking of it was necessary to command the upper part of the <hi>Rhine</hi>; for in regard there could be no Circ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation made beyond the River, they could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> be assurd of the River without taking in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which commanded it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, so soon as the Bridge was finishd, the Duke order'd <hi>d' Aumont</hi> to pass the River with six hundred Foot, and three hundred Horse, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack <hi>Germensheim,</hi> which he did in two days after the Trenches were opend; and after that he marchd toward <hi>Spire.</hi> This City, tho it stands upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> is only considerable for being the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:54443:51"/>
Seat of the Imperial Chamber; for it is only sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a Wall, garnishd with Towers, after the Ancient manner, and a nasty Moat.</p>
            <p>Thus, while <hi>D' Aumont</hi> made himself sure of the most necessary Posts upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Duke began the Attack of <hi>Philipsburgh.</hi> And it has been already by us observ'd that there is but one way to approach the Town, where the Earth is Gravelly, all along to the very Counterscarp of the two Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of the Place.</p>
            <p>In this part the Duke orderd two Attacks to be rais'd; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which <hi>Grammont</hi> undertook to carry on the Left, and <hi>Turenne</hi> took Care of that on the Right Hand. Both the one and the other made use of above fifteen hundred paces of the Course of a little Rivolet that waters the Plain, after they had turn'd the Water another way, in order to make their Approaches toward the two Bastions which they were to Attack. The Trench was open'd the first of <hi>September,</hi> and the same Night they made a Place of Arms common to both Attacks; each of which carry'd on their Approaches to the opposite Bastion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Espenan,</hi> with the Regiment of <hi>Persan,</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Guard, the first Night in <hi>Grammont</hi>'s Trench, and after he had carry'd on the Line near 200 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he began to raise a great Redoubt, where he settl'd a <hi>Corps du Guard</hi> of a hundred <hi>Gendarms</hi> at the Head of the Workmen; and those Horsemen had Orders to retire, in the day time, behind the Ruines of an old Building, near the opening of the Trench.</p>
            <p>The Night was quiet enough; and the Besieged who knew not as yet where the Pioniers were at work, never gave any Interruption to the Besiegers. But so soon as day appear'd, and that they descry'd the Earth cast up, they resolv'd by a Salley to ruine the Work which had been carry'd on in the Night.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54443:52"/>
To that purpose they detach'd two Hundred Foot, and a Hundred Horse, who advanc'd toward the Line; and tho it were full of Pioniers <hi>Espenan</hi> prepar'd to receive 'em, commanding the <hi>Gendarms</hi> to oppose their Cavalry.</p>
            <p>But that Squadron marchd against the Enemy in so much Disorder, that they were utterly broken at the first Charge, and <hi>la Boulay</hi> was there slain upon the Place. However <hi>Espenan</hi> had put the Line in so good Order, that the Besieged durst not attack it; nor pursue this their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>irst Advantage any farther; in so much that the <hi>Gendarmes</hi> had time to rally and return to the Charge; and this second time they so well acquitted themselves, that notwithstanding all their firing from the Bastions, all that remaind of those that sally'd were driven to their Counterscarp.</p>
            <p>Thus the Besiegers continued their Work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Opposition, but that their Infantry was lessen'd to that Degree, that the Dukes Army did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to above three thousand Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was not above two thousand strong. With so few Men the Prince had an Incredible deal of Trouble to guard so spacious a Circumvallation, and to furnish Men sufficient to guard the Trenches, and other necessary Occasions.</p>
            <p>His Infantry consisted of Four Battallions; of which that which was relievd in the Trenches was order'd for the extraordinary Guard of the Camp. The other two wrought in the Approaches, and the last provided Faggots to fill up the Trenches. <hi>Palluau,</hi> with the Regiment of <hi>Enguien</hi> relievd, the second Night, <hi>Espenan</hi> and <hi>Persan,</hi> &amp; carry'd on the Line and finishd the Redoubt. <hi>Tournon</hi> and <hi>Marsin,</hi> the two next Nights advanc'd the Works much farther, and made a Battery of six Canons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:54443:52"/>
               <hi>Turenne</hi> had made n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> less haste on his side. The fifth Night the two Attacks made a Lodgement upon the Counterscarp; neither did <hi>Bamberg</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these Works, but with his Canon and Small-Shot. Neither did the Duke hear any thing of the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Army; only he had Intelligence that <hi>Iohn de Wert</hi> was upon his March with a Thousand Horse and as many Musketeers, to try whether he could put any Relief into <hi>Philipsburgh</hi>; and this advice constraind the Duke to redouble his Guards, and to ride the Rounds every Night.</p>
            <p>So soon as the two Attacks had made their Lodgements upon the Counterscarp, the Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men began to pierce it, and raise Batteries to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine the Defences of the Place. As for the Descent into the Moat, it was not very difficult, but it would be very troublesome to secure it. For in regard the Water was almost even with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terscarp, the Besiegers could not come at it under Ground, and it requird a great deal of time to make a Gallery coverd with Oaken Planks. So that the D. only drew a streight Line which butted upon the Moat, and which was coverd with Bavins upon Blinds and Chandeleers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Espenan</hi> and <hi>Palluau,</hi> during the two Nights that they kept Guard, brought their Works to so much Perfection as to be able to fill up the Moat. <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> also had already thrown into it a great number of Bavins, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as he passd along the piercd Line that led to the Work, he was slain with a Musket Bullet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>La Pomme</hi> the Engeneer was expert at making Mines and passing Moats: but he met with a great many Difficulties by reason of the Canon that playd from the Town, which the Besiegers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the room; and beside those which they had in their Flanks with which they batter'd the Bridge side-ways, they had a Row upon the Face of the Bastions which pierc'd and ruin'd the whole Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach.</p>
            <p>'Tis true the Flanks were so small that they could not plant above three pieces of Canon upon 'em. Which is a usual Fault in the best Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Flanks either too narrow or too open<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> But the first of these defects is the worst, in regard that between the two opposite Batteries the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est number of Canon always prevails. In a word, the Besiegers having rais'd two Batteries, each of four pieces of Canon, presently put to silence the Enemies Canon from the Flanks. But the Besieged planted so many upon the Faces of the Bastions, the Rampart of which was very low, that they ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in'd those of the Besiegers. For which reason, the Duke was constrain'd to raise Shoulderings to hide his Batteries, and cover the Faces of the Bastions. By which means his Canon got the Mastery, and the Besiegers labour'd with more security to perfect their Bridge.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Bamberg</hi> found that it would not be in his Power to hinder the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>at from being fill'd up, and therefore knowing his Garrison to be but weak, he thought it not convenient to stay till the Miners were set to work, in hopes before that, to make a more Advantageous Capitulation. Thereupon, he beat a Parley, Hostages were given on both sides, and the Garrison march'd out the twelfth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to the number of five Hundred Men, with two Pieces of Canon. The Duke put <hi>Persan</hi>'s Regiment into the Town, and made <hi>Espenan</hi> Governour.</p>
            <p>The winning of this Place, tho more easie then the Prince fore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:54443:53"/>
till <hi>D'Aumont</hi> summon'd 'em, but sent Commissioners with their Keys to the D. who receiv'd 'em Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably; and after he had confirm'd their Priviledges, sent 'em back with Order to dismiss the Imperialists, and receive a <hi>French</hi> Garrison, which <hi>a' Aumont</hi> had Instructions to put into the Town.</p>
            <p>But the Duke could not reap himself the Fruits of the taking of <hi>Philipsburgh,</hi> nor could he remove from thence before he had repair'd the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the Enemy was at hand; his Men were much lessen'd and weary'd; his Canon had made great Ruins which were to be repair'd; nor was the Prince in a Condition to stand <hi>Mercy,</hi> who had both refresh'd and recruited his Army since his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from <hi>Friburgh.</hi> So that all the Duke could do was to settle his Quarters in the Places along the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in such a manner, that the Enemy could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regain what he had won, nor force him to a General Battel.</p>
            <p>He had the River on the one side, the City on the other, the Fort of <hi>Rhine</hi> before him, and the <hi>Mersh,</hi> and the Woods behind him. His Army being thus Advantageously Posted, he detach'd <hi>Turenne,</hi> to go and attack <hi>Wormes.</hi> This City is not Inferiour either in Dignity or number of Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants to any of the Cities of <hi>Germany,</hi> being Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Turenne</hi> likewise took <hi>Creussnack</hi> in his March, and <hi>d' Aumont</hi> invested <hi>Landau</hi> with twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Foot, and fifteen hundred Horse. This is a City seated in a Plain, four Leagues from <hi>Philips<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> well Peopl'd, and having a Rampart flank'd by two Towers, after the antient manner, with a Moat defended by some Half-Moons and a Covert way.

                  <hi>Three things not observ'd in the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign of</hi> Friburgh.</note> which are not to be omitted. The First is, that the Duke, as it is credibly reported, the more to encourage his Souldiers to force the <hi>Bavarian</hi> Camp, threw his <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Second thing necessary to be observ'd is this, that the Defeat of the <hi>Bavarians</hi> at the Battel of <hi>Friburgh,</hi> gave the <hi>French</hi> an easie opportunity to make such considerable Progresses, that they no sooner presented themselves before a Town, but the Garrison surrender'd.

And then the Chapter of <hi>Mayence</hi> sent their Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners to the Duke, to inform him of the Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they had taken, to Surrender the City into his Hands, upon Condition that the Prince would Sign the Capitulation as it was drawn up, and that he would come and receive their Oathes of Fidelity. These Offers and Conditions were accepted the Sixteenth of <hi>September.</hi> The Principal Articles of the Capitulation being, <hi>That the Administration as well Ecclesiastical as Secular should remain Free to the Chapter. That Iustice should be administer'd according to the usual manner; and that under that Clause, the Officers should be preserv'd in their Employments and Priviledges. That the</hi> Chapter <hi>having put themselves under the King of</hi> France<hi>'s Protection, the Duke should not Charge 'em with any new Impositions; and that he should put a Garrison of Five Hundred Men into the Fort.</hi> The Duke also made a particular Agreement with the Governour, which immediately concernd the Emperor and the Imperial Garrison that was in the Place. So soon as the Capitulation was Signd, the Duke sent advice of it to their Majesties, and then made his Entrance into the City, where he was receivd with that Pomp and Magnificence which carry'd along with it the Aire and Shew of a Triumph. All the Corporations of <hi>Mayence</hi> went forth to meet the Prince, and made their Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to him in Latin.

            <p>The Place was no sooner invested, but <hi>Berghen</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> pull'd up all their Sluces; but the <hi>French</hi> had posted themselves upon two Rising Grounds, and opend two Trenches, one in the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s, the other in the D. of <hi>Enguien</hi>'s Quarter.

Nevertheless, to testifie his Moderation in an Action of so great Importance, and to avoid as much as in him lay, the effects of envy the insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Companion always of great Atchievements, he caus'd the Opinions which had been debated in Council to be written out, and without imparting his mind publickly to any Body, sent away <hi>La Mous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saye</hi> to Court, to inform <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> who during the Minority of <hi>Lewis</hi> the XIV. her Son, successfully govern'd our Empire, in Expectation of her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with a Submission so much the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to her, that he might have Permission to act without consulting the rest of the great Ministers.</p>
            <p>Now in regard he had so order'd his Message that he made no question but that the Queen would leave all things to his Management, and that she would permit his Prudence to take the Liberty of his choice, he resolv'd while he stay'd for her Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, to employ his time in getting all things which he thought necessary in such a Readiness, that when the Answer came from Court, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to retard his going forward. Four things chiefly put him to a great deal of Trouble; the bad condition of his Men, that lessen'd every day, and which however he design'd for new hardships, grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then those they had already undergone; the barrenness of the Place whither he was to lead 'em;
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:54443:69"/>
the difficulty of hindring the <hi>Dunkirkers</hi> from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating with <hi>Ostend</hi> and <hi>Newport,</hi> and the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Furnes,</hi> which left him expos'd to the Enemy, if he drew off his Army.</p>
            <p>After he had for some time debated with himself the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Prince also gave him Directions with all speed to fortifie those Places which the <hi>French</hi> held in those Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to put <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He wrote likewise to the <hi>Vidame</hi> of <hi>Amiens,</hi> the King's Lieutenant in <hi>Picardy,</hi> to draw out of the Frontier Garrisons as many Men as possibly he could, and to bring 'em to the Camp. He sent <hi>Villequien</hi> into <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonnois</hi> to rally the Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He order'd also the <hi>Polish</hi> Regiments of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amski</hi> and <hi>Cabree</hi> to take some rest in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood to <hi>Calais.</hi> Those Foreigners were above seventeen hundred in all, and were newly come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France</hi> under the Leading of <hi>Sicot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had taken those just Measures, that he
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:54443:69"/>
might bring together when he pleas'd as many Men as were sufficient to fight the Enemy, should they resolve to fall upon him rather then suffer the Town to fall into his hands, and to carry on all the Labours of the Siege, his next care was to provide for their Subsistence. To which purpose he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd the Intendant <hi>Champestr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now, tho that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Admiral, <hi>Trump,</hi> a Man famous for Sea Affairs, and whose valour had rais'd his Fortune, was come, by the <hi>States</hi> Order, with ten Men of War to an Anchor in <hi>Dunkirk</hi> Road, and that number were sufficient to block up the Port, while the <hi>French</hi> Navy found the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Employment in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi>; nevertheless in regard the small Vessels of the Enemy might creep along the Coast and slip into the Place, the Prince thought it convenient to send for some few Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the <hi>French</hi> Ports. So that <hi>Montigny</hi> sent away twelve from <hi>Dieppe; Villequier</hi> two from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> which were join'd by one from <hi>Calais,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with some <hi>Beelanders</hi> which they pickt up upon the Coast. <hi>Beelands</hi> are small Vessels, longer and narrower then Hoys which they very much resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and much in use among the <hi>Flemings,</hi> for the conveniency of their Trade; and all these small Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels were under the command of <hi>Andonville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was nothing more now to be done but to put <hi>Furnes</hi> in a Condition to stop the Enemy while <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was taken; and to furnish it with Forrage for the Subsistance of the Horse, which the Prince took care of in Person; to the end his presence might make 'em more diligent to hasten their work,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:54443:70"/>
and to see that they spent no more time then what was necessary in finishing the Fortifications, and supplying the Magazines.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furnes</hi> is seated between <hi>Newport</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> at some distance from the Sea, tho it may be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd that formerly it was very near it, when the Ocean driven by the violence of the North Winds, overflow'd all the Land about it, if not stopp'd by the Mounds that lye in the way.

So that the Prince after he had consider'd the Situation, and the nature of the Place, resolv'd to environ it with several Half-Moons, a Hornwork and a Counterscarp; having no other defence at that time then a Wall flankd with Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and a Moat full of Water. To this purpose he distributed the Foot into those places where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to break Ground; divided and appointed the Quarters of the Regiments; orderd a Camp-Master to every Quarter to take care of the Work; settl'd the Hours of Rest; nam'd the Bodies which were to relieve one another, and methodizd all things with so much equality, that there might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be a good number of Souldiers at work all day long. In the mean time, the Cavalry were order'd to cut Wood, and every Troop brought Piles to make Palisadoes and Stakes for the Use of the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications.

He sent for Boats from all parts to facilitate the Transportation of it; and appointed an Officer to receive it as they hundled it up, and store it up in the Magazines. Never was seen so much Diligence, and so much Order, both at the same time. The Fortifications

were rais'd, the City furnish'd with Provisions, the Cavalry, Infantry, Burgesses, Peasants, Sea-men, every Body quick, and without Confusion, in the performance of what was enjoin'd 'em. All this while, the Prince was every where giving Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and shewing that he had a perfect Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Military Oeconomy. Which to me, seemd so much the more worthy of Applause, because Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is common to the meanest private Souldier, whereas Fore-sight, and Knowledge in the Art of War, are the distinguishing Qualities of Great Men.

in this important necessity, he resolv'd to try whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he could excite the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>French,</hi> in regard they seem'd to look upon it as their Interest not to let <hi>Dunkirk</hi> fall into their Hands. To this purpose, after he had imparted his Resolutions to the Generals he dispatch'd an Express to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Ambassadour at <hi>London,</hi> to the end he might be inform'd of his Designs, and make use of his Credit, which was very great with the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans at that time, to obtain a considerable Succour.</p>
            <p>This was the posture of Affairs on both sides, when the Answer from the Court was brought to the Prince. It was written in such a manner, that tho the Ministers started some difficulties in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thereupon they referr'd it again to the Prince, to consider whither he would undertake the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize or no.</p>
            <p>The design therefore being resolv'd upon, there was nothing more in the Princes Thoughts but go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to work, and to make the best of the Season, Winter drawing on a pace, and already beginning to pinch the Army.

to put in Succour into the Town, between <hi>Berguen</hi> and <hi>Mardike,</hi> meeting with that Obstacle might be quite out of hopes. By Sea, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships, and the <hi>French</hi> Frigates, blockt up the Port, and thus was <hi>Dunkirk</hi> enclos'd on every side. Moreover, a Bridge was layd over the Canal of <hi>Furnes,</hi> for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Quarters; and two more over the Canals of <hi>Honscotte</hi> and <hi>Berguen,</hi> for the Carriages to come over that brought Victuals from <hi>Calais</hi> to the Camp.</p>
            <p>The next day the Circumvallation was begun; at which the whole Army wrought. The Prince undertook to cut, and sink a Moat, six Foot deep, and twelve Foot wide, from the Downs, next the Sea, to the Canal of <hi>Furnes</hi>; and to consolidate the Work, and hinder the Sand from falling into it; he order<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d the Lines, which were to be Canon Proof, to be lin'd with Turf. Then he mark'd out the most easie Places for the Attacks, and to secure 'em with Pallilado's and Turnpikes; and about 30 or 40 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces beyond the Moat, he drew out another of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>qual, and for that there were some along the Lines, that might annoy the Army, he was constraind to possess himself of all those upper Grounds, to fortifie 'em, and extend his Works a great way, chiefly toward <hi>Newport</hi> Road, and <hi>Gas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi>'s Quarter. There was one of these Hills, which being much higher then the rest, commanded the Camp, from the top of which, the <hi>French</hi> were to be seen drawn up in order of Battel, and it was dangerous to let the Enemy be Masters of it, so as to plant their Cannon upon it. The Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to obviate all Annoyances, resolv'd to possess it; and whatever pains it cost him to environ it with two Lines, which should joyn to those of the Circumvallation, to raise a Fort at the top of it, and to plant a Battery upon it.</p>
            <p>The Sea Shore still remain'd to be fortifid. But
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:54443:76"/>
by reason of the Flux and Reflux of the Sea, there was no probability of working in the Sand, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to fix it; and besides, the shortness of time would not permit the casting up of Mounds. Nevertheless, the rest of the works were insignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, if such a space of Sandy Ground should be left unguarded, during low Water. The Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore resolv'd to plant a kind of Rail, well fortifi'd with Stakes anow to put a stop to the Enemy for some time, and easie to repair if the Tyde should carry any part of it away. He order'd therefore Piles of Wood to be driven in by main force, the better to sustain the fury of the Waves, and to range 'em so close one to another, that there might be no room to go between 'em; yet still at such a distance as to give way to the violence of the Sea, and break the strength of the Innundation.</p>
            <p>Nor did he employ less Industry to defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the Water, which the <hi>Dunkirkers,</hi> had let into the Highways, from the <hi>New River</hi> to <hi>Mardike,</hi> which were overflow'd in such a manner, that the Wagons that came with Victuals from <hi>Calais</hi> could not pass. But tho, when the Prince thought of the Siege, he had provided against this Inconvenience, by ordering <hi>Champlastreux</hi> to cause a great quantity of Ammunition Bread to be bak'd at <hi>Berguen,</hi> from whence it was brought down the Canal to the Camp, and to send for all the Provision he could in Boats, that crept along the Coasts from <hi>Calai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, because this way was uncertain and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, and for that the Army was still in fear of want, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he thought it necessary to clear the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by turning away the Water. And first they thought to stop the Sluces with Planks, rampar'd with Earth, which would be easily done, and take up but little time. But the Fury of the Waves, which with a wonderful Rapidness, drives back the stream of Rivers, when the Tyde flows in, having
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:54443:77"/>
twice carry'd away all their Toyl and Labour, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they determin'd with great pains to drive in great Piles near the Hollowness of the Sluces, thorough which the Sea rowl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At the same time also that he entrench'd himself against the Enemies Forces, and the Obstacles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Prince with no less Prudence provided for the Necessities of the Army.

That Nation contemns danger, which their Natural Fierceness is ignorant of. The Nobility however are Civil and Ingenious, but Haughty, as are all the rest of the Northern People. Now in regard the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> know little what belongs to Sieges, the most part of their Wars being carry'd on in the Field, they came into the Camp without any conveniences

for the making of Hutts. Nor did the Place, which was Barren enough of it self, afford 'em any; so that they were constrain'd like Beasts, to dig them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selves holes in the Sand, to shelter themselves from the weather.</p>
            <p>During all this variety of Labour and Toyl, the Prince was up and down every where, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing exempted from his Care; yet still appearing with that Sedateness of Mind, which was easie to be discern'd in his Countenance. So that the Souldiers imitating the Example of his Chearfulness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubling their Labour with the same Alacrity, in four days, notwithstanding the continual Rains and Winds, all the Fortifications of the Camp were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishd, and the Sluces prevented from doing any more harm. The Downs also that were fortifid for defence, lookt like so many great Bastions, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd the Eyes of those that beheld 'em. Nay, even they that fortifi'd 'em could not but wonder how such prodigious Works could be brought to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in so short a time. Surely, if we consider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While they were working at the Entrenchments, the Prince receiv'd news that the Orders which he had sent for securing the Places which the <hi>French</hi> held upon the <hi>Lis,</hi> had been punctually obey'd. That <hi>La Ferte Seneterre,</hi> together with <hi>Rovigny</hi> and <hi>de Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennes</hi> were departed from <hi>Bethune,</hi> with all their Men, to put in a Convoy of 500 measures of Corn, and some bundles of Match into <hi>Courtray,</hi> which that Place stood in need of. And it was said, that because they would make the more haste, and for that they understood, that the Enemy had thrown
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:54443:78"/>
Trees cross the High-ways, they left the Wagons, and loaded the draught Horses which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spang'd from the Wains, beside that every Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was order'd to carry a Sack behind him, and so crossing the Enemies Country, in the Night, got safe to <hi>Courtray,</hi> where they left 500 Men of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Antragnes, Tavanes, Lamberte,</hi> and the <hi>Swiss</hi> Guards, and Provision enough for two months for 3000 Souldiers. Lastly that they were return'd to <hi>Armentiers,</hi> from whence, they could send all ther Men to the Prince.</p>
            <p>At the heels of this came other News no less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. <hi>Tourville</hi> return'd from <hi>Holland,</hi> and gave a better account of the Success of his Negotiation, then the Inclination of that Republick seem'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise. <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority till then had constrain'd the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to continue the War, then lay labouring under a lingring Distemper, which had much enfeebld the Vigour of his mind, and renderd him less capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Business.

                  <desc>•</desc>

At this time, the Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the thing, being joynd with the loss of their Reputation, which the continual Victories of the <hi>French</hi> had very much lessend, oblig'd 'em to give their opinions generously, and to bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of an entire Union, and which way to force the <hi>French</hi> to raise their Siege. Nor were they at the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Besides, the Inconveniencies of
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:54443:79"/>
the D's. being encamp'd in such a place, and the badness of the Season gave 'em hopes that they might defeat the <hi>French</hi> Army full of Diseases and tyr'd, and enclos'd between their Forces and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Town; besides, that they lay open toward the Sea, &amp; were but badly entrench'd along the Downs. For they could not imagine that in so f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w days it had been possible to fortifie the Sea-shore, nor to raise in the Sand such good Defences as the <hi>French</hi> had done. Nevertheless, not being willing to hazard any thing rashly, and because <hi>Beck</hi> was not yet come to <hi>Newport,</hi> to take the most certain measures, they concluded to draw out of all their Bodies a good number of Horse to take Prisoners, and to inform themselves the best they could of the state of the <hi>French</hi> Camp. They also thought it necessary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare at <hi>Newport</hi> as many Frigates as they could get ready, to the end, that if their Negotiation with <hi>England</hi> succeeded, they might assist the <hi>English</hi> Men of War to force the Confederates Fleet; or if they miss'd of Forraign Ayd, that they might attempt the putting in Relief into <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> by the Favour of Wind and Tyde.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Prince resolvd to carry the Place by main Force; for being a Person of a deep Fore-sight, he rightly conjectur'd, that only the length of the Siege could ruine his Design. Victuals came with great di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pieces. Moreover, the Rain continually falling, soak'd into the Souldiers Hutts, so that they lay half in the Durt; the Wind caus'd 'em to catch great colds<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>These vast Inconveniencies nothing dismay'd the Prince, who had seen 'em all present in his thoughts, from the very moment that he form'd the Design; and who as we have already said, had from that time so well taken his Measures that by his extraordinary Dillig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By that means he prov'd a good Husband of time, the loss of which is never to be recover'd. He satisfi'd the desire of the whole Army, impatient of their Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but the rather because his Virtue had rais'd him above the reach of ill Fortune.</p>
            <p>With these thoughts, the very same day that the Entrenchments were finish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In the Evening the Trenches were open'd, and a great Redoubt was rais'd at the beginning of each, and between the two Redoubts they rais'd a Battery of 15 Great Guns. This was done without any Disorder, the Besieged never mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesting the Workmen; whether it were that they thought that what was yet done, would do 'em but little harm; or whither they believ'd it more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to employ themselves in finishing certain Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works which they had already begun, and to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round 'em with Pallisado's.</p>
            <p>The Marshals Attack was the first place where any fighting happen'd to be. For between the Pallisados and the Besiegers Trenches, there was an indifferent high Hill, which the Enemy possess'd, and from whence they were to be driven, before the <hi>French</hi> could carry on their Works.

So that the Attack was undertaken with so much Vigour, and in so good Order, that the Enemy astonishd at the fury of the first Onset, gave ground without much resistance, not being able in their Confusion to consider the number of the Assailants, nor to make the best of those Advantages, which the Light of the Moon, and the white Sands, over which the <hi>French</hi> advanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Besieged were in hopes that their Granado's would have put the <hi>French</hi> in Disorder; and that afterwards they might be repelld with more ease. But when they saw the Officers resolute and accustom'd to Discipline, succeeded one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when any one was wounded, and that fresh Souldiers took the place of those that fell, then hopeless to see the small effect of their Granado's, they came to Handiblows with the Besiegers.

Resolution, as also of the Misfortune into which the Governor of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> might precipitate himself; so soon as he began to find him wavering, he fell insensibly to talk of <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s men, and the hardships of Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and feigning to be concern'd out of a Principle of Honour and Generosity, in the Misfortunes that threatn'd him, he manag'd his discourse so dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously, that he never left him, till he judg'd him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely resolv'd to sollicit a Surrender. With such a rapidness is the mind of man transported with the impressions of fear; and so true it is, that Reason serves only to augment the belief of Danger, when a man is once dismay'd with the terror of it.</p>
            <p>Being enter'd the Place, he found <hi>Leda</hi> perusing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which the <hi>Spanish</hi> Generals had sent him by a Frigat from <hi>Newport,</hi> which had stole into the Harbour in the night time, the Wind and Tide favouring him. Those Letters were stuff'd with high Encomiums of his Prowess, and with great Promises encourag'd him to hold out some few days longer. And he seem'd willing to prepare himself for it; flattering himself with an Opinion, that he should do the King of <hi>Spain</hi> a great piece of service; and with hopes, that the Generals would not fail of their Promises. But after <hi>Veere</hi> had made it out to him,
<q>That they did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude him, That there was nothing to be expected from the inability of <hi>Spain</hi>; That all the Defence he could make, would be to little purpose; That it would but exasperate the Prince; and that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd him to prepare for a long Imprisonment in an Enemy's Country, if he refus'd to capitulate.</q>
These Considerations, together with one more, which was the chiefest; and that was, that he might preserve an Army for the defence of his Partyy, by preserving his Garison compos'd of a great number of Officers, the loss of which would not be easily repair'd, in the miserable condition to which Poverty and long Wars had reduc'd Military Discipline; all these Reasons, I
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:54443:91"/>
say, bow'd his haughty mind, and made him resolve upon a Capitulation.</p>
            <p>And being thus determin'd, he sent back <hi>Veere</hi> to capitulate, with express Orders to gain as much time as he could, in expectation of being succour'd by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> Being desirous to do that honour to the Arms of the King his Master, though he expected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from them; and the better to justify his sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring the place, by the more sufficient Testimony of their Disability. He also wrote at the same time to the Generals, of his intended Capitulation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd them of the Reasons which oblig'd him to it. Among other things, That he was unwilling, when it could not be any advantage or honour to them, for five or six days holding out longer, to venture his being made a Prisoner of War in his old Age, and when he was almost worn out in the King's Service; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, That if they could be certain to relieve him within ten or twelve days, he would do his utmost till that time: otherwise that it would be but a fruitless waste of time and good Soldiers.</p>
            <p>But this last point of relieving the Place was more difficult to execute, then promise. For on the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal's side, <hi>Sicot,</hi> with the Regiments of <hi>Orleans</hi> and <hi>Noirmonster,</hi> had driven the Enemy from their last In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment upon the Hornwork; so that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd no more then to carry on their Approaches to the side of the Moat of the Old Town. In the attack of the Bastion also, where <hi>Vignaut,</hi> Serjeant of Battel, was kill'd, the greatest Difficulties were surmounted. <hi>Moussaye,</hi> who led the Regiments of <hi>Anguien</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> and a Battalion of <hi>English,</hi> had finish'd the Bridge of Fagots, and was raedy to set the Miners to work. So that the Promises made to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, had more of noise then solidity; more of show than truth.</p>
            <p>Towards night therefore <hi>Veere</hi> return'd with a power to capitulate; and immediately the Duke gave
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:54443:92"/>
order to <hi>Balluaw,</hi> and <hi>Arnaud,</hi> men of understanding, and long experience in War, to treat with him. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some Contests and Disputes, at length the Articles of Composition were agreed, whereby among other usual things it was concluded,
<q>That all the Marks of Honour should be allow'd the Governor and the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; That <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Regiments should march out with their Artillery; That the <hi>Spanish</hi> Armies should have three days time to succour <hi>Dunkirk</hi>; which if they did not do by that time, the Town should be surrender'd to the Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Capitulation was forthwith sign'd by the Prince, and the Governour. At the same time also Hostages were deliver'd by the Garison, by <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s Regiments, and the Townsmen: and so without any more ado, <hi>Veere</hi> departed for <hi>Nieuport,</hi> where he was in hopes to meet the Governour.</p>
            <p>That night the <hi>French</hi> Officers that were upon the Guard, went on with their Approaches<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>In the other Attack, <hi>Chabot,</hi> with the Regiments of <hi>Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> and <hi>Albret,</hi> with a Battalion of <hi>Polanders,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took some Traverses, whither the Enemy were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd. But Fortune usually crossing Felicity, at the very instant that the assurance of the Capitulation seem'd to warrant that all the danger was over, and that the Besiegers were ready to reap the Fruit of their Victory; and that <hi>Chabot,</hi> having given his last Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, was re-passing the Bridge in order to retire, he was struck in the Head with some pieces of a Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nado, and dy'd of his Wound in a few days after. This Accident was the occasion of no small grief to the Prince, who had always rank'd him in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his most familiar Friends. As for his part, he shew'd a great Resolution at his death; no way daunted at the expectation of it, and contemning i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> when it came.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:54443:92"/>In the mean time Truces were made, and all the Approaches were strongly guarded, till <hi>Veere</hi> return'd, that nothing might be attempted afresh. Two days after he return'd no ways deceiv'd in the success of his Journey, from which there was nothing to be hop'd for, and which he had undertaken only to keep up the Reputation of his Party, and to admonish his Generals to provide for all those Places, upon which the Prince is most likely to turn his Victorious Arms after the Surrender of <hi>Dunkirk.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the time for relieving the Town being just ready to expire, in the evening of the third day <hi>Veere</hi> deliver'd up into the Prince's hands all the New Town; and <hi>Miossans,</hi> who then commanded in his turn, enter'd the Place with two Squadrons of Horse, and six hundred Foot taken out of the Battalions of <hi>French</hi> Guards, and the <hi>Switzers</hi> of <hi>Gassions</hi> Brigade. Which done, he march'd to take possession of <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uport</hi> Gate of the Old Town. 'Tis true, that Governour made some scruple of yielding up the Gate: but at last, being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to it by his Capitulation, the Soldiers became Masters of it, and there stood all the night under their Arms, within a Pikes length of the Enemy. The next day, being the 11th of <hi>October,</hi> the Garison be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to march forth about Eight of the Clock in the Morning. The Prince also, not so much out of ostentation, as to prevent Disorders, and to see <hi>Leda,</hi> for whom he had a high esteem, plac'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the way through which they were to pass. A hundred and fifty Horse appear'd first of all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being follow'd by <hi>Lamboy</hi>'s five Regiments; after which came the Baggage, and then the Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the <hi>Germans,</hi> and two Pieces of the City Cannon, according to the Articles; the <hi>Spanish</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:54443:93"/>So soon as he perceiv'd the Prince, he alighted, and accosted Him with a profound Respect. On the other side, The Prince, who was also alighted from his Horse, so soon as the Governour came pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty near him, receiv'd him very civilly. After the first Complements, and a great number of Recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Encomiums, as the Governour was ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, the Prince stopp'd him, and invited him to stay and see the Garison which he intended to put into <hi>Dunkirk.</hi> Presently <hi>Norssmonstier,</hi> who had the leading of 'em, advanc'd at the head of the Battalions of <hi>French</hi> Guards of <hi>Ranza<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While they march'd along, and that the Prince was discoursing with the Governour, the latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to himself the Fortune of the Siege of <hi>Maestricht</hi> with his present Condition, and the great Qualities of two famous Captains that had vanquish'd him, could not chuse but admire the Prince. Puissant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, abundance of all things, length of time, had render'd <hi>Frederick Henry</hi> of <hi>Nassau</hi> Victorious. But here the Prince, with a slender Army, pinch'd for want of Necessaries, in a short time had by his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Courage within thirty days accomplish'd what the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were three Months bringing to pass.</p>
            <p>The Garison being march'd by, <hi>Leda</hi> took his leave of the Prince, who order'd him the Queen's <hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi> commanded by <hi>Franquerot,</hi> to conduct him to <hi>Nieuport,</hi> and then made his Entry into <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk.</hi> He found in the Magazines a good quantity of Powder, Match, Bullets, Arms, Corn, Forage, and other sorts of Provision and Ammunition. Upon the Fortifications several Pieces of Brass Cannon, and a

great number of Iron Pieces; and in the Port, two great Vessels, three Flutes, and thirteen Frigats, or rather Privateers, which kept the <hi>Western</hi> Seas of <hi>France</hi> in a shameful subjection: it being easie by all this to see, that the Besieged had store of all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for their Defence, and that Valour only had tam'd them.</p>
            <p>Thus ended the Siege of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> at a time when all <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note> but the Duke took a Resolution to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege <hi>Menene.</hi> Nevertheless, considering that the Season was too far spent to undertake that Conquest, he only sent <hi>Gassion</hi> with his Army toward the Abby of <hi>Lenzi,</hi> to see whether some At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt might not be made upon <hi>Dixmude,</hi> of which he had a Design to make himself Master, to the end he might in those Quarters refresh some part of his men: But that Enterprize not appearing feasible, he set forward and encamp'd at <hi>Hondescott,</hi> by reason of the abundance of Forage, after he had set his men at work, to repair as well as they could the Breaches of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and strengthen'd that Place with Men and Ammunition sufficient, and put in two Convoys into <hi>Courtray</hi>; one of which he conducted himself through a Thousand Dangers. After which, having receiv'd Orders to lay up his Men in their Winter Quarters, he distributed his Forces according to his Orders; leading himself into <hi>Champaign</hi> that part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which he commanded in Person, before he join'd the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> The Government of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was join'd to that of <hi>Berguen,</hi> as well for that <hi>Dunkirk</hi>

And these two Governments were conferred upon Marshal <hi>Ranzau,</hi> which equally surpriz'd all people; in regard that no body question'd but that the Court would have cast their eyes upon Mareschal <hi>de Gassion,</hi> who had so highly signaliz'd himself in the Siege of that place, and who had moreover those Personal Qualities which <hi>Ranzau</hi> wanted. But this was not the only vexation that mortified <hi>Gassion</hi> after the Siege of <hi>Dunkirk</hi>; for out of a <hi>Capricio</hi> of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky star, he would needs embroil himself with the Duke of <hi>Enguien,</hi> who had a great value for him, and had procur'd him a Marshal's Battoon, in despite of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> who had no kindness for him. This hapned a little before the Armies separated, and upon this occasion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gassion</hi> had taken with his own hand, during the Siege,<note place="margin">

For in regard the Prisoner had his Liberty upon his Parole, the Captain of the Guards could not meet with him time enough to present him to his Collonel so soon as he desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But however it were, the Officer complain'd to the Duke, That <hi>Gassion</hi> took no notice of his Orders, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>No question but the Duke was afterwards better inform'd of what had passed between the Marshal and the Collonel.

            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:54443:101"/>This being concluded, the Prince told 'em, with a sedate Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntenance. That there was no way but either to Vanquish, or Dye, and then began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his men. Never General shew'd so great a Resolution as did the Prince at that time; yet through the midst of this Heroick Resolution, and Undaunted Bravery, you might discern a Sedateness of Mind, and a Contempt of Danger, which is the Character of a Hero.

As for the Main Battel, which consisted of Ten Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, it was commanded by <hi>Chatillon</hi>; and Five Squadrons, which made the Body of the Reserve, were under <hi>Herlack</hi>'s Orders; and <hi>Coss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All things being thus dispos'd, the Prince rode through all the Lines, encouraging the Soldiers to Fight; he put 'em in mind of their Victories at <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:54443:101"/>
And after he had laid before 'em the Honour which the <hi>French</hi> Nation would acquire if they won the day, he prepar'd to give the Signal of Battel; but a certain Movement of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> stopt him. For he perceiv'd that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cavalry open'd, instead of Advancing; and believing there was some My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery in it, he kept his Ground, that he might disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the meaning of that Movement; of which he was soon inform'd by his sight; for he saw the void spaces between the Horse fill'd up with Foot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which made him easily conjecture, that it was the Main Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which he understood the Duke had design'd to Command, believing the Victory sure.</p>
            <p>The Design of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army was no sooner known, but the Prince took his Measures accordingly: He ordered <hi>Cosse</hi> to march with the Cannon, and play upon the Enemy; and at the same time that the Artillery play'd, the Squadrons and Battalions ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with such an undaunted Courage as astonish'd the Enemy. The Count <hi>de la Sala,</hi> who was at the Head of the First Line of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Left Wing, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with a singular Bravery, and gave the Enemy a dreadful Volley of Pistol Shot. The <hi>French</hi> never fir'd at all, but so soon as <hi>de la Sala</hi> had made his last discharge, they fell on with their Swords upon the Squadron which was before 'em, with so much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, being seconded by some other Troops of the same Wing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that they quite disorder'd the first Line of the Enemies Army. Which the Arch-Duke beholding, order'd the second Line to advance, and then both Lines being join'd, the Combat began to be very bloody. But the <hi>Spanish</hi> Troops being supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the Prince's, <hi>Villequier</hi> and <hi>Moussay</hi> were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and taken Prisoners.

Victory. On the other side, the Prince, who was every where, having rally'd the Troops that gave way, sent 'em again to fight afresh. And those Troops, tho half terrify'd, flew upon the Enemies Lines with so much Fury and Courage, that the <hi>Spanish</hi> Cavalry began to totter. But being vigorously seconded by their Reserve, the two Lines that were almost broken, took Courage, and re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At what time <hi>Herlack</hi> appear'd at the Head of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Squadrons, and fell upon the <hi>Lorainers</hi> with such an impetuous Violence, that not being able to withstand the shock, they betook themselves to their Heels, and carry'd all the rest along with them.</p>

            <p>But this Answer and Apology of Cardinal <hi>Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> could not hinder his Enemies from persevering in their Design to remove him from the Administration of the Government, and then to Ruin him.

Discourses made so deep an Impression in his Mind, that he would no longer hear of a Neutrality; so that abandoning all his Care of losing the Affection of the Publick, he had recourse to those Thoughts which inclin'd him to the most violent Extremities. In short,<note place="margin">The P's. heat in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> going along with the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to the Palace, he carried himself with so much Heat and Passion, as did him a great deal of Injury in the Hearts of the People. He had no sooner taken his Place, but the President <hi>Viole,</hi> who had great Credit in the Company, rose up, and took upon him to say, That the occasion of their meeting was of that great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that they could not make one step which did not lead 'em either to Honour or Infamy; nor was there any probability that they could enter into a good Beginning till they had first implor'd the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Holy Ghost, and he was preparing for the Solemnity of the Duty. However in regard that while the President was talking, he let fall some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliging Expressions against the Cardinal, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> threatning him at the same time with his Looks and Hand, could not forbear to bid him hold his Tongue; and then addressing himself to the First President, in a great Passion told him, That he wonder'd, that he who was the Head of so Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous an Assembly, did not endeavour to suppress the Liberty which some People gave themselves, who under the pretence of the Publick Good, went about to excite the People to Sedition. Adding withall, That if the King's Youth, and his want of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were the cause of the Disorders which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in the Kingdom, he would have him to know, That the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who was there present, and himself, were able to supply both the one and the other; and that the King would not want good Subjects, to reduce the Male-contented to their Duty.</p>

            <p>This same Speech did not equally satisfy all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The more ancient and prudent sort found that he had spoken much in a few words; and that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Conjuncture of Affairs, the first President could not have done much better then he did. But the younger sort were not so reserv'd; for they began
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:54443:108"/>
to murmur one among another. So that the Prince, who was not well pleas'd with the plaints that were made of his proceeding, as not being accustom'd to hear Truths told him, nor to receive any opposition to his Will, was so little master of his own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that instead of making amends for what he had done amiss, he turn'd toward the younger sort, and threaten'd them, as he had the President <hi>Viole,</hi> that is to say, with his looks and hand.</p>

            <p>Considering what the Prince had done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding War, in favour of the Court and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, it was a difficult thing for them to make him those acknowledgments which his great Services de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd; or that the Prince should contain himself within the bounds of Mod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sty, out of a desire of Domination and Superiority, in demanding the most considerable Employments, whether for himself or for those whom he had a mind to favo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r. And in regard the Cardinal had chiefly reap'd the benefit of the Prince's Assistance, he was the most expos'd to his Demands, his Complaints, his Threatnings, and his Bad Humour.</p>
            <p>And indeed, during the <hi>Parisian</hi> War, there had been some Misunderstandings between the Prince and the Cardinal. For as there was at that time a strict and diligent Correspondence between 'em, and for that for the most part Familiarity lessens Esteem, the Respect which the Prince had for the Cardinal was very much abated; and the Cardinal who perc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iv'd it, had look'd upon those great Virtues which the Prince had made so gloriously appear in the time of the Civil Troubles, as no other then the Effects of Fear and Aversion. Moreover, during that time, the Cardinal plotted to bring the Odium of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon the Prince, by endeavouring to make him the Author of all the Mischiefs to which they were expos'd. The Prince also after the Peace, thought it behov'd him to thwart the Cardinal, and to shew the Alienation of his Kindness for him, that he might

               </gap>ld not be impossible for him to make that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess sensible of the Cardinal's Defects, and to have all the Authority next her, himself, after he had laid the Cardinal aside.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Cardinal had found, that he could build no solid Foundation upon the Prince's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>iendship, who was sway'd rather by <hi>Capricio,</hi> then by Reason or his own Interests, and that time did bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And that which contributed considerably to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve the Knot was this, That the Cardinal was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Prince's so openly declaring for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Revolters of <hi>Guyenne</hi> put it positively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all doubt, that he held a Correspondence with

'em and consequently that he was in Confederacy with all the Factions. And that which augmented the Confusion and Jealousie of the Court, was the Demand which <hi>Guyenne</hi> made to have the Prince to be Governor of that Province instead of the Duke of <hi>Espernon.</hi> But new Troubles arose at <hi>Paris,</hi> occasion'd by the <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

For the Ministers did not think it safe to envelop themselves among an enrag'd Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy, whom they had so lately besieg'd; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Campaign drew near, 'twas a plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for taking a Progress towards the Frontiers, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on some considerable Employment. Moreover, they were in hopes that time would calm their minds, and bury the Remembrance of things past. As for the Prince, he thought it was for his Interest and his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to shew himself to a people that had so often loaded him with Imprecations. For which reason he went to <hi>Paris,</hi> and shew'd himself alone in his Coach, which drew upon him the Respect and Fear of the people, but abated their Resentments.

            <p>During the Prince's Absence, the Cardinal had held no other then a Correspondence of Decency and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility with him; and the Prince, who began to be sensible of the Prosperity of the Court with some regret, and who was not a little disturb'd about the Siege of <hi>Cambray,</hi> was no less glad to hear it was rais'd.

that obstructed his recovering an Absolute and Independent Authority. And therefore he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the incredible Throng of people who appear'd at that same Entrance, and who abhorr'd the very sight of the Cardinal, did only then let loose their Joy for the King's Return, who at that time took up all their thoughts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd the remembrance of all their Animosities and past Misfortunes. When their Majesties arriv'd at the Palace-Royal, they receiv'd the Submissions of the D. of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the Coadjutor, and the rest of the Heads of the <hi>Frondeurs</hi>; and the Prince compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so Noble a day's work, by telling the Queen, That he lookt upon himself to be very happy in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fulfill'd the Promise that he made her, to bring back the King.

with imprisonment. His Moveables were put to sale. No less then eight Silver Candlesticks mark'd with the Prince's Arms, were sold by an Outcry. And his Sword, the support of the State, the glory of the Regency, the Terrour of all <hi>Europe,</hi> was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a hairs breadth of being cry'd in the publick Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-place by a pitiful Catchpole; that Sword which had defeated the most considerable Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had sacrific'd to the Security and Welfare of the King, three famous Generals, gain'd whole Provinces to the Crown; that had vanquish'd the <hi>Bavarians</hi>; the Support and Hopes on which the Empire rely'd, and which had defended the Cardinal himself from the Fury and Animosity of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These three Princes suffer'd their Misfortunes with variety of Humours. The Duke of <hi>Longuevil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e</hi> was sad and pensive, and spoke not a word. The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> wept, and never stirr'd out of his Bed; while the Prince sung, swore, went to Mass a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, read and play'd to pass away his time. 'Tis said, that the Prince, hearing the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> desire some-body to bring him a Book, entitl'd, <hi>The Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ,</hi> should presently use this Expression to the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi>'s Friend, <hi>And I, Sir,</hi> said he, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you to bring me the Imitation of Monsieur</hi> Beaufort; <hi>that I may make my escape out of this place, as he did about two years ago<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>These Rigorous Proceedings against the Princes were attended with several others. The guard of 'em was committed to the care of <hi>De Barr,</hi> a Man of great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, and whose hard Usage much augmented the Discontents of the Prisoners. Now in regard this man was made choice of by the Cardinal to be the Minister of his Passions, neither the Respect due to the Birth of the Princes, their Services done the Kingdom, nor the honour to be entrusted with those Illustrious Sufferers, made any impression upon his crabbed Disposition. And not contented with four

               </gap> be always prating in their ears that which was offensive. They were refus'd the Attendance of their own Servants. Only the Complaints of the Princess of <hi>Conde</hi> causing 'em to fear the effects of some pity, they were forc'd to grant 'em what the King was pleas'd to extend toward 'em. This put their Friends in hope, that they might be able to settle a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence with 'em. Thereupon, they ventur'd a Letter, which was deliver'd 'em: And at length they made use of such dextrous means to hear from 'em, and to send 'em News of what concern'd 'em, that <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>For five months that this lucky Stratagem lasted, neither they, nor those that adher'd to their Interests, had any reason to conceive any great hopes of their Releasement. The Success of <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> that swell'd the Pride of their Enemies, abated the Courage of their Friends and Servants. Besides that, their Meetings always prov'd fruitless, by reason of the Union and Vigilance of the Cardinal, and Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>In <hi>May</hi> the Coadjutor disappointed the Petition of the Princess Dowager of <hi>Conde,</hi> that she might have liberty to prosecute the Releasement of her Sons. She was in hopes that the Cardinal's absence would afford her favourable Opportunities; and that the good Nature of the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> which had so long with f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the Obstinacy of the Court, and the Malice of those that persecuted her House.</p>
            <p>But all her Attendance prov'd in vain. They were so far from doing her right upon her Petition, that they would not so much as lend an ear to her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; they rejected her Supplications, and had no regard to her Tears. She might humble her self, if she pleas'd, even to the conjuring her Enemies by all the considerations of Mercy and Compassion; her Requests were still evaded<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and upon the return of the Court, which remov'd a great way off on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, she obtain'd no more then the liberty to abide at <hi>Vallery,</hi> which she chose of her own accord before <hi>Chatillon</hi> upon <hi>Loin.</hi> All this bad Usage cast the Princess into a melancholy Discontent, and Languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which she dy'd the 2d of <hi>December.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal, on the other side, was fully satisfy'd. All things went well in <hi>Burgundy</hi> and <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the hopes that he had of the like success in <hi>Guyenne;</hi> and particularly at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> puft up his Heart, and render'd him inexorable. Now for the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of all these particulars, it will be requisite to give a brief Relation of what pass'd in those Provinces during the imprisonment of the Princes.</p>
            <p>The Count of <hi>Tavanes,</hi> who was one of those who laid most to heart the Interests of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi>

Now in regard the Marquess was none of the most resolute men in the world, he appear'd to be strangely alarum'd and surpriz'd, and with a world of confusion, askt the Count what was to be done. <hi>It behoves ye,</hi> briskly reply'd the Count of <hi>Tavanes, to repair with all speed to your Government; and if you have nothing to do any where else, you will find busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness enough there, and you will see me there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:54443:121"/>Afterwards the Count went to <hi>Conde</hi> House, where he found the Princess Dowager all in Tears, with a great number of people, all in consternation, not knowing what Resolution to take. There was also in the Garden a good number of the Prince's Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>At first they thought to have easily dispers'd the Tumult, upon the appearance of the Jurats that were sent for; but the Disorder increasing upon the delay of the Repeal, the Parliament sent notice to the Dukes of <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Thus the <hi>Spanish</hi> Envoy had all the liberty he could desire. Afterwards the Generals thought it requisite to make a general M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

no less then Twelve thousand men, no unlucky Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident happen'd.

            </p>
            <p>However, in a little time they made a shift to raise Three thousand Foot, and Seven or eight hundred Horse; with which they took <hi>Castellan,</hi> within four Leagues of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and would have extended themselves farther, but that they heard of <hi>Meilleray</hi>'s approach, and that <hi>Espernoon</hi> was joyn'd with <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Upon this advice, <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd away <hi>Sillery</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> to hasten away the promis'd Relief: However, they left a Garison in <hi>Castelnau,</hi> and retreated with the rest of their Forces to <hi>Blanquefort,</hi> within two Leagues of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> And there it was that the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> came to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em in their Quarters, at what time <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> were return'd to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> leaving <hi>Chambon</hi> to Command the Forces in their Absence, which were much inferior to <hi>Espernon</hi>'s. Nevertheless, tho' they could not defend the Entrance into their Quarters, the Marshes and Canals which environ'd one part of 'em, gave 'em the opportunity, without being broken, to save both their Men and their Baggage. Upon the noise of this Combat, <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,</hi> set forward out of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with a good number of the Citizens, and having joyn'd their own men, advanc'd toward <hi>Espernon</hi> with a resolution to Fight him, but the same Canal, already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, prevented their coming to blows: Only some skirmishes happen'd, wherein <hi>Espernon</hi> lost a great many Officers and Soldiers; of the <hi>Bourdelois</hi>
               <pb n="228" facs="tcp:54443:126"/>
very few were kill'd, and Mr. <hi>Guitault,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Chamberlain was Wounded. After which time <hi>Meilleray</hi> and <hi>Espernon</hi> being join'd kept <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> block'd up, tho at some distance; and they retook the Island of St. <hi>George,</hi> about four Leagues above the City in the <hi>Garon,</hi> where the two Dukes had begun some Fortifications. It had been defended for two or three Days with vigour enough, because they got in a fresh Regiment every day, and <hi>Valette</hi> being there Wounded, dy'd of his Wounds within a few days. But at length the Boat that brought 'em Reliefs and carry'd back those that were reliev'd, being sunk by a Battery which <hi>Meilleray</hi> had rais'd upon the Rivers side; it struck such a Terrour as well into the Officers as Soldiers, that they surrender'd all Prisoners of War. So that the <hi>Bourdelois</hi> lost the Island and Twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd of their best men at one time. This ill success, and the Arrival of the King at <hi>Liburn,</hi> who also caus'd the Castle of <hi>Vaire</hi> to be attack'd, lying about two Leagues from <hi>Paris,</hi> caus'd a great consternation in the City. Upon this the Parliament and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens perceiving the City ready to be Besieg'd by the King, and finding themselves in want of all things necessary for their Defence, and no Succors coming from <hi>Spain</hi> made a Decree to desire a Peace upon what conditions the King pleas'd to impose upon 'em, at what time News was brought 'em, that <hi>Vaire</hi> was tak'n, and that the Governor, named <hi>Richon,</hi> who surrender'd at discretion was Hang'd. This severity by which the Cardinal thought to have stricken a terror and discord among the <hi>Bourdelois,</hi> wrought a quite contrary effect. <hi>Bouillon</hi> and <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood so well to make their best advantage of it, that by this means he resettl'd the minds of those that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd and were astonishd before, causing the Governor of the Island of St. <hi>George,</hi> who surrender'd at Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, to be Hang'd. And to the end that the Parliament and People might be concern'd with the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:54443:126"/>
Generals, which was no less requisite then bold and daring; they caus'd the Commander to be Try'd by a Council of War, where the Princess and the Duke of <hi>Enguien</hi> Presided; and which was compos'd not only of the Military Officers, but of two Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the Parliament, and Thirty six Captains of the City. Who all unanimously Condemn'd the poor Commander, who was a Gentleman, and guilty of no other Crime then of being Unfortunate. The People also, who were enrag'd above measure, would hardly give him time to be Executed, but would have torn him Limb from Limb, and cut him to Peices.</p>
            <p>This Action astonishd the Court, gave new vigour to the <hi>Bourdelois,</hi> and made such an alteration in the City, that they resolv'd to abide a Siege, and to defend themselves Couragiously; the Citizens relying upon their own strength, and the Promises of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who put 'em in hopes of a powerful and speedy Succor. In the mean while they hasten'd the Raising of a Fort of Four Bastions at <hi>Bastide,</hi> which lyes over-against <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> on the other side of the River. They also carry'd on with great heat and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence the other Fortifications of the City. But in regard that several of the Citizens had Houses in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Surin,</hi> they would not permit 'em to be burnt or pull'd down; tho it were made out, That that Suburb would be the first that would be attack'd, and that it was large enough to lodge all the King's Infantry. All they could obtain was only to intercept the Avenues, and to lay the Houses open; For it was impossible to defend so large a place as that with on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Inhabitants and a few men, that did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to above Seven or eight hundred Foot, and three hundred Horse. Nevertheless the Place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a numerous Guard, the access being open to it on every side, and the City Gate which was next it in a very bad condition having nothing to defend it, and for that the Enemy might approach it under Covert.

In a word, Did we not see that the D. of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> had a right at that time to make those Demands, the very thoughts of which has render'd the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> guilty? 'Tis pretended, that he desir'd the Office of High Steward, Lord High Admiral; which Demands were not only unjust, but criminal, to make a Prince of the Blood, who had won five or six Battels, and tak'n for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty strong Holds of great Importance; but the same Demand<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

It has been often seen in corrupt Ages, that not only Vertue has been oft without reward, and Crimes have gone unpunish'd; but that the Disorder has been so great, that only they who were unworthy Employments were permitted to demand 'em without offence, and that Merit only serv'd to remove men from pretending to Elevated Employments. But this is what we never saw in our days, till during the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>; for now all men must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to disown true Worth, and renounce Desert, if he thinks to have any preferment; and he must be careful of pretending to Employments, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing suspected for a State-offender.</p>
               <p>With what black and sooty Colours do they besmear the Protection which he gave to the Marriage of the Duke of <hi>Richlieu</hi>? And yet if you examin all the Circumstances, you will find, that there was not the

least shadow of a Crime in that Action, and that they would fain make that the Effect of a pernicious Design, which proceeded only from a real Friendship, which Madam <hi>De Longueville</hi> had for the Lady that had her Advantages by it. Persons that know the whole Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Business, can certifie that the Match was not carry'd on by concert in the whole Family, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, since the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was not acquainted with it, till it could no longer be conceal'd from him; and that the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> knew nothing of it, till the very instant that Madam <hi>de Longueville,</hi> who had undertaken the Business, was ready to depart for <hi>Try,</hi> to accomplish the Design which she had been long contriving for the advantage of Madam <hi>de Ponse,</hi> and not at all for her own Interest. All the Circumstances of the Marriage, that could occasion any mistrust at Court, proceeded only from the Distrusts of the Queen and Cardinal <hi>Mazarine,</hi> in reference to the Match. 'Tis true that the Prince advis'd the Duke of <hi>Richlieu</hi> to retire to <hi>Havre</hi> so soon as he was marri'd, but he gave him that Council only because he was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the jealous Humour of a Minister, who would not fail to draw mischievous Conjectures from a Design that was really innocent, but which might admit of different Interpretations. He rightly judg'd that <hi>Mazarine</hi> would make use of those Pretences, to wrest that Place from the Duke of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> and to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the Desire which he had a long time had, to make himself Master of that Place, there being no other way for him to do it. For, my Lords, if you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the real Crime that the Prince committed upon that occasion, was this; That the Prince having caus'd the Duke of <hi>Richlieu</hi> to marry Madam <hi>de Pone,</hi> he disappointed Cardinal <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s Design for one of his Neices, who by that Alliance was in hopes to make sure of <hi>Havre</hi> to himself; a Place of great importance, and a proper place of refuge for him, if he should be forc'd to quit his Ministry.</p>

Observe, I beseech ye, that in all this there was nothing done but by the approbation and impulse of the Court it self. Sometime after this, the Prince, without any other design then to extend the bounds of this Empire, in pursuance of an intention which had been made manifest to him, propos'd the Conquest of <hi>Franche Contè,</hi> as a thing of no less advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the State, and wherein there was not much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. He offer'd to raise an Army at his own charges, and as if he had foreseen the unjust pretensions which they might have of his Power, he promises to resign the Government of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and all the strong holds that are in that Province. His courage and his zeal for the King's Service causing him to prefer the Pains and Hardships to be undergone in the Conquest of a Country, before the Tranquility which he enjoy'd in the peaceable Possession of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince which had been given him for his Services, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of the Prince his Father. Who could blame so generous a Design, so advantageous for the Kingdom, and so honourable for the Prince? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the Proposal which he made in Council was joyfully embrac'd: They declar'd to him that it was a Proposal becoming his Courage; and at that time they call'd it a Heroic, which is now term'd an Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

They tell ye, that in these two Affairs of the same nature, he went about in one place absolutely to uphold the Authority of the Governor, to the oppression of the Parliament; and that in the other he acted quite contrary, without any other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but only that he had a kindness for one of the Governors, and hated the other. But they who set these things on foot, are either bad, or very malicious Politicians. For they say, these two Affairs were both of the same nature, because they were both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces that had taken up Arms against the Authority of the Parliament. But they are to understand that the least circumstance in such Affairs as these, quite alters the nature of the thing, and obliges those that debate upon the remedy of disorders, to vary their Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ls, according to time and place, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of the People they have to deal with: So that he who should take the same Counsel in one Affair, as he took on the other, would do like a Painter that should go about to draw one man's Face, from another man's Picture, because he had the same Parts. But are these sorts of Politicks to be attributed peculiarly to the Prince of <hi>Conde?</hi> Do not all Histories furnish us with examples of different Conducts, in causing Revolted People to lay down their Arms? Have we not seen some Princes make use of Mildness toward their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:54443:147"/>
to disarm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>em, and others to use violent means. We have also observ'd in Histories the same Princes employ different ways, according to the various hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the Subjects which they have to govern. And it were in vain for Politicians to have found out the two ways of fear and gentleness to reduce a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous People, if the same Conduct were to be observ'd upon all occasions, and if both the one and the other were not to be made use of according to the different circumstances that offer themselves in the Disorders that are to be remedy'd. Why then should it be thought strange, that the Prince, after he had consented to make use of Force of Arms to abate the Power of the Parliament of <hi>Provence,</hi> and strike a terror in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, should for Reasons, no less considerable, give quite contrary Counsel to remedy the Troubles of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> He thought at first, with those of the Council, that Force was the most sure way to Disarm the People, and that only Terror was the means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 'em to their Duty. But having experimented the contrary in the Affair of <hi>Provence,</hi> was it not very proper to alter such a dangerous Method? Is it to be thought strange, that the Prince who was accus'd to be the Author of all the violences that were committed, should be tir'd out with so many Prosecutions? and that he should represent it to the Court, that the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in <hi>Guyenne</hi> would be more easily appeas'd by ways of mildness and moderation? besides that, he clearly saw the design which <hi>Mazarin</hi> drave on to carry things with a violent hand, and he knew that his aim was to draw the Duke of <hi>Espernon</hi> into his Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and bring about the Marriage of one of his Neices, with Monsieur <hi>de Caudale.</hi> Is the Prince to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd for having oppos'd such pernicious designs by the justice of his Councels, and for having made use of all his endeavours to stop the course of a revenge so costly to the State, and so contrary to the zeal which Subjects ought to have for the repose and tranquility

of the Kingdom? But my Lords, if Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> had been well advis'd, he would for his own Interest have suppres<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> without believing him to be the cause of all those Disorders? Do we not well know that he has endeavour'd to ruine that part of the Kingdom, to gratify the revenge of the Duke of <hi>Espernon?</hi> And thence ought we not to infer, that he would make no scruple to overturn the whole Monarchy, for the satisfaction of his own particular Interest. For in short, if you would be inform'd in few words all the Crimes of Monsieur the Prince are to be reduc'd to this, That he hinder'd the Marriage of the Cardinal's Three Nieces. He openly oppos'd his design of Matching the Eldest to the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur,</hi> he engag'd, as they pretend, the Duke of <hi>Richlieu</hi> to marry Madam <hi>de Pons,</hi> for whom the Cardinal had design'd the other; and by the Peace of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> he disappointed the Alliance he would have made with the Duke of <hi>Espernon,</hi> which the Duke never promis'd him, but in case he could bring about his revenge. And thus we see likewise, that as soon as the Prince was arrested, the Three Nieces were fetch'd out of their Convent, the better to conceal his Designs; how they were brought back in Triumph to the Palace-Royal, and how one of the Matches was privately accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd, the Cardinal not thinking it proper to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish his intentions, and to let all the world know, that he had not perswaded the Queen and the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to cause the Prince to be arrested, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he obstructed his Designs. Nevertheless, they would fain have it, that every thing which the Prince has done, tends to the Ruin of the Kingdom, and that he never had any other aims in the Counsels which he had given, but his own particular Grandeur.</p>
               <p>But my Lords, by one convincing Argument to overthrow all that they have alledg'd against him,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:54443:148"/>
to make him appear Guilty, and his Imprisonment just, is it not true that they accuse him of nothing else but an irregular Ambition; and that all his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions which they charge upon him without any proof, are invented to no other design, then to convince People that he had no other intention then to set himself up for a Sovereign, and to Aggrandize his own, to the prejudice of the Royal Authority. But how easie a thing is it to demonstrate the contrary to all the world by recent Examples? We cannot judge of Passions but by outward Effects: Nor is there any but God alone who knows the motions which they produce in the Heart. Now when was it, that the Prince displai'd these marks of an ambition so irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar? Rather what apparent proofs has he not given of the contrary but very lately? Had he been possest with such a vehement desire of Sovereignty, would he not have declar'd for the <hi>Parisian</hi> Party? At what time he was proffer'd advantages enough to have tempted the most regular Person in the world? They cry out, he was capable of all Undertakings to Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandize himself, and that he would never mind the overturning of the State, so soon as he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in a condition to establish his Grandeur upon the Ruin of it; and yet when every thing favour'd the pernicious Designs of which he is accus'd, when every thing contributed to satisfy that Ambition which was laid to his charge, when he is to declare himself head of a Party; and that the more to encourage him to it, they give him to understand that his Power shall be unlimited; he stands off, he refuses the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions made him, and is so far from putting himself at the head of the Party<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> that he undertakes the Ruine of it. Is this his having a desire of Grandeur deeply engrav'd in his heart, never to make use of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities when they present themselves? Is this the giving marks of an Ambitious Spirit capable of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Provinces into an uproar, to refuse the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:54443:148"/>
Grandeur that is offer'd him, provided he will but consent to be declar'd head of a Party? Who was ever accus'd of passionately desiring a thing, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd it when 'twas proffer'd him? What more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Opportunity could the Prince have expected to display his Ambition? Had he been so violently possess'd with this Desire, the Court would not have been in a condition to have made use of this pretence to Arrest him; or had his Ambition over-sway'd his Zeal for the King's Service and the Queen's Interests, she would never have had an oppor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>unity to have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with so much Cruelty. But this is not the first time that Ingratitude has been the Vice of the Court: And that great Services have been repaid with like Rewards when their Benefactors have gain'd too much Honour by their Noble Actions. Merit is a Crime in Princes under the Tyrannick Government of Ministers, who can never endure the Power of which they are Jealous: So that of necessity they must be reduc'd to live in a drowsie slothfulness per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the State, or else resolve to fall into inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

These Ministers that strive to exalt themselves into Soveraigns and Gods as much as lyes in their power, never dart their Thunder but against the most Lofty Heads; so that there is no way to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void their Tyranny but by an humble Lowliness, which way has been always so odious to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that he rather chose to venture his Person by doing Important Services for the Kingdom, and by acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ring Honour, then by Tricks of Pusillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to protect himself from the Injustice of those that now seek to Revenge themselves upon his Power. For my Lords, he is Guilty of no other Crime, but that a Polite Historian says one thing of <hi>Agricola</hi> which may be justly said of the Prince, that <hi>Agricola</hi> was in perpetual Danger, because he had acquir'd too much Honour, and for that his Power gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Suspicions to the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> who could
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:54443:149"/>
not endure that a Subject should bear so Potent a Sway in the Empire. Is not this the Prince's Crime? Not that he has Attempted any thing against the State; not that he has done any thing contrary to the Duty which he owes to the King's Service, but they are afraid least such a Thought should enter the Mind of a Prince sufficiently powerful to put it in Execution when ever conceiv'd. Therefore to obviate these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Disorders, to cure the Minds of people of these Imaginary Apprehensions, and which one would think he had destroy'd by all the Actions of his Life, he submits himself to the Loss of all his Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to abandon all his Places, and to despoil himself of all his Crimes, by disrobing himself of all his Power. After all this my Lords, what reason can they have to detain this Prince in Prison? By what Motives either just, or so appearing? What Disorder can his Liberty procure to the State?

Never believe his Violence will stop at the Imprisonment of the Princes, but assure your selves that it will reach your August Assembly, and make you sensible of it by the less'ning of your Authority, and by falling foul upon the Persons of some in particular. Should it so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, as I make no doubt of it, if you do not apply necessary Remedies, and stifle not the Mischief in the Birth, what priviledge will you have to assemble? how can you without some sort of shame, do that for the freedom of some few persons of your Assembly, which you are unwilling to undertake for the Liberty

They who have hither escap'd his Tyranny, are to thank their good Fortune, and not his favourable Intentions. So that the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> the Coadjutor, and all their Friends, may say what <hi>Caesar</hi> said to <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who presented him with <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Head, who fled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge into his Kingdom, after the Battel of <hi>Pharsalia; Thanks to my Victory, they make to me those Presents which they would have made to</hi> Pompey <hi>had he been victorious.</hi> If the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> and the Coadjutor had not preserv'd the Friendship of the People, who have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto shelter'd 'em from the Oppressions of that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister, there is no question to be made, but that if he thought he could have done it with the same security in <hi>Paris,</hi> he had made the same sacrifice of their Liberty to the Prince, which he pretends they would have made of his. Let your August Assembly therefore be careful to preserve that Authority which has sav'd it hitherto from the Cardinal's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; let 'em consider, that he will never forego his eager Desire to ruin it, and by consequence that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them to deprive him of the power to do it.

The Honour of your August Assembly engages ye to it: The Laws which you have so lately renew'd, and safety of your own Persons, obliges ye to the same Resolution. I shall add to these things the Testimonies of these Princes, that they have no other Confidence but in you; and that if they could act for their Liberty, their Innocence would not permit 'em to have recourse to any other Ways then those of Justice. Could they have been permitted time to have spoken to their Friends, when their persons were secur'd, I make no question but that they would have said the same that <hi>Germanicus</hi> said to his, being ready to die the Death which was caus'd by <hi>Piso,</hi> the most implacable of his Enemies; <hi>If there are any among ye, who are concern'd for my Death, and who are desirous to give me other Marks of it, then some unprofitable Tears; there is room for complaining to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and invoking the Vengeance of the Laws.</hi> 'Tis then in conformity to these Princes Intentions that I address my self to your August Assembly, to demand Justice, and to conjure ye to employ your utmost care to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their Liberty.

               </note> The Cardinal acuss'd the Coadjutor of <hi>Paris</hi> of having advis'd the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to remove them to that Place, and hindred their being conducted to <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> according to his Intention. He believ'd moreover that this Chief of the Faction of the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> or Slingers, design'd to have the Princes wholly at his disposal, in order to draw great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages thereby. The Queen exclaim'd publickly against it; and the Arrival of a Trumpet from the Arch-Duke, with a Letter fill'd up with Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Peace, having oblig'd <hi>Monsieur</hi> to send the Baron of <hi>Verde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:54443:153"/>These two causes of Complaint were follow'd by a third, which appear'd no less unjust. <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux</hi> defended it self vigorously; and the News that came from the Siege, spoke the Success of it so doubtful, that nothing seem'd more proper for the Reputation of the King's Arms than to save that City by a Treaty of Accommodation. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Monsieur</hi> sent for the King's Ministers, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd them to propose to the Parliament, in his Name, to send Deputies to <hi>Guienne,</hi> about the Treaty. Those Deputies were sent, but not well receiv'd: And others being sent again, the Cardinal gave it out, that the Coadjutor had hindred him by those Deputies from Chastising the Rebellion of the <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delois,</hi> and that he frustrated all his Designs.</p>
            <p>The Coadjutor being in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led to find his Conduct blam'd at Court, after having acted with so much sincerity; and therefore went to Madame <hi>de Chevreuse,</hi> who, as we have already noted, had contributed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderably towards the Imprisonment of the Princes, and had ever since liv'd in a perfect Intelligence with the Cardinal. He made great Complaints in his turn,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</hi>
               </note> and told her, that he could no longer keep any Measures, and that he would look out for new Friends. Madame <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> endeavour'd to make him alter his Resolution, and to hinder him from breaking with the Court. She represented to him that he ought not to credit bare Reports, which perhaps were spread on purpose by the Princes Friends, in order to divide the Party which was against them; and that before he proceeded any further, it would be proper for him to acquaint the Cardinal with his Intentions, and to ask some Favours of him, thereby to discover the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of his Eminency. The Coadjutor opposd all this a long while, telling her among other things, that whatever fair Promises the Cardinal might
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54443:153"/>
make to him, he would never resolve to procure him the Cardinals Cap, which he desir'd. In fine, he consented at last that Madame <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> should request the said Cap of the Cardinal. He consider'd that in case the Cardinal should grant her desire, he should only be oblig'd to her for it; and that if he should deny her, his Refusal would enable him to draw her off from the Cardinal's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest. Madame <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> accordingly writ to the Cardinal,<note place="margin">

               </note> urging all the Reasons that should oblige him to procure a Cardinal's Cap for the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor. The Cardinal made an Answer, which indeed did not import a direct refusal, but yet contain'd nothing beyond bare Complements, and some Words which only afforded very distant hopes.</p>
            <p>During these Transactions, all things tended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an Accommodation in <hi>Guienne.</hi>

To this end the Parliament sent Deputies to <hi>Bourg,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s Deputies were arriv'd before to make Propositions of Peace. He desir'd the Princess of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the Dukes <hi>de Bouillon,</hi> and <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to send theirs. But whereas those Dukes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd nothing but the Liberty of the Princes, and could not consent to a Peace without that Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they barely contented themselves with not opposing a thing, which it was not in their Power

to hinder; and so refus'd to send any body in their Name: They only desir'd the Deputies to be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their Security, and the Liberty of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and the Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> as well as of all the others who had been engag'd in the Interest of the Princes, together with the re-establishment of every one.</p>

The Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and Monsieur <hi>le Tellier</hi> said, that the King's Coffers were so much exhausted, that all Expences were to be avoided, and that there were places in the Kingdom, in which the Princes might be securely Guarded by the Garrison only.

His Design was to March strait to <hi>Rhetel,</hi> and to perform one of these two things, that is, either to oblige the Marshal <hi>Du Plessis</hi> to raise the Siege, or to Attack the separate Quarters of his Army: But while he was marching at the Head of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Army to execute that Design, <hi>Delli Ponti</hi> surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Place by Composition six days sooner than he had promised; which having obliged him to advance in haste, he was constrained to Fight with disadvantage, and lost the Battle, which is called the Battle of <hi>Somme Suip,</hi> which was fought on the 15<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> near <hi>Rhetel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Monsieur <hi>de Bouteville,</hi> Brother to Madame <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> having fought with a great deal of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry under Monsieur <hi>de Turenne</hi>'s Standards, was taken Prisoner, from which the Cardinal expected to draw considerable Advantages, as it appear'd by a Letter written by him to Monsieur <hi>Le Tellier,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Account of the Battle.</p>
            <p>In effect, his being taken, afforded the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal an occasion to Negotiate with Madame <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillon,</hi> under pretence of Treating about her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Princes and the Coadjutor, the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> and their Friends, together with a general Oblivion of all that was past, and a Faithful Union for the future.

            <p>By the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s Treaty it was propos'd, That the Duke <hi>D' Enguien</hi> should Marry Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle <hi>de Vallois, Monsieur</hi>'s Third Daughter, That the Prince should require no Favours for his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: That he should be link'd to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness's Interests, towards all, and against all; and that he should require no Employments for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>All these Proposals, together with others that were no less vexatious, were accepted by the Prince, who might say with Justice, that by those different Treaties he was constrained to consent to, he did not become free; but only chang'd his Chains, and was free of the Cardinal's, to receive many others.</p>

I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with the Affection wherewith you have all laboured for their Liberty, and have made them sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the kindness they ought to have for your House.

                  </gap>eral, and to every one in particular.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> made a Complement little different from his Brother's; after which, the Prince assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Discourse again, told them, that the Duke
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54443:162"/>
of <hi>Longueville</hi> should have been glad also to have express'd his sense of his Obligements to them, but that they could not be ignorant of the Reasons that hindred him from so doing.</p>
            <p>The first President answered: <hi>Sir, The House can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not sufficiently express their Ioy at your Return, and think themselves happy to have contributed towards it. The Duke of</hi> Orleance<hi>'s Affection, to which you are indebted for your Liberty, next to the Queen's Goodness, makes us hope that the Confusions which for three whole Years have been like to occasion the Ruin of this Monarchy, and have so much diminished the Royal Authority, will be dissipated by the perfect Union that is to be expected from Princes that are of the same Blood. You are so much concerned in the preservation of the Glory and Greatness thereof, that in labouring to revive the said Authority, and to dispel all Clouds of Division, you will labour for your own Advantage, and render your selves more considerable, by employing your Persons and Cares to keep the People in the Obedience they owe their King and Soveraign. Moreover your Prudence will induce you not to hearken to any Seditious Spirits, who under pretence of specious Advantages, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may only aim at sowing Divisions among you. Those evil Counsellors must for ever be remov'd from your Persons. And,</hi> Sir, <hi>considering your Obligations to the Duke of</hi> Orleance; (in saying this he look'd upon the Prince) <hi>nothing should be capable to divide your Affections and Interests. 'Tis from that Union the State must expect its Repose, the People the relief of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and the King the Support of his Authority: and it is the only Recompence this House desires, for the Vows they have made for your Liberty, and for the Affection wherewith they have always promoted it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, some ask'd for the Declaration of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence they had agreed to grant for the Princes. But whereas it was not ready yet, and that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd some time to consult the Princes about it,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54443:162"/>
it was referr'd to another Day. Then <hi>Monsieur</hi> rose; and the Prince having answer'd all those who did Congratulate his Return, retir'd amidst the Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Joy of an infinite multitude of People which fill'd up the Hall, and strove with Emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give him signal proofs of a satisfaction not only capable to make him lose the remembrance of the Joy they had express'd at his Confinement, but also to render his Prison more Glorious than his Victories.</p>
            <p>The manner of the Prince's Reception at <hi>Paris</hi> after his being put at Liberty,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Addition of Glory to the Prince of</hi> Conde.</note> gave a new Lustre to his Glory, and made that Hero confess, that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was no less Glorious to him, than the Great and Famous Victories of <hi>Rocroy, Fribourg, Nortlingue,</hi> and <hi>Lens,</hi> in which he had Triumph'd over the most powerful Efforts of the Enemies of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed this new kind of Glory was greatly due to him,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>It was his due.</hi>
               </note> since after having rendred such great Services to the State, and discover'd such Eminent Vertues in so many Sieges and Battels, he had been seiz'd and detain'd long in Prison, with all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice imaginable, and with the utmost Ingratitude from the Court. For in fine, besides the early marks of Valour he had given in the Trenches of <hi>Arras,</hi> and in the Plains of <hi>Ipres,</hi> is it not certain that in all probability <hi>France</hi> would have been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd in the beginning of the Regency, but for the Battle the Prince had won at <hi>Rocroy</hi>? That Kingdom which had carry'd the Glory of its Arms so far, by the great Genius of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> seem'd to fall by degrees from its Elevation, since that Minister's Death. <hi>Spain</hi> being at that time attentive in the pursuit of its vast Designs, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps reckoning upon a Queen, to whom it had given Birth, and who had long been suspected of not being well affected to <hi>France: Spain,</hi> I say, which at that time look'd upon the King's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54443:163"/>
Minority as a Source of Divisions, which after the Death of <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII. whose Distemper was judg'd incurable by the Physicians, was going to expose so great a State as a Prey to their Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Desires. Moreover <hi>France</hi> wanted Famous Experienc'd Chiefs, as well as well disciplin'd For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: while the Enemies had a Triumphant Army, compos'd of the best Forces of <hi>Europe,</hi> Commanded by a very Experienc'd General, who only tarry'd for a proper moment to improve a Conjuncture which open'd a large Field to his Hopes; and while the Garrisons of the Kingdom being unprovided, and without Assistance, trembled at the approach of the uncertain Storm which threatned the whole Frontier. <hi>Lewis</hi> XIII dying in that Conjuncture, the Consternation of his Death, the Weakness of a Minority, a Tumultuous Regency, a Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this Victory he effectually sav'd the Realm, he calm'd it, he encourag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>That memorable Day was follow'd with a Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of Prosperity for <hi>France,</hi> of Conquests, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels gain'd, Cities taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the Campains that succeeded this by the Singularity of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes that were form'd and executed by the Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> equall'd, or surpass'd the most sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing things we meet with in History. The Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels of <hi>Fribourg</hi> and <hi>Nortlingue,</hi> so celebrated through

the obstinate Resistance of the Enemies, and the Invincible Difficulties that oppos'd the attacking of them: Those Battles, which may very well be compar'd to those of <hi>Arbella</hi> and <hi>Pharsalia,</hi> alarm'd and terrify'd the very Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Battle of <hi>Lens</hi> yet more Glorious and Triumphant, placing the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> in the just and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputable possession of being the Hero of his Age, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ais'd at the same time the great and signal Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had laid upon the Court, to the highest degree, which after that Battle committed a world of Faults without him, and was only sav'd by him in the War of <hi>Paris.</hi> And yet notwithstanding all this, at a time when all his Designs, all his Vertues, and all his Actions only tended to the King's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the Grandeur of the Kingdom, of which he was the chief Ornament, he was Imprison'd, because his Conduct in some Occasions had not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd sufficiently Respectful towards the Queen, and that he had not all the Complaisance for the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, which that Minister desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tune to displease by the impetuosity of his Temper, which he could not Master; the which, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> most, could only be look'd upon as Court Faults, and not Crimes of State, capable of obliterating the Important Services rendred by a first Prince of the Blood. Therefore it is no wonder that after his being put at Liberty again, and return'd to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> the People express'd their Joy, and receiv'd him in Triumph, as if he had been newly return'd from gaining the Battles of <hi>Rocroy, Fribourg, Nort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingue,</hi> and <hi>Lens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But unfortunately his Glory, which had appear'd with such a Lustre in so many different manners, was afterwards tarnish'd by a very blameable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. For finally, he excited a Civil War, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54443:164"/>
took up Arms against his Soveraign. Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> But that does not justifie the Prince, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we consider that thereby he ruin'd his own Party, and made the Court Triumph. It is most certain that had the Prince been endu'd with all <hi>Caesar</hi>'s Qualifications,<note place="margin">

Few Persons have ever been known with so much Equality in their Life, so much Moderation in their Fortune, and so much Clemency when injur'd. He gain'd the Affection of all People by his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Mildness: Those who were Familiar with him, and did espouse his Interests, neither dreaded his Anger or Capricio's. He was Liberal and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent, towards the People, towards his Friends, and even towards his very Enemies. He compass'd his Ends by Mild, Insinuating, Cunning, Secret means. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> did not possess those Qualities. He was of an unequal Temper; he was Rough, Difficult, and Haughty, and an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Precaution. He could not moderate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in his Prosperity or Fortune. He was Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and Revengeful. He did not acknowledge

He made Treaties without them, he often neglected their most considerable Interests, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded his own. Neither was he very Liberal, or Magnificent. He did not consult or manage the Temper of the People, and took no great care to gain their Love. He could not Dissemble, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he Act in great Affairs with Cunning and Secrecy. In short, he rely'd too much upon his own Valour, Merit, Reputation, and Quality, and neglected other things that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>But before I proceed any farther, because I am now to treat about the most considerable Point of this History, and that by reason of the partiality of those who have left us <hi>Memoirs</hi> about it, it is very difficult to distinguish the real Sentiments of the Prince whose Life we are now writing; I will set down, as a necessary Foundation, that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> came out of Prison with Sentiments of Vengeance, not only against Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> Madame <hi>de Chevreuse,</hi> and against the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> who had only promoted his Liberty upon disobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Considerations, and very hard Conditions, but also against the Queen, and against the King. I do not think any body can blame me for what I advance, since the Prince himself, after the Civil War was ended, and he receiv'd into Favour again, condemning his Conduct and former Sentiments, declar'd with Candor to some Persons of Honour and Credit, <hi>That he was the most Innocent man alive,

                  </gap>rs,</hi> and to swerve too soon, and without the least pretence, from all the Declarations she had just granted the Parliament against the Cardinal's return. The Prince on his side was afraid his Friends would be angry at his Treating without their participation; that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and the Marshal of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> would quit his Interests, that the <hi>Frondeurs,</hi> and the Dutchess of <hi>Chevreuse</hi> would grow his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Enemies, and that the Parliament and the People would on a sudden reflect on the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Image of the last War of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore they us'd all the Cautions imaginable to Treat secretly. The Prince went to the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess <hi>Palatin,</hi> whom the Queen had chosen to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age the Treaty. She was of the House of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and Sister to the Queen of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Count of <hi>Servient</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> likewise met there from the Queen. The Prince would have the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> present, and did nothing without the consent of the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville</hi> his Sister.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54443:166"/>The first Project of the Treaty which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the Princess <hi>Palatin,</hi> was, That <hi>Guienne</hi> should be given to the Prince, and that the Lord Lieutenancy thereof should be given to whatever Friend of his he should be pleas'd to choose: That the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> should have the Government of <hi>Provence</hi>; And that Gratifications should be made to such as had been engag'd in the Prince's Interests: That nothing should be desir'd of him but barely to retire into his Government, with whatever Forces of his own he should think fit for his own Security: That he should remain there without contributing to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s return, but that he should not oppose the King's Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in order thereunto, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that whatever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd, the Prince should be free to be his Friend or Enemy, according as his Conduct should give him cause to love or hate him. Those Conditions were not only confirm'd, but augmented by Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieurs <hi>de Servient</hi> and <hi>de Lionne.</hi> For at the Prince's desire that the Government of <hi>Blaye</hi> might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the Lord Lieutenancy of <hi>Guienne</hi> for the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> they gave him all the hopes of it he could desire. They only desir'd time to treat with the Duke <hi>d' Angouleme,</hi> about the Government of <hi>Provence,</hi> and to dispose the Queen to grant <hi>Blaye.</hi> But apparently it was only to give the Cardinal an Account of what past, and to receive his Orders. He was at that time at <hi>Brueil</hi> in the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Cologne</hi>; and the Queen consulted him as an Oracle.</p>

                  <hi>Imbroilures.</hi>
               </note> The Queen deny'd her having ever hearken'd to the Proposition about <hi>Blaye,</hi> and accus'd <hi>Servient</hi> of having made it on purpose to raise the Prince's Demands so high, that it should be impossible for her to grant them. As for the Prince, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints against the Count of <hi>Servient</hi> were, That he had treated with him from the Queen, about Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that were unknown to her, or that he had made so many vain Propositions to him to amuse him under pretence of a sincere Treaty, which in effect was only a premeditated Design to Ruin him.</p>
            <p>Although the Count of <hi>Servient</hi> was suspected on both sides, it did not lessen the Animosity which began to arise between the Queen and Prince; it was almost equally fomented by all those who came near them. Some represented to the Queen that the Division between the Prince and Madame <hi>de Chevreuse</hi> about the breach of the Marriage between the Brother of the one, and the Sister of the other, would certainly reconcile the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's Interests, and that all things would be soon reduc'd to the state they were in when the Prince was seiz'd. He on the other hand was induc'd to break with the Court by many different Interests: He found no longer any Safety with the Queen, who did nothing without the Cardinal's consent; and he dreaded to be involv'd into his former dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces again. Madame <hi>de Longueville</hi> was sensible that the Cardinal had made an irreconcileable Breach between her Husband and her, and that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54443:167"/>
after the impressions he had given him against her Conduct, she could not go to him in <hi>Normandy,</hi> without exposing her Life, or Liberty. The Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> on the other hand us'd his utmost Endeavours to get her to him; and she had no way to avoid that perillous Journey, but by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her Brother to quit the Court abruptly, and to prepare for a Civil War. The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> had no particular Aim; he follow'd his Sister's Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents without knowing them, and was for War, because it freed him from his Ecclesiastical Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which he did not love. The Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> was very sollicitous for War; not so much out of Ambition, as Jealousie which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd against the Prince. He could not endure his seeing and loving Madame <hi>de Chatillon.</hi> And whereas he could not hinder his seeing of her, but by separating them; he imagin'd that War was the only means he could imploy to that end, and that it would in time quench the Prince's Passion. The Dukes <hi>de Bouillon</hi> and <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire that War, they had lately found by Experience to what invincible Difficulties they are expos'd who undertake to maintain a Civil War against the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their King. They were sensible of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments that attend it. They knew the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; they were not ignorant how vain and deceitful their Promises were, and that it was not their Interest to advance the Prince's or the Cardinal's Affairs, but only to foment Disorders among them, in order to take an Advantage of the Divisions of <hi>France.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over joyn'd his particular Interest to the Publick's, and was in hopes to oblige the Queen sensibly, and to be altogether in her Favour, by contributing to keep the Princes within the Bounds of Duty. As for the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucalt,</hi> he durst not so publickly express his repugnancy to that War, by

            <p>But before we proceed any farther, it will be proper to enlarge upon a thing I have only hinted by the by, which is, that the Prince hindred the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> his Brother from Marrying Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiselle <hi>de Chevreuse</hi>;<note place="margin">

The Count of <hi>Bussy</hi> was strangely surpriz'd at that Question, which shew'd but little Gratitude for his past Services, and yet less Value for him, and less Consideration for his Quality; but yet he consented to it, on Condition that he should resign it into his Highnesses own hands. As soon as he had surrender'd it, he quitted him, as the Count <hi>de Grand Pré</hi> had done before, who, after having espous'd his Party with so much heat, going to Visit the Princes after their being put at Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, was receiv'd by them in a very disobliging manner.</p>
            <p>All these things gave a great check to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Affairs, and in the sequel weaken'd his Party considerably.<note place="margin">

The Reasons alledg'd for it were, that the Government of <hi>Burgundy</hi> was worth Forty Five Thousand Livres more than that of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and that consequently he certainly design'd to make use of the singular Affection the People of <hi>Guienne</hi> had for his Person, in order to execute some extraordinary Enterprize. That the People of <hi>Guienne</hi> as well as the <hi>Limosins</hi> their Neighbours, were Warlike, Light, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant. That <hi>Poitou,</hi> of which the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> was Governour, was adjoyning to that Province: That the Prince had other Friends, who were very Powerful in other adjacent Provinces: That he had only desir'd <hi>Provence</hi> for the Prince of <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:54443:169"/>On the other hand the Queen had made a new Engagement with the Coadjutor, who was strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly animated against the Prince,<note place="margin">

The King and Queen were extreamly surpriz'd and disorder'd to find themselves, as it were, alone amidst a croud of armed Men, compos'd of the Prince's Friends and Attendance, which fill'd up the Ring. The Queen was already very much displeas'd with the Prince, for his having ceas'd to see the King of late, and his being continually with <hi>Monsieur,</hi> and such of the Parliament as were most animated against the Cardinal; in so much that she was under great Apprehensions at that time. Moreover some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the Court talk'd of it, as if he had really design'd to insult Their Majesties, which made an end of exasperating them against the Prince.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> having notice of it the next day, endeavour'd to pacifie all, and engag'd the Prince with great difficulty to go to the <hi>Louvre.</hi> Where Their Majesties receiv'd him so coldly, and with so much indifference, that he retir'd in a Passion, and protested publickly that he would go there no more. This was done in so high a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that from that moment People began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Report that had been spread, of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s having an Intelligence with the Enemies of the State to wage a War against the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:54443:171"/>The first President <hi>Molé</hi> himself, who was the Prince's Friend, complain'd of it in a full House, in so much that he seem'd already to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd his Friendship;<note place="margin">

               </note> so much he was a lover of Justice, and had an aversion to Disloyalty and Rebellion against his King. And the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> being at that time in the Parliament, rising to inform that President how Injurious that Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion was to the Prince his Brother, who, as he said, aim'd at nothing but the King's Glory, and the Tranquility of the State; he answer'd him, That he was too Young to speak in such a manner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore so August an Assembly, and told him with some sharpness, that he ought to know that in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the Princes of the Blood were no more than the bare Counsellors.</p>
            <p>The President <hi>Molé</hi> did not Complain without powerful Reasons against the Conduct and ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of the Prince.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Foundation of those Complaints.</hi>
               </note> For besides divers other things that were come to his knowledge, the Prince, who had only quitted St. <hi>Maur</hi> to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he believ'd that this haughty, bold manner of proceeding would give a Reputation to his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, had at the same time sent away the Princess, the Duke <hi>D' Enguien,</hi> and Madame <hi>de Longueville</hi> to <hi>Montrond,</hi> being resolv'd to follow soon after, and to pass from thence into <hi>Guienne,</hi> where they were well dispos'd to receive him, and to embrace his Party. He had likewise sent the Count <hi>de Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanes</hi> to his Forces which serv'd in the Army in <hi>Champagne,</hi> and had order'd that Count, who at the same time had not much cause to be contented with him, to March those Troops in a Body to <hi>Stenay</hi> as soon as he should receive Orders from him. He had provided for his Garrisons, and had Two Hundred Thousand Crowns ready Money; in a word, he was preparing for War. He endeavour'd to engage Persons of Quality in his Party, and

among the rest the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> and Marshal <hi>Turenne.</hi> They were both intimate Friends to the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> who omitted nothing to engage them in the same Party he was oblig'd to follow. The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> at that time appear'd unresolv'd; he was unwilling to undertake any thing without consulting his own Safety and Advantage, and he was equally diffident of the Court and Prince. He was also willing to see how things would go, before he would declare himself. As for the Marshal of <hi>Turenne,</hi>

That he had omitted nothing to contribute to the Prince's Liberty; but that at the same time it was his Opinion that his Engagement to him was to end with his Prison; and that therefore he thought himself free to make whatever new Engagements he thought fit, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Inclinations, or Interest. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Prince had had no consideration for him since his being put at Liberty, and that far from consulting, or imparting his Designs to him, he had not only done the contrary, but besides had suffer'd those very Troops that had combated for him, which did belong to Monsieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> to perish, rather than speak a word to get Winter Quarters for them.</p>
            <p>It appear'd by all this that President <hi>Mole</hi>'s Zeal had not been blind, and that he had a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his Complaints. The Queen perceiving the first President to be in the state, and in the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents she desir'd, and that he had spoken vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously against the Prince, endeavour'd to improve that favourable Occasion to animate the Parliament against that Prince.

            <p>These Complaints were, That whereas so many Decrees, which depriv'd that Cardinal of all manner of Commerce in <hi>France,</hi> the which had been confirm'd in such a manner by Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, that there was no hope left for him ever to pretend to return into the Kingdom, she thought it very hard and strange that notwithstanding, that Minister's Name should serve for a pretence to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Persons to continue their Revol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That he had already laid in Stores, and fortify'd the Garrisons that were in his Power, rais'd Forces in the Provinces he had gain'd, and dispos'd all things so well towards a Revolt, that the Factious only expected his Orders to take Arms.

            <p>

The Queen concluded, saying, that those dismal pressing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities deserv'd to be taken into Consideration by the House, in order to apply proper Remedies thereunto, by declaring themselves absolutely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Authors thereof; and that if they had still the least Affection and Kindness for the King, they could never approve it better than at that time, now His Majesty was going to enter into his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority, at which time, according to Law, they were to give him an Account of the Government.</p>
            <p>After the Reading of this Paper, a general Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence reign'd in the House, none offering to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press their thoughts about it, excepting the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi>

               </gap> However at that time there was a great deal of reason to fear the contrary, by reason of the then disposition of the Parliament. But an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident interven'd which soon alter'd the Dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that August Assembly, which enabled the Prince happily to execute what the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> had so boldly advanc'd in his favour against the Complaints of the Court. And thus it happen'd.</p>
            <p>As the Parliament was going to deliberate upon these Complaints, News was brought that the Duke of <hi>Mercoeur</hi> was privately retir'd to <hi>Cologne</hi> to the Cardinal,<note place="margin">

who together with the Prince had already suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently declar'd their dislike of the said Match, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd a great deal of Resentment against it, and judg'd that his Highness was not altogether so much to blame as was imagin'd, in complaining still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Mazarin</hi> after his retreat out of <hi>France</hi>; and look'd upon that Match as an undeniable Proof of the excessive Power wherewith that Cardinal still rul'd the Court.</p>
            <p>Therefore, The Prince looking upon this as a very favourable Conjuncture to clear himself from the Aspersions that had been cast upon him,<note place="margin">Monsieur<hi>'s Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </note> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented a Declaration to the Parliament, written by the hand of <hi>Monsieur</hi> the King's Uncle, wherein he declar'd, That the Forces the Prince had at <hi>Marle,</hi> were kept there by his Royal Highnesses Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; That it was by his Order they tarry'd there in a Body, and moreover that he had sent <hi>le Sieur Valons,</hi> to Command them joyntly with his own, in the room of <hi>la Ferté Sennetterre,</hi> who was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Mazarin.</hi> That as to the Foreign Garrison that was in <hi>Stenay,</hi> he was satisfy'd that the Prince had us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Prince had no need of any further Apology, after this Declaration of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom, especially since the Parliament was sufficiently inclin'd to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him Innocent.

That a Prince of the Blood, whose Father had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Head of the Council by the late King's Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, could not be excluded from it. That it was very well known that he had no Strong Holds in the Kingdom to Second his pretended Designs of a Revolt; whereas <hi>Mazarin</hi> was still in possession of them all by his Creatures. That the Court was to blame to envy those few Men he had at <hi>Marle,</hi> since <hi>France</hi> was particularly indebted to them for the best part of its last Victories; and that besides they were only assembled there by his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Order, who was the Absolute Master there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. That the only Reason for which he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd the Court to exchange his Government of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy</hi> for <hi>Guienne,</hi> was to Relieve that poor Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince from the Misery it was reduc'd to under the proud and violent Domination of the Duke <hi>d' E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spernon,</hi> whose Excesses were but too well known in the World. That if he had reserv'd any Places in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> it was because they were his, the late Prince his Father having bought them, by His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty's Leave and Approbation; and that for that Reason he had a Right to keep them, especially
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:54443:174"/>
since no others had been given him in exchange in <hi>Guienne.</hi> That it was true, that he had abstain'd for some time from seeing the King, and from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting at the Council; but that no Man of Sense could blame him for it, since his most inveterate Foes, being most in Her Majesty's favour, he had reason to suspect them, and to avoid falling, for the second time, in the same Snare. That since his coming out of Prison, he had been most sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to drive the <hi>Spanish</hi> Garrison out of <hi>Stenay</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and that that was the only end of all that pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Commerce with the Enemies of the State, which made so much noise; and that therefore it was a shame to see a Prince of the Blood, under such a Pretence, pursu'd as being guilty of High Treason, and that at the Queen's sollicitations. That the Authors of that outragious Undertaking ought to be inform'd against, and constrain'd either to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie their Calumny, or to be prosecuted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law. That, notwithstanding, he submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Estate and Person to the disposal of the Parliament, and to whatever they should be pleas'd to determine.</p>
            <p>The Prince finding that this Paper had made strong Impressions in his favour,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>demands Iustice of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Accusers.</hi>
               </note> and that all things tended to his Justification in the Parliament, went thither himself, to renew his Complaints <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> and to demand reparation for the enormous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies level'd against his Honour, pointing at the same time at the Author's thereof. He said among several other things whereby he design'd the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor of <hi>Paris,</hi> that nothing could be more odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than to see Persons whose main business should tend towards the maintaining of Peace, apply themselves unfortunately to the disturbing of it, by outragious Falsities, which an implacable Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred had made them invent. The Coadjutor justly applying that Discourse to himself, finding himself
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:54443:175"/>
seconded by the Queen's Authority and Protection, rising at the same time, answer'd, That all he had done was design'd for the Publick Good, and what could be expected from a Man of Honour, whose Loyalty was untainted; That his Enemies could not accuse him of having broken his Promises, and that few Persons, at that time, were free from that defect. <hi>I wonder,</hi> reply'd the Prince, who possess'd himself more in that Occasion than he was wont to do, <hi>that any body should be so bold in this place, as to dare to cope with a Prince of the Blood, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with him. I know, Sir,</hi> reply'd the Coadjutor, <hi>what is owing to a Prince of the Blood like you: But every body is free in this place; in which, none but the King can expect a perfect Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The First President then assuming the Discourse, told them, that the Place in which they were, was not a place of Quarrel, or Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estation, but a place of Majesty: And seeing besides that the whole Palace was fill'd, on the behalves of the Prince and Coadjutor, with armed Men, ready to Charge each other, and that even Swords glitter'd on all sides, he desir'd the Prince and the Coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutor to cause their Men to retire, in order to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Gentlemen of the House the Liberty of their Opinions. After this, he turn'd towards the Prince, and told him, <hi>Your Highness is to shew by your Example the Honour and Respect that is due to this Assembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince yielding to that Advice, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately sent the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> to Command his People to retire out of the Palace.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Disorder in the great Hall.</hi>
               </note> The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adjutor at the same time went out of the great Room to desire his to retire also. The Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> walk'd seven or eight steps behind him, and was still within the Usher's Bar when the Coadjutor appear'd in the great Hall. At sight of this Prelate all those of his Party drew their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54443:175"/>
Swords, and the Prince's Friends did the same. Every one sided with the Party he serv'd, and in a moment both Troops joyn'd within reach of their Swords, and yet among so many brave Men, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated by such different hatreds, none offer'd to make a Pass, or shoot off a Pistol. The Coadjutor seeing so great a Disorder, offer'd to retire into the great Room again: but coming to the Door which goes from the Hall to the Usher's Bar, he found that the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> had seiz'd it. However he endeavour'd to open it with force: but whereas it only open'd half, and that the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> held it, that Duke at the instant the Coadjutor was entring, push'd it in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he stopt it just as that Prelate's Head was pass'd on the side of the Bar, and his Body still in the Hall. That occasion might have tempted the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> to kill the greatest Enemy of the Prince's Party, and to Revenge the Shame and Affront a Prince of the Blood had just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in full Parliament. He contented himself however with securing him, that his Life might answer for the Event of the Disorder. Thus the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> unwilling to commit an Act of Cruelty, and the Prince's Attendants, who at that time were near that Duke, being unresolv'd in a case of that Consequence, gave time to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Champlatreux,</hi> Son to the first President, to arrive, with Order to dis-engage the Coadjutor, and to draw him out of the greatest peril, he was ever expos'd to.</p>
            <p>This proceeding of the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> towards the Coadjutor,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Duke of</hi> Orleance<hi>'s Expedient.</hi>
               </note> prov'd a new Subject of Hatred and Envy amongst them and their Friends, which without doubt would have occasion'd great Disorders, had not the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> compos'd all by an Expedient he invented, which was, That for the future the Coadjutor should no longer assist
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54443:176"/>
at the Assemblies of the Parliament; and that the Prince should only be attended there by a small number of his ordinary Attendance.</p>
            <p>During these Transactions the Queen perceiving that the Parliament daily declar'd more and more in favour of the Prince,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>justify'd.</hi>
               </note> and that she should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose her Authority in vain in pursuing his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation any further, on a sudden relinquish'd her pursuit, and declar'd that she desir'd nothing so much as his Justification: And some days after it the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> at her Majesty's Intreaty, obtain'd a Decree from the Court, by which the Accusations, and Complaints exhibited against him, were declar'd false, and without ground, as having been contriv'd on purpose to animate the People, and to increase Divisions.</p>
            <p>After so many Obstacles were happily remov'd, there was reason to expect that all things would soon be reduc'd to a Calm. But the Storm soon rose again about the <note n="*" place="margin">

Those three Old Men, whom the Prince look'd upon as the Cardinal's Slaves, had insinuated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so far into the Queen's favour, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd so far into the Intrigues of the Court, since the removal of Messieurs <hi>de Servient, Le Tellier,</hi> and <hi>Lionne,</hi> that Monsieur <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi> was publickly design'd First Minister, President <hi>Mole</hi> Lord-Keeper of the Great Seal, in Monsieur <hi>Seguier</hi>'s room, from whom it was to be taken, and Monsieur <hi>de la Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> Super-Intendant of the Exchequer.

            <p>To that end he made use of one <hi>Prioly,</hi> a <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Gentleman,<note place="margin">

            <p>Things being thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For that reason, he distributed his Money to all those who were engag'd with him, and press'd them so much to make their Levies, that his Precipitation serv'd them for a pretence to make ill ones.</p>
            <p>Within a few days after his Arrival, the Count <hi>du Doignon</hi> came to him, and openly declar'd for his Party; The Duke of <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>de la Force</hi> did the same, and the Prince of <hi>Tarente,</hi> who was come to <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> sent him word that he likewise enter'd into his Party. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>d' Arpajou</hi> was more difficult to be wrought, and he made use of the same Conduct on this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, for which he had already been rewarded during the Princes Imprisonment; He demanded Conditions which could not be granted, and treated with the Court, when he found that the Affairs of the Prince were decaying.</p>

               </gap>r'd being perform'd, the execution of his Promises was expected. This Duke, for a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable time, avoided the giving a positive Answer, being desirous, at once, to keep in with the Court, which made him great Advances, and not to break with the Prince, of whom he might stand in need. He likewise saw, that Monsieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> whose Interests he once thought inseparable from his, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd to joyn with the Prince; That the Prince of <hi>Tarente</hi> had embrac'd that Party without him, and that the Marquess <hi>de la Force</hi> remain'd united to Monsie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r <hi>de Turenne.</hi> He consider'd, moreover, that neither being follow'd by his Brother, nor by the others I have mention'd, according to his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement with the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> there would not be so much safety for him in the Party he was going to embrace; and that the Prince would express no more Gratitude for what Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> and he would do for the future, than for what they had already done. He likewise found that there would be a necessity of making a new Treaty with the Prince, less advantageous for him than that they had already agreed upon. In fine, all these Reasons joyn'd to the Promises he receiv'd from the Court, and seconded by all the Industry of his Dutchess, who had a great Influence over him, hindred him from following his first Design, and from declaring for the Prince: But then, in order to get off handsomly, he turn'd Mediator for an Accommodation between him and the Court. After having had some particular Confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nces with the Queen upon that Subject, he sent back <hi>Gourville,</hi> who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d been dispatch'd to him from the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> to offer the Prince whatever he had

demanded for himself, and for his Friends, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the disposal of the Government of <hi>Bla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e,</hi> without requiring any other Conditions on his side, than those <hi>Servient</hi> and <hi>de Lionne</hi> had demanded in the first Project of the Treaty, which was made at <hi>Paris,</hi> at his coming out of Prison.</p>
            <p>Moreover, Monsieur <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi> offer'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Propositions of Accommodation by the said <hi>Gourville,</hi> but whereas they tended to hinder the Cardinal's Return, his Offers could not equal those the Queen had made him by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon.</hi> He only offer'd to remain inseparably united to the Prince after the Cardinal's overthrow, and to allow him whatever share he should desire in the Government of Affairs. The Court offer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides to consent to an Interview between him and the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> at <hi>Richelieu,</hi> there to Examine together the Conditions of a sincere Peace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto the Court seem'd to be sincerely inclin'd. But it was the Misfortune of <hi>France,</hi> and his own, that he refus'd to hearken to so many Advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Proffers, being vex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d that the Queen's offers should be made by the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s means, by reason that he had expected that the said Duke and his Brother would be very considerable to his Party, being sensible that none could maintain the Posts of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> and <hi>Stenay</hi> like them; and that besides the old Troops he had left there to be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Marshal of <hi>Turenne,</hi> thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd useless, and were in danger of being dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated or defeated. He consider'd besides that the Measures he had taken with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> towards <hi>Champain</hi> would be of no effect, and that neither his own Troops, nor the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should be able to find out a Chief to fill up that Post, with that Esteem the World had for Monsieur <hi>de Turenne.</hi> All these Reasons touch'd the Prince sensibly, and tho' he endeavour'd to conceal his Resentments, he could
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:54443:181"/>
not forbear answering the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> pretty smartly; That it was not Honourable to hearken to Propositions one had no mind to effectuate: That he should declare himself according to his Promise; That Monsieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> should repair at the Head of the Forces that were gone to <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> and that then he would be in a condition to hearken to the offers of the Court, and to make an Honourable Treaty. <hi>Gourville</hi> was sent back with the said Answer, and order'd to acquaint the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> with the Reasons for which he refus'd an Interview at <hi>Richelieu.</hi> The chief were, That the aim of the said Conference was not to make a Peace, but only to hinder him from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king War: That while the whole Kingdom was at the point of Declaring against the Court, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were preparing considerable Succours of Men, Money, and Ships, endeavours were us'd to engage him upon a Publick Negotiation, the very tumour of which would hinder his Levies, and debauch all those from him, which were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to embrace his Party. Besides these general Reasons, there were more particular ones, which did not permit him to trust his Interests in the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s hands, being jealous of his strict Engagements with the Coadjutor of <hi>Paris,</hi> his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd Enemy, as well as that Prelate's with the Court, which had newly promis'd him a Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's Cap. This Incident put him upon a very strange Resolution; for finding that the Coadjutor, either out of Interest, or Pride, affected to cross him continually, he form'd the Design of seizing him in <hi>Paris.</hi> Whatever difficulty this Enterprize seem'd to be attended with, <hi>Gourville</hi> undertook it, after having receiv'd the Princes Order for it in Writing; and the Coadjutor had certainly been taken one Evening he went to the Hostel of <hi>Chev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuse</hi> had he come back in his own Coach; but
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:54443:182"/>
having discharg'd it, together with his Attendance, the Coach that carry'd him home again could not be distinguish'd with certainty; in so much that the Business was put off for some days, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards discover'd; those that are employ'd on such Occasions, having seldom Discretion enough to rest satisfy'd with the knowledge one thinks fit to give them, or Fidelity and Secresie enough to put it safely in Execution.</p>
            <p>Thus all things were dispos'd for War on all sides. Monsieur <hi>de Chateauneuf,</hi> who at that time was Head, or President of the Council, had caus'd the Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to repair to <hi>Bourges,</hi> where the King's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence instantly restor'd that City to its former O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: At the Report of those happy begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> Madame <hi>de Longueville,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> were oblig'd to quit <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trond,</hi> with their Forces, to retire into <hi>Guienne.</hi> They left the Chevalier <hi>de Riviere</hi> expiring; he dy'd the same day, regretted by all those who knew him, for besides his being possess'd of all the Qualifications requir'd in a compleat Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, few Persons of his Age have given so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs of Conduct, Fidelity, and Generosity, being free from all Self-Interest, as he had done in so many hazardous Enterprizes in which he had been employ'd.</p>
            <p>The Marquess <hi>de Pergan</hi> remain'd Governour of that place, which was block'd up by a small Body lodg'd at St. <hi>Amand,</hi> of which <hi>Palluau</hi> was Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-General. The Court was come as far as <hi>Poitiers,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi> insisted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it to <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> considering that since the War was only grounded upon the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etence of the Cardinal's Return, it was necessary to improve his Absence, and that it was sufficient for the Interest of the State, and yet more for his own in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to continue his said Absence. He likewise
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:54443:182"/>
insisted that the King's Presence was a powerful Motive to keep the people in awe at the Birth of these Disorders; That in drawing near the Prince, who was neither certain of <hi>Guienne,</hi> nor of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> his Designs might easily be dissipated, whereas on the contrary they would be strengthen'd by the absence of the Court. But th<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se Counsels of <hi>Chateauneuf</hi> rais'd too much Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie in the Cardinal's Friends, to be follow'd at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> without having first been examin'd at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne:</hi> And whereas they were forc'd to tarry for his Orders, their delays and diversity caus'd conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Irresolutions, and kept the Court incertain at <hi>Poitiers</hi> until his Return, which follow'd soon after.</p>
            <p>On the other hand the Baron of <hi>Batteville</hi> was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd in the River of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> with the <hi>Spanish</hi> Fleet, composd of Eight Men of War, and some Fire-ships. He fortify'd <hi>Talmond,</hi> where there was a Body of foot of 1500 Men. The City of <hi>Saintes</hi> had surrender'd it self without Resistance, <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> which has a Port upon the <hi>Charante,</hi> was pretty well fortify'd, and the Prince was Master of the River as far as <hi>Angoulesme,</hi> excepting <hi>Coignac.</hi> The Count of <hi>Ionsac,</hi> the King's Lieutenant in <hi>Saintonge,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Coignac,</hi> was there in Person, to the end that place might serve him to make his Conditions the better in the Party he should embrace, being as yet unresolv'd. In this irresolution he began a Commerce of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with the Prince, and writ enough to him, to make him believe, that he only design'd to save Appearances, and that he wou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d deliver it into his hands at the approach of a Siege. This hope, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the state of the Prince's Forces, which at that time were very inconsiderable, made him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve upon Marching towards <hi>Coignac.</hi> He was sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that the success of his Enterprizes depended upon the Reputation of his Arms; but at the same time he likewise knew that wanting Forces, and all
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:54443:183"/>
things necessary to form a Siege, this was the only one he could pretend to succeed in. So that ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his hopes upon that Governour, he caus'd the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> to go from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> to Assemble whatever Forces he had on Foot, which only amounted in all to three Regiments of Foot, and Three Hundred Horse, and to Invest <hi>Coignac,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Tarente</hi> was to repair with what Forces he had. The Report of their March being spread in the Country, whatever could be remov'd out of the Fields, was carry'd into <hi>Coignac,</hi> and abundance of the Nobility retir'd there also, to express their Zeal for the King's Service, and chiefly to Guard themselves what they had caused to be transported there. This considerable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gentlemen easily kept the Inhabitants in awe, and made them resolve to shut up their Gates, in hopes of being soon reliev'd by Count <hi>d' Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> General of the King's Forces, who was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing towards them. And whereas they had but little Confidence in the Count of <hi>Ionsac,</hi> whom they equally suspected of Weakness, and of being gain'd by the Prince, they watch'd him so narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that one may say, that he resolv'd to defend the place, because the Power of Surrendring it was taken from him.</p>
            <p>This was the only thing in which the Gentry shew'd any Vigour, for during Eight days that the Prince's Men tarry'd before <hi>Coignac,</hi> without Arms, without Ammunition, without Officers, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Discipline, being at the same time fatigu'd by continual Rains, which broke the Bridge of Boats they had made over the <hi>Charante,</hi> for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of Quarters; those within never made the least use of those Disorders, and kept close with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Town with the Inhabitants, only firing from behind the Walls. However the Prince being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that the Town was upon the point of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendring,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:54443:183"/>
departed from <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and came to the Camp, with the Duke of <hi>Nemours.</hi> The day after his Arrival, the Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> receiving Intelligence that the Bridge of Boats was broken, and that Major-General <hi>Nort</hi> was retrench'd in a Suburb on the other side of the River with 500 Men, without any possibility of being succour'd, march'd against him with 2000 Foot, compos'd of the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Suitz</hi> Guards, and with the King's <hi>Gendarmes, Chevanx-Legers,</hi> and Guards, and some Gentry. He forc'd <hi>Nort</hi>'s Quarter without hardly meeting any resistance, and thus reliev'd <hi>Coignac</hi> to the Prince's Face, who was lodg'd on the other side of the River. Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was satisfy'd with having Reliev'd the place, and suffer'd the Prince to retire without following of him.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this Success was not very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in it self, yet it increas'd Count <hi>d' Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi>'s Hopes, and gave a Reputation to his Arms. Nay, moreover he judg'd himself in a condition to make some Progresses, and knowing that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>d' Estissac</hi> had reduc'd <hi>Rochel</hi> to its former O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, excepting the Towers, which shut the Port, he resolv'd to march thither, relying upon the good-will of the Inhabitants, and their hatred to Count <hi>du Doignon</hi> their Governour. He had caus'd those Towers to be fortify'd, and kept a Gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I must confess that the small Resistance the Garrison of the Towers made, hardly afforded him time enough to form the Design of it: For Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> being arriv'd with his Forces at <hi>Rochel,</hi> and assisted by the Marquess <hi>d' Estissac,</hi> lately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested with the Count <hi>du Doignon</hi>'s Governments, he found <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

However the Towers might have held out some time, had the <hi>Switzers</hi> prov'd as brave and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as that Count had expected. But instead of answering his Expectation, they resolv'd to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem themselves by a piece of Treachery, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Resistance of three days, Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> having sent them word, that he would allow them no Quarter unless they stab'd <hi>Basse</hi> their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, they made no scruple of executing this horrid Order: But <hi>Basse</hi> expecting to meet more Compassion from Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> than from his own Men, flung himself wounded as he was from the top of the Towers into the Port, where that General caus'd him to be dispa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> yet, which he had not the wit to improve; for the Prince confiding absolutely on a Major-Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, who was commanded by him to burn, or break the Bridge of Boats, on that assurance, posted his Men in divers Quarters, some being a League and a half distant from his own, without fear of a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, the River lying between him and the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But this Officer only loosen'd the Boats, and let them float down the stream of the River; in so much that Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi>'s Men having stopt them, the Bridge was re-built in an hours time, and he caus'd Three Hundred Horse, and some Foot to cross over it to guard the head of the said Bridge.

He found the Advice that had been given him to be true, and the Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horse were in Battalia in the Meadow next to the River: But at the same time he found the Enemies had not bethought themselves of what he fear'd, or had lost the Opportunity of putting it in execution, since that not being pass'd while they could do it without hindrance, there was no likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood they would attempt it in his Presence. Some Skirmishes past for some time without any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable loss on either side; and his Infantry being arriv'd, he caus'd a long Retrenchment to be made over against the Bridge, leaving the Meadow and the River between Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> and him. The two Armies remain'd above three Weeks in the same place, without undertaking any thing, contenting themselves with living in a Fertil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where all things were plenty.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi>'s delays, and all his Conduct convinc'd the Prince, that he was no longer to expect any thing from him, or from Monsieur <hi>de Turenne,</hi> and for that Reason he exclaim'd and acted against them with all the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion imaginable, altho' their Engagements had been different. For it is most certain that the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> had made an Agreement with the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> and afterwards with Monsieur <hi>Laisné,</hi> upon the Conditions heretofore related.

               </gap> commanded. Many have blam'd this Action, and look'd upon it as a piece of Treason: For my part, without taking upon me to condemn, or defend it, I shall barely relate, that <hi>Marsin</hi> having long been devoted to the Prince's Service, had receiv'd the Government of <hi>Bellegarde</hi> (which place belong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>nia,</hi> and the Government of <hi>Tortose</hi> for him, in which he serv'd the King with great Loyalty, and good Fortune. And when the Prince was made a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, <hi>Marsin,</hi> who was taken up at the same time, was tax'd with no other Crime than being his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Nay more, his Government of <hi>Tortose</hi> being given to <hi>Launay Gringelinere,</hi> he suffer'd it to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken soon after. <hi>Marsin</hi>'s Confinement lasted as long as the Prince's, and after his being put at Liberty, he remain'd some time without any Employment: But the Affairs of <hi>Catalonia</hi> being in an ill Posture, and the Court being at a loss to find a Person ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to redress them, <hi>Marsin</hi> was propos'd for the second time by the Prince, and the Duke <hi>de la Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault</hi> made the overture of it to Monsieur <hi>Le Tellier,</hi> without <hi>Marsin</hi>'s solliciting in the least for

               </gap> It was impossible for him to defer his Journey <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nto <hi>Catalonia,</hi> to expect the issue of the doubtful things that pass'd at the Court, which were more likely to be decided by an Accommodation, than by a Civil War. Therefore he set forward towards his new Employment, for which he was solely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd to the Prince, who had likewise lately given him the Government of <hi>Stenay,</hi> which was vacant by the Death of <hi>la Moussaie.</hi> So that this Action of <hi>Marsin</hi> may bear two very different Constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap> Province the King had entrusted him with, will find him very disloyal; and those who will look upon him running after most pressing, and almost indispensible Obligations, will believe him a very worthy Gentleman. Few Persons of sense will dare to say that he is Guilty, or declare him In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. In fine, both those that are against him, and those that favour him, will agree in pitying of him; the one, for a Fault he was necessitated to commit; the others, for having acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of what he ow'd, by a fault.</p>
            <p>The Court was at that time at <hi>Poitiers,</hi> as I have said, and Monsieur <hi>de Chateauneuf</hi> possess'd in appearance the first Place in Affairs, altho' the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal still possess'd it in Effect. Nevertheless this Old Man's firm, decisive, familiar way of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directly opposite to the Cardinal's, began to give a relish to his Ministry, and even began to please the Queen. The Cardinal was too well inform'd thereof to suffer him to gain any more ground; and it is very probable that he judg'd his return ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely necessary to remedy the Evil he dreaded in his own particular, since otherwise he little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted the Interest of the State; in so much that thereby he afforded the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> a Pretence to declare against the Court.

This Army pass'd the River <hi>Seine</hi> at <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Things were in this condition when the Prince remov'd from <hi>La Bergerie,</hi> where he had remain'd three Weeks, without Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi>'s, who was on the other side of the River at <hi>Tonay Charante,</hi> and Master of the Bridge of Boats, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken any thing against him. Nevertheless as the Number and Goodness of his Forces was very much inferiour to the King's Army, he avoided the occasions of being constrain'd to so unequal a Combat. To that end he march'd to <hi>la Bernette,</hi> three Leagues distant from the King's Army, in order to have more time to consider in case they should march up to him. He remain'd there some time without any considerable Action on either side: But finding that far from making any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in that Country, he was not able to remain there in sight of Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> he turn'd all

his thoughts to the preservation of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and to Fortifie the Cities that were in his Party. To that end he resolvd to march thither with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and believ'd himself capable to maintain <hi>Saintonge</hi> for some time, in leaving on the one side the Count <hi>du Doignon</hi> in the Garrisons, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> at <hi>Talmont,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Tarente</hi> in <hi>Saintes</hi> and <hi>Taillebourg,</hi> to hasten their Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Having thus given his Orders, he caus'd his Infantry, and his Baggage to march to <hi>Talmont,</hi> in order to be Transported by Sea to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and after a long march with his Cavalry the first day, he stopt the second at St. <hi>Andras,</hi> within four Leagues of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> believing himself without the Enemy's reach. But Count <hi>d' Harcourt,</hi> who had follow'd him close, arriv'd within sight of his Quarter, when he least suspected it, and would certainly have forc'd it, had his foremost Troops entred it without hesitation; whereas they plac'd themselves in Battalia over against St. <hi>Andras,</hi> whilst the others attack'd the Quarter of <hi>Baltazar,</hi> who repuls'd them with Vigour, and came to joyn the Prince, who got on Horse back at the very first noise. They remain'd some time in sight, but the Night proving very dark, there was no Combat, and the Prince retir'd without any loss, being more oblig'd to the Enemies over-great precaution for his Safety, than to his own. Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> follow'd him no farther, and the Prince persisting in the Design of going to <hi>Bergerac,</hi> in order to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it, pass'd at <hi>Libourne,</hi> of which the Count of <hi>Maure</hi> was Governour, and left Orders with him for the continuation of some Out-works. The Marshal <hi>de la Force</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Bergerac</hi> just as he did, with his Son the Marquess of <hi>Castelnau,</hi> who commanded there; and the Duke <hi>de la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault,</hi> who was come back from the Upper <hi>Guienne,</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> repair'd thither also.</p>

At present I pass to the recital of what the Prince did during that Interval. His chief care was speedily to repair the Towns of <hi>Guienne,</hi> and particularly to put <hi>Bergerac</hi> in a condition of Defence: He employ'd some days about it with great Application, at which time he receiv'd intelligence that his Affairs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay'd in <hi>Saintonge</hi>; That the Count <hi>du Doignon</hi> was shut up within his Garrisons, and durst not peep out of them, through his us<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al Jealousies; That the Prince of <hi>Tarente,</hi> on his side, had receiv'd some disadvantage in a Combat near <hi>Pons</hi>; That <hi>Saintes,</hi> which he judg'd capable of sustaining a long Siege, by the Works that had been made there, and by reason of the Garrison, which was compos'd of his best Forces, had notwitstanding surrender'd it self, without any considerable Defence; and that <hi>Taillebourg</hi> was besieg'd, and ready to follow the Example of <hi>Saintes.</hi> He was moreover inform'd, that the Marquess of St. <hi>Luc</hi> assembled a Body in order to oppose the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Caudecôte,</hi> and some other places of small Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. This last Evil was the only one he could any ways remedy; but whereas the Marquess was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ill at a distance from the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> he did not think it proper to pass into the Upper <hi>Guienne,</hi> without being more particularly inform'd of what pass'd at <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>: To which end, he writ to the Princess, and to Madame <hi>de Longueville</hi> to repair to <hi>Libourne,</hi> where he arriv'd at the same time with
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:54443:190"/>
them. He only tarry'd there a day, and gave what Orders he could to prevent the Progress of the Evil, which Division began to create in his Party, and in his Family. After which, he went away with the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> to joyn the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who was at <hi>Staffort,</hi> four Leagues beyond <hi>Agen</hi>; And being inform'd by a Courier near <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourne,</hi> that St. <hi>Luc</hi> was marching towards <hi>Staffort,</hi> he judg'd his presence would be very necessary there, and therefore advanc'd with all the speed imaginable, and found the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> who assembled his Quarters, being perswaded that St. <hi>Luc</hi> would attack him. This Marquess being at <hi>Miradoux</hi> with the Regiments of <hi>Champayne</hi> and <hi>Lorrain,</hi> his Cavalry being lodg'd apart in Villages and Farms, on a sudden the Prince resolv'd to march all Night, to surprize the Quarters of his Cavalry, and set insta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tly forward with the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault:</hi> and tho' the Way were long, and the Road bad, he arriv'd before day at a Bridge, where the Enemy had a Guard of Twelve or Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Horse. He caus'd them immediately to be charg'd, and those who made their escape, having alarm'd all the rest, they got on Horse-back. Some Squadrons fac'd him near <hi>Miradoux,</hi> the which he charg'd, and easily broke them. Six Regiments were defeated, and he took abundance of Equipage, and many Prisoners; after which he retir'd towards <hi>Miradoux,</hi> a small City situate on the top of a Hill, of which it contains one half, and has no other Fortification than an ill Dith, and a single Wall, to which the Houses are adjoyning. At break of Day St. <hi>Luc</hi> plac'd all his Forces in Battalia upon a Level before the Gate of the Town. The Prince tarry'd at the bottom of the Hill for those the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> was to bring him, which arriv'd soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But whereas the ascent is pretty steep, and very long, and that the Soil is fat in Winter time,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:54443:190"/>
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore he only caused his Infantry to advance instantly, and forc'd the Enemy's to retire from some Posts they had possess'd themselves of, by Firing at them. Two or three Squadrons also engag'd, and the whole day past in Skirmishes, St. <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> not quitting the high Ground he was posted upon, and the Prince not thinking it fit to attack him in so Advantageous a Post without Canon, which he could not have until the next day. He order'd two Pieces to be sent for, and in the mean time judging that the Report of his Arrival would surprize his Enemies more than the Advantage he had gain'd over them, he set some Prisoners at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, in order to carry the News of it to St. <hi>Luc,</hi> which soon produc'd the Effect he expected; for the Souldiers were terrify'd at it, and it caus'd such a Consternation even among the Officers, that they had hardly patience to tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ore-seen this Retreat, plac'd Corps de Guard so near the Enemy's, that Notice was given him of their Retreat as soon as they mov'd; but it may be said, that his extream Diligence hindred him from defeating them absolutely; for without tarrying until the Foot was got into the Road, where he might have cut them in pieces with ease, he charg'd them upon the edge of the Ditch of <hi>Miradoux,</hi> and falling with Sword in Hand upon the Battalion of <hi>Champayne</hi> and <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi> he overthrew them into the Ditch, where they demanded Quarter, flinging down their Arms. But whereas it was impossible to get at them on Horse-back, they found means to get into <hi>Miradoux</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, not with a design to defend the place, but
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:54443:191"/>
to save their Lives. The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> fought all along next the Prince his Brother, who follow'd the Marquess of St. <hi>Luc</hi> and the Runaways, as far as <hi>Leytoure,</hi> and then came back to Invest <hi>Miradoux,</hi> into which Major-General <hi>Marins, Cominges,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with several other Officers were got. The Prince caus'd them to be summon'd, not imagining that a beaten Party, without Ammunition, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, would undertake to defend so weak a Place. And indeed they offer'd immediately to surrender it; but the Prince, who was unwilling to let such good Infantry escape, and did not value the place, insisted to have them Prisoners of War, or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them not to serve in six Months time; which Conditions appear'd so hard to them, that they resolv'd to Defend the place themselves, and to make amends for the shame they had suffer'd the day before, instead of augmenting it by such a Capitulation. They found moreover that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants had Provisions, and consider'd that the Prince was not in a condition to make Lines: They believ'd that it would be easie to send them Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Match, and Lead, as indeed the Marquess of St. <hi>Luc</hi> did the following day, and still continu'd to refresh them with all Necssaries, as long as the Siege lasted. During these Transactions the Prince sent back the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and soon found that it had been better for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Miradoux</hi> on the Conditions that were offer'd him, than to engage on a Siege, wanting every thing, as he did, not so much as being certain to get any Canon. However as we are often neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitated to continue cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly what we have begun in a Heat, he resolv'd to persist in his Enterprize to the end, hoping thereby to astonish his Enemies. To that end he got two Pieces of Ordnance from <hi>Agen,</hi> the one a Ten, and the other a Twelve Pounder, with a small quantity of Balls; he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:54443:191"/>
that number sufficient to make a Breach, and take the Town by Storm, before Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> who was on his March thither, could come up to him. He made himself Master of some Houses pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tty near the Gates, where those two Pieces of Ordnance were plac'd in a Battery, and did a great deal of Execution in the Walls; but the Balls not holding out, he was forc'd to give Souldiers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to gather up the Balls that had been shot, out of the Ditches. The Enemies made a pretty good Defence, considering their scarcity of Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they made two Sallies with a great deal of Vigour. In fine, the Breach began to appear reasonable, and the Wall being fallen with Houses that were adjoyning to it, had made a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Overture; but this Rubbish serv'd the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged instead of a new Retrenchment, by reason that the top of the House where the Breach was made being fallen into the Cellar, they set it on fire, and retrench'd themselves on the other side; in so much that this burning Cellar became a Ditch, impossible to be cross'd. This Obstacle stop'd the Prince, who was unwilling to hazard an Attack, which certainly would have discourag'd his Men, and encourag'd his Enemies. Therefore he resolv'd to make another Breach in a place where the Houses had no Cellars, and had not fir'd above a day against it, when he was inform'd that Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was Marching towards him, and would be the next day at <hi>Miradoux.</hi> Their Forces being too unequal to hazard a Combat, he was forc'd to raise the Siege, and to retire to <hi>Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,</hi> where he arriv'd without having been pursued. This City is neither larger, nor stronger than <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoux,</hi> but whereas Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was on the other side of the <hi>Garonne,</hi> and that he could only cross it at <hi>Auvilars,</hi> the Prince being Master of the other side of the Country, separated his Quarters,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:54443:192"/>
supposing it was sufficient to place some near <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilars,</hi> and to Order Parties to be continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tach'd on that side, to be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that new Forces, and new Officers generally execute what is commanded them in a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner from those who have more Experience: And this Order, which would have been sufficient to secure a Camp, was like to ruin the Prince, and to expose him to the shame of being surpriz'd and defeated; by reason that none of the Parties that were Commanded follow'd his Orders, but instead of getting Intelligence of Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they fell a pillaging the Neighbouring Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, in so much that he cross'd the River, and march'd in Battalia in the middle of the Prince's Quarters, and came within a quarter of a League of the place where he was, before any Alarm was given, or he receiv'd the least Notice of it.

                  </gap>span,</hi> which afforded time enough to some Boats fill'd with Musqueteers to cross over to them, and to force the Enemies to retire. That very day the Prince receiv'd Intelligence that his Horse was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd at St. <hi>Mary,</hi> without having fought, or lost any part of his Equipage, and that his Guards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themselves still in <hi>Le Pergan,</hi> where it was impossible to succour them. The next day they yielded themselves Prisoners of War; and that was the only Advantage Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> drew from an Occasion, in which his Fortune, and the Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the Prince's Men had offer'd him an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Victory. These ill Successes were soon follow'd by the Sedition of <hi>Agen,</hi> the which oblig'd the Prince to turn his greatest hopes towards <hi>Paris,</hi> and to make it the Seat of War, as I shall relate in the sequel.</p>
            <p>The War was maintain'd in <hi>Guienne</hi> much more through the Vigilance and Reputation of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> than by the Valour and Number of his Forces; and Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> by his Conduct and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:54443:193"/>
Fortune had already repair'd all the disadvantage which the Marquess of St. <hi>Luc</hi>'s Defeat at <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doux</hi> had occasion'd. The Siege of <hi>Miradoux</hi> was rais'd; The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Guards, and three or four Hundred Horse had been taken at <hi>le Pergan,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> himself with the rest of his Forces had been constrain'd to quit <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>affort,</hi> and to cross the River <hi>Garonne</hi> at <hi>Boüe,</hi> and to retire at <hi>Agen:</hi> But the Divisions of that City soon made that Prince sensible that it would no longer remain in his Party, than while constrain'd to it by his Presence, or a strong Garrison. And therefore he resolv'd to throw the Regiment of Foot, of <hi>Conty</hi> into it, and to take possession of one of the Gates of the City, in order to oblige the People to receive a Garrison: But whereas this Design was not kept secret, it was soon rumour'd throughout the City. Upon which the Inhabitants immediately betook themselves to their Arms, and made Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes; The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being inform'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, got on Horse-back, to stop the Tumult by his Presence, and to remain Master of the Gate of <hi>Grave</hi> until the aforesaid Regiment had taken possession of it: But the arrival of the Souldiers increas'd the Disorder, instead of appeasing it: They entred and made a halt in the first Street, and tho' the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and all the Officers endeav'd to appease the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, they could not hinder the Streets from being barricado'd in a moment. However the People still preserv'd their Respect towards the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and towards all the General Officers, but at the same time the Animosity increas'd in all places where his Presence was wanting. It was impossible that things should remain long in that condition; the Souldiers, as I have already rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had taken Possession of the Gate of <hi>Grave,</hi> and half the adjoyning Street; The People were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:54443:193"/>
in Arms, all the Streets were barricado'd, and Corps <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e Guards plac'd every where; Night drew on, which would have increas'd the Disorder, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> found himself necessitated either to quit the Town shamefully, or cause it to be p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ilag'd and burnt, either of which apparently would have ruin'd his Affairs: For if he quitted the Town, the King's Forces would be receivd into it, and if he burnt it, it would occasion the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt of the whole Province against him. Those Reasons induc'd him to endeavour an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, which in appearance might save his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and serve for a pretence to Pardon the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Agen.</hi> The Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> spoke to some of the most considerable Citizens, and prevail'd with them to go to the Town-Hall, there to Depute some among them to the Prince to beg his Pardon, and to intreat him to come to their Assembly, there to prescribe the means to preserve <hi>Agen</hi> in the Submission and Loyalty they had sworn to him. The Prince accordingly went thither, and told them, that it had always been his Intention to preserve their Freedom entire; and that the only end for which he had sent Souldiers thither, was to ease them, and help them to Guard the City; but that since they did not desire it, he was willing to remove them, provided the City would raise a Regiment of Foot at their own Charge, and give him the Names of the Officers. These Conditions were easily agreed to; the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricado's were remov'd, the Souldiers march'd out again, and the City remain'd in appearance as quiet and full of Submission, as it was before the Sedition. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who could not confide in those Appearances, remain'd some time in <hi>Agen,</hi> to put the City in its former state again; at which time he receiv'd the News, that the Army from <hi>Flanders,</hi> Commanded by the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi>

and the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s Forces, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> were joyn'd, and on their March towards the River <hi>Loire.</hi> This Joy was notwithstanding mix'd with some Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet: On the one hand, he saw an Army from <hi>Spain,</hi> he had so long expected, in the middle of the Kingdom, which might come to the Relief of <hi>Montro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their Armies being separate, it was impossible for them to keep the Field before the King's Army, Commanded by the Marshals of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi> and <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> reinforc'd by the Troops <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Cardinal had brought along with him, besides the Neighbourhood of the Court. The Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>'s Orders were to cross the River of <hi>Loire,</hi> in order to relieve <hi>Montrond,</hi> and to March imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately towards <hi>Guienne</hi>; whereas the Orders the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> daily receiv'd from the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> were directly opposite. <hi>Monsieur</hi> could not consent that the Army should march away so far from <hi>Paris,</hi> fearing lest the People, or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should alter their minds, seeing the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi>'s Army march into <hi>Guienne,</hi> while the King's remain'd in their Neighbourhood.

               </gap>ut no Bounds to his Ambition and his Hopes, he did not question but in making a particular Peace, he should be chosen with the Cardinal, to conclude the General Peace.

In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he writ several times to the Prince to press him to quit <hi>Guienne</hi>; he represented to him, how necessary his Presence was in the Army; that in suffering it to be destroy'd, he would lose his last Stake; but that in making Progresses in the heart of the Kingdom, and in the King's sight, he would not only immediately retrieve his Affairs in <hi>Guienne,</hi> but all the rest of his Party. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> suffer'd himself easily to be perswaded by <hi>Chavigny</hi>'s Reasons; but the principal Motive which induc'd him to it, was his desire of quitting <hi>Guienne</hi> at a time when the weakness of his Army oblig'd him continually to fly before Count <hi>d' Harcourt.</hi> He
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:54443:195"/>
communicated his Design to the Duke <hi>de la Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault,</hi> and to <hi>Marsin</hi>; both of them represented to him equally, what was to be fear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d, and hop'd for, in so doing, without giving him any Advice about it; but at the same time both desir'd earnestly to follow him. He chose the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> to accompany him, and left <hi>Marsin</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> relying absolutely upon his Care for the maintaining his Party in <hi>Guienne,</hi> and the preserving of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> not only among the Divisions that had been fomented among the People, and in the Parliament, but also to hinder the separate Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and of Madame <hi>de Longueville</hi> from augmenting their Mis-understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and thereby cause the loss of that City, in which Affairs were in the state I am going to relate.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants were divided in two Cabals: The Rich Citizens compos'd the one, who were resolv'd to maintain the Authority of their Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, and to render themselves so considerable, and so necessary in the City, that the Prince and Parliament might look upon them as those who could most contribute towards their Preservation. The other Cabal consisted of the meanest, and most seditious part of the City, who having often assembled themselves without any Design at a place near the Castle of the <hi>Ha,</hi> call'd <hi>L' Hormee,</hi> at last took the Name of it themselves. The Parliament was as much divided as the People; the Members of that Body who were against the Court were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in two Factions; The one was call'd <hi>the Great Fronde,</hi> and the other <hi>the Small one.</hi> Altho' both of them agreed in being for the Prince, they were very much opposite in all the rest: In the beginning <hi>L' Hormee</hi> had been united to both, and had often separated from it according to the divers Motives of Interest, which commonly sway those

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>allen out, augmented the Credit and Insolence of that Faction to that degree, in order to draw them on their side, that thereby they advanc'd the loss of the Party, in exasperating the Parliament, and the rest of the People, and in giving way to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plots, and other Contrivances of the Court, which finally brought <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> back to its former Allegiance to the King.

                  </gap>ent</hi> of the Subjects which occasion'd all these Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, without entring upon the particulars of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, that cannot be written. The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> having suffer'd himself to be perswaded by some of his People, who were gain'd by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> to fall out publickly with the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville,</hi> upon pretences, which good Manners, and Consanguinity should have oblig'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal; out of hatred to one another, they kindled the Fury of the <hi>Hormee,</hi> and sacrific'd, in so many occasions, the greatest Advantage of the Party to their Passions and private Animosities; that instead of establishing their Authority, thereby to make themselves useful to the Prince, as they both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to do, they contributed to the Disorders and Seditions of the people, to that degree, that they were reduc'd themselves to abandon the Prince, and to submit to whatever Conditions the Court was pleas'd to impose upon them. The Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> being sensible, by a long Experience, that their mutual Grandeur depended on their Union, had made it his business to maintain it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, none being so cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ble of doing it as himself, ever since the War of <hi>Paris.</hi> But at that time Madame <hi>de Longueville</hi> imagin'd that it would be more for her Advantage, to take new Measures, and it happen'd that the means she made use of to that end, caus'd a Division between her and her
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:54443:196"/>
Brothers. The Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> was inclin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to a Peace, being weary, and tyr'd with a War in which he had only engag'd himself to oblige the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville,</hi> which he repented of, as soon as ever he fell out with her. He has alledg'd since, in order to his Justification, that the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ince, after having sign'd a Writing, by which he oblig'd himself not to make a Treaty without obtaining the Government of <hi>Provence</hi> for him, had notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, absolutely neglected his Interests. But the real cause of his falling off, was that Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, I have mention'd, against his Sister, the which transported him to a degree of Passion and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie against her, that had been much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusable in a Lover than a Brother. On the other hand, altho' the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> spoke less than he about the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville's</hi> Conduct, he was as much dissatisfy'd about it in his Heart; he was sensible of her Engagements with the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and what it had been like to produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his real Interests; and he fear'd moreover she might enter into new ones, which might yet prove of worse Consequence for him. That which augmented the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville's</hi> Trouble at that time was, that she thought it impossible ever to be reconcil'd to her Husband, by reason of the ill impressions he had receiv'd about her; and by his being perswaded that she had too great a share in that War. She had likewise vainly attempted to be reconcil'd to the Court by the Princess <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin's</hi> Intermission. In so much that finding her self equally ruin'd on all sides, she imagin'd the only means to re-establish her self was to fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that having regulated with <hi>Marsin,</hi> and with <hi>Laisne</hi> what related to the Army in <hi>Guienne,</hi> the Cabals of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and those of his Family, he sent for the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> to <hi>Agen</hi>; and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the management of all things, he desir'd him to follow the Counsels of <hi>Marsin</hi> and <hi>Laisne.</hi> He also seem'd to repose a great deal of Confidence in the President <hi>Viole,</hi> tho' in reality he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he left no body in <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> in whom he could truly confide, besides the two first I have nam'd.</p>
            <p>Having thus dispos'd all things, he prepar'd for his departure from <hi>Agen,</hi> in order to joyn the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi>'s Army. This Journey was long, and accompany'd with Difficulties one could hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to overcome.

               <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> might not only cause the Prince to be follow'd by Parties, but besides might have given the Court a speedy Account of his March, and order'd all the Cities and Garrisons thereabouts to oppose his Passage: Moreover the Prince could not trust many with his Design, and a small Attendance was not capable to secure him: He was besides oblig'd to perswade every body, that he was going to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and to hinder the Officers of the Army from accompanying him, under pretence that might not discover his real Intention. To that end he left the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> at <hi>Agen,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go to <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> for two or three days only, he commanded all the Officers and Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

soon carry'd the News of what he had seen to <hi>Gien.</hi> Whereupon St. <hi>Maure</hi> was commanded with Twenty Horse to way-lay the Prince between <hi>Chastillon</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi>'s Army, and to take him dead or alive. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> being sensible that the meeting of the aforesaid Courier would infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly discover his passage, march'd with all speed towards <hi>Chastillon:</hi> But whereas we were necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Travel 35 Leagues that day, without chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our Horses, the necessity of Baiting made us lose a great deal of time, and afforded St. <hi>Maure</hi> time enough to come up to us.

and the Prince of <hi>Marsillac.</hi> However they continu'd their March still towards <hi>Chastillon.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Marsillac</hi> went a hundred Paces before the Prince, and the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> follow'd him at the same distance, to the end that being warn'd by either of them, he might have some Advantage to make his Escape. They had not travel'd long in this manner, when they heard the firing of some Pistols on that side where the <hi>Valet de Chambre</hi> was gone, and at the same time dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd four Troopers on their left hand; upon which concluding they were pursu'd, they resolv'd to Charge those four Men, and march'd up to them with a Resolution to suffer themselves to be kill'd rather than taken. But being come nearer to them, they found it was <hi>Chavaignac,</hi> who was in search of them with three Gentlemen; and they arriv'd together at <hi>Chastillon</hi> without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> receiv'd Tidings there of the Army he was going to joyn, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that it lay towards <hi>Lory,</hi> near the Forest of <hi>Orleance,</hi> within Eight Leagues of <hi>Chastillon</hi>; he heard moreover that Ten or Twelve <hi>Chevaux-Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> of the King's Guard, together with some Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers were at that time at <hi>Chastillon</hi>; whereupon he resolv'd to remove from thence about Midnight with speed, with a Guide for <hi>Lory.</hi> This Guide had like to have occasion'd his Ruin; for after a long March, he found that he was but within a short League of <hi>Gien,</hi> in so much that going about to quit that Road, to tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But this prov'd an Advantage instead of a Prejudice to him, for some of them got on Horse-back, with him, and accompany'd him to the Army. He met the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard at the entrance of the Forest of <hi>Orleance</hi>; some Troopers coming up to him, and he having discover'd himself to them, the whole Army was surpriz'd with an excess of Joy that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd. His Presence had never been so necessary as it was at that time, and had never been less ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The Animosity between the Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>Beaufort</hi> daily increas'd, and thereby the sole Prop of the Party daily perish'd through the Division of the Chiefs, at a time when the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the King, and his Army, should have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd them most to prefer the Publick Good to their particular Quarrels. The Prince was too much concern'd to put an end to those Differences, not to endeavour it with all the earnestness imaginable, which he effected the more easily, by reason that his Arrival taking the Command from them, at the same time it remov'd the main cause of their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie and Hatred. Affairs standing in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Army march'd to <hi>Lory,</hi> where they rested a day, three or four days more were employ'd in going to <hi>Montargis,</hi> which surrender'd without any Resistance. The Army soon quitted that place, by reason that it was stor'd with Corn and Wine, which might be of use, upon occasion; as also to sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w an Example of Mildness, which might prove advantageous to his Party in the other Cities. The Army march'd from <hi>Montargis,</hi> and went to <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renard: Gourville</hi> arriv'd there at the same time from <hi>Paris,</hi> to give the Prince an account of his Friends S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Power would reside in his hands: Whereas in going to <hi>Paris,</hi> he took away from his Forces the Reputation which his Presence had given them, since he was necessitated to leave the Command thereof to the same Persons, whose Division and Incapacity had been like to produce such great Disorders. <hi>Chavigny</hi> on the contrary assur'd the Prince that his Presence was absolutely necessary in <hi>Paris</hi>; That the Cabals of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>'d between the two Squadrons. The Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> as I have declar'd already, stopt his, and forc'd it to turn back upon his Enemies, who had not dar'd to pursue it, for fear of its being sustain'd by some Infantry. During this Disorder Thirty Horse had cross'd the Defile: The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> plac'd himself immediately at the Head of them with the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> and attacking Marshal <hi>d' Hoquincourt</hi> in the Flank, he caus'd him to be charg'd in the Front by the Squadron where he had lost the Duke of <hi>Beaufort.</hi> This made an end of overthrowing the Enemies, of which part threw themselves into <hi>Bleneau,</hi> and the rest were pursu'd three or four Leagues towards <hi>Auxere,</hi> without their endeavouring to Rally. They lost all their Baggage, and Three Hundred Horse were taken. This Overthrow might have been greater, had not the Prince been inform'd that Marshal <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne</hi>'s Army was in sight.</p>
            <p>This News oblig'd him to retire to his Foot, who had quitted their Post to Plunder, and having rally'd his Forces, he march'd towards Marshal <hi>Turenne,</hi> who plac'd his Army in Battle in a very large Plain, within less than Musquet-shot of a very large Wood, through the midst of which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was oblig'd to March to come up to him. This Passage was large enough of it self to March two Squadrons a-breast: But whereas it was very Marshy, and that several Ditches had been made
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:54443:201"/>
to drain it, there was no coming to the Plain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making Defiles. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> finding it possess'd by his Enemies, threw his Infantry to the Right and Left into the Wood which border'd it, in order to keep the Enemy at a distance from it, and it succeeded according to his desires: For Marshal <hi>Turenne</hi> dreading the Inconveniency of the Musquetry, quitted his Post, to take another at a little more distance, and upon a higher Ground than the Prince's. This Movement perswaded the Prince that he was retiring towards <hi>Gien,</hi> and that it would be easie to beat him in the disorder of his Retreat, before he could reach it. To this end he caus'd his Cavalry to advance, and made hast to make six Squadrons pass the Defiles, in order to enter the Plain; but the Marshal of <hi>Turenne</hi> being sensible how disadvantageous it would be for him to Combat the Prince in the Plain, he having a Victorious Army, that was much stronger than his, resolv'd to turn back with Sword in hand, upon those six Squadrons, in order to defeat those that were past, and to stop the remainder of the Forces, that were still on the other side of the Defile.

He was in hopes, as I have already declar'd, to render himself equally considerable to those two Princes, by perswading each of them, that he was the real promoter of their Union; besides he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy'd that it was the easiest way to succeed in his Project with <hi>Fabert.</hi> He therefore press'd the Prince to come to <hi>Paris,</hi> in order to oppose the Progress the Cardinal of <hi>Rets</hi> made upon the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance</hi>'s Mind, and to improve the favourable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position the Parliament was in at that time, having made a Decree, by which they had proscrib'd, and put a Price upon Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Head. Whatever Impressions <hi>Chavigny</hi>'s Counsels made upon the Prince, it is certain that he follow'd them; he was receiv'd at <hi>Paris</hi> with so many Acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and such Testimonies of publick Joy, that he did not think he had any cause to Repent his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.

Thus the Duke of <hi>Rohan, Chavigny,</hi> and <hi>Goulas</hi> went to St. <hi>Germans,</hi> with positive Orders not to see Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> or to Treat about any thing with him. The Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi>'s Demands consisted chiefly in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of the Cardinal; but the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s had more Latitude, by reason that hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, without comprising their Interests in it, in the manner I shall relate hereafter. No body did in the least question the Success of those Gentlemen's Journey; there being no likelihood that a Man of <hi>Chavigny</hi>'s Parts and Understanding, who knew the Court, and Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> by so long an Experience, would have engag'd in so great a Negotiation, having manag'd it for three Months together, without being certain of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. But every body was soon undeceiv'd by the Return of those Deputies, who had, not only treated with Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> contrary to the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:54443:204"/>
express Orders they had receiv'd about it; but moreover, instead of demanding for the Prince, what was set down in their Instructions, had only insisted chiefly, upon the establishing of a necessary Council, almost in the form of that which the late King had order'd upon his Death-Bed; Upon which Condition they were to prevail with the Prince to consent, that Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany'd by <hi>Chavigny,</hi> should go to treat about a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tead of the Prince; and that it should be Lawful for him to come back into <hi>France</hi> after the Conclusion thereof. As those Propositions were contrary to the Prince's Interests and Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he receiv'd them with great Indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Chavigny,</hi> and resolv'd for the future never to give him the least knowledge of whatever he should Treat of in Secret with the Court. To that end he gave <hi>Gourville</hi> Instructions, which were drawn in presence of the Dutchess of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Nemours</hi> and <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> which contain'd what followeth.
<q>1. That they would hearken to no Negotiation after that Day; and that they expected a positive Answer to all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, of <hi>Yes,</hi> or <hi>No,</hi> since they could not desist from any of them.

            <p>Whatever induc'd the Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> to use these Arguments, it is most certain that they hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the Cardinal from proceeding any farther, and he sent back <hi>Gourville</hi> to the Prince, in order to remove that Difficulty. But whereas in all great Affairs delays are commonly very dangerous, they were much more so in this, which was not only compos'd of so many different Interests, and view'd by so many opposite Cabals, which endeavour'd to break it; but was moreover manag'd by the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> on one side, and by Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> on the other; who tho' very opposite in some things, yet were alike in many others, particularly in Treating about all manner of Affairs without any limited Pretentions; which is the Reason that when their desires are granted, they still flatter themselves with obtaining more, perswading themselves to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:54443:206"/>
that degree, that all things are due to their good Fortune, that the Balance can never be kept suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently even between them, nor can ever remain long enough in that condition, to afford them time to resolve upon a Treaty, and to conclude it. Other Obstacles were joyn'd to these: It was the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Rets</hi>'s Interest to prevent the Peace, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that if it were made without his participation, the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> and the Prince being united with the Court, he would remain expos'd, without any Protection. On the other hand, <hi>Chavigny</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing disgusted with the Court, and with the Prince after the ill Success of his Negotiation, concluded that it was better to break the Treaty, than suffer it to be made by any but himself.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell whether the Conformity of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, that happen'd to meet at that time between the Cardinal of <hi>Rets</hi> and <hi>Chavigny,</hi> made them joyn to hinder the Prince's Treaty; or whether either of them prevail'd with the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to do it; but I have been inform'd since by a Person I must Credit, that while <hi>Gourville</hi> was at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Monsieur</hi> sent the Duke <hi>d' Anville</hi> to Cardinal <hi>Mazarin,</hi> to desire him not to conclude any thing with the Prince, because he design'd the Court should be solely oblig'd to him for a Peace: That he was ready to go to the King, and thereby to give an Example which should be follow'd by the Inhabitants, and by the Parliament of <hi>Paris.</hi> It was very probable that such a Proposition should be hearken'd unto, preferably to all others: And in effect, whether by this Reason, or by the other I have alledg'd before, about the Prince and Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Minds; or whether, as I always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd it, the Cardinal was never inclinable to a Peace, and only made use of Negotiations for a Snare, in which he could surprize his Enemies: In fine, all things were entangled to that degree, that

            <p>In the mean while, besides that the Prince's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were not constantly fix'd on a Peace, he was continually combated by the divers Interests of those who endeavour'd to disswade him from it.

               </gap> by which means he remaining alone near the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> might render himself considerable at Court, whereby he propos'd very considerable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages.

            <p>No Arguments or Politicks were omitted to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the Prince to embrace either of these Parties, when the Dutchess of <hi>Chatillon</hi> rais'd a desire of Peace in him by more agreeable means: She ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that so great a good was only to be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by her Beauty, and mixing some Ambition with the desire of making a new Conquest, she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd at once to Triumph over the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Heart, and to draw from the Court all the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of that Negotiation.</p>

Madame <hi>de Chatillon,</hi> putting no Bounds to her Victory, not only obligd the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> to break off all his Engagements with Madame <hi>de Longueville</hi> in a very disobliging manner, but at the same time resolv'd to take from her all the knowledge of A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who had great Engagements with her, approv'd her Design, and believd that since it was in his power to Regulate the Dutchess of <hi>Chatillon</hi>'s Conduct towards the Prince, she would inspire him with whatever Sentiments he pleas'd, and that thus he should dispose of the Prince's Mind, by the power he had over the Dutchess of <hi>Chatillon's.</hi> The Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> at that time had the greatest share of any body in the Prince's favour, and at the same time had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry strict Engagements both with the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> and with Madame <hi>de Chatillon:</hi> He was very sensible of the Prince's Irresolutions towards a Peace; and fearing, as it happen'd since, that the <hi>Spanish,</hi> and the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville's</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bals would joyn, in order to remove the Prince from <hi>Paris,</hi> where he might daily Treat without their Participation; he imagin'd that the Dutchess of <hi>Chatillon's</hi> Design would be able to remove all the Obstacles that oppos'd a Peace, and for that Reason induc'd the Prince to engage with her, and to give her <hi>Merlou</hi> for her self.

And thus those four Persons being equally advantag'd thereby, it would certainly have had at last the Success they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, had not Fortune oppos'd it by a World of unavoidable Accidents.</p>

She came back to <hi>Paris</hi> with great hopes, but the Cardinal only reap'd solid Advantages by that Negotiation; he gain'd Time, he augmented the Suspicions of the opposite Cabal, and amus'd the Prince at <hi>Paris</hi> by the hopes of a Treaty, while they took <hi>Guienne,</hi> and his Towns from him, and while the King's Army, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Marshals of <hi>Turenne</hi> and <hi>Hoquincourt,</hi> held the Field, and his was retir'd in <hi>Estampes.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it did not remain long there, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a considerable Loss, which was this; The Marshal of <hi>Turenne</hi> being inform'd that <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>This Success rais'd the hopes of the Court to that degree, that they design'd to Besiege <hi>Estampes,</hi> and all the Army that was in it. Whatever Difficulty seem'd to attend that Enterprize, it was resolv'd upon, in hopes to meet with Astonishment in the Men, and Division in the Commanders; a Town open in several parts, unprovided, and without probability of Succours from any but the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with whom the Court thought a Treaty had been made. Moreover it is my Opinion, that the Event of the Siege was not so much consider'd, as the Reputation so great an Undertaking would afford the King's Arms: For tho' at the same time the Negotiation was continud with great earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and that the Prince was then very desirous of a Peace, yet it could not reasonably be expected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the Success of <hi>Estampes</hi> had regulated the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1652.</note>During these Transactions the Court-Party made use of that Conjuncture to gain the People, and to form Cabals in the Parliament; and tho' at that time the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> seem'd closely united with the Prince, he notwithstanding daily had particular Conferences with the Cardinal of <hi>Rets,</hi> who made it his chief business to destroy whatever Resolutions the Prince put him upon. The Siege of <hi>Estampes</hi> continu'd still, and tho' the Progresses of the King's Army were inconsiderable, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless the Reports that were spread up and down the Realm, were advantageous to the King.

            <p>At first there happen'd some Disputes between the Prince and him about their Rank; but he finding that the Prince would not desist, relinquish'd his Pretentions so much the rather, because he had only insisted upon it, in order to gain time to make a secret Treaty with the Court, to raise the Siege of <hi>Estampes</hi> without hazarding a Combat.

The Court at that time was at St. <hi>Denis,</hi> and the Marshal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> had joyn'd the King's Army with the Forces he had brought from <hi>Lorrain.</hi> The Prince's Army which was weaker than the least of the two that were oppos'd to him, had till then kept its Post at St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> in order to make use of the Bridge to avoid an unequal Combat; but the arrival of Marshal <hi>de la Ferté</hi> enabled the King's Army to divide into two Bodies, and to attack St. <hi>Cloud</hi> on both sides, by making Bridges towards

St. <hi>Denis</hi>; the Prince resolv'd to remove from St. <hi>Cloud,</hi> in order to march to <hi>Charenton,</hi> and to Post himself in that nook of Land, which makes the Conjunction between the River <hi>Marne</hi> and the <hi>Seine.</hi> Without doubt he would not have done it had he followed his own Inclination, and it had been much safer and much easier to leave the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Seine</hi> on the left hand, and to march by <hi>Meu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Vaugirard,</hi> to Encamp under the <hi>Faux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi> St. <hi>Germans,</hi> where perhaps he should not have been attack'd for fear of Engaging the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> in his Defence.

            <p>He did not desire leave to March through <hi>Paris,</hi> for fear of a denial, which at that time would have discover'd the ill Condition of his Affairs: Besides he was afraid, that having obtain'd it, his Forces would disperse themselves in the City, and that it would be difficult to force them out of it, in case of Necessity. The Court soon receiv'd Intelligence of his March, and the Marshal of <hi>Turenne</hi> follow'd him immediately with what Forces he had, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to stop him, until Marshal <hi>de la Ferté,</hi> who

In the mean time the King was sent to <hi>Charonne,</hi> to behold from that place, as from a Theatre, that Action, which, according to appearances, was like to prove the absolute Overthrow of the Prince, and the end of the Civil War; but in Effect that which prov'd one of the boldest, and most perillous Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, that ever was seen in War, and that in which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s great Endowments appear'd to the best Advantage. Fortune it self seem'd to be reconcil'd to him in that Occasion, and would have a share in a Success, of which both Parties have imputed the Glory to his Valour, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: For he was attac'd precisely at a time, in which he could make use of the Retrenchments the Inhabitants of the Suburb of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> had made, to secure themselves from being pillag'd by the Duke o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>He had but just so much time as was necessary to that end, and to garnish those Posts through which he could be attack'd, with Foot and Horse: He was forc'd to place the Baggage of the Army upon the side of the Ditch of St. <hi>Anthony,</hi> because the <hi>Parisians</hi> had refus'd to receive it. Moreover some Carriages had been plunder'd, and those of the Court-Party had contriv'd Affairs so, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of that Business should be seen from thence, as from a Neuter place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:54443:211"/>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> preserv'd about him such of his Attendants as happen'd to be there, and such Persons of Quality as had no Command, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of which amounted to about Thirty or Forty. The Marshal of <hi>Turenne</hi> dispos'd his Attacks with all the Diligence and Confidence of a Man who thinks himself certain of Victory. His detach'd Men being come within 30 Yards of the Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Prince came out upon them, with the Squadron I have mention'd, and charging them with Sword in hand, defeated their Battalion ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, took some Officers Prisoners, carry'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their Colours, and retir'd to his Retrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the Marquess of St. <hi>Mesgrin</hi> attack'd the Post that was defended by Count <hi>de Tavannes,</hi> Lieutenant-General, and <hi>Languais,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reschal de Camp; who made so brave a Resistance, that the Marquess of St. <hi>Mesgrin</hi> finding that his Infantry flinch'd, being hurry'd on by Heat and Anger, advanc'd with the King's Troop of <hi>Chevaux Legers</hi> in a Street shut up with Barricado's, where he was kill'd, with the Marquess of <hi>Nantouillet, Le Fouilloux,</hi> and some others, <hi>Mancini,</hi> Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Nephew was wounded, and dy'd of his Wounds some time after.</p>
            <p>The Attacks were continu'd on all sides with great Vigour, and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> charg'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies a second time, with an equal Success to the first; he appear'd every where, in the middle of the Fire and Combat, and gave his Orders with that calmness of Mind, which is so necessary, and yet so seldom met with on those Occasions. Finally, the King's Forces having forc'd the last Barricado of the Street call'd <hi>du Cours,</hi> which leads to <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cennes,</hi> they entred in Order of Battle as far as the Market-place of the Suburb of St. <hi>Anthony</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Prince ran thither, charg'd them, and

The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> did design to go with some Infantry, to cause other Houses to be pierc'd, to force them to retire by a greater Fire, which indeed was the best way; but the Duke of <hi>Beaufort,</hi> who chanc'd not to be near the Prince at the beginning of the Attack, being somewhat Jealous at the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> having been there all along, press'd the Prince to cause the said Barricado to be attack'd by Infantry that was already tyr'd and discourag'd, the which instead of going up to the Enemy, kept close to the Houses, and would not Advance.</p>
            <p>At the same time a Squadron of the Forces from <hi>Flanders,</hi> that had been posted in a Street, which butted in one of the corners of the Square on that side where the Houses were, being no longer able to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> stood firm in the Street with those that had rally'd about him. In the mean time, the Enemies, who were possess'd of all the Houses of the Street, seeing the Barricado guarded only by four Men, would certainly have re-taken it, had not the Prince's Squadron hindred them; but there being no Infantry to hinder their Firing from the Windows, they began to Fire again from all sides, and saw the four who kept the Barricade side-ways from head to foot.

This for a while had the Effect he desir'd, and <hi>Paris</hi> was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better affected to the Prince, than it was at that time.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the noise of the Canon of the <hi>Bastille,</hi> produc'd at one and the same time two very different Sentiments in Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi>'s Mind; for at first he believ'd that <hi>Paris</hi> was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring against the Prince, and that he was going to Triumph over that City, and over his Enemy: But finding that instead thereof, they fir'd upon the King's Forces, he sent Orders to the Marshals of <hi>France</hi> to retire with the Army, and to March back to St. <hi>Denis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Day prov'd one of the most Glorious of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Life, his Valour and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct never had a greater share in any of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and it may be said with Truth, that so many Persons of Quality never made a smaller number of Men fight. The Colours were carried to <hi>Notre Dame,</hi> and all the Officers were put at Liberty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Parole.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this, the Negotiations were continued, every Cabal was desirous to make the Peace, or to hinder the others from doing it; and the Prince and Cardinal were absolutely resolv'd

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:54443:214"/>
first this Noise was only look'd upon as an ordinary effect of the Common People's Impatience, but seeing that the Croud and Tumult increas'd, and that not only the Souldiers, but even the Officers were concern'd in the Riot, the Gates being set on fire, and the Windows shot at, all the Members of the Assembly thought themselves equally undone. Many of them to avoid the Fire, expos'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the Fury of the People, and abundance of Persons of all Qualities, and of all Parties were kill'd: It was generally believ'd that the Prince had sacrific'd his Friends, in order not to be suspected of having destroy'd his Enemies. The Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> was not in the least suspected of having any share in that Business, the Odium and Hatred thereof being wholly cast upon the Prince of <hi>Conde.</hi> As for my part, I am of Opinion, that both of them had employ'd the Duke of <hi>Beaufort</hi> in it, to frighten such Members of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly as were not on their side; tho' at the same time I am perswaded that neither of them had the least Intention of hurting any body. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they soon appeas'd the Disorder, but they could not race out the Impression it had made in the Peoples Mind.</p>
            <p>Afterwards it was propos'd to create a Council, compos'd of the Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the Chancellor of <hi>France,</hi> the Princes, Dukes, and Peers, Marshals of <hi>France,</hi> and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Officers of the Party.

            <p>This Council augmented the Disorder instead of diminishing it, about the Pretentions of the Rank that was to be held in it, the sequel of which, as

            <p>All those who knew that Prince, were mov'd with Grief and Compassion at his Death; even the Publick had cause to lament him; for besides his great and lovely Qualifications, he contributed as much as in him lay to promote a Peace, and both he and the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o perswade the Prince to go into <hi>Flanders</hi>; they dazled him with hopes, and Madame <hi>de Chatillon</hi> seem'd to appear less Charming to him, because he no longer found an Illustrious Rival to Combat in her Heart. However he did not at first reject the Propositions of a Peace, but taking his measures to continue the War, he offer'd the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi>'s Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> who co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paris</hi> was more divided at that time than ever it had been; The Court daily gain'd Ground in the Parliament, and among the People, the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der committed at the Town-House having struck every body with Horror: The Army durst not keep the Field, and their abode in <hi>Paris</hi> exasperated the People the more against the Prince. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ine, his Affairs were reduc'd to the greatest Extremity,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:54443:215"/>
when the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were equally desirous of preventing his Ruin and his Elevation, in order to perpetuate the War, caus'd the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to March to <hi>Paris</hi> for the second time, with a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Body, to stop the King's Army. Nay, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over he kept it invested at <hi>Villeneuve St. George,</hi> and sent word to <hi>Paris,</hi> that the Enemies would be constrain'd to come to a Battle, or to starve in their Camp.</p>
            <p>This hope flatter'd the Prince, and he imagin'd he should draw great Advantages from the Event of that Action, although in reality the Marshal of <hi>Turenne</hi> never wanted Provisions, nor the Liberty of retiring to <hi>Melun,</hi> withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hazarding a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. He did it accordingly, without meeting any Opposition, whilst the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was gone to <hi>Paris,</hi> where the Prince lay sick of a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Palluau</hi>'s Forces at that time joyn'd the King's Army, after having taken <hi>Montrond:</hi> The Marquess of <hi>Persan</hi> had been block'd up in it from the beginning of the War, by Count <hi>Palluau</hi> with an inconsiderable Army: But when the Garrison was weaken'd by Hunger and Diseases, he attack'd it by Force, and took it with less Resistance, than could be expected from such brave Men in one of the strongest Places in the World, had nothing been wanting in it. The loss thereof prov'd so much the more sensible to the Prince, by reason that it was occasion'd by his Neglect, since he might easily have succour'd <hi>Montrond,</hi> whilst the King's Army was towards <hi>Compiegne</hi>; whereas his Forces in ruining the Country round about <hi>Paris</hi> increas'd the Inhabitants Hatred against him.</p>
            <p>The Prince was neither happier, nor better serv'd in <hi>Guienne,</hi> where the Division between the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> and the Dutchess of <hi>Longueville</hi> serv'd for a Pretence to those who had a mind to quit his Party. Several Cities, following the Example of

               </gap> Count <hi>d' Harcourt</hi> was forc'd to raise the Siege.

            <p>During these Transactions the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Ilness increas'd, yet, tho' it was very violent, it prov'd nevertheless less Fatal to him than to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>de Chavigny,</hi> who having had a very rough Esclaircissement with the Prince, he was seiz'd with a Fever, of which he dyed few days after.

All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Crimes were imputed to him, and the Prince particularly justify'd himself at his Cost, of the Jealousie the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Frondeurs</hi> conceiv'd of a secret Treaty with the Court: He complain'd that <hi>Chavigny</hi> had hearken'd to some Propositions of the Abbot <hi>Fouquet</hi> without his participation (altho' he had order'd him so to do in Writing) and that he had promis'd to make him relinquish some Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, which he could not do. The Prince like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise caus'd a Copy to be written of an intercepted Letter from the aforesaid Abbot, the Original of which I have seen, whereby he acquainted the Court, that <hi>Goulas</hi> would incline the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leance</hi>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:54443:216"/>
to abandon the Prince, unless he accepted the Conditions of Peace that were offer'd him: But in the Copies the Prince had written of it, he put the Name of <hi>Chavigny</hi> instead of <hi>Goulas</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he accus'd him of Treason, without giving any other Proofs thereof, besides a falsify'd Copy of that Letter written by the said Abbot <hi>Fouquet,</hi> with whom the Prince daily treated, and gave an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count thereof to <hi>Chavigny.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I can only impute the cause of so unjust, and so extraordinary a proceeding to the extream desire the Prince had of making War, the which being oppos'd by his Friends, had made him alter his Conduct towards them, and place all his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Duke of</hi> Bouillon<hi>'s Death.</hi>
               </note>The Duke of <hi>Bouillon</hi> dy'd at that very time at <hi>Pontoise,</hi> whose Death should have cur'd Men of Ambition, and disgusted them from making so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different Projects, in order to Rise. For the Ambition of that Duke was accompany'd by all the extraordinary Qualifications that could render it prosperous: He was brave, and was a perfect Master in the Orders of War; he had an Easie, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, Insinuating Eloquence: A clear Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, abounding in Expedients, and fit to manage the most difficult Undertakings; a sound Judgment, and an admirable Talent in distinguishing. He hearken'd mildly to the Counsels that were given him, and he valu'd other Peoples Reasons so much, that he seem'd to draw his Resolutions from thence. But yet those Advantages prov'd almost useless to him, through the obstinacy of his Fortune, which always thwarted his Prudence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were Revenging the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>'s Enterprize upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> by a long and cruel Imprisonment, and had long prov'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exorable to all those who interceded for his Liberty. However they granted it to the Prince, and on

th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t occasion they renounc'd one of their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Maxims, to link him the closer to their Party, by a concession that is so extraordinary among them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> receiv'd his Liberty, when he least expected it, and he came out of Prison, engag'd by so great a Favour, and by his Parole to enter into the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Interests. He came to him at <hi>Paris,</hi> and perhaps believing he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himself of what he ow'd him, by some Complements, and some Visits, he went soon after to meet the Court, to offer the King what such great Obligations exacted from him towards the Prince.</p>
            <p>As soon as <hi>Chavigny</hi> was dead, the Prince began to take his Measures to go away with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi>; and indeed his Conduct had rendred his departure so necessary, that it was the only way he had left; for the Peace was too generally desir'd at <hi>Paris</hi> to remain there in safety, with a design to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it. The Duke of <hi>Orleance,</hi> who had desir'd it all along, and dreaded the Evil the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Presence might draw upon him, contributed so much the rather towards his Removal, by reason that he found himself thereby free to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Treaty.</p>
            <p>Altho' Affairs stood on these terms, the ordinary course of the Negotiation had not been interrupted; for even at that time when Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> was quitting the Kingdom for the second time, to put a period to the pretences of the Civil War, or to shew that the Prince had other Interests besides his Removal, he sent <hi>Langlade,</hi> Secretary to the Duke of <hi>Bouillon,</hi> to the Duke <hi>de la Rochefoucault,</hi> either out of a real desire to Treat, thereby to facilitate his Return, or hoping to draw great Advantages by his shewing that he desir'd a Peace. In fine, <hi>Langlade</hi> came, with Conditions that were much
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:54443:217"/>
fuller than all the others, and almost conformable to what the Prince had demanded: but they were equally refus'd, and his Fate, which drew him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> did not permit him to discover the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice until it was too late to retreat. Finally, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted with the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> after having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vain Measures with the Duke of <hi>Orleance</hi> to hinder the King from being receiv'd at <hi>Paris:</hi> But his Credit was not sufficient at that time to cope with the Court's. He was order'd to leave <hi>Paris</hi> the very day the King was to arrive there, and he obey'd immediately, to avoid being a Spectator of the Triumph of his Enemies, as well as of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Joy.</p>

But notwithstanding all the Perils the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> expos'd himself to, and the great Actions he did, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> lost the Day, and the Battel was no sooner lost, but the Governor of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> being discourag'd, is desir'd to capitulate, which he did within 5 or 6 days after it: It was on the 23d of <hi>Iune.</hi> The Town was deliver'd to the <hi>English.</hi> The taking of <hi>Dunkirk</hi> was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by that of <hi>Bergue, Gravelines, Oudenarde, Ypres,</hi> and several other places.</p>
            <p>Altho' the <hi>French</hi> had had very considerable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages over the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1659.</note> yet they were desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of a Peace. The Queen, who desir'd it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, had already dispatch'd Monsieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> to lay the Foundations of it with <hi>Don Lewis de Haro.</hi> And tho' Monsieur <hi>de Lionne</hi> was

               <hi>incognito</hi> at <hi>Madrid,</hi> yet that Minister's Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions succeeded according to the Queens Wishes. They had agreed upon the general Articles, and there was a suspension of Arms. But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> declaring that he would have the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> compris'd in the Treaty of Peace, the <hi>French</hi> Minister reply'd, That he had no Orders to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to any such Proposition; That the King his Master would be the sole disposer of the Favours he thought fit to grant that Prince, without being impos'd upon in that point. Whereupon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences were broke off.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> being sensible that that Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty would not easily be removed, communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the Pope, who was Mediator between the two Crowns, in order to his perswading the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he ought to desist in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Interest of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> but could obtain nothing. Finally, the Peace was concluded between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner every body knows. Cardinal <hi>Mazarin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented readily, that the Prince should be compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Treaty, but he desir'd, that whatever related to his being restor'd to his Dignity and Estate, should be left entirely to the King's dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal. Nevertheless, after many Contestations, the Affair was determin'd in the manner his Catholick Majesty had desir'd it, that is to the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s advantage. These are the Articles that concern'd him, as they are inserted in the Treaty of Peace, made in the Isle of <hi>Faisans,</hi> in the year 1659. between <hi>Philip</hi> the Fourth King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth King of <hi>France.</hi>

Monsieur <hi>de Rabenhaut.</hi> But the taking of that place not proving so easie as it was imagin'd, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three Months were spent in the taking of it; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> at that time design'd the Siege of <hi>Charleroy.</hi> Nevertheless he seem'd to have a Design upon some other place.

The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> in order to oblige the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to quit his Post, made a Detachment of 7 or 8000 Men, which march'd towards the <hi>Meuse</hi>: But the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> suspecting that they only design'd to draw him to some Inconveniences<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> only sent some of his Forces that way, which broke the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Measures. These two Princes esteem'd and dreaded each other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally: but the one was better serv'd than the other. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> daily form'd new Designs, without being able of putting any of them in execution; and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> propos'd nothing but what he did execute at the same time. This last who took the advantage of the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences that reign'd among the Allies, kept still on the side of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Army, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving observ'd in one of the Marches of that Army, that the Ground oblig'd him to separate from it, he caus'd his Cavalry to mount, and before the Van could succour the Rear he fought with so much Fortune, that we may say that he had the Advantage at first, but it prov'd otherwise in the end; as will be seen hereafter. This Battle we are going to relate, was fought at <hi>Senef</hi> on the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>August.</hi>

And it is most certain that the loss of a Battle on the side of the <hi>French,</hi> would have been attended with terrible Consequences, and would have shook the Grandeur of that Crown, by reason of the Discontents that reign'd in the Kingdom, and in which the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was suspected to have a share.

            <p>Had the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> contented himself with that Success, it is most certain that the Victory could not have been disputed, but being incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by the hopes of obtaining a compleat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and believing that the <hi>Dutch</hi> whom he look'd upon as being the worst Souldiers in the World, would never stand their Ground after the absolute Defeat of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he caused his whole Army to advance.

            <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was marching to the Relief of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and of the Squadrons he had detach'd: but he found himself immediately hem'd in by the Run-aways whom he could never stop, either by Words, Blows, Promises, or Reproaches.

As ill as he was, he caused himself to be carried several times in a day into her Chamber: But finally, the ill Air, joyn'd to the Fatigue of that last Journey, threw him into a condition which soon put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to his life.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s condition being spread at Court, and at <hi>Paris,</hi> a world of Couriers were dispatch'd to him, from all the considerable persons of the Kingdom.

            <p>After which he call'd for the Princess, and for Mons. <hi>de Gourville,</hi> and while they were gone for, he uttered some words. Mons. <hi>de Gourville</hi> being come near him, he told him with a compos'd Air, <hi>Well</hi> Gourville, <hi>my Friend, we must part, there is no
Remedy.</hi> He was going to say more, when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Princess drown'd in Tears. He conjur'd her with a serene countenance not to afflict herself and to send for the Duke <hi>d' Enguien,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> to come to him. Some body asked him, <hi>Whether the Duke of</hi> Bourbon, <hi>whom he loved so ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, should not likewise be sent for, since he was so very sollicitous to pay his Respects to him? I should be very glad to see him,</hi> answer'd he, <hi>I love him with all my Heart, and as much as a Father can love a Son, but he is an only Son, he must be preserved, and must not be exposed to an ill Air, full of the Small Pox.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this he called for Paper and a Pen, and wrote a whole Page with his own Hand, the which he caused the Dutchess of <hi>Enguien</hi> and Mons. <hi>de Gourville,</hi> and order'd it to be sealed, and deliver'd a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreover, he took the liberty in the same Writing to conjure the King, to be mindful of that Princess, and to be pleas'd to prescribe her the manner in which she was to live; which the King granted.</p>

It is true, that about the middle of my Life, I have held a Conduct, I have blam'd my self before any body; the which your Majesty has been pleas'd to forgive: I have afterwards endeavour'd to repair my Fault by an inviolable Tye to your Majesty; and my greatest trouble ever since has been my not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to do things great enough to deserve your Majesty's Goodness towards me.

               </gap>hey affected him too sensibly: But considering that allowed too much to Nature, at a time he ought to turn all his thoughts on Death, he told him, <hi>My Son, you have no Father now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They made a stop there, and for a while only spoke with their Eyes. But they broke that silence to determine with an equal Satisfaction what Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments should be given to the Officers of his Highnesses Houshold, who express'd his being very well satisfied with them, and desired they might be entertained still by reason of their Merit and Fidelity.</p>
            <p>After this he turned to Monsieur <hi>de Gourville,</hi> and said, <hi>By all the kindness you have for me, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal from me, how long I have to live.

            <p>When ever his Eyes met with the Duke or Dutchess, he discovered the Sentiments of his Heart sufficiently, without needing to express them by words. However he could not forbear telling a

            <p>About Nine, seeing the Duke in a very great Anguish, he told him, that he was moved by his kindness, that he was satisfied with him, beyond what could be exprest by words.</p>

After which his Highness embracing the Duke and the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> told them all that a good Father could say to his Children, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd them to love one another like Brothers.

               </note> his Highness opened his Arms to Embrace him, expressing a great Joy to see him. Every body withdrew.

            <p>The Duke received his Orders with the Submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he ought. And whereas his presence as well as the Dutchesses, and the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi>'s moved him, and hindred him from applying all his thoughts on God, he desired them to withdraw.

            <p>In the mean time the Duke and Dutchess, as well as the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> begg'd his leave to see him once more, to which he consented, on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they should retire immediately.

He was of a sanguin Constitution, Cholerick, and Strong, he lov'd Hunting, Gaming, Joy, Pleasures, and Divertisements: He likewise lov'd Women, but without any particular Engagements, having ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any real Affection but for Madame <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon.</hi> In his Youth he abandon'd himself some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to small Debauches, and at that time made very pretty diverting Verses upon any Subject that occur'd; they were <hi>Extempores</hi> no Poet could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual. He had a great Vivacity, a clear Wit, and very good Judgment, and express'd himself with a great deal of Ease. He had much Probity and Honour in great Actions: he was not Liberal, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he Covetous; he Laugh'd much, but disagreeably; he was very free, and very offensive in Railleries. He kept no measures with any Body. He was of a Rough, uneasy, Impetuous, Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Temper, and thereby he ruin'd all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages

Nature and Fortune, had bestow'd upon him, frustrated the Extraordinary qualifications he was Endow'd with which were such, that he would have obsur'd the Glory of the greatest Men in past Ages, had mildness and Complaisance been Joyn'd to their lively Virtues, that shin'd in him, and to that Supream Valour, which rais'd an Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all the World.</p>
            <p>He had an admirable Genius for War, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for Battles. He was Born for military Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions insomuch that he wanted no Prenticeship to form him. The Superiority of his Genius serv'd him instead of Art and Experience; and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan by that which the most famous Conquerors would have been proud to end. He had a Martial heat, which made him dare and undertake all; a Fire, which in the execution render'd all things pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and easie to him, and a firmness of Soul, which no Obstacle could stop, or any Peril could frighten, which no Resistance could tire, or discourage; a Vigilancy, which could not be surpriz'd; a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith, even in the most dangerous Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, he fore-saw whatever might obstruct or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Event of things; a great quickness in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, the quickness of his Action not allowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nothing could equal his Activity, which in a day of Battle made him, dividing himself, as it were, to appear in all places. Supplying all, Rallying all, and Maintaining all. In so much that he was both General, and Souldier at once, and by his Presence inspir'd his Courage and Valour into a whole Army, even to the vilest Members thereof. And yet he preserv'd a great Presence of Mind in the heat of a Combat, and a Calmness he was never so certain of, as in a En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, and in the horror of the Tumult. In

            <p>He has always had, and ever express'd a great Aversion for Praises, as we have observ'd: All <hi>Europe</hi> was fill'd with the Fame of his Name, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When any body desir'd him in this Retirement to relate his fine Action in his Campagns, they perplex'd him. There was a great deal of Pleasure in hearing him: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Monsieur <hi>de Turenne</hi> is more agreeable, and not less esteem'd, leaving more Satisfaction, but not preserving his Authority so much.</p>
