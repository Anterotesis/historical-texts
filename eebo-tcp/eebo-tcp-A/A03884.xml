            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING in the precedent Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersyes declared, that Christ and all that good is, can only be found in the true Church, and that out of it there is nothing but euerlasting dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: now it remayneth that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire which is that true Church; where it may be found, and how it is described and set forth in holy Scripture; for all the sectes of heresies go about to challenge her vnto themselues, yea euen those who otherwise haue a very bad conceyt and opinion of her.

               </gap> this fourth signe we will speake a little after, for it is reduced to the vnity of the Church. But the three signes set downe by the <hi>Caluinists</hi> are altogeather foolish and friuolous, the which we proue thus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. First by the very nature of a signe. For euery signe of it owne nature is a sensible thing,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Aug. Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>l.</hi> 2 <hi>de doctrina Christiana cap.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Calu. l.</hi> 4. <hi>Inst. cap.</hi> 17. <hi>sect.</hi> 11.</note> as all teach, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein <hi>S. Augustine</hi>; and our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries confesse this to be true when they treat of the Sacraments: Yea <hi>Caluin</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that this was alwaies as it were a matter of faith in the Church. And so do all teach now who are of vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. Truly non<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will say, that which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:14612:3"/>
is only belieued in the Sacrament, is a signe, but that which is seene. But these signes of the Church prescribed by our Aduersaries can neyther be seen nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued by any sense. Yea not euen by our vnderstanding, vnlesse it be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by faith. For by faith only are they perceyued: because none can know which is the sincere preaching, lawfull admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the Sacraments or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discipline prescribed by Christ, but by faith: wherfore they who say that these are the signes and markes of the Church do not indeed know what they say; euen as if one should affirme, that in the Sacrament of baptisme the ablution and the wordes are not signes, but the effect of baptisme which is not seene, which euery man seeth how absurd it is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The second reason. Euery signe of anything must be more manifest and better knowne then the thing it selfe whose signe it is, because it is put for that end that it may be a signe or token wherby that other thing may be known, but these signes of the Church alleadged by our Aduersaries, are more obscure and vncertaine then the Church it self. For the Church is at the least often tymes vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible as they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues confesse, but these
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:14612:4"/>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> we haue already declared, but that which is by faith belieued is necessarily obscure,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 1.</note> because faith as witnesseth the Apostle, <hi>is the arg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. The third reason, our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lledge in va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ne these signes, for therfore do we enquire for signes and Markes of the Church that they which are ignorant of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, may therby come to know her, for they who already know any thing do not need any signes, as for example, he who already knoweth very well this Citty needeth no markes or signe therof wherby he may know it. But he sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth in need of signes who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer saw this Citty. So in like manner they w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o are out of the Church and know her not, do most of all need some signe and markes wherby to know her, but these which our Aduersaries assigne, can be knowne by none but by those who are already within the Church and know her very well, hauing the true faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> therof, but they cannot be vnderstood by those who know not the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:14612:4"/>
true Church, to the end they may seeke and fynd her, because they are only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued and knowne by faith, they are therfore alleadged in vaine by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But neyther can these signes be knowne of all those who are in the Church, but only of the more learned in the Church. For euery one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people cannot discerne which is the <hi>sincere preaching of the word of God, or the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full administration of the Sacraments,</hi> and <hi>the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall discipline</hi> prescribed by the word of God, for it is necessary that he who knoweth all these things well, should also vnderstand almost all the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture. Moreouer there is as yet a very great controuersy among ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Aduersaries themselues concerning these three signes, whiles that some of them doe contend, &amp; striue, that this is the sincere preaching of the word of God, others that some doe say that this is the lawfull administration of the Sacraments, others that some doe say, this is the discipline prescribed by the word of God, others assigne another quite different from this.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But our Aduersaries do in very truth confound the offices of the Church with the signes therof. For to preach sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:14612:5"/>
to administer the Sacraments law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and to appoint the discipline of the Church rightly,<note place="margin">

            <p n="6">6. Finally euen naturall reason it selfe proueth this to be one of the most certaine signes of the true Church. For God cannot teach contrary and oppofit doctrine, because he then should be a <hi>lyar,</hi>

            <p>HITHERTO we haue described out of holy Scripture the true Church of Christ, and that by the properties, offices, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar signes thereof. Now it remaineth that we by the same enquire and examine in what parte or place of the world this true Church of Christ may be found, the which will easily be done, if we declare that all these propertyes, offices, and signes must needes agree to some one. We therefore do affirme that all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, properties, and signes of the true Church do only agree to the Roman Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is heere notwithstanding to be considered, least some perchance by the ambiguity or equiuocation of the word be deceyued, that we doe not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand by the Roman Church, that

which is only at Rome, as our Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries go about to perswade the ignorant, but plainly euery Church which agreeth in the vnity of the same faith with the Roman, and which obeyeth the Bishop of Rome, whersoeuer that Church be, whether at Rome, or elswhere, yea euen the furtthest part of the Indyes. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer that this Roman Church thus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood is the only true Church of Christ, and consequently that out of her we cannot hope for eternall saluation (seing that out of the true Church as we haue sufficiently declared before,<note place="margin">

VVhere we are to consider three thinges against the great boldnesse of these men.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The first is, that the true Church hath alwaies continued, as we haue decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before out of the Scriptures.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius Contr. Geneb. in sua chron. Coccius Tom. x. l.</hi> 8. <hi>Art.</hi> 2. <hi>Histor. Magdeb. Lutheran.</hi>

The which may easily be vnderstood by <hi>Genebrard, Coccius,</hi> and all other Ecclesiasticall writers of what reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion soeuer they be.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The second. Our Aduersaries cannot proue all their pointes out of any one ancient heretike, but they borrow one heresy condemned in tymes past of one,<note place="margin">

            <p n="10">10. The second reason. The office of the true Church is to bring forth chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to God, that is to say, to conuert <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Gentills</hi> from their Idolatry to the Catholike faith. This the Roman Church hath performed not only in the first fiue or six hundred yeares after <hi>Christ,</hi> as our Aduersaries confesse, but in euery age afterward she hath done the same.

Augustine</hi> affirmeth, that He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes go about to seduce and deceyue <hi>Christians</hi> whom they see borne againe to God by the Ghospelll of Christ.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The third reason. The proper office of the Church is to preuaile against all persecutors. <hi>The gates of hell</hi> (saith our Lord) <hi>shall not preuaile against my Church</hi>; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon saith <hi>S. Hilary,</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>This is the propertie of the Church, that she then preuaileth most when she is persecuted, then she is vnderstood when she is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, then she getteth the victory when she is as it were forsaken.</hi> But the Roman Church
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14612:19"/>
hath susteyned hitherto many persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contradictions, assaultes, and false slaunders, but she hath euer gotten the victory both of the Gentills, Heretikes, &amp; bad Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s persecuting the Church of God, as all Ecclesiasticall histories &amp; experience also doth testify. For euen to this day for the space of almost a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand and six hundred yeares she is still constant, immoueable, and inuincible in despite of all her Aduersaries.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Our Aduersaries indeed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bookes published against the Pope of Rome heape vp togeather many in diuers ages who haue opposed themselues against him, but they can find none who haue at any tyme quite ouerthrowne the Roman Church.

and determined by the word of God, presently the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> endeth this Controuersy, and forbiddeth vnder payne of excommunication any to teach the contrary; and by this meanes euery Controuersy in matters of faith amongst Catholikes is forthwith ended. But if the matter be obscure and cannot easily be gathered out of the word of God, nor be very necessary to saluation, then the Roman Church commaundeth both parties that one of them do not condemne the others opinion, as we see practised concerning the Conception of the <hi>B.

            <p>THese are the chiefest arguments which our Aduersaries do obiect against vs out of holy Scripture. The first. Christ is the head of the Church, the rocke &amp; foundation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides which no man can lay any other.<note place="margin">

For the head of the woman is the man, the head of euery man is Christ, and the head of Christ is God, as the Apostle testifieth. And so the woman hath three heades, her Husband, Christ, and God; but each one of them is subiect vnto another. So <hi>S. Peter</hi> or the Pope of Rome is the head of the Church, but vnder Christ and subiect vnto him.<note place="margin">

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14612:38"/>
But <hi>S. Peter</hi> or his successor is only head of the Church in this world and of the new Testament only. Hereupon sayd Christ,<note place="margin">

               <hi>vpon this rocke I will build my Church,</hi> that is to say, the Church of the new Testament which was then to be built.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yea euen by the nature of a head we may gather very well that besides Christ, who is the head of al Churches aswell visible as inuisible, as the Apostle saith, there is also another visible head of the visible Church,<note place="margin">

               <hi>all thinges therefore, whatsoeuer they shall say to you, obserue yee, and doe yee: but according to their workes do ye not.

            <p>AMongst other Crimes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Roman Church</hi> is char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by our Aduersaries, one at which many take offence, is the <hi>adoration</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and the <hi>kissing of his feete.</hi> We will therefore in this Chapter say somewhat in iustification therof, for if it shall appeare that nothing is done therein which is not warranted by the written word, it will appeare how little reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue to tearme that <hi>impious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry,</hi> which is nothing els indeed but <hi>Religious piety.</hi>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:14612:44"/>
of Scripture there are which approue this adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, of which only we now treate. For this adoration only is exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited to the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp; not that other which belongeth only to <hi>God</hi>: and it is exhibited vnto him as the <hi>Vicar</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> wheras the other cannot be exhibited but to the true God himselfe. Now there are foure testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of holy Scripture which euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proue, that the adoration of the <hi>Pope,</hi> is not only lawfull, but also dutifull.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The first testimonie is, that which the <hi>Prophet Isay</hi> recordeth in these wordes:<note place="margin">

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:14612:45"/>
               <hi>Egipt,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> and the eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the <hi>Sabeans</hi> (by whome are vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Gentils</hi>) shall passe ouer to the Church, and they shalbe the Churches, and they shall walke after the Church in manicles (by which are signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Ecclesiasticall lawes) and that they shall <hi>adore</hi> the Church, and make suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to her.</p>
