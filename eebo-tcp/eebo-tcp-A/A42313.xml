         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are two remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
points of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie
which are used
by the enemies of
the Trueth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists,
for bearing
down the same, and for upholding the
<hi>Dagon &amp; Diana</hi> of their idolatrous
worship. The first is, the claime of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable.
<hi>Antiquitie,</hi> to be only on their,
<pb facs="tcp:109543:3"/>
side, being herein like the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi>
who tho they dwelt near hand, yet prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that they wer come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a far, or like
the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who deryved the leaven
of their new and corrupt doctrine from
the verie chayre of <hi>Moses</hi> it self.</p>
            <p>The second is, the imputation of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veltie</hi>
to us, and laying that foule as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion
on the faire face of trueth and
of our profession, as (tho like <hi>Elihues</hi>
confession of himself <hi>Iob,</hi> 32. 6.) the
same were but young and of yesterday,
but theirs (like <hi>Iobs</hi> other friends) w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r
onlie old or ancient, which imputation
indeed is no new tricke of enemies to the
Trueth, seing we see the same aspersion
cast on our Saviours and his Apostles
doctrine, <hi>Act</hi> 17. 19. and whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
<hi>Pagans</hi> laboured to make the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at first odious to the world.</p>
            <p>But we are content to be tryed by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie,
the old way</hi> (as <hi>Ieremie</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

way, and</hi> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> sayeth cap.
4. ad <hi>praxeam) That, that onelie is
trueth which is first and most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
as that was the good seed onelie
which was first sowen in the Masters
field, it being tares onlie which were
sowen later by the envyous enemie.</p>
            <p>Therfore we must distinguish between
<hi>Antiquitie of Trueth,</hi> which is like
the Legitime, &amp; first borne, &amp; between
<hi>Antiquitie of Errour,</hi> which is later
and of a bastard broode, which made
our Saviour to oppose to this, Math.
5. (<hi>it was said of old.</hi>) this other
speech of his (<hi>but from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
it was not so</hi>) by which sort also
of primitive antiquitie <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was
somtimes a <hi>faithfull Citie</hi> (as <hi>Isaiah</hi>
calleth her, 1. 21.) but afterwards by
the other sort <hi>became a Harlot,</hi> &amp; as
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> also speaketh 23. 43. <hi>waxed
old in her adulteries:</hi> even as Rome
in likemanner was first famous for her
<pb facs="tcp:109543:4"/>
faith throughout the world, by holding
the antiquitie of trueth. But thereafter
like <hi>Ierusalem</hi> making defection to
errour and Idolatrie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shee hath in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner
<hi>played the Harlot, &amp; waxed
old in her Adulteries.</hi> Whose fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
(as <hi>Demetrius</hi> cryed up their
great <hi>Diana</hi> of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> or the Iewes,
the <hi>Temple</hi> of the Lord.) so, tho they
in likemanner cry up the <hi>holie Roma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Church, Mother and Mistresse of
all other,</hi> yet justlie we may reply, as
is said of her, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. 5. That shee
is a mother indeed, but the <hi>Mother of
harlots and abhominations of the
earth,</hi> and so, old indeed, but (as <hi>Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ekiel</hi>
speaketh) old in adulteries, and
who <hi>because of the multitude of
her whoredomes</hi> (as the Prophet
<hi>Nahum</hi> speaketh 3. 4.) <hi>is the mistres
of witch-crafts, whose skirts the
Lord hath discovered upon her
face, and will more and more shew
<pb facs="tcp:109543:4"/>
the Nations her nakednes, and the
Kingdomes her shame, who at last
shall hate the Whore, (as</hi> Revel. 17.
16.) <hi>make her dosolate, eate her
flesh, and burne her with fire, for
strong is the Lord who judgeth
her.</hi>

anie one more flowrished in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
(sayeth hee,) the more hee
with-stood ever anie newe inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
Whence it is, that the
Church was called a diligent, and
warie preserver, of these doctrines
of Fayth, which were concredit
vnto her, without changing anie
thing ever therein: without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minishing
therefrae, or adding
anie thing thereto, (sayeth the
same Father.) Her teachers ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that which was concredit to
them, not invented by them,
which they receaved, not exco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitate,
and not anie brood of their
owne ingyne, but the bread of
heavenlie doctrine; which is not
of private vsurpation, but of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke
deliverie or traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, brought
to them, not broached by them,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109543:8"/>
wherein they should not bee Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
but keepers; not instituters,
but observers; not leaders, but
followers: teaching the same
thinges to others by word, which
themselues had from the Apostles
by WRIT. So that tho they
speake after a new manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or expression, yet they should
speake no new thing for matter:
observing that as in the growth of
our bodies, there is no increase
of new members in number, but
augmentation of the same in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure:
So in the Churches know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the growth there-of
should bee in the same doctrine of
Fayth, alreadie delyvered, but no
new Article of doctrine after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to bee broached.</p>
            <p>For preventing whereof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

APPENDIX
To this Treatise
Of the Noveltie
of Poperie:
Clearlie showing next,
The antiquitie of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Religion.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving thus
singled out
Poperie, from
the profession
of true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion,
as Chaffe from
the Corne, or Popple rather
from the good Wheat; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
showne the Noveltie thereof,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:109543:72"/>
as of a disease which hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
a bodie, which was sound
and healthfull at first, but lyke
BABELL had neede of cure at
last; it will not bee amisse to set
downe the points of the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Religion, which is that onlie
Auncient, Catholicke, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicke
Fayth, <hi>Which was once</hi>
(sayeth S. IVDE) <hi>delyvered to
the Saynctes,</hi> and which in all
the positiue poyntes thereof, wee
at this day contende for and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse,
and wherein also our verie
adversaries doe not dissent from
vs.</p>
            <p>Which thing doeth serue, 1. to
show the great advantage that
wee haue of them heerein, to wit,
that what are the positiue poynts
of our Religion, therein they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with vs, and cannot say but
the same is the trueth: but in all
the former poyntes of Poperie,
which they doe professe, wee just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
disagree from them, because
of the proven Noveltie thereof,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:109543:73"/>
and disagreement from the Word
of GOD. Next, this shall serue
to answere two ordinarie and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomable
questions of theirs; to
wit, 1. whereby they aske, where
was our Religion befor <hi>Luther?</hi> and</p>
            <p>2. what became of the soules of
our fore-fathers, who dyed before
the reformation?</p>
            <p>First, then, this Catholicke
antiquitie of our doctrine, wee
shall proue, GOD willing, by the
playne in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uction onelie of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitiue
poyntes thereof, wherein
(as is sayde) our verie Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
the, <hi>Romanists</hi> themselues, doe
agree.</p>
            <p>First, therefore, concerning the
Scriptures, wee say, according to
Scripture, that they are the sure
and safe rule of fayth: and so
sayeth <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell. l. 1. de verb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> c. 2.</note> with vs: The
Scripture is the rule of our fayth,
most sure, and most safe, (sayeth
hee.)</p>
            <p>2. Wee say, that all doctrines
of fayth and manners, which are
simplie necessarie for all men,, are
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:109543:73"/>
playnlie set downe in Scripture:
and so doeth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> professe,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 4. de verbo c. 11. § vlti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo.</note>
that as this was the doctrine of
<hi>Augustine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> so it is true of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
of fayth, (sayeth hee)
which are simplie necessarie for all
men to salvation.</p>
            <p>3. Next to the word, to come
to the Sacramentes, wee say, that
Baptisme, and the LORD'S Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
are the two proper Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
instituted by CHRIST vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our salvation:<note place="margin">Bell. l. 2. de effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and this <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
also confesseth, saying, Of
Baptisme, and the LORD'S Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
there is no question at all.</p>
            <p>4. Wee say, that in the Lords
Supper, the bodie and blood of
CHRIST is present, not onelie
in a signe or figure, but truelie
and reallie; yet spirituallie, and
mysticallie:<note place="margin">Bell. l. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </note> and so doeth <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>
confesse, as <hi>Bernard</hi> teacheth
in his sermon of S. <hi>Martine,</hi> where
hee sayeth, That in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ibite vnto vs, the true
substance of Christs flesh; but yet
spirituallie, not carnallie (sayth he.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:109543:74"/>
5. From the word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to come to the Church, we
say that the Rocke whereon the
same is built,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 1. de Rom. pont. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> is CHRIST: and so
granteth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> saying, No
man doubteth, but Christ is that
Rocke.</p>
            <p>6. As Hee is the Rocke and
Foundation, wee say in lyke-man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
that Hee is the onelie Head
and King of His Church: and so
sayeth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Bell l. 2. de Rom. pont. c. 31.</note> Onelie Christ
is the head of all the Churches,
and all others vnder Him are not
heads nor Princes thereof.</p>
            <p>7. As Hee is onelie King, so
is Hee the high Priest thereof,
whose righteousnesse and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringes,
in our justification, is made
ours; so that wee may offer vp
the same vnto the Father as ours,
for the remission of our sinnes:
and so sayeth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> That
Christ is called our righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 2, de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

vs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> satisfaction, (sayeth hee)
and communicateth it to vs, when
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:109543:74"/>
Hee justifieth vs, that it may bee
called our satisfaction and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse:
and this way it is not
absurde for anie man to say, that
Christs righteousnesse and merites
are imputed to vs, (sayeth hee)
seeing they are so given and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to vs, as if wee our selues
had made satisfaction to GOD.</p>
            <p>8, Wee say, that good workes
are necessarie to salvation, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi>
acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 4. de justif. c. 1.</note> saying,
<hi>Cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in</hi> and <hi>Luther</hi> doe teach, That
good workes are to bee done,
and in some sort are necessarie,
<note n="†" place="margin">Ephes. 2. 10.</note> seeing they affirme, that it is not
true fayth, which bringeth not
foorth good workes: and so saye
the <hi>Romanistes,</hi> jumping heerein
with vs.</p>
            <p>9. Yet, notwithstanding that
wee affirme them to bee necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
wee saye, That to obtayne
salvation, it is the onelie safe way
to put our whole confidence in
the onelie mercie of GOD, and
merites of CHRIST onelie: and
so sayeth <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> For the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certayntie
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:109543:75"/>
of our owne righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Bell. l. 5. de <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and danger of vaine glorie,
(sayeth hee) it is safest to repose
our whole confidence, in the <hi>one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi>
mercie and free favour of
GOD.</p>
            <p>10. Lyke-wyse, for religious
worship, wee say, that the holie
Trinitie is to bee so worshipped,
and to GOD onelie wee should
pray, as the authour and giver of
all good thinges:<note place="margin">Bell. l. 1. de S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Bellarmine,</hi> That this most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyne
excellencie is to bee wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped;
and it is most evident,
that GOD is to bee prayed vnto,
(sayeth hee) yea, GOD <hi>onelie,</hi>
as the authour of all good giftes.</p>
            <p>11. Wee say, that after this

12. Last of all, in a word; wee
belieue the holie Trinitie, and
whole Articles of the Creede,
which contayne the whole
summe of the Christian fayth; so
that heere by the Antiquitie of our
doctrine and Religion, and in all
the fore-named positiue poynts
thereof may bee clea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Tares, is branded with that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall
Anathema, and is to bee

            <p>Therefore, for our part, wee
say with <hi>Vincentius Lyrinensis,</hi> Let
that vessell of election (to wit,
PAVLL) crye, and that teacher
of the Nations, and that trumpet
of the Apostles, that preacher
