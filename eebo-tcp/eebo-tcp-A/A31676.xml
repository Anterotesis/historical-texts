            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He City of <hi>Bath</hi> is ſeated in the North North-Eaſt part of <hi>Somerſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> environ'd (almoſt) all) round with pleaſant and fruitful Hills full of excellent Springs of Waters, in ſo much as 'tis obſerved that on many of their Sumits, there are rare Chriſtal Waters, guſhing out eſpecially in one Village adjoyning to the Southwards of it, there are near Fifty (if not more) Habitations, where ſcarce one Houſe makes uſe of that Water that ſerved another, each one enjoying a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to its ſelf.</p>
            <p>The Valley in which it ſtands, in any place extends (hardly) it ſelf to half a Mile in bredth, in moſt places leſs; it is very pleaſant and fruitful, and therein hardly ever ſeen any Pools, Loughs, or Meery places; for as ſoon as any inundation is over, the Waters totally Drein away

with it, which doubtleſs contributes much to the Salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brity of the Air. From two of theſe Hills, the City (by Pipes of Lead) is not only plentifully ſerved into the Common Conduits, but alſo not few of the private Houſes are ſupplyed with it within their own Doors, ſuch a Convenience, and at ſuch eaſie Rates, that few places enjoy the like; and this being carried through moſt Streets, Lanes, and By-wayes, is not only for within<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door Occaſions, but in caſe of Fire, is very ready to be made uſe of.</p>
            <p>The Streets, moſt of the Narroweſt ſize, eſpecially that near the Center called <hi>Cheap-ſtreet,</hi> the greateſt Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſore of its Beauty and Cumber to its accommodation, it is Walled all round, with a Time-defying Stone, the Buildings (by ſtrong ſuppoſition) mounted much higher then in former Ages; for walking round the Walls, it is perceivable, the City ſtands on a Batch (as we call it) in a bottom, from Fifteen to Twenty foot higher then the Surface without; neither is it without Suburbs, the fourth part ſuppoſed to be ſo, and all together, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by ſome that pretend to have calculated its Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions, takes not up much more then Fifty Acres, in ſuch a narrow compaſs is this ancient, famous, little pretty City contained; which being in ſuch a bottom, hath ſuch a variety of Proſpects, and Landskips, that few places parallel it, whereas places ſcited on Levels, ſeldom pleaſe the Eye far, deprived by the interpoſition of the next Pale, Wall, or Hedge, whereas, this raiſing it ſelf higher then the adjoyning Gardens and Meadows, hath full and free paſſage, nor do the Hills ſo ſtrengthen the Proſpect, but that the Eye may even ſurfeit its ſelf with variety of Objects (in ſome places) for at leaſt three Miles, at once beholding the <hi>Meander-Aven</hi> Semi-circling the City, then the low Meadows, in ſeveral
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98660:5"/>
ſmall and great Partitions, the Paſture grounds above them, then the Corn fields, ſo gradually ye come up to the Downs, on which particularly <hi>Launſdown</hi> is an excellent Coarſe of above two Miles, at the end whereof may be ſeen the City of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> with the Counties of <hi>Somerſet, Wilts, Gloceſter, Worceſter, Hereford,</hi> and <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth;</hi> but this has made me endanger the Out-running my intended Diſcourſe, ſeldom farther then the little City or its Proſpect, but this Digreſſion (I ſuppoſe) may not be much out of Order, when the Gallantry and Youth of the Nation, may be made acquainted, what Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Vicinity of the place affords, eſpecially when it is accompanied with Hunting, Setting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Wall is in compaſs not a full <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile, and were the City not in ſuch a bottom, and ſo over topped by Neighbouring Hills, by the Opinion of Col. <hi>B.</hi> (once Governor thereof) and ſome others, that may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Fortifications) might be made Tenable, for indeed the whole, is but one entire Rampart, a Coffin fill'd with Earth, on which the Buildings are; then the Springs ſo near the Superficies, that no Approaches can be made but with great difficulty, there are large diſcourſes already extant of ſeveral Statues, Figures, as Gorgons Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in it, in which I ſhall not meddle, but leave every man to his view, and belief, but certainly this, it is a Noble Ancient Wall therein appearing many antiquities, as alſo four Gates, having their ſeveral denominations from the four Cardinal winds, which every night are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be lock'd up, and a Watch Itinerant, Sworn not to enter any Houſe till four in the Morn, which how duely obſerved, ſome of them who have been caught tardy, and put into Wooden Baſtile, for their pains can ſatisfie you.</p>
            <p>The Government is by a Mayor, Aldermen, and Twenty Councellors or Citizens. The Mayor and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98660:6"/>
(on ſolemn dayes) are in Scarlet, the number (by Charter) may not exceed eleven, nor under five; to theſe is added a Recorder, who there with the Mayor is Juſtice of the Peace and <hi>Quorum,</hi> having the precedence of the two other Juſtices; alſo a Town Clark, who every Leet-day (twice in the year) calls the Court, and it is kept in his Name, although Mayor, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> preſent.</p>
            <p>And here (I conceive it will not be improper, no Sally from the purpoſe, to obſerve the care here taken for the Poor, of which quality (I ſuppoſe) there are fewer then in any place (for its bigneſs) in the Kingdom, the yearly rate for the three Pariſhes, being under 30 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> which to ſome Strangers, hath, not being acquainted with the Cuſtom and Method here taken) ſeem'd wonderful, moſt People conjecturing the City to be poor, (as indeed it cannot vaunt of many notoriouſly rich) yet Providence, with the beneficent munificence of ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Monarques hath ſufficiently provided for it, thereby they owing as little to their backs and bellies as any place I know of, yet no ſtupid Gormandizers neither; for ſuch care is taken that the wealthier ſort eat their own Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, free from ſuch importunate Clamours and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries as are too frequently ſeen in other places, that have a higher Celebration for Riches, this principally ariſing (without doubt) from Magiſtratical care, at every Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Sale day wherein the poorer ſort are not only kindly uſed (beyond compariſon) but are alſo ſo tyed up, that they cannot ſquander away their good bargains, but are reſerved in caſe of neceſſity to their needy Families.</p>
            <p>It is ſupplied and adorned for the Service of God with three Churches, dedicated to St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Michael,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> the later juſtly challenging to its ſelf the preheminence, for lightſomneſs, ſtatelineſs, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance

of Structure, of all the Parochial Churches in the Kingdom, the Tower whereof is 162 foot high, in the upper loft whereof, is a noble Taunting, and Muſical ring of Bells, whoſe loud Peals have been diſtinctly heard five, ſix, nay ſometimes ſeven Miles diſtant. The Tenor is called <hi>Hopton;</hi> moſtly the gift of that Honorable Family, what wanted in their bounty, was ſupplyed by the City; to this Tower are four ſeveral Stair-Caſes, at each diſtinct corner one. This Stately Pile was begun in <hi>Henry</hi> the Sevenths time by one <hi>Oliver King,</hi> the then Biſhop of the Dioceſs, but never (by the iniquity of the times partly ariſing by the ſeveral changes) could it ariſe to any perfection, till about the year 1606. God raiſed up Biſhop <hi>Montague,</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Bellot,</hi> and other pious and generous Benefactors, by whoſe great bounty and good Example it now enjoys its preſent Splendor and Glory. In the Body whereof one thing is moſt remarkable, that although it be of a vaſt Dimenſion taking its height, bredth, and length, and lying unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered for above 100 years, the Windows ſo large, the Walls ſo thin, (that I preſume many Manſion-houſes equal it) yet this Noble Pile, notwithſtanding it hath no ſloaping Buttreſſes, on the outſide to ſupport and ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it, which the great Churches uſually have, ſhews no Flaw, Crack, not ſettling, but ſtands firm and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, evidencing thereby, not only the profound Skill of the Architect, but the goodneſs of the Stone, whoſe quality is, when taken up green out of the Quarry, of ſuch a ſoftneſs, that a Pen-knife (comparatively) may work it, without turning its edge, but when expoſed to any building in the open Air, nothing more laſting, nothing more permanent, for neither Age nor time can deface it, witneſs the whole Pile, which notwithſtanding it hath ſtood near two Centuries, yet to this day, remains as

firm and beautiful as at firſt, near the midſt whereof, under an Arch to the Northward, lyes interred the Noble and Charitable Benefactor Biſhop <hi>Montague,</hi> on whom his Executors (his Brothers) men of great Honor and Places, rear'd a ſtately Monument, anſwerable to the Dignity of that Honourable and Religious Prelate, over againſt this Noble Monument, the City in Teſtimony of the reſpects they owed to the then Rector Mr. <hi>John Pelling</hi> erected another to him, this Reverend Divine, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he had a numerous Iſſue; yet was ſo indefatigably zealous in forwarding the reparation of this Fabrick, that when at any time (and that was not ſeldom in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and benefactory Age) any Perſons of Honour offer'd to him, as to his private, refuſed it with his, <hi>Non mihi ſed Eccleſiae,</hi> which occaſion'd that Motto over his Tomb, which ſelf-denyal (its poſſible) the good God hath (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condarily paid into his own boſom, by a bleſſing on his Poſterity, who (ſome of them eſpecially) notwithſtanding the few mites they had to begin the World, have now the value of Talents in their Poſſeſſion; but this I take notice of, only for the Readers ſatisfaction, not for other Miniſters Imitation.</p>
            <p>In the South-eaſt Iſle, is a pretty, ſomewhat ſtately, and doubt leſs conceited Monument, all of Free-ſtone, having Originally no Inſcription, as to time, perſon, or quality, therefore vulgarly called the <hi>Speechleſs Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but now not ſo, for although the Tenant was (poſſibly) not willing to have any, yet the will of the Dead, as to that particular is ſufficiently broken, for on the ground are many Stones, curiouſly and artificially Joyned together, theſe make the reſemblance of a copped Cheſt, and is in length, bredth, and height, ſufficient to receive an Ordinary Corps; but it ſeems it was not the receptacle, if you believe the Scribled Inſcription.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I muſt not omit ſpeaking ſomewhat of the Revenue of this Church, which indeed is but ſmall, and that which is and hath been the Gifts of Proteſtant Benefactors, among whom, Dame <hi>Elizabeth Booth</hi> the Anceſtors of that Noble and fully accompliſh'd Gentleman the Lord <hi>de la<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mere,</hi> exceeded all the Sons and Daughters of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by whoſe pious bounty (with ſome additions the

City made) there is purchaſed in Land, to the yearly value of near 20 l. <hi>per annum,</hi> this ſeems but a ſmall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance for ſo great a Building, yet with this, and with what elſe doth ariſe by breaking ground for Burial places, and for Monuments, it is as well kept in Repair as any Church I know of.</p>
            <p>But before I leave this Church, I ſhall leave with you theſe few obſervations; Firſt, that not any one (that I know of) not of the Religion profeſſed and eſtabliſh'd, gave one peny towards its Reparation; Next for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of our Fathers, they were the Repairers, and that in the laſt place We their Survivours may not be branded of having ſo much Faith, that we have loſt all Good Works, continue the Reparation, and that not Niggardly neither; of which thoſe famous Battlements and Pinacles, almoſt round, gives ſufficient and pregnant Evidence.</p>
            <p>And now having done your Devotions, it is time I lead you to the Kings Bath, where as ſoon as you come down the great Stairs, you may behold the Stone-pavement and Battlements quite round it, the bounty of Sir <hi>Francis Stonor</hi> of <hi>Stonor;</hi> and for that I have had ſome Reflections on Proteſtant Benefactors on the Church to give each Perſwaſion its due, this Gentleman was a Romaniſt, may not this therefore argue for them, that although they may be no Friends to the Church, yet they may be to the State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And now behold one of the greateſt Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in Nature: The Univerſe (by Travellers general report) not affording the like, whoſe Waters, (granted by all hands to be as old as the Creation, keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly one quantity and quality in the greateſt Drought, not one drop leſs in appearance, nor in the greateſt Flouds or Innundation any the More, experimentally made true by this unqueſtionable Evidence, the Waters filling it up to the uſual height, which when the Sluces are carefully
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98660:9"/>
and exactly ſtopped, whether Summer or Winter, Drought or Floud, makes not one Minutes difference; ſo that Dame <hi>Luna,</hi> that Puling Piſs-Kitchin Planet with her Ebbings and Flowings, her Nepes and Spring-tides, hath no influence at all here, and no more then Reaſon, for theſe Waters all along have been and are <note n="*" place="margin">Anciently the Cities Name.</note> 
               <hi>Aquae Solis,</hi> ſo <hi>Sol</hi> is ſolely predominant here, and Lord Paramount, whereby we are aſſured they partake of no other accidental Increaſe, by any Spring or ſoaking to contaminate, defile or diſ-vertue it, which the cold Waters of <hi>Tunbridge, Epſom, Barnet,</hi> &amp;c. cannot appropriate to themſelves, if general report be true, they increaſing and decreaſing, according to Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Seaſon; but of this no more till I come to hint, and but to hint of them in another place.</p>
            <p>Now the quantity of theſe Waters ariſing in the Kings Bath (there are none in the Queens although they are contiguous) may (as is ſuppoſed) very well drive an Over-ſhot Mill, and the quality is as conſtant as the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, the Springs at their Ebullitions, as hot in <hi>December</hi> as in <hi>June,</hi> and therefore may (with ſome more care for prevention of taking Cold) be with much efficacy uſed in all Seaſons of the year, which is very fit ſhould be taken notice of, to remove a Vulgar Error, That theſe Waters are never uſeful nor ſeaſonable but in the Summer.</p>
            <p>Among the many Springs in the Kings Bath, there is a principal one called the Hot-Spring, which is received by its ſelf (without Communication into a lead Ciſtern, and that ſo cloſe, that it is impoſſible any Drop of the other Waters can intermingle, over this Spring and Ciſtern, is (by the Order and Direction of an Honorable and Famous Phyſitian, a pump erecting, ſo that the Waters from its ſingle Effluence ſhall by three ſeveral Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, be diſtributed abroad in wonderful quantities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98660:9"/>
that although the three pumps ſhould be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual agitation, yet this noble, and exuberant Spring will remain inexhauſtible, the Vertues whereof Fame (warranted by Experience) hath juſtly Trumpetted forth to the world, inſomuch, that they are not only made uſe of in the Bath, the ſeveral places of the City, and Neighborhood, but alſo in Bottles and Runlets at <hi>Briſtol, Gloceſter, Worceſter,</hi> nay, <hi>London</hi> it ſelf. Among many its vertues, I ſhall give you an accompt of but a few, Take your proportion in the Morn, whether two, three, or more quarts, as may be preſcribed you, for four, five, or ſix hours after you have drank them, you have no Thirſt, whereas formerly, when they were not taken inwardly, the Bathers were ſo greatly afflicted with it, that many times weak heads have been near an intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in only endeavouring by taking in other potable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor (moderately) to quench it, and all the times theſe Soveraign Waters are in your body, although they may give you ſeveral Stools, yet it is without any rumbling in your body, or Laceration of your Guts, having a gentle and painleſs Operation, both by Urine and Siege; the Concomitant whereof is an excellent Stomach, much better'd by walking and ſtirring your body after the drinking them, and ſtill as your body empties, you may continue drinking more, the Waters being ſo innocent, that it is ſeldom or never heard, any complaint that a great quantity injured any one, and now (as I ſaid before) they are never out of ſeaſon, for that Stately new erected Croſs in the Kings Bath is a defence and ſhelter as well from Winters blaſts as Summers Sun, and there are many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Rooms for drinking of, and bathing in them, which may invite thoſe that have occaſion to make uſe of them at any ſeaſon, eſpecially ſince I ſhall give them this aſſurance, that although there may be to Winter-Bathers
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98660:10"/>
more expence in fuel, yet to recompence that, their Lodgings will be cheaper, and the Inhabitants are obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be as active in their attendance, and as ready to take your Money, in hoary <hi>December,</hi> as in fragrant <hi>June.</hi> This being granted, I have often wonder'd ſo much peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have neglected a ſuddain Repair hither, but to the loſs of many of their Lives, Limbs, or both; have delayed ſo long, and tamper'd ſo much, by taking undue cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in other places, that many times, when they come hither, they are ſo far paſt all hopes, that nothing but a Miracle can cure them, whereas ſeldom or never, any part hence (that make early Application) without ſome comfort, if not perfect cure or recovery. I cannot play the Emperick to tell you all the Maladies, and Diſeaſes by Potion and Lotion they are effectually good for, only this (to my own knowledge) they are (in ſome conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions) good againſt, and for avoiding the very Stone, of which there are proofs ſufficient, among the many this one, The deareſt Relation of the Author of theſe papers, was extreamly tormented with it for ſome years, never could ſhe find any eaſe or comfort by any Skill or Direction of the ableſt Phyſitian, till the great Phyſitian was pleaſed to put it into her head to make uſe of the Bath; which in three or four times uſing, by bathing and drinking, divers Stones came from her, and that only in the time of her Bathing, and drinking, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as big as Olive-Stones are yet in my Cuſtody, and from that time to her dying day, (which was ſome years) was never troubled with it afterwards. For other ordinary Diſeaſes, as <hi>Palſie, Dropſie, Sciatica, Rickets,</hi> and the like, the numberleſs number of Crutches that have from time to time been left behind, is a ſufficient Teſtimony, ſome whereof yet hung up, remain as Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of Gods Mercies in their ſeveral Cures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98660:10"/>And now in this place (according to my promiſe) and purpoſe) I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat of the Cold Waters of <hi>Tunbridge, Epſom,</hi> &amp;c. ſo much celebrated and drank of in and about <hi>London,</hi> wherein becauſe I may be thought partial, I ſhall ſpeak the leſs, in which let me deſire an Obſervation whether or no ſince the drinking thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been ſo much in uſe. <hi>The Griping of the Guts,</hi> a not only painful torturing, but Mortal Malady, hath not been more frequent now then in former times, it is eaſily found to be ſo by examination of the Weekly Bills, which plainly evidences, that of late more have been caſt over the Perch, by this doleful Diſeaſe in one year, then (giving allowance alſo for the growth of the City too proportionably) in former Ages in ſeven, and thoſe that will not appropriate that ſingle Diſeaſe, beſides ſome others that may be attributed to thoſe Waters, are in their underſtandings (I humbly conceive) blind or wilfully obſtinate, indeed how can it be otherwiſe but thoſe cold and crude Springs, with their Nauſeous ſoakings (ſo averſe to our <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and all Northern Conſtitutions) lying ſo long in the Stomach, but muſt oppreſs, chill it, and deſtroy the Appetite, eſpecially ſince it is granted there is many times a mixture of Rain waters, ſoaking through the ſeveral crannies of the Earth into them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding an increaſe by Urine and Ordure, Humane and Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luine, plentifully ſhed thereabouts; ſo that the Phyſick makes the Excrement, and (<hi>Viciſsim</hi>) the Excrement the Phyſick, certainly it is ſo, thoſe Springs being obſerved to be far more fluent in wet and cold Summers, then in the hot and dry, then if compounded Rain-waters, and ſuch Soakings are of ſuch vertues I ſuppoſe they may be had nearer home, but it can never win belief with me, that the drinking them is the ſole Reaſon and Occaſion of the great reſort thither; no, doubtleſs there is ſomething elſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98660:11"/>
in it Meetings; which if ſo, they that go thither on that Errand, do not amiſs, let them enjoy and ſolace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves there, no hurt, but when they are there, to drink the waters in ſuch a prodigious manner and meaſure through wantonneſs, cuſtom, or example, can by no man wiſhing well to the Nation be approved of. But <hi>Si Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus vult perire, quis vetet?</hi> Sure this I am, that not above two or three years ſince, ſome ſixteen miles diſtant from this City at a place called <hi>Alford,</hi> there was ſuch another Spring found out, as I now am diſcourſing of; never was there a greater reſort to any place (conſidering the ſmall quantities of Waters it produced) then thither ſo much reputation it had gained that much people had the patience to ſtay their turns (for Gods mercies were much ſeen in that it was a (pitifully) barren Spring) till they could be ſupplyed from the Well. This was then (for that year only, for never before, nor never after, that I ever could here of (it having (paid the Drinkers off, ſufficiently) was it made uſe of) the <hi>Engliſh Betheſda,</hi> but it was not the Angel of the Lord that ſtirred thoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but an evil one; found ſo, by the Diſeaſes and Mortality that ſeized on abundance of People, in a very ſhort time after they had drank them; inſomuch, that ever ſince there is a <hi>Lord have Mercy</hi> written on the Door of him that made Merchandize of them.
