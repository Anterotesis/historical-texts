            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>HILIP late Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> being ſeized in Tail Male, <note place="margin">17 Dec. 1647.</note> with remainder over to the preſent Earl, of ſeveral Mannors and Lands in the <hi>County of Glamorgan,</hi> in conſideration of a Marriage to be had between him and <hi>Henriette Querovalle,</hi> and of 10000 <hi>l.</hi> Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did by Articles of that Date, Covenant with <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> Lord <hi>Godolphin,</hi> to ſettle on her 1300 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> during her Life, out of thoſe Mannors, in lieu of a Joynture; and entred into a Statute of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> Penalty to make good thoſe Articles.</p>
            <p>The Marriage took effect, and the Portion was paid; and the late Earl, to enable himſelf to make ſuch Settlement, employs Mr. <hi>Rider</hi> and Mr. <hi>Negus,</hi> his own Servants, to get a <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Recovery,</hi> levied and ſuffered at the <hi>Grand Seſſions</hi> held in <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan-ſhire</hi> in <hi>April</hi> 1675. And accordingly Commiſſions of <hi>Dedimus Poteſtatem</hi> were taken out, and directed to Mr, <hi>Herbert Salladine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Francis Negus,</hi> and others, as Commiſſioners to take the Earls acknowledgment of the Fine, and Warrant of Attorney for the Recovery; which were by <hi>Salladine</hi> and <hi>Negus</hi> duly executed and return'd.</p>
            <p>That Mr. <hi>Rider</hi> coming to the <hi>Grand Seſſions</hi> was informed, that there were ſeveral Freehold Leaſes on ſeveral parts of the Eſtate, and that the <hi>Recovery</hi> would not bar the Entail of thoſe Lands, unleſs ſuch Freehold Leaſes were firſt ſurrendred; and therefore Mr. <hi>Rider</hi> agrees with the Compounder for the King's Silver, to paſs the <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Recovery</hi> at that time for 140 <hi>l.</hi> Composition Money; which was alſo to be a Satisfaction for a Second <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Recovery,</hi> if any were eſteemed neceſſary, for the Tenements contained in ſuch Freehold Leaſes: And in <hi>April</hi> 1675. a <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Recovery</hi> of the Eſtate paſſed, and a <hi>Chirograph</hi> of the <hi>Fine,</hi> and an <hi>Exemplification</hi> of the <hi>Recovery</hi> were brought to Sir <hi>John King,</hi> in order to have the Settlement drawn by him; and by his Direction and Advice the Freehold Leaſes were ſurrendred, and a <hi>Fine</hi> and a 2 <hi>d.Recovery</hi> duly ſuffered of thoſe Lands, at the <hi>Grand Seſſions</hi> held in <hi>Auguſt</hi> after. And thereupon a <hi>Chirograph</hi> of that <hi>Fine,</hi> and an <hi>Exemplification</hi> of that <hi>Recovery</hi> were brought also and delivered to the ſaid Sir <hi>John King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That thereupon the Earl by Indenture, dat. 10. <hi>Sep.</hi> 1675, Reciting both Fines and Recoveries to be duly levied and ſuffer'd, declar'd the Uſes thereof to himſelf and his Heirs. And in purſuance of the ſaid Articles, and ſubſequent Agreement ſecur'd to his Counteſs a Jointure of 1500 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> out of the ſaid Mannors and Lands, of which the ſaid <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries</hi> had paſs'd.</p>
            <p>And upon the Execution of the ſaid Fines and Recoveries, and the ſaid Conveyances, the Truſtees of the Counteſs delivered up the Stat. of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> to the Earl to be cancell'd.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>Aug.</hi> 1685. Earl <hi>Philip</hi> dyed without Iſſue Male, leaving only one Daughter, <hi>viz.</hi> the Lady <hi>Charlotte</hi> now Wife of the Lord <hi>Jeffreys;</hi> to whom all the ſaid Mannors and Premiſſes, of which the ſaid <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Recovery</hi> were ſuffer'd, deſcended; and by whom after the Earl's death, the Premiſſes were enjoy'd, ſubject to the ſaid Jointure of the Counteſs of <hi>Pembroke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Writs</hi> relating to the Fines and Recoveries are so <hi>careleſly</hi> kept in the County of <hi>Glamorgan;</hi> that many of them are <hi>Torn, Defac'd, Rotten, Loſt,</hi> or otherwiſe embezzelled, by the neglect and default of the Officers in the Courts there.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Hil. Ter.</hi> 1687. <hi>Tho.</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> now Lord <hi>Privy Seal;</hi> hoping to take advantage of the Miſpriſion of the Clerks in Entring the ſaid <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries,</hi> or of their negligence in keeping them, brought three ſeveral <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> to reverſe the firſt <hi>Fine</hi> and both <hi>Recoveries,</hi> which were return'd accordingly.</p>
            <p>That upon this occaſion the Counteſs being adviſed; that the miſtakes in the ſaid <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries</hi> were amendable, and that upon a <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Error</hi> brought the Court uſually Ordered Amendments to be made, did, by the advice of her Council, move the Juſtices of the Grand Seſſions of <hi>Wales;</hi> That the mistakes in the ſaid <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries</hi> might be amended, and the ſeveral <hi>Writs</hi> and parts of <hi>Records,</hi> that were <hi>rotten, eaten by Vermin or deſac'd,</hi> might, <hi>as uſually in like Caſes,</hi> be ſupply'd upon the Teſtimony of Living Witneſſes, who were concern'd in the ſaid <hi>Fine</hi> and <hi>Recoveries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That upon this motion, the uſual <hi>Rule</hi> was made for <hi>amending</hi> and <hi>ſupplying</hi> the ſaid Writs, unleſs the Earls Council ſhould at a time appointed ſhow cauſe to the contrary.</p>
            <p>That upon hearing of Council on both ſides, and upon fight of many Precedents of the like Amendments in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and upon the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of many Eminent Council, and the Oaths of ſeveral Living Witneſſes, That Commiſſions had iſſued, and were returned for the Earls acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging the Fine and Recoveries, and that the uſual Writs and Proceedings had been made in proſecuting and perfecting them, and that the Records were kept in a confuſed manner, and in ſuch places, that they were <hi>Rotten, Defac'd,</hi> or <hi>Loſt:</hi> And that whatever <hi>Writ,</hi> or part of <hi>Records</hi> was <hi>wanting,</hi> was <hi>rotten</hi> or <hi>eaten</hi> by <hi>Vermin;</hi> ſuch of the Defects, as were uſually amendable, were by Rule of Court amended, or ſupplyed.</p>
            <p>Since which Proceedings the amended Records are removed into the King's Bench by <hi>Certiorari,</hi> and by the <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Errors</hi> cannot be further proceeded in until the Lady <hi>Charlotte</hi> comes of Age.</p>
            <p>The Preſent Earl hath now brought a Bill in Parliament, to ſet aſide all theſe Amendments by the Legiſlative Power, and to diſenherit the Heir at Law.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as theſe Miſtakes occaſioned by the Miſpriſion or Negligence of the Clerk in making or keeping Records have uſually been amended and ſupplied.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as many good Laws have been made for the Encouragement of Amendments in the Reigns of ſeveral of their Majeſties Predeceſſors, which do yet ſtand in force.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as a Common Recovery is favoured in Law, more than any Judgment or Proceedings in any other Real Action: As being a Common Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance made by the mutual Conſent of Parties, and upon which moſt of the <hi>Settlements</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Titles</hi> of <hi>Purchaſers</hi> do depend, and therefore <hi>hath been, and is uſually</hi> amended and ſupported.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as this Precedent will be of <hi>fatal</hi> Conſequence to <hi>most</hi> of the Eſtates in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>more eſpecially</hi> in <hi>Wales,</hi> if the <hi>Neglect,</hi> or <hi>Miſpriſion,</hi> or <hi>indirect Acts</hi> of the Clerks ſhall ſet aſide all Titles and Settlements, contrary to the plain Words of the Deeds, and the Teſtimony of many <hi>Witneſſes</hi> yet alive, and the known Conſent and Meaning of the Parties, without any Relief, or Amendment of thoſe Miſtakes: And the rather ſince it cannot be denied, that the <hi>Records</hi> in that County are kept in ſuch Place and Manner, that there are no whole and entire Proceedings in any <hi>Fine</hi> or <hi>Recovery,</hi> ſuffered and levied in the County of Twenty Years ſtanding.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is therefore humbly Pray'd, That this Bill may not paſs into an Act.</hi>
