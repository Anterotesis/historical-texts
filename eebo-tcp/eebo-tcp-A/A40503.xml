         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS I have always had a paſſionate
Deſire to ſee Foreign Countries, I
was no ſooner Maſter of my own Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but I made it my Buſineſs, in the
proſecution of my Deſign, to attain to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
might contribute to the Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of an honeſt Man, and to diſtinguiſh
my ſelf from thoſe Travellers, who run
over the World for the ſole delight they
have of ſeeing different Objects, without
ever putting themſelves in a Condition
to be uſeful to their Country: Wherefore
being thus inclin'd, and aſſiſted by the
Advice of my Friends, I took to the
Study of the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> and at
length, by reading the Relations of others,
made my ſelf familiarly acquainted with
the Hiſtory of the different Nations of
the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:106963:6"/>
The Noiſe which Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi>
his Expedition made in 1695, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd
my Reſolutions of taking that Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to go abroad, as believing I
could not do better than to lay hold of
the Conveniency of ſo brave a Voyage;
and therefore without any more ado, I
abandon'd the little Experience that an
Age of Nineteen Years cou'd ſupply me
with, to the Courſe of my Fortune, came
quickly to make uſe of the Leſſons I had
learnt (as well as the chief Officers of
the Mariners) under one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Maſters of the Age; and began now
to come to the practick Part of what I
knew before but in the Theory. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Idea I had formed with my ſelf
of the Voyage, and the frequent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
I had with our Pilots, gave
me the Advantage of taking notice of
all the Circumſtances I thought neceſſary
to Sailing; And I am not to omit,
that the long abode I have made in
divers Parts, giving me a real Taſte
of the Pleaſure there is in ſeeing Foreign
Countries; I have with all imaginable
Exactneſs enquir'd into the Commerce
of the Place, the particular Intereſts
of each Colony, the Strength, Situation,
and Advantages of the Ports; the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb facs="tcp:106963:6"/>
Cuſtoms, and Religion of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
and laſtly, the Nature of thoſe
Fruits, Plants, Birds, Fiſhes, and the
Animals that ſeem'd to have any thing
extraordinary in or peculiar to them,
and theſe I have ſet out in the beſt
manner I cou'd, by a great many Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-Cuts,
all of them reſpectively fixed in
their proper Places.</p>
            <p>But I have more particularly apply'd
my ſelf to make Charts of the Entrances
of Harbours and Rivers, either of my
ſelf, as I have had Leaſure for it, as
may be ſeen in thoſe I have given of
<hi>Gambia, Rio-Janeiro,</hi> and <hi>All-Saints</hi>-Bay,
as by reforming the Charts or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
that have been taken of the Streight
of <hi>Magellan,</hi> of the diſemboguings of the
Iſles of <hi>Antilles,</hi> and of the Government
of <hi>Cayenne,</hi> that hath not yet appear'd
in the World, under the Name of <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial
France,</hi> in that Extent, and
with thoſe Limits I have ſet it forth by.</p>
            <p>I hope this Relation will meet with
ſo much the more favourable Reception,
ſeeing I have retrencht it of thoſe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
Particulars wherewith others of this
kind are uſually ſtuffed, and have made
uſe of all the Exactneſs and Simplicity
that a Work requires that has no other
<pb facs="tcp:106963:7"/>
than Truth for its End, and wherein
the Reader will have the pleaſure either
of ſeeing new Deſcriptions, or his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
regulated in reſpect of thoſe he has
already ſeen elſewhere; and laſtly, an
orderly View given of all the unfortunate
Diſappointments of ſo noble an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,

            <p>On the 15th. at four a-Clock in the

which came up to view us within three

            <p>On the 21th. at Sun-Riſing, we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd

off a Gun, to give us notice that ſhe

            <p>On the 3d. we diſcover'd <hi>Cape Verd,</hi>

            <p>The Governour of that Iſland imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately

               <note place="margin">The Iſland of <hi>Gorea.</hi>
               </note>
with a Preſent of an Ox, and two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen

this Preſent told us, That the Veſſels of
the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company paſs'd by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while ago, and that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter
had inform'd them, That almoſt
the whole Garriſon of <hi>Gambia</hi> was fall'n
ſick, and wanted Proviſions; which
piece of News was ſo well confirm'd to
<hi>M. de Gennes,</hi> even by the Relation of

any notice of our Arrival.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, waiting till thoſe
Ships appear'd, we diverted our ſelves,
ſome in Hunting, and others in Fiſhing;
nay we met with ſufficient variety of
Divertiſements, not very expenſive,
without leaving the Villages. The Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
came continually on board with
their<note n="*" place="margin">Pirogues.</note> Veſſels full of Fiſh, which they
gave us in exchange for Knives, Sheets
of Paper, little pieces of Iron, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Toys of the like nature: We alſo
pierc'd ſome Barrels of Wine, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
aſide the Heat of the Weather,
which was exceſſive, the Sports and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes
abated a great deal of the Impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

            </p>
            <p>On the fifth Inſtant, <hi>M. de Gennes,</hi>
M. <hi>du Parc,</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi>
went to give a Viſit to the <hi>Alcaty</hi>
or Governour of a Village call'd <hi>The
Gap,</hi> ſituate on the Sea-ſhore, near a

freſh Water can be taken in; upon

their Requeſts upon good Terms.</p>
            <p>The next Day M. <hi>de Gennes</hi> invited to
Dinner the Governour of <hi>Gorea,</hi> the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid
<hi>Alcaty</hi> of <hi>Gap,</hi> and another <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caty</hi>
of a neighbouring Village, who
was the Brother of a Favourite of the
King of <hi>Houmel,</hi> and otherwiſe in great
eſteem for his Magnanimity, and for
being one of the moſt robuſt and well-ſet
Men of the Country. The <hi>Alcaty</hi>
of <hi>Rufiſca</hi> was alſo preſent, by chance,
with a Negro Lady, the Widow of a
certain <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who had one of
the chief Places in the Kingdom:
This Lady had excellent Features,
was endow'd with a generous Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and of a very obliging Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
being of a middle-ſiz'd Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and cloath'd after the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Faſhion. M. <hi>du Gennes</hi> treated them all
magnificently, and made them ſome ſmall
Preſents: He was alſo deſirous to divert
them with a Volly of Cannon and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-ſhot:
But Dinner was ſcarce ended,
when they earneſtly importun'd to be
diſmiſs'd. The cauſe of their ſudden
Departure being unknown to us, we
were not a little ſurpriz'd, in regard that
they had no reaſon to be tir'd with the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106963:10"/>
Company; till the Governour of <hi>Gorea</hi>
told us,<note place="margin">Superſtition of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's.</note> That apparently they had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to eaſe themſelves, and that a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious

never to do it at Sea.</p>
            <p>On the 9th. Inſtant, our Shallop be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fitted out to take in freſh Water, a
Storm of Wind aroſe, which threw
her on the Coaſt: She ſuffer'd little
Dammage, by reaſon that the Shock
happen'd on the Sand: Nevertheleſs
this Accident was like to have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
a great Conteſt with the Negroes,
who gave it out, That one Moiety of
the Veſſels that run a-ground on their
Coaſts, ought to be appropriated to
their Uſe: And even the Governour of
<hi>Gorea</hi> himſelf acknowledg'd, that they
had a Right to ſuch a Claim: But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as this Law was made only in
reference to Merchant-Ships, we ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet ſome of our Men on Shore, to
ſtand upon their Guard; and for far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Security, retain'd ſeven or eight
Negroes, who were come on board to
trade with Fiſh: In the mean while, our
Carpenters wrought during the whole
Night; and the next Day in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon
our Shallop return'd laden with
Water, and as ſound as before.</p>

On the 13th. at two a-clock, two Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
appear'd, whilſt our <hi>Corvette</hi> was
ſailing to the Village of <hi>Ruſiſca;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
we diſcharg'd a Cannon to cauſe
her to return, and to recal all the Mariners
on board: We likewiſe made Signals to
the other Ships, which were anſwer'd
by them. They were the <hi>Seditious</hi> and
the <hi>Fruitful</hi> Pinks, which came to join
with us again, after having waited for
our Arrival eleven Days at <hi>Madera:</hi>
They caſt Anchor at two a-clock, and
the next Day our <hi>Corvette</hi> ſet out a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

            <p>Before we leave <hi>Gorea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the Iſland of <hi>Gorea.</hi>
               </note> it may not be
improper to give ſome account, how
the <hi>French</hi> ſettled in that Iſland, and to
relate what I have ſeen and heard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Nature of the Coaſt, and the
Traffick and Manners of the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of <hi>Gorea</hi> is diſtant only
one League from the Continent, four
from Cape <hi>Verd,</hi> and may be about
half a League in Compaſs. The <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
firſt fix'd a Colony therein, and
built the Forts of St. <hi>Francis</hi> and St. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,</hi>
which are ſtill to be ſeen: After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Count <hi>d' Etrées</hi> made himſelf
Maſter of the Place <hi>A. D.</hi> 1678: The
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:106963:11"/>
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> took it from the <hi>French</hi> in 1692.
and demoliſh'd the Forts which were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by the <hi>Hollanders:</hi> At laſt the
<hi>Senegal</hi> Company, having re-taken it in
1693, rebuilt St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s Fort: And
there are at preſent in this Iſland about
100 <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> with ſome Families of
<hi>Lapto's</hi> or free Negro's, who are hir'd
by the Company to trade from one
Coaſt to another.</p>
            <p>The Sea-Coaſt is flat, ſandy, and in
many places very barren: The Soil
brings forth Millet, Rice, Tobacco, and
ſome Fruits, which are all generally ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
inſipid: The Country is every where
beſet with a ſort of wild Apple or Crab-Trees,
that grow as thick as Broom in
a Heath or Warren: There are alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſmall Shrubs, which are very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;
their Fruit, call'd <hi>Mandanaza</hi> by
the Negro's, being no bigger than a
ſmall Nut, exactly reſembles an Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock
in Shape and Colour: It is of a
very grateful Taſte, but very unwhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom:
Its Leaf is like that of Ivy, but
of a ſomewhat lighter Green. I have
ſeen there a ſort of Trees not unlike
our Plum-Trees, the Fruit of which has
the Colour, Bigneſs, and almoſt Taſte
of our Cherries; 'Tis call'd <hi>Cahoüar;</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:106963:12"/>
and I have caus'd the Figure of it to be
drawn, becauſe it appear'd to me to be
very remarkable. The Negro's made a
Preſent to us, as a choice Banquet, of
certain large Fruits that reſemble ſmall
Gourds, but under the Skin, is only a
kind of Subſtance like dreſs'd Flax:
They cauſe them to be roaſted under
Embers, and afterward chew them to
ſuck out the Juice, which is as yellow
as Saffron: This Fruit has a Stone as
large as an Egg, and as hard as Iron.
In the Country there is a great number
of Palm-Trees, out of which the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's
extract a ſort of white Liquor,
that we call Palm-Wine, and which is
thus prepar'd: They make an Inciſion
in the Trunk, and apply to it a Gourd-Bottle,
into which the Liquor runs by
the means of a Pipe: 'Tis very pleaſant
to drink when one is hot; but at the end
of two or three Days, it is ſpoil'd, and
eaſily inebriates.</p>
            <p>The Iſland affords great variety of
Game: Turtle-Doves, <hi>Pintades,</hi> Pigeons
and Partridges as big as Pullets, and of
an exquiſite Taſte, are very numerous;
beſides divers ſorts of large Fowl, which
are unknown in <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>The People of theſe Coaſts from the

               <note place="margin">The People.</note> are entirely black, robuſt,

Privy Parts, that are cover'd with a

<hi>Pagnes:</hi> They are very ſlothful, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
hold a Pipe in their Mouth: They
feed upon nothing but Millet and Fiſh,
and very ſeldom eat any Fleſh: They
were ſurpriz'd to ſee us eat Herbs, and
ſaid that we were like Horſes in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Their Trade conſiſts in Slaves,
Gold, <hi>Morphil</hi> or Ivory, and Wax;
which Commodities they uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for Iron, Hatchets, Fuſees, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106963:15"/>
Glaſſes, Knives, Paper, red Stuffs,
and more eſpecially Brandy; in which

            <p>Every Province has its particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
who gathers the Tributes due

which nevertheleſs they do not uſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

aim is to take a great number of

are either diſtributed for the Service of

<hi>Gilofriée,</hi> ſituated on the River-ſide,
to carry a Letter to a certain ancient <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi>
nam'd <hi>Don Cardos,</hi> whom the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Gorea</hi> had aſſur'd us to be
well-affected to the <hi>French.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
this <hi>Portugueſe</hi> having receiv'd the
Letter, came to ſalute M. <hi>de Gennes,</hi> to
whom he afterwards gave an exact Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Condition of the Fort,
and inſinuated at the ſame time, that
foraſmuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were not well
belov'd by the King of <hi>Bar,</hi> it would
be no difficult matter, by the means of
ſome Preſent, to bring him over to
their Party. The Chevalier <hi>de Fontenay,</hi>
our ſecond Captain, went at two a-clock
in the Morning, to compliment
<hi>Don Cardos,</hi> and to entreat him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
us to land a Body of Men; to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from taking in freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and Proviſions: But the King had
told him that he wou'd not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
in our Quarrels, leſt if we could
not take the Fort, it might give an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of Hatred to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who
might afterwards reſent the Affront; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106963:19"/>
that therefore he would not ſuffer any
one to land, but that he would readily
ſupply us with all Things that were in
his Power.</p>
            <p>On the 23d.<note place="margin">St. <hi>James</hi>'s Fort ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd.</note> Inſtant M. <hi>de la Roque</hi>
went to ſummon the Fort to ſurrender,
and upon his Approach, a Canoo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd
to enquire of him what were
his Demands: He anſwer'd, That he
was deſirous to ſpeak with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
Whereupon he was conducted
blind-fold to the Governour's Houſe,
and was receiv'd in his Abſence by the
King's Lieutenant, whom he made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the occaſion of our Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,
and that he was come to ſummon
the Place before we proceeded to any
Acts of Hoſtility. M. <hi>de la Roque</hi> was
nobly treated, and the Healths of the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> were drank
ſeveral times, with Volleys of Cannon-ſhot.
After the Collation, M. <hi>de la
Roque</hi> return'd on board, with three
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers, whom M. <hi>de Gennes</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd
with the like Magnificence.
They deſir'd ſome Days of Truce to
conſult about the Affair, but no longer
time was granted to make their poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Anſwer, than till ſix a-clock the
next Morning; ſo that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:106963:19"/>
to their Fort very much diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd

            <p>The next Night 23 or 24 of our
Shallops took a Brigantine and ſeveral
Canoos, laden with Proviſions for the
Fort; whilſt the <hi>Sun of Africa</hi> gave
Chace to another Canoo, in which the
Governour was paſſing over thither, who
perceiving their cloſe Purſuit, threw
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:106963:20"/>
himſelf into the Sea, and made his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
to the Woods, from whence he
found means to retire the ſame Night,
without being diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>At break of Day, we ſet out two of
our Shallops, and ſail'd three Leagues
up a ſmall River, which takes its Name
from the Village of <hi>Block,</hi> where a

Title of Emperor,<note place="margin">The King of <hi>Block</hi> ſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Emperor.</note> and who is almoſt

which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were refitting
there, and laded our Shallops with two
Pieces of Cannon, and divers caſt Pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rero's
that were taken out of them. In

Fortification call'd <hi>Horſe-Shooes,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Batteries along the Palliſado's: It
was furniſhed with a prodigious quantity
Arms, and the Magazines of Powder
were well ſtor'd; inſomuch that 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that if the Governour, being a
young Man, (who was more intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Pleaſures than on the putting of
his Fort in a good Condition) had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
care to keep therein a ſufficient
quantity of Proviſions and of freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
it might have held out for a long

only a Magazine of Powder, and a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern

            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:106963:23"/>
On the 28th. Inſtant M. <hi>de la Roque</hi>
went to deſire the King of <hi>Bar</hi> to give
us leave to take poſſeſſion of the Slaves
and Oxen, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in his
Dominions: Whereupon the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
That the Fort being ſurrender'd,
every thing that was left on the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
of very good right belonged to him:
M. <hi>de la Roque</hi> told him, that we would
not be ſo ſatisfy'd, and that if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd
to grant our Demands willingly,
we wou'd certainly do our ſelves Juſtice
by force of Arms. And indeed a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
was held about that Anſwer; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as it was well known, that in
the beginning of the War, he had ſeiz'd
on Merchandizes to the value of above
40000 Crowns, belonging to the <hi>French</hi>
who traded on that River; it was
determin'd to make a Deſcent upon the
Country, to take the King Priſoner, and
as many Negroes as cou'd be catched;
and to burn all their Hutts. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
was ready to be put in execution,
when an <hi>Alcaty</hi> came to paſs a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
upon M. <hi>de Gennes,</hi> and to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
him, that the King was unwilling
to engage in a War againſt him; on the
contrary, that he was very deſirous
to keep an amicable Correſpondence
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:106963:23"/>
with him; and that he might freely take
whatever he ſhould think fit.</p>
            <p>The next Day, M. <hi>de Gennes</hi> went to
give a Viſit to the King; the principal
Officers walk'd before him to his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo,
and conducted him to the Place
where the Interview was to be made.
The King appear'd a little while after,
without any regular Train, in the midſt
of a great number of Negroes, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with ſome Drummers: He was
of a very advantageous Stature, and was
cloath'd with a red Doublet beſet with
the Tails of Wild Beaſts, and little Bells.
He had on his Head an Oſier-Cap, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
with divers Rows of Coral, and
two Ox-Horns. Here we may obſerve
by the way, that Circumciſed Perſons in
thoſe Parts, have the liberty to wear
ſuch a Cap, during eight Days imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after their Circumciſion, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of which, they are authoriz'd to
commit all manner of Crimes imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
with impunity, and none durſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of their outragious Villainies. The
King in this pompous Equipage, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Pipe in his Mouth, walk'd with
a Majeſtick Gate under a ſtately Tree,
where he uſually gives Audience to the
Ambaſſadors of the neighbouring Princes.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:106963:24"/>
M. <hi>de Gennes</hi> went thither to ſalute him,
and made him a Preſent of 20 Bars of
Iron, a Barrel of Brandy, a Pair of Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols,
and a Burning-Glaſs, with the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
of which he was extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd.
The Interpreter being a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
who dwelt on the River above ten
Years, ſpoke the Language of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
very fluently; by which means their
Converſation was continu'd for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time; and among other things,
this poor King often enquir'd whether
he was much talk'd of in <hi>France?</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a great deal of Diſcourſe of the like
nature, they parted; but the King cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
M. <hi>de Gennes</hi> to be reconducted by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Men of his own Guards, and ſeveral
Drummers, and preſented him with ſome
of the fineſt Oxen that could be found
in the Village.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. Inſtant, a Council was
held to determine, whether the Fort
ſhould be kept or ſlighted: The latter
Advice was follow'd for divers Reaſons,
and therefore we drew near, to take all
the Merchandizes that were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
in our Veſſels: They conſiſted
in ſeveral Pieces of Ordnance, a great
quantity of Arms, <hi>Morphil,</hi> Wax, Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of Tin and Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Woollen and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:106963:24"/>
Linen-Cloth, printed Calico's, Coral,
Glaſſes, and other Commodities, in which
a great Trade is carryed on in that
Country.</p>
            <p>On the 5th. Day of <hi>Auguſt A. D.</hi> 1695.<note place="margin">Auguſt, 1695.</note>
the <hi>Sun of Africa</hi> paſs'd down the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,

Voyage was undertaken to no purpoſe,
becauſe the Governour would not furniſh

            <p>On the 14th. Inſtant,<note place="margin">The meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Free-booter.</note> a Free-booter of

This Veſſel met with the <hi>Sun of Africa</hi>

that ſince it was determined to demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh

got by divers Proviſions that were left,
as being of no uſe to us. The ſame
Day, we ſuffered a conſiderable Loſs

the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers into <hi>France,</hi> and
was obliged to paſs by <hi>Cayenna</hi> to leave
ſome of our <hi>Negroes</hi> there; 150 of

them were ſhut up in the Hold, leſt
they ſhou'd attempt to make their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape:
But theſe miſerable Wretches,
ſcarce having room to breathe in, threw

in the middle of a fine River, where
the Traffick is very conſiderable; and
the Revenues which they receiv'd from
thence are computed to amount to a
Million; ſo that the Loſs of the Place
cannot be eaſily repair'd.</p>
            <p>This River is navigable even ſo as to bear
large Barks,<note place="margin">The Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of the River.</note> 200 Leagues up the Country,
where it is join'd with that of <hi>Senegal,</hi>
in that place where the <hi>Niger</hi> forms its
famous Arms: Its Sides are flat, and cut
with many Channels, to which the Sea
runs up; and the Soil along its Banks
is fertil in Millet, Rice, Tobacco, and
divers ſorts of Fruits; affording alſo
good Paſture for the feeding of nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Herds of Oxen. The principal
Fruits that we obſerv'd in thoſe Parts,
are the <hi>Banana,</hi> the <hi>Tabakomba,</hi> and the
<hi>Plougue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Banana</hi> is a long Fruit cover'd
with a yellow and tender Skin; the
Pulp of it being ſoft like Cotton, and of
a very good taſte: It grows on a tender
Stalk, about two or three Fathoms high;
its Leaves are a Fathom long, and of a
proportionate breadth. This Stalk bears
only one ſingle Bunch or Cluſter, round
which there may be forty or fifty <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nana's;</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:106963:26"/>
and when the Bunch is gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Stalk is to be cut, by reaſon
that otherwiſe it cou'd not bring forth
any more Fruit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Tabakomba</hi> is almoſt of the ſame
Shape as a <hi>Bon-Chretien</hi> Pear; its
Peel or Rind is like that of a Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
and opens when the Fruit is ripe:
It contains five or ſix ſmall Fruits of a
Roſe-Colour, the Pulp of which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipid,
and the Stone very large.</p>

            <p>The Air about this River is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſom,
by reaſon of the Rains that

can ſcarce avoid its malign Influence;

they die. We experimentally felt
theſe direful Effects, departing from
thence with about 250 ſick Perſons, of

            <p>On the 26th. and 27th. we had a great

that we took in this Bay, ſerv'd in ſome

            <p>Amongſt the Fiſh that were caught
by us, we met with one of an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

about the Eyes, a great number of Spots

On the 5th. at Night, we paſs'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Iſlands of St. <hi>Jago</hi> and <hi>Fuogo.</hi>
The former is the firſt of all the Iſlands
of Cape <hi>Verd,</hi> and the See of a Biſhop:
The other is only a large Mountain,
that continually burns, where we ſaw
Fire on the top of it during the whole
Night; and in the Day it only appear'd
to be Smoke. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
endeavour'd to fix ſettl'd Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
therein, but could never accompliſh
their Deſign, as being perhaps too much
diſturb'd by the Cinders, Sulphureous
Matter, and even Stones that are thrown
out of this burning Mountain.</p>
            <p>On the 6th. and 7th. we had ſtrong
blaſts of Wind, with Thunder and Rain;
and on the 10th. we ſaw two <hi>Blowers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Blowers and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſes.</note>
being a ſort of ſmall Whales, which
ſpout up Water very high, and with a
great Noiſe. We likewiſe diſcover'd vaſt
Shoales of Porpoiſes, that follow'd us
above two Hours: They are of the ſize
of a Hogg, ſwim in Rank and File as
it were ſo many Companies of Infantry,
and ſometimes reach above two Miles in
length.</p>
            <p>On the 11th. 12th. 13th. and 14th.
the Rains were continual, and the Winds
very unconſtant, ſo that our Pilots were
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:106963:37"/>
very much ſurpriz'd; for in drawing
near the Coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> they expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet with the Trade-Winds, which
are very common in thoſe Parts that
lie between the <hi>Tropicks.</hi> In the mean
while, our Water diminiſh'd, half of our
Men were fallen ſick, and our Negroes
periſh'd daily.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. at Night we paſs'd the
Equinoctial-Line within a Degree,<note place="margin">They paſſed the Line.</note> or
thereabouts, of the firſt Meridian; and
the ſame Night we obſerv'd a Comet,
which continu'd till the 19th. of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember.</hi>
Indeed we were not ſenſible of
the exceſſive Heats, and tedious Calms,
with which all the Relations of Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
threaten thoſe who croſs the <hi>Torrid
Zone;</hi> for we always had ſome freſh
Gales of Wind, and the Nights were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               </note> we

Theſe flying Fiſh are almoſt as
big as a Herring, but their Head is more
ſquare; and their Wings are nothing
elſe, but two very long Fins, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
them above the Water as long as
they retain never ſo little Moiſture.
The Gold-Fiſh and the <hi>Bonite</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
make War with them in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106963:38"/>

            <p>The <hi>Frigate</hi> is a large Bird,<note place="margin">The Frigate.</note> of a Grey
Colour, having ſhort Legs, Feet like a

ſometimes ſeven or eight Foot in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs:
Theſe Birds fly with a great deal
of ſwiftneſs, and are to be ſeen for 300

            <p>On the 13th. we gave Orders to the

            <p>On the 17th. we ſaw a great Flock

            <p>On the 22d.<note place="margin">A Sow that brought forth a Monſter.</note> a very remarkable thing
hapned in reference to a Sow with young
that we took at St. <hi>Antony</hi>'s Iſland. This
Sow pigg'd, and the firſt of her young
was a Monſter, which had the Body of
a Pig, the Ears and Snout of an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant;
and above that Snout which
was in the middle of the Forehead, an

<pb n="47" facs="tcp:106963:38"/>
might have been kept for a Rarity if

after it was brought forth.</p>
            <p>On the 24th. at four a-clock in the
Afternoon, we diſcover'd Land; but the
Winds and Currents being contrary to
us, we were not able to caſt Anchor
till the 26th. Inſtant, which we then did
before the Iſland of St. <hi>Ann,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Iſle of St. <hi>Ann.</hi>

Water may be taken in. There are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
ſome wild Fruits, as Purſlain and

of the ſame Taſte as ours.</p>
            <p>In the Woods,<note place="margin">Channell'd Cherries.</note> with which theſe Iſlands
are beſet, one may hear a melodious
Harmony, made by a great number of
ſmall Birds, with fine Feathers: Among
others, there are <hi>Perroquets, Cardinals,</hi>
and <hi>Colibries.</hi> The Cardinal is a kind
of ſmall Sparrow, the Wings and Tail
of which are black, and the reſt of

the Body of a very lively Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Colibrie</hi> is a ſmall Bird no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

It has a Bill ſomewhat long, and
feeds on the Juice of Flowers like our
Bees: Its Neſt is as large as an Egg, and
is ſo much the more curious, in regard
that it is made of fine Cotton, and hung
up with very ſmall Threads. On the
Sea-Coaſts there are <hi>Dotterils</hi> in ſo great
abundance, that our Mariners ſometimes
kill'd five or ſix of them with a Stick
at one blow. Theſe Birds are as big
as Ducks, and commonly fly about the
Iſlands and the Rocks that are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
far in the Sea. The two other
Iſlands are much leſs, and form with
the greater, to the North and South,
certain Channels, which one may paſs
through, as occaſion ſerves. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern

a Creek very convenient for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reening

            <p>Over-againſt the Coaſt ſtands a ſmall

and ready to hinder our landing upon
the leaſt ſuſpicion. Theſe People were
pillag'd ſome Years ago by Rovers, and
ever ſince ſtand upon their Guard as
ſoon as they diſcover the approach of
any Veſſel. However we found means
to purchaſe a couple of Oxen, a dry'd
Fiſh, ſeveral Cheeſes, and Pulſe, with
ſome Fruits, at a dear rate.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. we took in freſh Water,
and the next Day ſet ſail for the River of
<hi>Janeiro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 29th. we doubl'd Cape <hi>Frie,</hi>

and on the 30th. at eight a-clock in the
Morning, ſuppoſing that we had almoſt
made the River,<note place="margin">The River <hi>Jeneiro.</hi>
               </note> we let off a Gun, to
give notice that we ſtood in need of a
Pilot; but having tack'd about on all
ſides till three a-clock in the Afternoon,
without hearing any News, and without
being able to diſcover the Mouth; We
caſt Anchor within three Leagues of the
Land, and ſent our Boat along the Coaſt,
to ſearch it out. The <hi>Portugueſes</hi> of
St. <hi>Ann</hi> had told us, that there was at
the Entrance, a huge Rock in form of
a Sugar-Loaf; but inſtead of one, we
diſcern'd two, at a great diſtance one
from another; ſo that we were much
perplex'd, not knowing how to ſteer our
Courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:106963:41"/>
Our Boat lay at Anchor during the
Night, at the Mouth of the River, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Cannon of the Forts, which
caus'd it to be ſtop'd. At break of Day
the Officer, who was in the Boat, went
to meet the Governour of the Place,
and return'd at ſix a-clock in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
to inform us that the Inhabitants
ſcrupl'd to permit us to enter, by reaſon
(as they gave it out) of the great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our Sick Men: But it is more
probable,<note place="margin">A Scruple made to permit them to enter the River.</note> that not being accuſtom'd to
ſee any other Ships than thoſe of their
own Nation, and fearing leſt we might
be engag'd in a War againſt them,
they were ſo extremely terrify'd at our
Arrival, that as ſoon as our <hi>Corvette</hi>
(which enter'd eight Days before us)
appear'd, all the Women retir'd to the
Country, with the beſt Effects of the
Town.</p>
            <p>At ſix a-clock in the Morning, we
prepar'd to draw near, and at nine an
Officer came, who caus'd us to caſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor
within half a Cannon-ſhot of the
Forts, which are built on both ſides of
that River. Afterwards he went to
make a Report to the Governour, and
promis'd us that he wou'd uſe his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Endeavours to get an Order for the
ſending of a Pilot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:106963:41"/>
In the mean while, there aroſe a ſtrong
Blaſt of Wind, which oblig'd us to hoiſt
up Sail, by reaſon that our Ship got
looſe from Anchor, and ran upon a Shelf
of Rocks which is in the middle of the
River: But the Commanders of the
Forts, who had Orders to ſtop our
Courſe, and who, without having any
regard to the apparent Danger we were
in of periſhing at that inſtant, imagin'd
that we deſign'd to enter without their
leave, diſcharg'd twelve or fifteen Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-Balls
a-croſs our Maſts, to oblige
us to caſt Anchor: Thus they made a
Bravado, inſulting over us, becauſe they
knew that we ſtood in need of their
Aſſiſtance, and durſt not reſent their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts.
Therefore we made haſte to
caſt Anchor; and about a quarter
of an Hour after, an Officer came on
board, who left us a Pilot, and a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
to viſit our ſick Men: He told
us that we might weigh Anchor, and
that he was going to the Fort to know
the Governour's Pleaſure: But as we
were under ſail, before he arriv'd there,
we receiv'd ten Cannon-ſhot more,
which ſhatter'd our Flag, diſmounted
one of the Port-Holes in the Gunner's
Room, and paſs'd between the Shrouds,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:106963:42"/>
without hurting any one of our Crew.
Then we went to caſt Anchor with the
<hi>Seditious</hi> Pink, within a ſmall League
of the Town; neither wou'd the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
ſuffer the <hi>Sun of Africa,</hi> nor the
<hi>Glutton</hi> Frigate, to enter, by reaſon that
he had Orders (as he pretended) from
the King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> not to admit above
three Foreign Men of War into the
Harbour.</p>
            <p>The next Night, at two or three a-clock,
the <hi>Sun of Africa,</hi> which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
ſtill at the Mouth of the River,
got looſe from Anchor; and foraſmuch
as the Current drove her on the abovemention'd
Shelf of Rocks, ſo that ſhe
could not be ſtay'd by any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chors,
ſhe diſcharg'd ſeveral Cannon-ſhot,
and made Fires upon all the Maſts,
as a Signal to get Succour: Whereupon
we ſent our Shallop, which got her off
from that place, where ſhe would have
been inevitably loſt without their Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
This Ship ſet ſail the ſame Day
for <hi>La Iſla Grande,</hi> which is twenty
Leagues diſtant from thence; and the
Pink caſt Anchor in a ſmall Bay at the
Mouth of the River, where ſhe waited
till the <hi>Corvette</hi> came up to enter. M.
<hi>de Gennes</hi> made a Complaint to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106963:42"/>
of the Inſult that was offer'd
us at our Entrance, and that the King's
Ships were baſely left in danger: He
excus'd himſelf upon account that the
People were ready to make an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
that it was none of his Fault
that we did not enter at firſt; and that
for the future he wou'd ſerve us as far
as it lay in his power.</p>
            <p>On the 4th. Inſtant,<note place="margin">The ſick Men ſet on Shore.</note> we ſet our ſick
Men a-ſhore in a ſmall Village that
fronts the Town on the other ſide the

            <p>On the 5th. The Governour ſent us a

within a quarter of a League of the

they refus'd to return us an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

            <p>On the 15th. a Veſſel enter'd which
came from the Bay of <hi>All-Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 17th. and 18th. two other

            <p>We continu'd till the 27th. Inſtant in

whoſe Liberty they are not willing to

retrench, as being the Natives of the
Country. Their Slaves for the moſt
part manage all their Houſhold-Affairs,
which renders them ſo diſſolute and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feminate,
that they will not vouchſafe
to ſtoop to take up a Pin themſelves,
for which they have occaſion. Luxury
is ſo predominant among them, that not
only the Burghers, but even the Monks
may have to do with common Harlots,
without fearing the Cenſures or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
of the People, who have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great Reſpect for them. Uncleanneſs
is not the only Vice peculiar to theſe
lewd Monks: They live in groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

            <p>I cannot forbear relating a ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
which happen'd to a young Man
of our Squadron,<note place="margin">A notable Adventure.</note> who fell out with one
of the Inhabitants, and was oblig'd to
draw his Sword in his own Defence;
but perceiving himſelf alone, and preſs'd
with a great number of <hi>Portugueſes,</hi> he
thought fit to retire, and ſeeing the Door
of the <hi>Carmelite</hi>'s Monaſtery open'd, he
made bold to enter, not doubting but to
meet with a ſure Sanctuary in that Place;
but he ſoon found the contrary, for one
of theſe charitable Monks immediately
ſtruck him on the Head with a Hanger,
the Marks of which Wound will always
appear during his whole Life-time: Then
many others ruſh'd in, and beat him
with Cudgels, and at laſt put him again
into the Hands of the Inhabitants, who
had Compaſſion on him, and deteſted
the barbarous Proceedings of the Monks.
The Reflections I have made on theſe
counterfeit Monks, ought not to give

            <p>The Country lying about this River
affords good Paſture,<note place="margin">Sugar Canes.</note> bringing forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of Tobacco and Canes, of
which the fineſt Sugar is made; and
alſo a kind of very ſtrong Brandy,
which we call <hi>Guildive.</hi> The latter
comes of Slips, are full of Knots, that
put forth Leaves like thoſe of Reeds,
and grow on Ridges as Corn: Theſe
Canes when gather'd, are carry'd to
the Mill to be ground, and the Juice
that they yield runs through ſeveral
Pipes into the Cauldrons, where the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
is made and refin'd, almoſt after the

Theſe Roots, which ſerve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead

               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:106963:45"/>
are as thick and long as Carrots:
They are uſually grated with Raſps made
for that purpoſe, and Meal is made of 'em
after having ſqueez'd out all their Juice,
which is the rankeſt Poyſon in the World,
and which they take care to drain off
into Places under-ground, leſt the Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
ſhou'd drink it. The moſt part of
the <hi>Portugueſes</hi> feed on this Meal, ſuch
as it is; and others make of it a kind
of ſmall Cakes, which they bake on I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron-Plates
appropriated to that uſe.
There is abundance of Fruit and Pulſe
in thoſe parts: Cabbiges, Onions, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuces,
Purcelain, Melons, Water-Melons,
Goads, Grapes, and many other Fruits
that we have in <hi>Europe,</hi> thrive there,
and come to perfection: But the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Fruits of the Country are Oranges,
<hi>Banana's, Ananas's,</hi> Potato's, <hi>Ighname's,
Coco's, Goyaves,</hi> and many others, of
which they make very good Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ananas</hi> grows like an Artichoak,
and reſembles a large Pine-Apple: Its
Leaves are long, thick, and arm'd with
ſmall Prickles. It bears a Crown of the
ſame Leaves, and may be eſteemed as
the beſt Fruit in the whole Continent of
<hi>America.</hi>

               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:106963:46"/>
The Potato and <hi>Ighname,</hi> are Roots
very like the <hi>Toupinambous;</hi> The former
is of the taſte of a Cheſnut, and is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
eaten broil'd or roaſted in Embers.
The <hi>Ighname</hi> is ſomewhat inſipid, but
much more wholſome and larger than
the Potato, but both theſe ſorts of
Roots are of ſingular uſe to make very
ſavory Pottage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Coco</hi> grows upon a Tree which is
much like a Palm-Tree: This Fruit is
very large, and has nothing but what
may be apply'd to ſome Uſe: It is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with a kind of Tow, which may
ſerve to caulk Veſſels, better than Hemp:
This Tow being taken off, we meet
with a large hard Nut, of an Oval Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure;
of which Cups and other Toys of
the like nature are uſually made, that bear
the Name of <hi>Coco's.</hi> This Nut contains
a white Kernel, of the Taſte of a Hazel
Nut, lying round about of the thickneſs
of one's Finger: Laſtly, the Middle is
fill'd with a cool Liquor reſembling thin
Milk, about the Quantity of a large
Glaſs-full; inſomuch that this Fruit alone
may ſerve for a Man's Suſtenance: And
indeed the moſt part of the <hi>Indians</hi> do
not trouble themſelves about providing
any Victuals, when they know that they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:106963:46"/>
ſhall meet with Coco-Trees in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
through which they are to paſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Goyave</hi> is ſomewhat bigger than a
Nut: Its Pulp is red, very ſtony, and
of the Taſte of a Peach. The Tree
that bears this Fruit reſembles our Plum-Trees.</p>
            <p>There are alſo numerous Herds of
Oxen, Hogs, and Sheep, with variety
of Game, and ſeveral ſorts of Fowl, but

            <p>On the 13th. at break of Day, we

Coaſt ariſes delightfully, and begins to

good freſh Water, but not without ſome

Notwithſtanding the exceſſive Cold, they

There are ſpacious Plains round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,

            <p>On the 6th. we weigh'd Anchor, and
doubl'd the Capes <hi>Froward</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
where we felt, as at other times, very

Leagues below Port <hi>Gallant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 8th. a high Wind aroſe, which

            <p>On the 9th. at Noon, the Winds
were as favourable as could be wiſh'd
for; yet we could not take the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
by reaſon that we were oblig'd to
wait for the <hi>Sun of Africa,</hi> which did
not appear till the next Morning at

The Winds continu'd contrary to us,
till the 20th. Inſtant, being very ſharp,
and there fell abundance of Rain, Hail,
and Snow, with which the Mountains
are cover'd during the whole Year. We
took in freſh Water and Wood, and ſaw
a great number of Whales.</p>
            <p>On the 20th.<note place="margin">The Rode of Port <hi>Gallant.</hi>
               </note> we ſet ſail with a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Wind, but it ſoon return'd to
its wonted Career, and we could only
make the Road of Port <hi>Galant,</hi> where
we continu'd fifteen Days longer, with
cold Winds, a great deal of Rain
and Snow. This Road is large, and
ſhelter'd from the Eaſtern Winds. The
Situation of the Harbour is pleaſant and
very commodious, two ſmall Rivers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

the fineſt Shells in the World, with va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Fowl, <hi>viz.</hi> Larks, Thruſhes,
Ducks, and abundance of Sea-Pies. We
often heard the Cries of the Savages
in the Mountains, but could not ſee
them.</p>
            <p>Foraſmuch as our Proviſions began to
fail, the Seaſon being already very far
advanc'd, and there was no longer any
hopes to meet with favourable Winds
to convey us into the Southern Sea; we
held a Council on the 3d. Day of <hi>April,</hi>

               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:106963:62"/>

did not change within the ſpace of two
Days, we ſhould return to <hi>La Iſla Grande,</hi>
to take in Proviſions, in order to ſeek
our Fortunes elſewhere. It may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
imagin'd in ſo lamentable a Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
how great a Mortification this
Diſappointment was to Perſons, who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to make their Fortune by ſo noble

of the whole Squadron who did
not chooſe rather to periſh with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
than to be diverted from the right
Courſe; And indeed they were already
accuſtom'd to eat Rats, and paid fifteen
Pence a-piece for them. Altho' we were
not ſo happy as to ſee thoſe fortunate
Coaſts of <hi>Peru,</hi> from whence we are
ſupply'd with what is generally eſteem'd,
moſt precious; nevertheleſs I am apt to
believe, that a particular Account of

            <p>In the Year 1686.<note place="margin">The Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Voyage.</note> certain Free-boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> who are well known

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:106963:62"/>
took a Reſolution to paſs to thoſe of
the Southern-Sea, which they know to
be much more Rich, and leſs fortify'd.
There were two Paſſages which lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
into thoſe Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> one along the
Coaſt, and the other by the Streight
of <hi>Magellan:</hi> The former, as the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,

where they ſoon became formidable by
the frequent Deſcents they made in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Places, and by the great number
of Ships richly laden, which they took:
However, notwithſtanding theſe Prizes,
they made but little Booty, as well by
reaſon of the irregular Conduct of their
ill-diſciplin'd Company, as in regard that
the Merchandizes were too comberſome

            <p>All the Free-Booters being come back

any longer to undergo the Hardſhips of

with good Memoires concerning their
Adventures. One of them nam'd <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certy,</hi>
made Application to Mouſieur
<hi>de Gennes,</hi> whom he knew to be
a Man very fit for the Management of
great Undertakings, inſomuch that the

<hi>Paris,</hi> to repreſent to the Court the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
that might ariſe from ſuch a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106963:64"/>
Voyage, proffering his Service to carry
on ſo noble an Enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Propoſals made by M. <hi>de Gennes</hi>
were receiv'd with all the approbation,
that could be wiſh'd for; the King ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
him with Ships at his own choice,
and the Project was ſo well approv'd of,
upon account of its Novelty, that divers
Perſons of the higheſt Quality readily
contributed to the equipping of our Fleet.
A great number of Young Men, who
were equally excited by Curioſity to ſee
ſuch fine Countries; and by the hopes
of getting an opportunity to make their
Fortune, earneſtly deſir'd to be admitted
into the Company: However it ſeems,
we did not go on ſucceſsfully in all
Points, ſince our Deſign at laſt prov'd
abortive: But 'tis to be hop'd, that the
Court will not diſcourage an Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of ſo great Importance, which fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only by reaſon of the ſmall Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we then had of the Seaſon of the
Winds. 'Tis well known, that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
are not in a Condition to make
War with us; that by the means of the
vaſt Treaſures which they gather daily
out of <hi>New-Spain</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> they have
actually made themſelves Maſters of thoſe
Countries, by ſpilling the Blood of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106963:64"/>
vaſt multitude of poor <hi>Indians,</hi> who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſought for an amicable Correſpondence
with thoſe haughty Invaders, who to
ſtrike a greater Terror into their Minds,
gave it out, that they were deſcended of
the Gods. Beſides all the Tortures which
they could deviſe for the deſtroying of
thoſe miſerable Wretches, they carried
on their Cruelty ſo far, as to aſſaſſinate
and ſell them for the Slaughter, for the
Maintenance of their Attendants. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
there are many <hi>Frenchmen</hi> who can
teſtifie, that the Coaſts of <hi>Peru</hi> are ſtill co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
with the Skeletons of thoſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Victims, whoſe Blood cries to Heaven
for Vengeance, and for the Liberty of
their native Country; inſomuch that
nothing can prevent the Deſtruction of
thoſe Enemies of God and Nature, who
under the Name of Chriſtians, revive
Idolatry, and live in the midſt of their
Treaſure, in a Luxury that even ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes
that of brute Beaſts. I might
enlarge on this Subject, but that 'tis
more expedient to reſume our former

of our Misfortunes.</p>
            <p>On the 5th. Inſtant, the Winds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

determin'd two Days before. But we

chang'd as it were on purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive

Attempt, which was not only
fruitleſs, but wou'd have certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
our Ruine, if we had not been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
protected by Divine Providence
in a very extraordinary manner. We
had not made a League, when theſe
favourable Winds terminated in a great
Calm, and the Tides (the Courſe of
which we cou'd not diſcern from Cape
<hi>Froward</hi>) drove us on the Coaſts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
that four Shallops were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to get us clear of the Shore. We
let fall a large Anchor, which very
much abated the force of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
but could not hinder us from run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
a-float, by reaſon that the bottom
not being firm, cou'd not hold it. We
might have leapt off from the Poop a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore,
and judg'd the Danger to be
unavoidable,<note place="margin">Apparent Danger.</note> when a gentle Breeze hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
blew freſh from the North, and
ſet us at Liberty; whereas if any other
Wind had aroſe, we had certainly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd.
In the mean while, the <hi>Sun of
Africa</hi> and the <hi>Glutton</hi> Frigate were very
near running the ſame Hazard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:106963:65"/>
We lay before the Cape during the
whole Night, and at break of Day, we
ſet ſail again, but the Winds being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
we were forc'd to ſpend the next
Night in the like manner, before Cape
<hi>Froward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 7th.<note place="margin">They ſtand in for the Northern Sea.</note> at break of Day, the
Winds blowing freſh again from the
North-Eaſt, we made our laſt Effort,
and doubl'd Cape <hi>Froward,</hi> but to no
purpoſe. However we did not forbear
to put out to Sea, and on the 11th.
at ſix a-clock in the Evening, having
paſs'd between <hi>Terra de Fuogo</hi> and the
Shelves that lie at the Mouth of the
Streight, we re-enter'd the Northern Sea,
and ſteer'd our Courſe directly for <hi>La
Iſla Grande.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 16th. at break of Day, we
were ſeparated from the <hi>Sun of Africa</hi>
and the <hi>Seditious</hi> Frigat, by the means
of a great Fog, which hinder'd 'em from
hearing the Signals that we gave to tack
about.</p>
            <p>On the 17th. and 18th. we had foul
Weather, and the Sea ran very high.</p>
            <p>On the 26th. the Weather was very
foggy, and the Winds were ſo boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
that we were oblig'd to take
down the Mizzen-Maſt: The Waves
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:106963:66"/>
ſwell'd extremely, and we were beſet
on all ſides as it were with Mountains
of foaming Billows; inſomuch that in
the Evening we loſt one of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
who fell into the Sea, as he
was coming down from the Top-Maſt.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. our Pilots ſail'd a-croſs
the River <hi>de la Plata,</hi> at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of 60 Leagues from the Land,
and on the 29th. we had a great deal of
foul Weather.</p>
            <p>The Winds were very favourable to
us,<note place="margin">May 1696</note> till the 9th. of the next Month;
but we did not take a provident Care
to ſail along the Coaſts, which we
could not diſcover till within 20 Leagues
to the North of the Iſlands of St. <hi>Ann.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 12th. we caſt Anchor in a
Road very full of Fiſh, where we
took a great quantity of fine ones,
and among others, divers Sea-Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines,<note place="margin">Sea-Porcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines.</note>

which they prick up when purſued by
other Fiſhes.</p>
            <p>On the 13th. at nine a-clock in the
Evening, we made ready to ſet Sail;
but on the 14th. and 15th. the Winds
were very variable.</p>
            <p>

On the 16th. we diſcover'd Cape
<hi>Frie,</hi> but were not able to double it,
becauſe there was very little Wind
ſtirring. About eight a-clock in the
Evening, the Sky being very ſerene,
we diſcern'd the Moon to be in an
Eclipſe, that continu'd almoſt for the
ſpace of two Hours, and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was not foreſeen by us, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
that we did not meet with any
Almanacks in the Straight of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi>
where the Inhabitants, although
great Star-gazers, do not reap the
Fruits of their Obſervations. About
two a-clock in the Morning, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcry'd
a Veſſel under the Wind, and
ſome gave it out that there were
two: Whereupon we prepar'd our Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries,
and kept the Weather-gage du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the whole Night. At break of
Day, we perceiv'd it to be a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
Bark, which a Storm had dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
from the Mouth of the River
<hi>Janëiro:</hi> The Mariners belonging to
this. Veſſel inform'd us, that the Fleet
was arriv'd, and that the Governor was
chang'd, but that he heard no News
of our Ships. We freely beſtow'd on
them two Barrels of Water, of which
they were deſtitute two Days, and were
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:106963:68"/>
not able to make Land, to take in any.</p>
            <p>On the 19th. we doubl'd Cape <hi>Frie,</hi>
and on the 20th. we caſt Anchor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſeven Leagues of <hi>Rio-Janeiro;</hi> but
we had not ſo much as one blaſt of
Wind, and the Currents were contrary.
There we ſaw Two of thoſe Pillars of
Water that ariſe out of the Sea, and
which are commonly call'd <hi>Spouts:</hi>
When they draw near, 'tis cuſtomary
to diſcharge ſeveral Cannon-ſhot, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſe
them, and by that means the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
is often eſcap'd.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt. we put out to Sea,
and the next Day we caſt Anchor,
within two Leagues of the Coaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Mouth of the River, but we
determin'd not to enter it, by reaſon
that our Place of Meeting was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be at <hi>La Iſla Grande.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 24th. we prepar'd to ſet Sail
again, when the Rocks cut our Cable,
and ſav'd us the trouble of weighing
Anchor; and ſo little Wind was ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in the Night, that at break of Day
we found our ſelves driven by the
Currents under Cape <hi>Frie,</hi> which made
us take a Reſolution to ſtand in for
the Iſlands of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> to wait for a
fair Wind, as alſo to take in freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106963:68"/>
and Proviſions, of which we had a
very ſhort Allowance. Thus we caſt
Anchor on the 26th. Inſtant at Noon,
and found the Iſland as full of Fowl as
at our firſt Arrival.</p>
            <p>On the 27th. we ſent our Boat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore
to take in Proviſions, and to get
Information about our Veſſels: We
purchas'd ſix Oxen, two Hoggs, and
ſome Pullets, but not without a great
deal of Difficulty, by reaſon that all the
Proviſions were tranſported to <hi>Rio Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiro,</hi>
for the uſe of the Fleet: We
were alſo inform'd, that our Ships
had enter'd that River twenty Days
ago.</p>
            <p>On the 29th. at five a-clock in the
Evening, we ſet Sail with a favourable
Wind, and order'd the Pink to carry
the Lanthorn: We follow'd her for
ſome time, but foraſmuch as ſhe ſail'd
too near the Coaſt, and the Night was
dark, we left her to continue her Courſe,
and ſtood ſomewhat farther out to Sea.</p>
            <p>On the 30th. at break of Day, we
weather'd Cape <hi>Frie,</hi> and found the
Winds and Currents contrary as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
At the ſame time, we diſcern'd
the Pink four large Leagues to the
Windward of us; nevertheleſs (as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106963:69"/>
we were afterwards inform'd) ſhe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd
at Sea eight Days longer, before
ſhe could find means to enter the
River.</p>
            <p>The reſt of that Day, and the next,
we had but little Wind, and that too
was contrary; inſomuch that after di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
fruitleſs Attempts, Monſieur <hi>de
Gennes</hi> judg'd, that for the future we
ought not to be obſtinately reſolv'd
to purſue our intended Courſe, leſt we
ſhould be reduc'd to the greateſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;
but that 'twas more expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to ſtand in for the Bay of <hi>All-Saints;</hi>
ſince by ſailing thither, we
ſhould get ſo far onward in our Way,
and we ſhould certainly meet with
plenty of Proviſions in that Place.</p>
            <p>Therefore we caſt Anchor <hi>June</hi> the
firſt,<note place="margin">June 1696</note> at Four a-clock in the Evening,
before the Iſlands of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> to get
ſome Recruits, having on board Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals
ſufficient only to ſerve for eight
Days at moſt; and foraſmuch as it was
requiſite to give notice to our Veſſels
of the Courſe that we had determin'd
to ſteer, we ſent an Officer a-ſhore to
deſire a Paſſ-port of the Commander of
the Town, to go to <hi>Rio-Janeiro</hi> by Land,
to acquaint them with our Deſign:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106963:69"/>
the Officer who had received Orders to
return the ſame Evening, not appearing
by next Day Noon; Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi>
believing ſome Misfortune had befallen
him, ſent out a Shallop armed with
two ſmall Guns, to get Intelligence,
which return'd to us again about Five
in the Evening: And the Men reported,
That they had ſeen the Canoe in the
River, where there were Dwelling-places;
and that the Officer who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
on Shoar, came up to the point
of Land there, in Order to give them
Notice to return, becauſe it was ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Water, and that he had paſſed over
a Ridge of Rocks where the Surge of
the Sea was very frightful; and that
this was the Reaſon, together with his
tarrying for three Beefs they were
in queſt of for us, that detained our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe
from returning to us.</p>
            <p>The Shallop went back next Day,
about ten of the Clock, and as ſhe was
ready to enter in, the Officer who had
ſent her back the Day before, gave
them a Signal to come to an Anchor,
and to wait till the Tide came in. They
continued in that Poſture till two a
Clock in the Afternoon; when the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer
that commanded, grown quite
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106963:70"/>
weary with ſtaying, made uſe both of
his Sails and Oars, and put forwards;
and that in ſpight of the Advice of the
Maſter, and of all the Signals that
could be made from the Shoar to the
contrary: But he was no ſooner incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moded
with the terrible Rocks afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned,
than that he began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
(tho' it was now too late) of his
Raſhneſs. After they had bore divers
rude Attacks of the Sea, a Wave brought
all their Oars on one ſide, and this Wave
was followed by another, that opened the
Shallop in the very middle, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Commander,<note place="margin">The Shallop loſt.</note> with ſeven Seamen
more; but the Maſter, together with
the Gunner and ſeven other Mariners,
ſaved themſelves, and remained on
Shoar to ſeek out their Comrades Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
            <p>That ſame Evening our Canoe came
to inform us of this ſorrowful News;
and withal, that it was impoſſible for
us to paſs over the Territories of the
<hi>Portugueſe</hi> to go to <hi>Rio-Janeiro,</hi> becauſe
the Governour had given Orders at <hi>Cape
de Frie,</hi> to ſuffer no Stranger to paſs that
way. She brought us three Beefs, ſome
Poultry, a Tyger-Cat, and another
very ſtrange Animal, whom the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>

Trees that he may come at the Fruit

            <p>On the 4th we ſung Maſs for the
dead, and diſcharged three Pieces of
Cannon for the Officer that had been
drowned, whoſe Name was <hi>Salior,</hi> born
at <hi>Paris,</hi> and a young Gentleman whoſe
Loſs deſerved to be regretted. This
being over, the Canoe was ſent to ſhoar
again, to bring back thoſe Seamen that
had the Luck to eſcape drowning; ſhe
returned the ſame Day, and brought
along with her two Beefs more: The
Bodies of our drowned Friends could
not be found, and the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
us that the Place where they
were loſt were full of <hi>Requins,</hi> it's not
to be doubted but they were devoured
by them.</p>
            <p>Next Day, which was the ſixth,
about three in the Morning, we made
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106963:72"/>
ready to ſail for the Bay of <hi>All-Saints,</hi>
without giving Information of the ſame
to the other Veſſels we had with us;
but ſeeing Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi> had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of it before at <hi>la Gloutonne,</hi> we had
ſome ſort of reaſon to hope that they
would rejoin us, at leaſt at <hi>Cayenne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 7th and 8th we ſteer'd a
wide Courſe, that we might put by the
<hi>Abralhes,</hi> which are certain Iſlands and
heaps of Rocks that run out five and
forty Leagues into the Sea, and on
which divers Ships have periſhed. The
<hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who are well acquainted
with them, make no great Difficulty
of ſailing through the midſt of them;
and ſo ſave a large Compaſs that others
are oblig'd to make, to avoid them.
We ſaw a great Whale the Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
that went round our Ship ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times, and twice under it.</p>
            <p>We were on the 10th, 11th, and 12th.
troubled with exceſſive Heats, and had
but very little Wind; at what time
we catch'd a great Number of <hi>Requins,</hi>
which was a conſiderable help to leng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
out our Proviſions: But tho' this
Fiſh appears to be firm Fleſh enough,
yet it is ſo inſipid that ſeveral of our
Men were injured with the eating of it.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106963:72"/>
It's thick, and five or ſix Foot long,
a great Lover of Man's Fleſh, has a
large Mouth, and therein five rows of
very ſharp Teeth: He turns himſelf
upon his back to catch his Prey, and
has two or three ſmall Fiſhes near him
that are his Pilots, and never forſake
him, but ſerve to ſecure him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſurprized by the Whale.</p>
            <p>There is a ſort of Fiſh which they
call <hi>Sucet,</hi> that is commonly faſtened
to the <hi>Requin,</hi> and this has given many
Men occaſion to believe that he is his
Pilot; but herein they are miſtaken,
for this ſmall Fiſh never cloſes with
the other, but when he finds himſelf
purſued; and then taking half a turn
round, he ſtrikes the <hi>Requin</hi> over the
Head, and fixes himſelf ſo faſt to the
other, that it's impoſſible for him
to make him let go his hold; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much,
that this little Fiſh makes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be convoyed with this pretty ſort
of Guard whitherſoever he pleaſes: On
the three following Days, <hi>viz.</hi> the 13th,
14th, and 15th, we were incommoded
with contrary Winds; but on the 17th
we kept about fifteen Leagues off of
the <hi>Abralhes</hi> and ſailed on, and next Day
paſſed over the Shallows of St. <hi>Antony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106963:73"/>
We made Land the <hi>Nineteenth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Courſe of the Sun on the Coaſt of <hi>Braſil.</hi>
               </note> which
our Pilots computed at above thirty
Leagues diſtance; and this made us
judge, That the Sea Currents moved
to the North, as the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> had
aſſured us, who take it for a Maxim,
that the Currents on the Coaſt of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil</hi>
follow the Courſe of the Sun; that
when the ſame is in the Northern He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere,
they run to the Northward,
but when in the Southern, to the
Southward. On the <hi>Nineteenth</hi> at
Night, having got within ſix Leagues
of Cape St. <hi>Antony,</hi> we brought to,
and by break of Day, we ſaw about
two Leagues to the Windward of us, a
Ship that ſteered the ſame Courſe as
we did; whereupon we ſlackned our
ſail to let her come up, and believing
it might have been one of our own
Fleet, we gave her a Signal whereby to
know us, but ſhe returned us no Anſwer,
and proved to be a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Ship, that
was making the beſt of her way for the
Bay of <hi>All-Saints</hi> as well as we: About
Noon we made the Cape of St. <hi>Antony,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cape St. <hi>Antony.</hi>
               </note>
and ſaw all along the Coaſt a great
Number of Barks, and the Negro's Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries,
as they are called, being no
other than three or four pieces of Wood
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106963:73"/>
made faſt together, whereon two Men
go out a fiſhing to the extent of two
Leagues: Some of them we boarded,
but we could never bring them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
us to the Road, they alledging,
they were forbid to do it; but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it was becauſe they would not
leave their fiſhing.</p>
            <p>But it fortunately happen'd, that we
deſcry'd two ſorts of ſmall Tartanes,
that were for making the beſt of their
way into the Bay as well as we; them
we waited for, and required them to
grant us a Pilot for our Money; upon
which, one of the Maſters of theſe
Tartanes, offered himſelf to conduct us
to the Place where we were to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
and this he performed with all
imaginable Civility: We drew up in
Order, within Cannon Shot of Cape
St. <hi>Antony,</hi> and about five in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
caſt Anchor within a ſmall League
of the Town, that we might not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs
our ſelves with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Fleet we found there, conſiſting of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
forty and fifty Sail, all laden
and ready every minute to ſail away.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as we were come to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor,
there came a Lieutenant from the
Admiral, to require us to ſalute him;
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:106963:74"/>
but Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi> made him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
the King had given him Orders
not to ſalute any, without they received
Gun for Gun; and that he would ſend
his next Captain, to ſettle that Affair
with the Governour: The Lieutenant
hereupon, ſent to ſee for his Shallop,
in order to aſſiſt us; and after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
tenders of his Service to us, he
accompanied the Chevalier <hi>de Fontenay</hi>
to wait upon the Governour, with
whom he had no long Diſpute, for they
quickly agreed not to ſalute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at all, which made moſt of the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
to murmur, and concernedly to
ſay, That it was not to be endured,
that a <hi>Frenchman</hi> ſhould paſs under
their Forts without ſaluting them, and
yet not be called to an Account for it:
But 'tis well known, they are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
brave than upon their own Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills;
and that they had rather, upon
Occaſion, have Recourſe to their Beads
than to their Courage.</p>
            <p>The Morrow being <hi>The Feaſt of God,</hi>
Monſieur <hi>de Gennes,</hi> accompanied with
ſeveral other Officers, went to wait
upon the Governour and the Intendant,
who ſhew'd him abundance of Civilities:
The Governour's Name was <hi>Don John

de Lancaſtre,</hi> one of the Principal Men
of the Kingdom, and Vice-Roy of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil:</hi>
Then they went to ſee the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
of the Holy Sacrament,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Holy Sacrament.</note> which
is as remarkable in that Town, for the
vaſt Number of Croſſes, Shrines, rich

Ceremony. The Proceſſion was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

were received by ſome Fathers of the
<hi>French</hi> Nation very kindly, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto them the Loſs of <hi>Namur,</hi>
and the Hopes there were of a Peace
with <hi>Savoy;</hi> from them they went to
dine with the <hi>French</hi> Conſul, and heard
a great deal more News there alſo.</p>
            <p>We were alſo informed by a Friar
newly come from <hi>Goa,</hi>
               <note place="margin">News from <hi>Goa.</hi>
               </note> that before he had
left that Port, he had ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Ship
that put in there, after having fought
three <hi>Arabian</hi> Veſſels, by whom ſhe had
been very rudely handled. When theſe
miſchievous Pirates board any Ship,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106963:75"/>
they do, in order to blind their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
make uſe of a ſort of wrought
Lime, which being ſquaſhed down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Bridge they uſe upon that Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
has a moſt terrible Effect.</p>
            <p>Here we came to know alſo of the
Loſs of the Famous <hi>Montauban,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Montau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban <hi>Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck'd.</hi>
               </note> of whom
the Free-booters made ſo much Noiſe
at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi> He met with a large
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi>
whom he boarded, and took her by
main Force; but the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
being enraged that he ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by a Free-booter, he ſet the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
on fire, and blew up his own Ship
and that of <hi>Montauban</hi>'s; who with a
dozen or fifteen of his own Men, threw
himſelf into the Sea, where they floated
upon Maſts for five Days and five
Nights, and at laſt got a-ſhoar half dead
in the King of the Negro's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where they were kindly received,
upon the account of an old <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
that Traded upon that Coaſt, and who
took Compaſſion on thoſe miſerable
Wretches: When they had been there
about five or ſix Months, a <hi>Dutch</hi> Ship
bound for <hi>Jamaica</hi> paſſed by that way,
which took <hi>Montauban</hi> and ſeven or
eight of his Followers, who promiſed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:106963:75"/>
to pay for their Paſſage, on board him;
while the other ſix, who could not find
the ſame Favour at the <hi>Dutch</hi>-man's
hands, got a Paſſage in a <hi>Portugueſe</hi>
Flute, that carried Negro's to <hi>All-Saints</hi>
Bay, from whence we gave them free
Tranſportation to <hi>Martenico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 4th of <hi>July,</hi>
               <note place="margin">July, 1696</note> the Admiral
with divers Merchant Ships, anchored
in the Road; and on the 8th, the whole
Fleet made ready to ſail away for <hi>Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
conſiſting in all of 45 Ships, laden
with Sugar, Tobacco, Cotton, Fiſh,
Oyl and Skins; they were almoſt all
of them mounted from twelve to thirty
ſix pieces of Cannon, but the Admiral
and Vice-Admiral that were Men of
War, and out upon the King's Account,
carried one of them ſixty Guns, and
the other no leſs than ſeventy two.</p>
            <p>We drew nearer to the City on the
9th, having hitherto taken in no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions;
for the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleet had
made it exceſſive dear, but now we
bought ſome <hi>European</hi> Meal, Magniot,
and Rice; and the Intendant was ſo
civil, as to let us have the Uſe of the
King's Magazine, to provide Salt to ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
our Proviſion with: And that we
might not be wanting in any thing to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:106963:76"/>
our ſelves that was neceſſary; we began
alſo to build us a Shallop inſtead of that
which we had loſt at St. <hi>Anne</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All-Saints</hi> may be reckoned for one of
the largeſt,<note place="margin">A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>All-Saints</hi> Bay.</note> fineſt, and moſt convenient
Bay of any other in the World, being
capable of containing no leſs than two
thouſand Ships; of a very good Depth,
and no Winds to be feared there. They
take a great Number of Whales therein,
build very fine Ships, and they had one
then upon the Stocks that would carry
ſixty pieces of Cannon.</p>
            <p>As for the City of St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> that
is ſeated upon this Bay, it's large, well
built, and very populous; but the Scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it is not ſo advantagious, as
could be wiſhed. It's high and low,
and ſcarce one ſtraight Street therein;
it's the Capital City of <hi>Braſil,</hi> an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopal
See, and the Reſidence of
the Vice-Roy: This place is honoured
with a Soveraign Council, and the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege
to coin Money; where, in order
to quicken Trade, they make ſuch ſort
of Pieces as are current no-where elſe,
but in <hi>Braſil:</hi> They have on the one

            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:106963:76"/>
This City, to the Seaward, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with ſome Forts, and ſeveral
Batteries mounted with Cannon, and
to the Landward, with earthen Baſtions
ill made. We ſaw them lay the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of a Fortreſs, the Governour had
ordered to be erected about half a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
ſhot without the Town: The
<hi>Dutch</hi> attempted divers times to make
themſelves Maſters of this Place, but
without Succeſs, tho' they have taken
away two and twenty Ships from
thence at one clap.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants, to ſay nothing of
the common People, who are inſolent
to the higheſt Degree, are neat, civil,
and honeſt, and withal rich, being lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of Trade, and for the moſt part
are of a Jewiſh Extract; and this is
the Reaſon, that when any one of the
Inhabitants is about to make one of his
Sons a Divine, he is obliged to prove
his Anceſtors were Chriſtians, as the
Knights of <hi>Malta</hi> are under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of making out their Gentility, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they enter into the Order. They
love Women extreamly, and ſpare no
Charges for the ſetting out of their
Wives, who in reſpect to all other
things, have Cauſe enough to complain;
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:106963:77"/>
for they are never allowed to ſee any
Body, and go not out of doors at any
other time but on <hi>Sunday</hi> early in the
Morning, to go to Church: They are
a very jealous People, and 'tis a kind
of a point of Honour for a Man to ſtab
his Wife, when he can convict her
of being unfaithful to his Bed; tho' for
all that, this cannot hinder many of
them from finding out a way to impart
ſome of their Favours to us <hi>Frenchmen,</hi>
whoſe winning and free Converſation
they are mightily in love with.</p>
            <p>As the Town is nothing throughout
but up's and downs, and that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Carriages are very impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
there; their Slaves are forced to
perform what Horſes ſhould otherwiſe
do, and carry the heavieſt ſort of Goods
from one place unto another: And 'tis
alſo for the ſame Reaſon, that a thing
they call a Palanquin is much in uſe
there; it's nothing elſe but a kind of
a Sedan, covered over with a little
embroidered Canopy, and carried by
two Negro's by the help of a long Pole,
whereunto it's faſtned at both ends:
Perſons of Quality are carried therein
to Church, to make their Viſits, and
alſo into the Fields. The Houſes are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:106963:77"/>
high-built, and moſt of them of Free-ſtone
and Brick; their Churches are
very ſumptuous, being finely gilt, full
of Silver-plate, Sculptures, and a vaſt
Number of the beſt Ornaments that are
to be met with: And as for the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral-Church
there, dedicated to the
Croſs, the Lamps and Candleſticks are
ſo high, and maſſy withal, that two
Men can ſcarce carry them.</p>
            <p>They have ſeveral ſorts of Religious
Orders amongſt them; as <hi>Franciſcans,
Carmelites, Benedictines, Jeſuits,</hi> and
divers others, and all of them, except
a little Convent of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian
Capuchins,</hi> are very rich; and more
particularly, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> are very potent
there, they being no leſs than 190 in
Number, their Houſe of a vaſt Extent,
and their Church large and well beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified:
Their Veſtry is one of the moſt
Magnificent that ever was ſeen, it's
about an hundred and fifty Foot long,
and of proportionable Breadth: They
have three Altars in it, two whereof are
placed at the two ends, and the third
in the midſt of that part that joins to
the Church; and upon which may be
ſeen, every Morning, above twenty
Calices, all of them made of Gold, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:106963:78"/>
and Silver; on each ſide of this
laſt Altar ſtand two great Tables, that
are of that length, that there is room
only left for two doors to open, by which
they enter into the Church. Theſe two
Tables are made of very fine Wood,
the whole Surface of them being ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Ivory, a ſort of Net-work,
and a great many fine Water-colour
Paintings, that are brought thither
from <hi>Rome.</hi> The fourth ſide of this
Veſtry, that ſtands to the Seaward, is
pierced with divers large Croſſes from
top to bottom, and the Ceiling very
curiouſly painted.</p>
            <p>The Soyl here is flat or level, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with fine Rivers, on which the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe</hi>
inhabit for above fifty Leagues
into the Country, whoſe Dominion the
<hi>Indians</hi> ſhun, and for that end retire into
the Woods; but they ſteal their Cattle
continually, and eat them themſelves
when they can catch them: Our <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins,</hi>
who (as we have already obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
have a Convent in this City, have
travelled four or five Years among theſe
poor People, and expos'd themſelves
with an Apoſtolical Zeal, to all ſorts of
Fatigues, in order to reduce them from
their Blindneſs and Ignorance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="tcp:106963:78"/>
The Earth produces Sugar-Canes, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
Cotton, Magniot-Roots, Rice,
Maes, and ſuch good Paſturage, that
they breed ſo great a Number of Cattle,
that Meat is ſold there under a Penny
a Pound; but the Country is ſo peſtered
with Ants, that they are conſtrained,
for the preſerving of their Fields of
Maes and Magniot, to carry them to
feed upon the Roads: And thoſe who
are curious in Gardening, muſt, by the
help of ſeveral ſmall Channels, form an
Iſland of every Bed, to drown the Ants
in their Paſſage over. They have Pulſe
and Fruits there in abundance, ſuch as
they call the <hi>Banane, Ananas, Patatoes,
Ighname, Cocoe,</hi> and <hi>Goyave,</hi> of which
we have given a Deſcription already.</p>
            <p>Here they have alſo Cinamon, Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
Ginger, the Oyl of <hi>Capahu,</hi> Balſom,
and ſeveral ſorts of Roots that have a
wonderful Effect; and amongſt the reſt,
thoſe called <hi>Para-ayra-braba,</hi> and <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecovana.</hi>
The Cinnamon-tree is about
the Height of a ſmall Cherry-tree,
bearing long Leaves, and pointed at the
end, of a bright green Colour; the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
were the firſt that brought them
thither out of <hi>Ceylan,</hi> of which they
took great Care: But in ſome Years
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:106963:79"/>
they grew very common, becauſe that
the Birds who eat the Fruit thereof,
ſow the Seed up and down every-where,
being not able to digeſt it. The Plant
which bears the Pepper, clings round
about to other Trees like Ivy, has pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
large Leaves, pointed at the ends,
and of a deep green; and the Fruit it
produces are ſmall Grapes, like thoſe
growing on the wild Vine.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Capahu-Oyle</hi> and the Balſom,
come from the Juriſdiction of <hi>Spiritu
Sancto;</hi> thoſe they draw from certain
Trees, where the wild Beaſts by rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
againſt their Bark, cure themſelves
of their Wounds; for let them take off
never ſo little of them, theſe Liquors
will guſh out, and have ſo much the
more admirable Effect, in that they are
not adulterated, as thoſe we have in
<hi>Europe</hi> are. The <hi>Para-ayra-braba,</hi> is a
thick hard Root, which is made uſe
of as an infallible Remedy againſt all
ſorts of Poyſons: And as for the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecovana</hi>
it's a ſmall Root, that in our
Armies has ſufficiently diſcovered the
Vertues of it againſt the Bloody-flux,
being valued at ten Piſtoles a Pound;
but now it's cheaper, as being more
common.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:106963:79"/>
Among thoſe that are curious, you
ſhall find very large Oranges, that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
were brought from the <hi>Mogul</hi>
Country; according to which they have
their Names, and ſome whereof are
eight Inches Diameter. They have a
ſort of Roſes growing amongſt them,
whoſe Leaves are very like unto thoſe
of <hi>Guimauva,</hi> and the Fruit whereof is
very ſingular, being white from Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
till Noon, and from Noon to
Mid-night again of a red Colour.</p>
            <p>They have abundance of wild Fowl
in that Country, and a great Number
of extraordinary Birds, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the fineſt Parrots in the World;
to which may be added Tygers, Deer,
wild Boars, and ſeveral other Animals
that are unknown to us in <hi>Europe:</hi>
Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi> was preſented with
a very large Tortoiſe, that lived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
eating and drinking the reſt of the
Summer, under one of the Carriages
of our Cannon; and theſe are a ſort
of Animals that will never die till all
their Fat is entirely conſumed.</p>
            <p>We obſerved two ſorts of Monkeys
there, which they diſtinguiſhed by the
Names of <hi>Sagovins</hi> and <hi>Macaques;</hi> the
former are about the Bigneſs of a Squir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:106963:80"/>
ſome of them being of a greyiſh
Colour, but others have a fine Coat,
and of a Golden Hue; they are always
very merry and lightſome, but ſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that the leaſt Cold kills them:
The <hi>Macaques</hi> are larger, and of a
brown Colour, weep continually, and
are no otherwiſe diverting, but that
they will imitate every thing they ſee
you do; and we had one of them that
would make ſome of our Ship-tackle as
well as the Seamen themſelves.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Portugueſe</hi> have already found
ſome Silver Mines there, and lately
Amethiſts alſo; they have Braſs enough
from the Coaſt of <hi>Angola,</hi> from the
Traffick they drive there, upon the
account of the Negro's. But to return,
on the 17th of <hi>July</hi> came in a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
Ship, belonging to the <hi>Guinea-Company,</hi>
lately erected amongſt them,
which carried a white Flag with a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople
or green Croſs in it, and next
Day our three Ships, which we did
not expect to ſee till we came to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne,</hi>
joined us; the <hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Africa</hi>
gave us ſeven Guns, and we returned
her as many; the <hi>Seditious</hi> had loſt her
Fore-round-top, and by them we were
informed that a Fleet of eighteen Sail
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106963:80"/>
were put out of <hi>Rio-Janeiro;</hi> that the
<hi>Felicity</hi> had gone thither, that fifteen
Men had deſerted them, and that Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de la Roque</hi> had two of his Men
killed and an Officer wounded, in a
Deſcent they had made againſt the <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe,</hi>
who detained five or ſix of our
Officers in Priſon, upon account of a
Quarrel that happened, wherein two of
the Inhabitants were left dead upon
the ſpot.</p>
            <p>On the 22d we heard the good <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchin</hi>
Father <hi>Francis</hi> preach; this Man
had ſpent five and twenty Years in
preaching to the <hi>Indians,</hi> and told Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Gennes,</hi> That he had ſeveral
times asked Leave of the General of
his Order, to return for ſome time into
<hi>Europe,</hi> but that he had deſired him to
continue where he was, and not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
that Work he had ſo happily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
upon; And that ſo taking the
Deſires of his Superiour, as a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from him, he ſaid he was ready
to re-enter upon his Miſſion, and had
no farther Thoughts of his Native
Country.</p>
            <p>Having, by the ſixth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. 1696</note> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in our Stores of Water and Wood,
and laid in Proviſion for ſix Months,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106963:81"/>
we prepared for our Departure, and
found the Governour very civil, who
made a Preſent to all the Captains of
ſome <hi>Amethiſts,</hi> and of all ſorts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments;
and the ſeventh Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, we ſailed away, and having
doubled the Cape of St. <hi>Antony,</hi> we
kept our Courſe out at Sea for ſome
Days, that we might ſhun the Coaſt,
which, by reaſon of the Banks of Rocks,
as well as the Storms that are frequent
there, is very dangerous.</p>
            <p>On the 8<hi>th</hi> we deſcry'd two Barks,
that made all the ſail they could to
come up with us, and we ſtaid for
them, as believing they were about to
bring us ſome News, becauſe there was
a Ship put in there the Day before.
But they proved to be Negro's, who
came to deſire us to take them away
with us, or elſe they would commit
themſelves to the mercy of the Waves,
ſooner than they would return again
under the Tyranny of their Maſters;
but we ſent them back, that we might
not give the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of us, that we had taken away
their Slaves:<note place="margin">The miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Negro Slaves.</note> And in truth, theſe ſort
of Wretches are in a very miſerable
State; they are born Slaves, and they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106963:81"/>
are ſcarce able to lift up their hands to
their heads, but they make them work
at tilling the Ground as Oxen do: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
they are ill-fed, and baſtinado'd
for the leaſt Fault: They behold their
Children ſold before their Faces, and
ſometimes their Wives: And this does
affect the greateſt part of thoſe who
have been bred up in the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to that Degree, that they run
away from their Maſters, and chuſe
rather to go and die in the Woods
among the <hi>Indians,</hi> where they meet
with greater Humanity than with the
other: But this they muſt execute with
the greateſt Precaution, for if their
Maſters once catch them, they give
them no Quarter; for they hang a great
Iron Collar about their Necks on each
ſide whereof there are Hooks, whereunto
is faſtened a Stake or Branch of a
Tree, with which they thraſh them at
Pleaſure; and this they repeat ſo often,
that they put them almoſt out of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to follow their Work: But if it
ſo happen, that after this ſort of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement
they relapſe again into the
ſame Fault, they without any more
ado, cut off one of their Legs, nay,
and ſometimes hang them for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:106963:82"/>
of Terrour unto others; and tho'
all this is bad enough, yet the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> treat them ſtill in a
more cruel manner.</p>
            <p>I knew one living in <hi>Martinico,</hi> who
being of a compaſſionate Nature, could
not find in his heart to cut off his
Slave's Leg, who had run away four
or five times, but to the end he might
not again run the riſque of loſing him
altogether, he bethought himſelf of
faſtening a Chain to his Neck, which
trailing down backwards, catches up
his Leg behind, as may be ſeen by the
Cut: And this, in the ſpace of two or
three Years, does ſo contract the Nerves,
that it will be impoſſible for this Slave
to make uſe of his Leg. And thus,
without running the Hazard of this
unhappy Wretch's Death, and without
doing him any Miſchief, he thereby
deprived him of the means to make
his Eſcape.</p>
            <p>On the 17th about ſeven in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we had a ſight of Cape St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi>
which we made at above thirty

to believe that there were great

them, told us, they did not want much
of being ſweet; and this made us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106963:84"/>
that we were come to the Mouth
of the famous River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The River of the <hi>Amazons.</hi>
               </note>
that is ſo rapid as to preſerve the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

the Coaſt till three in the Afternoon,
when we diſcovered a flat, even, and
woody Coaſt, where we anchored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſix in the Evening; and on the
28th and 29th, we followed the ſaid
Coaſt, at three or four Leagues diſtance
from the Shoar, and never found above
five or ſix Fathom Water.</p>
            <p>On the 30th,<note place="margin">Cape of <hi>Orange.</hi>
               </note> about ſeven in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we deſcry'd the Cape of <hi>Orange,</hi>
where we began to ſee the Foot of the
Mountains: About three in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
we doubled a great Rock called
the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> three Leagues out in the
Sea, and five from <hi>Cayenne;</hi> we drew up,
at about half a Cannon ſhot's diſtance,
and about ſix in the Evening came to
an Anchor, three Leagues to the North
of <hi>Cayenne</hi> before five little Iſlands ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
near to that place. When next Day
was come, Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi> ſent an
Officer to complement the Governour,
and to deſire him to ſend us a Pilot to
conduct us to a ſaſe Anchorage; but
our Arrival had already allarm'd the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106963:84"/>
whole Iſland, and they fired off their
Cannon all Night long, to give the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
Notice to come together; and
they would not truſt to our Colours,
becauſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their Paſſage to
<hi>Surinam</hi> and <hi>Barbicha,</hi> have often caſt
Anchor within a League of the Town,
under white Colours; and as they had
not been uſed to ſee four <hi>French</hi> Ships
at one time, they were apprehenſive of
ſome Deſign upon them.</p>
            <p>Our Shallop could not return before
next Day,<note place="margin">Sep. 1696.</note> which happened to be the
firſt of <hi>September,</hi> the ſame being oblig'd
to take a Courſe round the Iſland, for
avoiding the Currents, which are very
violent on that Coaſt; but ſhe brought
a Pilot along, tho' the Sea was ſo ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
that we were forced to tarry where
we were till the Day following: And
then on the ſecond and third, we made as
much uſe of the Tide as poſſibly we could,
in order to get in, becauſe there was ſo
very little Water, and that we could not
make ready before it had half flowed:
But about four in the Evening, we caſt
Anchor under the Cannon of the Town,
within Piſtol-ſhot of Land; there were
two Merchants Ships already in <hi>Cayenne,</hi>
that had waited ſeven or eight Months
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106963:85"/>
for their Cargo, beſides another Veſſel
that came in the Day before us, laden
with Wine and Brandy. As our Men
had, juſt about this time, received a
Month's Pay, and that it was now a
long time ſince they had met with ſo
good an Opportunity, they not only
drank up the Ship's whole Cargo in
eight Days time, but alſo all the Wine
they had in the Iſland.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cayenne</hi> is a <hi>French</hi> Iſland,<note place="margin">The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of <hi>Cayenne.</hi>
               </note> ſcituated on

forty five Minutes North Latitude, and
332 Longitude; it's formed by the
two Arms of a River, and may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
to be about eighteen Leagues in
Circumference; it ſtands high, upon
the Brink of the Sea, and is ſo marſhy
in the middle, that you cannot travel
by Land, from one end to the other;
the Fens of it are covered with a ſort
of large Trees called <hi>Mangles,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</note> which
above all other, have the peculiar Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of growing in Sea-Water; theſe
Trees are ſo thick, and their Roots for

riſe up, and are ſo well interlaced one

ſetting his Foot upon the Ground;
amongſt them alſo divers <hi>Indians</hi> retire
with their Canoes, and there they make
their Carbets.</p>
            <p>The Town ſtands on the Weſt-part
of the Iſland, and is very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſcituated, Nature and Art having
both equally contributed to the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
of it: It's of an irregular Hexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone-Figure, has near ſixty pieces of
Cannon planted upon Batteries, for the
Security of it; and on the Sea-ſide, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an Eminence, there is a Fort built
that commands every way: The Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of the place conſiſts of two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Regular Troops, but there are
above four Hundred Inhabitants living
either upon, or round about the Iſland,
that upon the leaſt Alarm are oblig'd
to ſtand to their Arms. Monſieur <hi>de
Feroles,</hi> the Governour, is a Perſon that
has great Inſight into the Affairs of a
Colony; the Power of diſtributing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
is veſted in him, and he is much
beloved by the Inhabitants: The <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits</hi>
have a Church in the Town, and
a Chappel at the other end of the
Iſland, for the Conveniency of thoſe
that live remote.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:106963:86"/>
This Iſland was formerly very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthy,
as well for the continual Rains
that fell there, for nine Months in the
Year, as becauſe the Ground was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Wood, and withal very
marſhy; Diſeaſes were very rife a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them, and Infants uſually died
almoſt as ſoon as they were born; but
ſince the Iſland has been grubbed up,
they have begun to grow more healthy,
the Women have good Lyings-in, and
their Children are luſty.</p>
            <p>The chief Commodity of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,<note place="margin">Traffick.</note>
is Sugar and <hi>Rocou,</hi> but they make
no great Quantity, becauſe the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
want Slaves to work for them,
and that is the Reaſon that Ships wait
ſometimes for near a Year's time for
their lading: Thoſe Negro's which we
had ſent thither by the Ship called the
<hi>Fertill,</hi> were almoſt all dead before they
got to the Place; for being taken with
a Calm, they wanted both Water and
Victuals: But we having ſtill about
forty on board, we ſold them for five
hundred Livres a Man. The Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
they have from <hi>France,</hi> are Wine,
Brandy, Meal, and powdered Meats;
for Beefs are very rare to be found
there, beſides they are not allowed to
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106963:86"/>
kill any of them without Leave, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
deſirous to let them multiply.</p>
            <p>They carry Iron Tools, and ſmall
Wares alſo thither, for to traffick with
the <hi>Indians:</hi> Four or five Years ſince,
Money was very ſcarce amongſt them;
but the Free-booters who returned from
the Southern-Seas, and the meaneſt of
which had at leaſt two or three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Crowns for his Share, bought
them Habitations here, increaſed the
Colony, and thereby made Money cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
amongſt them. They drive a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Trade in Slaves, dry'd Fiſh,
and <hi>Amacks,</hi> with the <hi>Indians</hi> living upon
the River of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> and by this
Commerce the Colony is very much
enriched; but the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> who for
ſome Years paſt have a mind to ſettle
there, have maſſacred in a moſt cruel
manner thoſe Perſons who before went
thither unmoleſted, and in all manner
of Security. Monſieur <hi>de Feroles</hi> hath
begun a Road which is to go by Land
to this River,<note place="margin">A Road from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne</hi> to the River of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons.</hi>
               </note> and pretends he'll drive
the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> from thence. The ſame
belongs to <hi>France,</hi> and 'tis our Intereſt
to preſerve it, not only upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of our Traffick, but alſo becauſe
there are Silver Mines there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:106963:87"/>
The Earth, beſides Sugar and <hi>Rocou;</hi>
produces Cotton and Indigo, and is
withal very fertil in Maes and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niot;
beſides thoſe Fruits we have ſeen
in <hi>Braſil,</hi> we find growing here,<note place="margin">Fruits.</note> the
<hi>Caſſia, Papaye, Acajou-Apples,</hi> the <hi>Vanilla,
Peet,</hi> and ſeveral others. As for the
<hi>Papaye,</hi> it's a thick Fruit, and taſtes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
like a Cucumber; it grows round
the ſtem of a tall but tender Tree
that has large Leaves, and cleft as your
Vine Leaves are; the Tree it ſelf is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and grows above fifteen Foot in
one Year's time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Acajou-Apple</hi> is thick, long, and
of a yellow-red; has a ſharp Taſte,
and is uſually eaten baked. At the
end of this Apple you have a little green
Nut, that taſtes like a Filbert, and in
form reſembles a Sheeps-kidney: This
Fruit grows upon a tall and round ſort
of a Tree, like unto a Cheſnut-tree,
whoſe Leaves are of the ſame Form
and Colour, as thoſe of the Laurel: The
Wood of it is very fine, and proper to
make Houſhold Furniture of, and <hi>Piro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues</hi>
of forty and fifty Foot long; if a
Line, or ſuch a thing, be once ſpotted
with the Juice of this <hi>Acajou-Apple,</hi>
it's impoſſible to take away the Stain,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106963:87"/>
till the Seaſon of the Fruit be entirely
gone.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Vanilla</hi> is a Plant that creeps up
along other Trees, in the ſame manner as
Ivy does; its Leaves being of a bright
green Colour, thick, long, ſtrait, and
pointed at the ends. About ſeven Years
after it is planted, it begins to hear a
ſort of Husks that are full of an oyly
Matter, and Seed that is ſmaller than
that of Poppy, which they make uſe
of in that Country, to give a good
Scent to Tobacco, and Liquors they
have amongſt them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Peet</hi> is an Herb that can be
peeled in the ſame manner, as Hemp
with us, and whoſe threads are ſtronger
and finer than Silk, the Uſe whereof it
would have long ſince put out of doors,
if ſo be it would have been allowed to
be tranſported to <hi>France. Ebony,</hi> of
a different ſort, <hi>Letter-wood</hi> (as they
call it) and that of <hi>Violet,</hi> with ſeveral
others, are very common in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
To ſay nothing of the Fiſh and
Fowl that we find there in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,
as we do alſo Tygers, Deer,
Pigs, little Porcupines, Camelions,
thoſe Beaſts they call <hi>Agontills</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paions,</hi>
and divers ſorts of Animals more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:106963:88"/>
As for the <hi>Agontill,</hi> it's a Creature of
the ſame Bigneſs with an Hare, of a
reddiſh Colour like unto a Deer, ſharp
Muzzle, ſmall Ears, and ſhort as well
as very ſmall Legs; but the <hi>Sapaion</hi> is
a kind of a little Monkey, of a yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Colour, having large Eyes, a white
Face and black Chin: It's of a low
Stature, but of a lively and careſſing
Nature.</p>
            <p>The Camelion doth ſomewhat reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thoſe ſmall Lizards that creep up
our Walls, whoſe Colour cannot be
agreed on, becauſe they receive it from
every thing they touch: They have
here alſo very large Serpents, but not
very venomous, and ſome of them have
been obſerved to have ſwallowed a
whole Deer at a time.</p>
            <p>As for Birds,<note place="margin">Birds.</note> they have very curious
Parrots in that Country, that will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
learn to ſpeak; from which the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi>
pluck Feathers of divers Colours,
by the help of the Blood of certain creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Animals, with which they rub them.
They have alſo other Birds, called <hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
Ocos, Toucans,</hi> and many ſorts
beſides. The firſt whereof, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Flamands</hi> are Sea-birds, about the Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of an Hen, which flie in Bands as
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106963:88"/>
Ducks, or rather Cranes do; and whoſe
Feathers being of a ſcarlet Colour, the
<hi>Indians</hi> make unto themſelves Crowns
of them: The <hi>Ocos</hi> are as big as the
<hi>Indian</hi> Poultry, black on the Back, but
white breaſted, with a ſhort yellow
Bill, a fierce Gate, and have ſmall friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Feathers ſtanding up like a Cop up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their Heads. And for the <hi>Toucan,</hi>
that is a Bird that hath both black, red,
and yellow Feathers, being very near
as big as a Pidgeon, whoſe Bill is
almoſt as thick as his Body, and of a
very ſingular make, as being all over
nothing but black and white welts or
ſtreaks, like <hi>Ebony</hi> and <hi>Ivory</hi> interlaid;
neither is his Tongue leſs admirable,
being nought but a plain Feather, and
that very ſtreight.</p>
            <p>We ſhall ſay nothing of ſeveral Birds,
who have nothing remarkable in them
beſides their Feathers; and therefore,
we ſhall now proceed to a ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of the Government of <hi>Cayenne,</hi>
which ſome, by reaſon of the Bigneſs of
it, and its Scituation under the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
have called Equinoxial <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Government of <hi>Cayenne</hi> contains
about an hundred Leagues in length,<note place="margin">The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne.</hi>

both on the Eaſt and North; as it has
to the Weſt the River <hi>Marony,</hi> which
ſeparates the ſame from <hi>Surinam,</hi> now
in the hands of the States of <hi>Holland;</hi>
and to the South, the Northern Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary
of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> where the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi>
have already built three Forts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Rivers of <hi>Paron</hi> and <hi>Macaba:</hi>
One may ſee by the Map made of this
Government (which I have taken Care
to correct, according to the Memoirs
of Monſieur <hi>de Feroles,</hi> for to ſend it to
Court) the Road that has been made,
in order to drive them from thence:
This Road begins at the River of <hi>Pei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi>
which falls into that of <hi>Paron,</hi> and
by which they can afterwards go down
in Canoes: Here alſo Obſervations may
be made of the different Nations of the
<hi>Indians</hi> that dwell in thoſe Parts, and
who all of them, tho' intermixt one
with another, ſpeak different Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and are almoſt always ingaged in
War, which is not uſually put an end
to, until they make forty or fifty of
their Enemies Priſoners. We were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> That ſeveral of
theſe Nations were once entred into a
League againſt one another; and that
they were about a Year's Space in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:106963:89"/>
grand Preparation for War, which
after all ended one Night, in their ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
two or three <hi>Carbets,</hi> where they
might burn perhaps about an hundred
Perſons, Men, Women and Children, and
ſo returned home as fierce and vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as if they had made a Conqueſt of
the whole Country.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Indians</hi> are red,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <hi>of</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yenne.</note> of ſhort Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
having black, long, and lank Hair;
they go all naked, unleſs it be their
Privy-parts, which they cover with a
little Cotton-welt, that hangs down by
their Legs: But for the Women, they
uſe a piece of Cloth half a Foot ſquare,
which they call <hi>Camiſa,</hi> and which is
uſually woven after a ſtriped manner,
of divers Colours, and eſpecially white,
which they prefer above any other;
but ſome of them there are, who only
hang a Carrot-leaf at their Girdle: The
Men cut off their Beards, dye their Faces
with <hi>Rocou,</hi> and cover their Arms and
Faces with ſeveral folds of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
ſort of Cloth; they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,
by way of Ornament, wear
Crowns made of Feathers of various
Colours, and bore a hole between their
Noſtrils, where they hang a little piece
of Money, or a large knob of green
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:106963:90"/>
Cryſtal that is brought from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
of <hi>Amazons,</hi> and which they migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
value: But there is particularly one
whole Nation of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> that
make a large hole in the nether Lip,
through which they put a piece of
Wood, whereunto they faſten this
Cryſtal: And as theſe are thus ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
all the other Nations have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
marks of Diſtinction alſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe People are very skilful in Bows
and Arrows, which they make uſe of
as well in fiſhing as fowling: They
work their <hi>Amacks</hi> very curiouſly, and
make very pretty Pots and Baskets,
which they call <hi>Pagara,</hi> and are wrought
in ſuch a manner, that they go one into
another, and cannot be penetrated by
Water: They alſo make uſe of their
<hi>Couis</hi> or <hi>Calabaſſes,</hi> about which they
turn their Ornaments, and varniſh them
with divers Colours, ſo as that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſhall not injure them; but for all
this Skill of theirs, they are very lazy,
and continually lain down, taking no
Care for the Morrow, no, not for their
neceſſary Subſiſtence: And there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but Famine that can draw them
out of their <hi>Amacks.</hi> When they are in
the Country, or waging War, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:106963:90"/>
chance to hear that the Wife lies in,
they return with all ſpeed, bind up their
Heads, and, as if themſelves were in
labour, they lie in their Beds, where
their Neighbours come to comfort them
under their imaginary Illneſs: There
are ſeveral of them live together in
one or more large Cottages, which they
call <hi>Carbets,</hi> over each of which there
is a Captain conſtituted. As for their
Diet, they feed upon that which they
call <hi>Caſſave, Maes,</hi> Fiſh and Fruits;
the Men they live by fiſhing, and 'tis
the Women that till the Ground: They
earry but a ſmall matter of Victuals
along with them, when they go to
War; for they feaſt upon the fatteſt
part of their Priſoners Fleſh, and for
the reſt they ſell them to the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They have divers ſorts of Feaſts
amongſt them, unto which one <hi>Carbet</hi>
invites another; and there they appear
with Crowns on their Heads, and Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-girdles,
and ſpend the Day in
dancing round, and in feaſting, where
they make themſelves drunk with a
ſtrong ſort of Liquor, which they call
<hi>Ovicon,</hi> made of <hi>Caſſave</hi> and Fruit,
boyled together.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:106963:91"/>
Theſe poor People live in miſerable
Ignorance, for they worſhip the Stars,
and are very much afraid of the Devil,
which they call <hi>Piaye,</hi> and who (as
they ſay) comes to Beat and Torment
them: Every one of them hath his
Wife, which they cannot forſake, 'tho
they find them Tardy: Old Men they
highly venerate, and when any of them
die, they bury them in their <hi>Carbets,</hi>
without any other Ceremony than to
make themſelves ſoundly drunk: But
as ſoon as they think the Corps is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
rotten, they dig up the bones, and
burning the ſame to aſhes, they put
it into their <hi>Ovicon,</hi> and this they
eſteem excellent chear; the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> take
a deal of Pains in Inſtructing theſe poor
People, who with much Docility give
ear to the Myſteries of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Faith.</p>
            <p>On the 16th a Fire broke out in the
Houſe of one of the Officers, which was
a great loſs not only to the Owners, but
alſo to ſeveral of the Inhabitants round
the Town, who had their Moveables
there. All theſe Houſes are built of
Wood, and thatched over, which is the
reaſon that Fire takes them ſo faſt that
nothing can be ſaved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:106963:91"/>
On the 25th we made ready for a
cruiſe upon the Coaſt of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> which
Iſland is under the Dominion of the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſend thither above ſix
hundred Ships every Year: It's well
Peopled, and they reckon no leſs than
ſix thouſand Negro-Slaves to be in it,
ſo that without Contradiction it may
be eſteemed the moſt Powerful Colony
of all the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>de Gennes</hi> had ſome thoughts
of going to attack <hi>Surinam,</hi> and for
furthering of his deſign, Monſieur <hi>de
Feroles</hi> made him an offer to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Perſon with part of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon;
but certain <hi>Indians</hi> who do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but go backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to give an Account of what is
done both on the one and the other
ſide, informed us there were two large
<hi>Dutch</hi> Ships there carrying 70 Pieces
of Cannon, that were ready to put out
forthwith, and that ſo we ſhould have
to deal with the Fort and theſe two Ships
at a time; which made us alter our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
and to continue Cruiſing.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of <hi>October,</hi>
               <note place="margin">October, 1696.</note> believing

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:106963:92"/>
And there we Cruiſed to the 16th,
fifty, forty, and thirty Leagues diſtance
from the Shoar, without ſeeing any
thing, and therefore we thought it
adviſable to draw near to the Iſland.</p>
            <p>The 17th the Weather was very
Hazy till five in the Afternoon, when
clearing up all of a ſudden, we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> from which we might
be about five Leagues diſtance: About
an Hour after we deſcryed a Ship; But as
we found ſhe was near the Shoar, and
that it was now Night, we thought
it more Convenient to bear off than to
come up with her.</p>
            <p>On the 18th the Wind being very
ſlack, we found our ſelves ſtill to be at
the ſame diſtance from Shoar, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Noon we gave chaſe under <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Colours to a Carvet that came to
diſcover what we were, but upon her
putting up <hi>French</hi> Colours, and giving
us a Gun as a Signal that ſhe was
really ſuch, we hung out ours alſo, and
gave her the ſame aſſurance. This was
a ſmall Veſſel from <hi>Martinico</hi> called
the <hi>Malovin,</hi> carrying four Guns, and
was manned with five and forty Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caneers,
whoſe Captain came on board
us, and gave us an Account of the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:106963:92"/>
Death of Monſieur <hi>de Blenac,</hi> General
of the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, adding farther
that he had met with our Fleet, and
that there were ſix and twenty Sail
of Ships got into <hi>Barbadoes</hi> about ſix
Weeks before.</p>
            <p>About five in the Evening we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
three Ships near the Shoar,
which the <hi>Malovin</hi> told us was a Man
of War for a Guard-ſhip, that carried
four and fifty Guns, and two ſmall
Frigates of fourteen Guns each, and
that they were come out to hinder
her to take a Merchant Ship, that ſhe
had chaſed to the very mouth of the
Port.</p>
            <p>On the 19th by Break of Day we
diſcovered the ſaid Guard-ſhip followed
by a Skiff about two Leagues off of us:
But as there was but very little Wind
ſtirring, and that ſhe had a great mind
to know what we were, ſhe made uſe
of her Oars to get out, and about three
in the Afternoon ſent her Shallop to
ſee what the <hi>Seditious</hi> was, which was
not above two Cannon-ſhot off, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
five ſhe recalled her, and an Hour
after ſhe ſailed off and made a ſhow of
getting to the Shoar and recovering
land: But we did not think fit to purſue
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:106963:93"/>
her, becauſe we were apprehenſive ſhe
might return, and had a deſign to
ſurprize us: But in ſhort we ſaw her
again at ten at Night within Cannon-ſhot
of us, and ſhe followed us all that
Night long almoſt within Musket-ſhot,
and from time to time fired Rockets as
a Signal for the Shallop to come up, that
had not yet rejoyned her. At break of
Day we came up to her with a good
Wind under <hi>French</hi> Colours, and all
our ſails looſe, but as ſhe had no other
deſign than to ſee what we were, and
not to fight, ſhe gave us no Occaſion
to deſire her to return to Port, which
ſhe did very ſafely, as did alſo the Skiff
and her Shallop, which we diſcharged
ſome ſhot at.</p>
            <p>On the 20th and 21th we bore off to
Sea, and next Day about Noon diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Ship, about three Leagues to
the Windward of us, with which we
came very near up, when the Night
approached and prevented our taking of
her.</p>
            <p>On the 24th we took a ſmall Fly-boat
of forty Tunn,<note place="margin">The taking of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fly-boat.</note> coming from <hi>Virginia,</hi>
laden with Tobacco, Bacon, and Meal
for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and was valued at 10000
Livres; and the <hi>Seditious</hi> the very ſame
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106963:93"/>
Day gave chaſe to another ſmall Ship,
that made her eſcape by the favour of
the Night.</p>
            <p>The 25th and 26th we had a great
deal of bad Weather, on the laſt of
which, about three in the Afternoon
we ſaw a large Ship two Leagues to
the Windward of us, towards which
we bare, and all that Night kept a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Courſe that we might not loſe
her, but all in vain.</p>
            <p>On the 28th we found our ſelves in
ſight of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> from which we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
our ſelves to be five and twenty
Leagues diſtance; we were ſurprized
with our miſtake, and could attribute
the cauſe of it to nothing but the
Currents; but we took this opportunity
to ſend our Fly-boat to <hi>Martinico,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
which ſhe made good ſail by the
help of the Night, and a favourable
Wind.</p>
            <p>We ſpent the reſt of our time to the
fourth of <hi>November,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Novem. 1696.</note> to get thirty or forty
Leagues out to Sea, becauſe the Winds
are always contrary, and that no way
can be made but upon a tack; and on
the ſixth, ſeventh, and eighth we had
very bad weather, and next Day we
were ready to ſail back, when we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:106963:94"/>
a Ship two Leagues off to the
See-ward,<note place="margin">The taking of another Veſſel.</note> which as well as we, was
at the Cape, to ſtay for the weather to
prove better; hereupon we made all the
ſail we could, and in two Hours time
came within Cannon-ſhot of her; ſhe put
out <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours, which we Anſwered
with ours, and at the ſame time gave
her ſome chaſe Guns; ſhe kept Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Retreating, and wounded three of
the <hi>Sun of Africa</hi>'s Men, which was
ready to give her a whole Broadſide
and to ſend her to the Deep, when, to
prevent it, ſhe preſently ſtruck.</p>
            <p>She was a tight Ship, carrying two
and twenty Guns, belonged to <hi>New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and this was her firſt Voyage:
Her lading conſiſted chiefly in Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
for Shipping, and ſome Cod; we
put twenty Men on board her, and
ſteered for <hi>Martinico,</hi> but that Night
it blew very hard, and we were ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the <hi>Seditious</hi> in the ſtorm;
and on the 11th we had ſight of <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does,</hi>
which we left to the North of
us.</p>
            <p>Next Day early in the Morning, we
found our ſelves at two Leagues diſtance
from St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> which we had a deſire
to leave behind us, but the Wind
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:106963:94"/>
took us ſhort: This Iſland is high of
Scituation, covered all over with
Wood, and very remarkable for two
Peaks in it like a Sugar-loaf, that may
be ſeen at twenty Leagues diſtance in
clear Weather: We Coaſted it all Day,
and on the 13th early in the Morning,
we found we were three Leagues from
the <hi>Diamond-Point</hi> of <hi>Martinico;</hi> we
plyed till Evening for to get into the
mouth of <hi>Sack-Royal,</hi> (as they call it)
where we Anchored at five, within
half a League of the Fort, which we
ſaluted with ſeven Pieces of Cannon,
and were anſwered with as many from
thence.</p>
            <p>Next Day the Captain of the Fort
entred us for Careening; we found
four or five Ships there from <hi>Rochel</hi>
and <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and two <hi>Danes</hi> hired by
<hi>French</hi> Merchants for the Voyage, one
of which ſaluted us with five Guns,
which we anſwered with three: We
Anchored about two Spears length
from the <hi>Mead,</hi> where we took out our
firſt Tier, Proviſion, and Utenſils, in
order to cleanſe our Ship.</p>
            <p>We underſtood on the 16th, that
the <hi>Seditious</hi> was come to Fort St. <hi>Peter,</hi>
and that the <hi>Glutton,</hi> laden with Sugar,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106963:95"/>
was ſailed away for <hi>France,</hi> the ſame
Day we were entred for Careening.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> failed not to ſend a Pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et-boat
to fetch away their Priſoners,
with a deſign to diſcover what ſtate
we were in, and the <hi>French</hi> Priſoners
ſhe brought over, told us that the
Guard-ſhip, that had given us Chaſe,
when ſhe underſtood what we were,
not thinking her ſelf ſafe in that Port,
had ſailed away for <hi>Antegoe</hi> to joyn
another Ship of ſixty Guns that cruiſed
about that Iſland: The Packet-boat went
from <hi>Port Royal</hi> to Fort St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners that were in
the Iſland, were delivered up to her,
and ſome of whom the very ſame
Night, they were to ſail for <hi>Barbadoes,</hi>
took away a ſmall Privateer that was
ready to put to Sea, and had but one
Man to look after her; whereupon
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers were preſently
ſeized, and the Packet-boat ſent back
to demand Satisfaction for this Seiſure,
which was contrary to the Law of War.</p>
            <p>On the firſt of <hi>December,</hi>
               <note place="margin">December 1696.</note> tho' we
had not fully embarked all our things
that we had to put a Shoar, we left
the Careening place, to the end we
might put an ſtop to the deſertion of
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:106963:95"/>
our Men, of whom we had already
loſt no leſs than thirty, all of them
brave young Fellows, who ſought for
nothing more than an opportunity to
fight for the honour of their Country,
in order to make their Fortune, or
loſe their Lives, and who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
at their ſufferings now for
two Years together without any hopes
of attaining their Ends: And what is
ſtill more lamentable, there were three
or four of them found ſtarved to
Death on the Mountains about fifteen
Days after.</p>
            <p>From the third at Night to the
fourth we ſet Sail for St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Fort,
where we anchored at five in the
Evening, within Piſtol-ſhot of Land,
and continued there to the thirteenth
to take in Water.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing it is now a long time
ſince we have had any account of the
Iſlands of <hi>America;</hi> and that the face
of things there is much altered ſince
fifteen or twenty Years, I thought it
would not be impertinent to make a
ſhort Deſcription of the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
depends all the reſt that are in our
poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:106963:96"/>
               <hi>Martinico</hi> was at firſt Inhabited by
ſome <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Martinico.</hi>
               </note> who took this,
as was done by all the other Iſlands,
as a place of refuge, and each of them
upon different accounts: They lived
there a long time at Peace with the
<hi>Indians,</hi> who gave them a ſhare of the
<hi>Caſſave</hi> and Fruits that they Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated;
but after the deſcent Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>d' Enambuc</hi> made on St. <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi>
in the Year 1625, thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
put in the head by their Wizards,
that theſe new Gueſts came with an
Intention to deſtroy them, and to take
away their Country, they reſolved to
Maſſacre them; but the <hi>French</hi> diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
the deſign, took all the Caution
imaginable to prevent it.</p>
            <p>In 1626 there was a Company erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, and then they
began to be Peopled, and Ships fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſailed thither, to Trade for
Sugar, for which they paid ready
Money; but after divers petty Wars,
there was a general Peace made with
the <hi>Indians</hi> in 1660, and they had
St. <hi>Vincent</hi> and <hi>Domingo</hi> aſſigned them
to retire to. They continue there to
this Day, and come conſtantly to
Trade with our <hi>French-men,</hi> between
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106963:96"/>
whom and them there is ſo great an
unity, that when they catch the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi>
whom they know to be our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
they Murder and Eat them, and
the <hi>French</hi> themſelves have no power
to bring them to give them Quarter:
The <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> and other Orders ſettled
in theſe Parts, do from time to time
make ſmall Voyages into their Iſlands,
to Inſtruct them in the Principles of
Religion; which they hear with a
great deal of Joy, but reap little Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereby, as being ſtill very tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
of their old Superſtition.</p>
            <p>The <hi>American</hi> Iſlands Company were
of no longer Duration than the Year
1651, when they ſold them to the
Knights of <hi>Malta,</hi> and ſeveral particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Perſons; but now the King is
Maſter of them; where he has erected
Forts, and keeps good Garriſons. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinico</hi>
is the reſidence of the General,
and Soveraign Courts of Judicature;
whereon depends St. <hi>Domingo, Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupa,
Granada, Mary-Galanda,</hi> the <hi>Saints,</hi>
St. <hi>Croſs,</hi> St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> and <hi>Tabago;</hi> of
which they have abandoned the laſt
three. This Iſland is ſcituated in 14
degrees North Latitude; and 315, 25
minutes Longitude, ſtands high, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:106963:97"/>
is fifty five or ſixty Leagues in Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.
It has the conveniency
of three Ports, where you may lade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
an hundred Ships every Year;
and their Names are the <hi>Cul-de-ſac
Royal,</hi> the <hi>Bourg</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and the
<hi>Cul-de-ſac de la Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cul-de-ſac Royal</hi> is a large Bay to
the South of the Iſland,<note place="margin">Cul-de-ſac Royal.</note> and at the
bottom whereof ſtands a pretty Town,
containing near three hundred Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
where the General reſides, and
the Courts of Juſtice are kept: The
Streets of it are ſtraight, the Houſes
regular, and moſtly built of Wood;
and here the <hi>Capuchins</hi> have a very
fine Convent. The Fort which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
advantageouſly ſcituated, is built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a large and long Point of land that
runs out into the Sea, and makes
the beſt Careening place in all the
Iſlands: The Fort is no other way
acceſſible to the Sea-ward, but by
Layes or Banks of Rocks which do
encompaſs it; and the Town cannot
be otherwiſe approached to, than by
a ſmall but very narrow Claſcis, that
is flanked with an half Moon, and
two Baſtions, lined with good Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work;
and defended with a Ditch
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106963:97"/>
full of Water; they have eighteen and
four and twenty Pounders mounted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way upon it, and ſix <hi>Marine</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
in Garriſon. Monſieur <hi>de Blenac</hi>
before his death erected a Magazine of
Powder there, and a Ciſtern Bomb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,
ſo that the Fort is now in a
Condition to withſtand a whole Army.</p>
            <p>The Town of St. <hi>Peter</hi> is pretty large,<note place="margin">The Town of <hi>St. Peter.</hi>
               </note>
and better peopled than that of <hi>Fort
Royal;</hi> but to ſpeak the truth of it,
it's no more than one Street, a
good quarter of a League in length, full
of aſcents and deſcents, and in ſeveral
Places interrupted with diverſe curious
Rows of <hi>Orange</hi> Trees; to ſay nothing
of a River that runs croſs the middle
thereof, that has excellent Water; this
River comes down from a great Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
that ſtands behind the Town, and
where may be ſeen a great many
Sugar Plantations, that are very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Eye: At one end of the
Town ſtands the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Houſe, which
is curiouſly Built; and at the other the
<hi>Jacobins</hi> Church; where alſo there is a
ſmall Convent of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſulines</hi> in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
beſides an Hoſpital, over which
the Brethren of <hi>Charity</hi> (as they are
called) have the ſuper-intendency:
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106963:98"/>
Moſt of the Houſes there are built of
Wood, but very well, and the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
are very Civil and Affable.
<hi>France</hi> may be known there by the
neatneſs of the People, and <hi>Martinico</hi>
can boaſt that her Females are as hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
as the Women of <hi>Europe:</hi> There
had been a Fort at the mouth of the
River, which the Hurricans entirely
ruined and levelled to the Ground;
they have no more now there, than
two Companies of Foot, and two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
at both ends of the Town, conſiſting
of eight or ten Pieces of Cannon each;
but they are continually at Work there
to raiſe new Fortifications.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> came thither in 1693,
with ſixty Sail of Ships, and made
a deſcent above the Town towards the
<hi>Preacher's Point,</hi> from whence they
were vigorouſly repulſed by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
who killed about fifteen Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
of them upon the ſpot, with the
diſadvantage of no more than twenty
Killed and Wounded on their own ſide;
and Monſieur <hi>de Blenac</hi> ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very much upon this Occaſion: He
Marched in one Night from <hi>Fort Royal</hi>
with two hundred Men thither, and
ſo incouraged the Inhabitants, that it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106963:98"/>
may be ſaid, it was almoſt to him
alone that the Succeſs of this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was owing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cul-de ſac de la Trinity,</hi> that ſtands
on the other ſide of the Iſland, is much
ſmaller, and leſs frequented than the
other Ports; beſides which, there are
divers ſmall Places on the Sea-ſide,
where Barks and Canoes take in
their Lading; ſo that ſince the taking
of St. <hi>Chriſtopher's,</hi> whoſe Inhabitants
withdrew into other Iſlands, they rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
<hi>Martinico</hi> to have three thouſand
Men bearing Arms, and above fifteen
thouſand Negro-Slaves.</p>
            <p>This Iſland, as has been already no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is very high and ſo full of Mountains,
that the middle part thereof cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited;
but it's very fruitful in Sugars,
where they are now refined, in Cotton,
<hi>Rocou,</hi> Cinnamon, <hi>Cocoe,</hi> of which they
make Chocolate, in Magniot, and the
Fruits of the Country, which I have
deſcrib'd already. They have very fine
ſort of Wood there, eſpecially that
which they call the <hi>Gayac,</hi> of which
they make Pullies, and ſuch like things,
for the King's Men of War.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſeveral other Fruits, which
are tranſported thence into <hi>France</hi> grow
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106963:99"/>
in this Country mighty well; and Sheep,
Oxen, and Horſes, multiply amongſt
them apace; and the Ships that ſail
thither, whether ſingly, or in company,
to lade Sugar, carry with them Wines,
Corn, Salt-meats, and all ſorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
they may have occaſion for;
ſo that a Man of an Eſtate can live
there, as well as in <hi>France:</hi> But yet the
high Scituation of the Country makes
the Air unwholſome, and there are but
a few Ships that go thither, whoſe
Crew does not feel the Effects of it;
and we our ſelves, loſt about a dozen
or fifteen Men, who died as it were
from one Day to another, without any
Symptom of being ſick. The Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
beſides the Inconveniency of a
bad Air, are much incommoded with
Ants, <hi>Mouſticks,</hi> and a kind of an Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm,
which they call <hi>Chiques,</hi> and
which fix themſelves in the ſoles of the
Feet, and are ſo much the more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome
and inſupportable, in that they
cannot be rooted out from thence, if
they have once time given them to
lay their Eggs there: Serpents are alſo
very common in this Iſland, and creep
into the very Houſes, of which there
are ſe<gap reason="illegible: blotted" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

dangerous; but the Negro's find <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>
there that cure them preſently.</p>
            <p>We made ready on the 13th to go

to a Merchant-Ship, bound for <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupa,</hi>
where ſhe received Monſieur <hi>de

            </p>
            <p>On the 14th,<note place="margin">The Iſle of St. <hi>Lucia,</hi>
               </note> about Nine in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we anchored in a great Bank of
Sand at St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> where a very good
Port may be made, and convenient
Habitations fixed. St. <hi>Lucia</hi> is of a
high Scituation, covered with Wood,
and rendred almoſt uninhabitable, by a
vaſt Number of Serpents that are to
be found there; but for all that, there
are two or three <hi>Indian Carbets,</hi> or Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,
upon the place, and ſome <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who fetch Tortoiſes from thence
for <hi>Martinico:</hi> You will find upon the
Sea-ſhoar, a great many <hi>Macheveliers,</hi>
which is a Tree that does not grow
very tall, whoſe Wood is very fine, and
its Leaves like unto thoſe of a Pear-tree;
it bears ſmall Apples, that are of ſuch
a Smell and Colour, as do invite Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106963:100"/>
to eat of them; but it's very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to comply with the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
for there is no Antidote that can
ſecure a Man from a ſpeedy Death,
that hath once taſted of them: The
very Leaf of it makes an Ulcer upon
the place it toucheth, the Dew that
falls from them takes away the Skin,
and the very Shadow of this Tree
makes a Man ſwell to that degree,
that it will infallibly kill him without
ſpeedy help.</p>
            <p>On the 15th, in the Afternoon, we
weigh'd Anchor, and kept pretty near
the Shoar, that we might be able to get
to the Coaſt of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> within two
Leagues of which we found our ſelves
next Morning by break of Day: But
it was three in the Afternoon before we
could draw near, tho' we had a ſmall
Gale that was favourable enough; and
this made us ſuppoſe that the Currents
were againſt us; but it blowing at
length, at three of the Clock, a freſh
Gale, we made a little more ſail, and
coaſted within half a League of the
Iſland, where we ſaw a very fine Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and ſeemingly well cultivated:
The ſame is inhabited, on the Coaſt by
which we paſſed, with twelve or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:106963:100"/>
hundred Negro's, that fled thither
from the Neighbouring Iſlands, and
eſpecially from <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> from whence
they made their Eſcapes, with a favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Wind, in their Maſters Canoes:
But the other ſide is Peopled with
two or three thouſand <hi>Indians,</hi> who have
a great Trade with thoſe that dwell
upon the River <hi>Orenoquo</hi> that is on the
Continent, whither they paſs in their
<hi>Pirogues,</hi> as they do to all the Iſlands
ſcituate in the Gulph of <hi>Mexico;</hi> and
that which is very wonderful, is, That
they are never overtaken with bad
Weather, but that on the contrary, they
are always aware of the Day wherein
an Hurricane happens, a long time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the ſame doth come to paſs.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Vincent</hi> is alſo high of Scituation,
abounding in Fruits, Fowl, in Goats
and Hogs. There is a very fine Port
there to Lee-ward, which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
ſome Years ſince, would have
made themſelves Maſters of; but the
<hi>Indians</hi> prevented their making a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
with Showers of poiſon'd Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
and the Aſſiſtance of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's,
who took Vengeance on them
for all the ill Uſage they had met with
at the hands of that Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:106963:101"/>
On the 17th we doubled that Place
they call the <hi>Pomgranates,</hi> and next Day
ſaw the Iſland of <hi>Tabago,</hi> which the
Mareſchal <hi>d' Eſtre</hi> took from the <hi>Dutch</hi>
in 1678. after two of the ſharpeſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements
that have been heard of;
but this Iſland is now deſolate, and
ſerves only for a place of Retreat to
Birds. About Noon we ſteered towards
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> which we diſcovered on the
one and twentieth; and having a fair
Wind on the 25th and 26th, we made
much of our way towards <hi>Barbadoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 31th we diſcovered, by break
of Day,<note place="margin">An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prize.</note> a ſmall Veſſel to Leeward,
and made all the Sail we could to come
up with her; and as ſhe ſaw we were got
near her, and that it was to no purpoſe
to flee, ſhe came to, and ſtaid for us:
She was a Veſſel of forty Tuns, that
had been three Months ſailing from
<hi>Briſtol</hi> for the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> and was laden
with Beer, Syder, Herrings, Cheeſe,
Butter, Hats, and ſeveral ſorts of other
Goods, being valued at 20000 Livres.
We put eight Men on board her, and
ſent her away for <hi>Martinico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next Day, which was the firſt of
<hi>January,</hi> 1697.<note place="margin">January, 1697.</note> we diſcovered alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Veſſel, four Leagues to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106963:101"/>
of us, and we bore up towards
her till three in the Afternoon, but could
not come up with her, which made us
give o'er the Chaſe.</p>
            <p>On the 6th we had a ſight of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes.</hi>
As Monſieur <hi>de Gennes,</hi> who had
been ſick for fifteen Days, found himſelf
now ſicker than ordinary, he thought
fit to return to <hi>Martinico.</hi>
               <note place="margin">They return to <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico.</hi>
               </note> We left the
<hi>Sun of Africa</hi> behind us, to cruiſe, which
ſhe did for five or ſix Days, without
purchaſe; and we making all the Sail
we could, next Day about four in the
Evening diſcovered the Coaſt of
St. <hi>Lucia,</hi> which we left to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of us; and on the 8th, about ten
in the Morning, entred the Port they
call <hi>Cul-de-Sac Royal:</hi> We were come
very near the Fort, and ready to caſt
Anchor, when we met with a great
Rock, that took out three of our Ship's
outer Planks, without doing us any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Damage; we quickly brought her
back, and anchored a good Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot
from the Shoar; and indeed it's
dangerous to get nearer, and we had
good luck to come off ſo well.</p>
            <p>We diſcharged our Prizes, and ſold
the Goods very well, becauſe the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
who were in daily Expectation
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:106963:102"/>
of the Arrival of Monſieur <hi>d' Ambli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s
Fleet, wanted Proviſions; and it's
certain they had not twenty Barrels of
Meal left in the whole Iſland. The
Free-booters had contributed very much
to ſubſiſt them for the firſt Years of the
War, by the many Prizes they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> St. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher,</hi>
and the other Iſlands belonging
to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but now their Merchant-ſhips
ſailed together in Fleets; and there
are alſo ſome of them, who to avoid
the Privateers, go to the Coaſt of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bago</hi>
and <hi>la Trinity,</hi> and come back
again to recover <hi>Barbadoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 24th we made ready to ſail
for the Fort of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> where we
anchored on the 25th, and continued
in that place till the fourth of the next
Month, to take in Sugar, <hi>Caſſia,</hi> and
<hi>Cocoe,</hi> with which <hi>Martinico</hi> almoſt
ſupplies all <hi>France:</hi> The <hi>Caſſia</hi> grows
in Husks about half a Foot long, upon
a Tree much like unto our Walnut-tree.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cocoe</hi> grows no where but in
moiſt Places,<note place="margin">Cocoe.</note> and ſuch as are but little
expoſed to the Sun; the Tree that
produces it is but ſmall, the Fruit is
long and uneven, like a Cucumber;
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106963:102"/>
when it is ripe they gather it, and
leave it for a time to dry in the Sun;
it's properly nothing elſe but a rind,
like that of the <hi>Pomgranate,</hi> that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
about five and twenty, or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Beans, of which thy make Choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
            <p>On the 31ſt. we fitted out a <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine,</hi>
to ſail to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
the Priſoners they had made
of the Crew of a ſmall Free-booter,
that had been taken in ſight of <hi>Guada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lupa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have a mind, before we go from
hence, to relate the Adventure of our
Poor <hi>Mango,</hi> who gave us continually
ſome diverſion or other; this was an
old Monkey we had, belonging once
to the Governour of <hi>Gambie;</hi> who was
ſo prodigiouſly ſtrong, that he broke his
Chain at leaſt once in eight Hours; and
as ſoon as he got looſe, he failed not to
make a Ravage: His main Care was
to get him a Dinner, and when he had
fooled any poor Seaman out of his Meſs,
it was very pleaſant to ſee him get
up to the top of the Maſts, and to
jump from one Sail unto another with
a diſh of Rice, or a great Piece of
Bacon in his Paws. If any one was
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106963:103"/>
ſo bold as to go about to take away
his prey, he threw a Cannon-ball at
his Head, or what ever elſe came
in his way; all which was nothing in
compariſon of the Wounds of his
Teeth, which made ſuch an Impreſſion,
that the Marks of them ſome times
remained for the ſpace of two Months
and upwards. At laſt he took upon
him to throw into the Sea the Wheels
of an Ivory-Clock which Monſieur
<hi>de Gennes</hi> had ordered to be made, and
took up two Years time in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
But this was no ſooner known,
than that the poor Devil was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to have his head chopped off, and
therefore he was carryed a Shoar to
have the Sentence Executed upon him;
but he managed his part ſo well, that
after two or three Piſtols ſhot at him,
he broke his Cord and took to his
feet; and all that Day we ſaw the
poor Animal, as wounded as he was,
run up and down along the Shoar, to
ſeek out an opportunity to return on
Board; and if he was much concerned
for loſing of us, we were no leſs to
find our ſelves deprived of his dear
Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:106963:103"/>
From the fourth at Night to the
fifth of <hi>February,</hi>
               <note place="margin">February, 1697.</note> we made ready to
ſail for <hi>Guadalupa.</hi> As for our Great
Prize which remained at Fort <hi>Royal,</hi>
to diſpoſe of her Wood, and relade
with Sugar, we left twenty Men on
board of her; but for the other two
Prizes, we ſold them, tho' to no great
advantage, becauſe they were but
ſmall, and the Lading inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>At the <hi>Preacher</hi>'s <hi>Point</hi> we met an
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Prize, taken by the Merchant-ſhip,
that entred at the ſame time
with us into <hi>Cayenne,</hi> near St. <hi>Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;</hi>
then we Coaſted St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> and
on the ſixth anchored very near the
Shoar before <hi>Guadalupa,</hi> even in the
midſt of the Town, to the South-weſt
of the Iſland, at the bottom of a very
high Sulphurous Cavity, that caſts out
ſmoke continually, and oftentimes fire.
We got our full Cargoe in leſs than
two Days, and the Inhabitants came
to intreat us with great earneſtneſs to
take off their Goods, ſo that we could
have laden fifteen Ships in fifteen
Days time.</p>
            <p>This Iſland is very large, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
than <hi>Martinico,</hi> being divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106963:104"/>
two parts by an Arm of the Sea,
called the <hi>Salt-River,</hi> by which Barks
may paſs up when the Tide is in; the
Land is high, but fruitful in Sugar,
Indico, and Cotton: Here alſo they
have <hi>Rocou, Caſſia, Cocoe,</hi> and very good
Comfits. Fruits and Fowl are very
common there; and they have a ſort
of Birds about the forementioned ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurous
Cavity, which they call <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolins,</hi>
which are very large, and as
good as Pullets; they live upon nothing
elſe but Fiſh, which they vomit up to
feed their Young withal, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
ſend out their Negro's to
take them; but whether it be that they
are not uſed to it, or that the Cold,
or the Air of the ſaid ſulphurous Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
ſeizes upon them, they are taken
with ſuch a languiſhment upon it, that
they cannot ſurmount without much
Difficulty; they alſo find ſeveral boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fountains in this Iſland.</p>
            <p>That part of the Iſland which ſtands
to the Northward, becauſe of its being
larger than the other, is called <hi>The
Great Land,</hi> and hath been inhabited a
long time, but at preſent has not above
an hundred Inhabitants. The other,
which is known by the Name of <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalupa,</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:106963:104"/>
has two Companies of Foot in it,
about a thouſand Inhabitants fit to bear
Arms, and a great Number of Negro-Slaves:
The <hi>Jeſuits, Jacobins, Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins</hi>
and <hi>Carmelites,</hi> have their Pariſhes
there in diſtinct Places, as well as in
<hi>Mary-Galand,</hi> and the Iſland called
<hi>Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town where we caſt Anchor,
is the moſt conſiderable and almoſt the
only one of the Iſland, being divided into
two parts by a ſmall River, which runs
from behind the ſulphurous Cavity
we have already mentioned; it's large
enough, and the greateſt part of the
Houſes in it are built of Stone: There
is a Battery of eight pieces of Cannon
erected in the middle, and the ſame
commands all the Road; and at the
end thereof, upon the Bank of a ſwift
Torrent, ſtands a little Fort defended
by eight pieces of Cannon, and lined
with good Stone-Work.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> made a Deſcent upon
this Place in 1691, burnt the Town,
took away the Battery that ſtood in
the middle of it; and there was none
but this Fort made good by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
till Monſieur <hi>d' <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ragny,</hi> then
General of the Iſlands, came with three
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106963:105"/>
or four Men of War, and ſome Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
Ships, fitted up in haſte to raiſe
the Siege; when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> re-imbarked
with Precipitation; and left above two
hundred Men in the Woods, to the
Mercy of the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between the tenth at Night, and the
eleventh, we weighed Anchor, and at
break of Day ſaw a <hi>Brigantine,</hi> that
bore up towards us, when we on our
part did the ſame in reſpect to her;
upon which about Noon we fired
three Pieces of Cannon, which made
her preſently alter her Courſe; it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhe might be ſome ſmall <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Privateer, that look'd after ſome Prey
on theſe Coaſts.</p>
            <p>On the 12th and 13th we were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much becalmed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Croſs.</note> and on the 15th
we diſcovered the Iſland of St. <hi>Croſs,</hi>
which many of our Crew were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident,
to be the Iſlands called the
<hi>Virgins;</hi> for indeed at a diſtance it
appeared to be no other than a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of little Iſlands ſeparated from one
another: Here they have Sugar, Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,
and Indico, great plenty of Fowl
and Swine. And Cows and Horſes
would have multiplied here apace:
But as they were from Day to Day appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:106963:105"/>
of the loſs of this Iſland, they
cauſed the Inhabitants to withdraw
to St. <hi>Domingo,</hi> with all their Effects,
and entirely to abandon the Place.</p>
            <p>On the 16th by break of Day we
diſcovered St. <hi>Thomas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>St.</hi> Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</note> that is to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of all the Iſles of the <hi>Virgins:</hi>
It's very remarkable for many Banks,
and white Towers that do ſurround the
Port of it: Upon our approach we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
the Town, and a great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
of Stone-work that defends the
Entrance of it, without which rode
three large Ships. This Iſland belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the <hi>Danes;</hi> the <hi>Hamburghers</hi> have
an Agent there, and the Product of
the Place is Sugar and Indico, but no
very great Quantity of either; and
they would not think it worth their
while to mind it, but that this does
facilitate the Trade they drive in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro's
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of <hi>Portorico,</hi>
that is about fifteen Leagues off.</p>
            <p>About Noon we doubled the Iſland
of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> and left a great white
Rock on the left, that looked at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
like a Hoy under-ſail: This
<hi>Euripus,</hi> as I may call it, is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious
for the Merchant-ſhips that
ſtand in fear of the <hi>Corſairs,</hi> which they
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:106963:106"/>
cannot many times eſcape, when they
ſail by St. <hi>Chriſtophers, Saba,</hi> and others
of the Enemies Iſlands.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventeenth, eighteenth, nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
and twentieth, we had a great
deal of Rain and but little Wind; and
on the one and twentieth, we paſt the
Tropick of <hi>Cancer.</hi> From the twenty
third to the twenty eighth we had va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable
Winds, and very rainy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>The ſecond and third of <hi>March</hi> we
had great Winds,<note place="margin">March, 1697.</note> Rains, and foggy
Weather, and the following Days we
were becalmed: We found our ſelves
parallel to the <hi>Bermudoes,</hi> but an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and fifty Leagues diſtance from it,
as being a Place which all the Ships
that come from the Iſlands, take care
to ſhun, ſeeing they have found by
conſtant Experience, they muſt meet
with bad Weather there; for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Winds either forces them to
draw near it, or to paſs to Lee-ward
of it.</p>
            <p>On the 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th, we
had a fair Wind and moderate Weather
but from the time of our leaving
St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> till we came parallel with
the <hi>Azores,</hi> we ſaw Herbs every Day
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:106963:106"/>
floating upon the Sea, which thoſe
who had ſailed upon the Coaſts of <hi>New
Spain,</hi> told us came from the Channel
of <hi>Bahama,</hi> from whence they were
carried into the main Ocean by the
rapidity of the Currents, and then
diſperſed over all this Sea, by the
Weſterly Winds that continually blow
upon the Coaſts of <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 10th we had both Winds
and Rain, and the Weather was very
cold; we came parallel to the <hi>Azores,</hi>
and kept at an hundred and fifty Leagues
diſtance from the Iſle of <hi>Corva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 11th we had very great
Winds, but they blowing of us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in our way, we were eaſily
brought to acquieſce with them.</p>
            <p>Very early on the 12th in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
the Winds blew very hard, the
Heavens were all over-caſt, and the Sea
grew very boiſterous and terrible,
and it was with very great Difficulty
that we could carry low Sails: We
had a Foot of Water in the Hole,
but we could not uſe our Pumps;
the Waves were as high as our
Maſts, and came in upon us on all
ſides: And in this dangerous pickle
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:106963:107"/>
we continued all the Day: But about
ten at Night the Winds began to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay,
and on the thirteenth we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joned
the <hi>Sun of Africa,</hi> which the
bad Weather had ſeparated from us
the Day before, and whoſe Gallery
had been ſwept away by a great
Wave.</p>
            <p>On the ſixteenth, being come paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to Cape <hi>Finiſter,</hi> we made all the
Sail we could to get a ſight of it;
and next Day, at five in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we ſaw a ſmall Veſſel two Leagues
to Windward of us, and which
we believed was bound for the Bank
of <hi>New-found-Land:</hi> But on this, and
the two ſucceeding Days, we had
Hail, Rain, and very cold Winds.</p>
            <p>On the nineteenth we diſcovered a
pretty large Ship three Leagues to
Leeward, whom we chaſed for four
Hours, but could not come up with
her.</p>
            <p>And on the twentieth, by break of
Day, we found another within two
Cannon-ſhot of us, which made us
put out all our Sails, and give her
chaſe, which continued for ſeven
hours: But as we had but little
Wind, we could not come up with
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:106963:107"/>
her, and ſo we reſumed our Courſe
again.</p>
            <p>From the two and twentieth to the
27th, the Weather was very hazy;
and for ſix Days together, we ſaw
neither Sun, Moon, nor Stars, and had
but very little Wind.</p>
            <p>On the 17th we ſaw three Ships
to Windward of us, which we did
not think convenient to look after,
ſeeing our Proviſion was now almoſt
ſpent, and that it was our Intereſt to
improve our time well; and this ſame
Night, we beheld a Rain-bow croſs
the Heavens, which, without recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
any Reflection from the Stars,
that were very much over-caſt, had a
very lively red Colour.</p>
            <p>The 28th, 29th, and 30th, we had
favourable Winds, and fine moderate
Weather.</p>
            <p>But now the firſt Day of the Month
of <hi>April</hi> being come,<note place="margin">April, 1697.</note> the Wind chopp'd
about all of a ſudden, and came con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;
at what time we accounted our
ſelves not above fifty Leagues from
Cape <hi>Finiſter:</hi> Next Day the Winds
bare hard upon us, and diſabled us to
make the Cape.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:106963:108"/>
But on the fourth and fifth they
began to allay, and proved fair enough;
and next Day, at ſeven in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
we diſcovered about a League
from us to Leeward, a pretty large
Ship, which we chaſed all Night long,
gained much upon her, and had it
not been for a Fog that fell for two
Hours, by favour of which ſhe ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away, ſhe had certainly given us
either Bullets or Bread, which laſt we
now moſt wanted, all our Proviſions
being ſpent, and the Winds ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
            <p>On the eighth we ſaw <hi>Pewets,</hi> and
other Sea-birds, who are never ſeen
very far from the Shoar; next
Day being the ninth, we met with a
ſort of little Sparrows, who paſſed over
our Sail-yards without reſting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
and this was an infallible ſign
unto us, that we were not far from Land.</p>
            <p>On the 12th at break of Day, we
deſcry'd two Ships at a League's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from us, but we could not come
up with them, our Ships being too
foul, too full of Herbs and Shell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
to think of gaining upon Veſſels
newly careened, as we apprehended
theſe to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:106963:108"/>
On the 13th we ſaw ſeveral Birds
that waited as well as we, for a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
Wind to put them a-ſhoar;
next Day the Wind was boiſterous,
and we had much Rain, Hail and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Snow: And we loſt Company with
the <hi>Sun of Africa</hi> in a Fog, who not
obſerving the Signal, ſailed away,
while we were ſetting our Round-tops,
that were diſplaced, in order again.</p>
            <p>On the 15th the Wind being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
allay'd, and the Weather clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, about break of Day we ſaw
five Ships, three to the Star-board,
and two to the Lar-board; but we
were not in a Condition to go and
look after any them.</p>
            <p>By the ſixteenth our Proviſion was
all ſpent,<note place="margin">The Men brought to live upon <hi>Chocolate.</hi>
               </note> and we neceſſitated to uſe
the Sugar and <hi>Cocoe</hi> of the Merchants,
to make Chocolate for the Ships Crew;
which is a Liquor that is of a very
nouriſhing nature, and might ſerve
inſtead of Victuals; but our Seamen,
who were not accuſtomed to it, did
not like it at all, and ſaid it made their
heads giddy.</p>
            <p>On the 17th at Sun riſing, we thought
we had the ſight of the Tower of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovan,</hi>
but our joy was ſhort-lived, and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:106963:109"/>
this Tower was all of a ſudden Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
into a Ship.</p>
            <p>At laſt on the 18th, after a traverſe
of ſixty ſeven Days, we ſounded and
found a Bottom, and were come
parallel to <hi>Pertuis de Maumuſſon,</hi> about
twenty Leagues diſtance from the
Shoar: On the ninteenth we had but a
ſmall Wind.</p>
            <p>But on the 20th we diſcovered <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi>
which is fifteen Leagues wide
of <hi>Pertuis d' Antioch;</hi> the Sea, tho' very
even, proved now to be broken and
violent: About Noon we ſaw four
Ships, and they Steered the ſame Courſe
with us. Soon after we diſcovered the
Steeple of <hi>God</hi>'s-<hi>Iſland,</hi> about five
in the the Evening, the <hi>Whale-Tower</hi>
in the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and at Night we
came to an Anchor, to wait for the
Tide.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt we weigh'd, and by
break of Day we found our ſelves
within two Cannon-ſhot of four Ships,
which we had ſeen the Day before, which
made us put out <hi>French</hi> Colours:
They did the like, and we ſent our
<hi>Canoe</hi> on board them, to know what
news from <hi>France:</hi> They happened to
be a Bark of the Iſle of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:106963:109"/>
three St. <hi>Malo</hi> Men, half men of War,
and half Merchants, who were going
to take in Salt in the Iſle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and
from thence to fiſh on the bank of
<hi>New-found-Land:</hi> They gave us ſix
Baskets of Bread, one Barrel of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
and ſome Beer, which a little
refreſhed our men. The St. <hi>Malo</hi>
men paſſed by <hi>Pertuis Breton,</hi> and we
by that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and ſo on till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Midnight, we caſt Anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Rochelle,</hi> where we found the
<hi>Sun</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> who was got into that
Port two Days before us.</p>
