            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The conſequence in the Major Propoſition, I argue and debate thus. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in all they have done (I mean, in the matter under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt) have no waies violated or tranſgreſſed that ſupreme Law, and conſequently have not tranſgreſſed any other Law ſubordinate to it, or depending on it; and ſo are blameleſſe. For in every combination or ſubordination, whether of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, or of things, no inferiours, or ſubordinate, whether perſon or thing, can be injured, but that which is ſupream or firſt in either, muſt needs partake thereof, and ſuffer wrong alſo; yea, the truth is, that the whole ſubordination, and that in every part or member of it ſuffers wrong, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any one part or member of it ſo ſuffers: The meaneſt Subject in a Kingdome or State cannot be injured, without injury and wrong done to the Prince, or ſupreame Ruler of this State, ſo that if the Prince be not injured, certain it is, that no ſubject under him ſuffered wrong. Thus then evident it is, that if the Army have done nothing in way of violation of that ſupream Law, the <hi>Safety of the people,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have they tranſgreſſed any other.</p>

               <p>That they have not tranſgreſſed that great Law we ſpeake of, is evident, becauſe in what they did, they obſerved it and yeelded obedience to it, they acted for the ſafety of the people, what they did had a full and a clear concurrence here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and tendency hereunto; The ſafety and well being of the people of their Land, was now laid upon the Altar, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be offered up in Sacrifice upon the ſervice of ſome few mens luſts and intereſts; upon the ſight whereof they put their lives into their hand, and ingaged themſelves for the reſcue, what is, or reaſonably may be objected againſt this Argument, the Sequell will anſwer.</p>
               <p>

               <p>If the Army were obliged to take care of, and to act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their beſt intereſts for the preſervation and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of the body of the Kingdom, then are they not at all culpable for acting according to the tenour of their late and preſent proceedings.</p>
               <p>But certain it is that the Army, as every other perſon and ſociety of men in the Kingdom, both were and are obliged to take care of, and to act according to their beſt intereſts, for the preſervation and well-being of the body of the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Therefore they are not at all culpable for acting according to the tenour of their late and preſent proceedings.</p>
               <p>The minor Propoſition in this Argument alſo is unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable; That which lies as a duty upon every particular member, Corporation, or Society of men in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom beſides, doubtleſſe reſts upon the ſame termes, and after the ſame manner on the Army alſo.

               <p>The connexion in the former Propoſition, this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration avoucheth for Truth.

thoſe upon whom they had caſt the honour of making them their Phyſicians, being now trodden and trampled under foot, yea caſt into the fire and conſumed by the Phyſicians themſelves.

When innocency in conjunction with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty and height of merit, ſhal be trampled upon as <hi>clay and mire in the ſtreet,</hi> by men in power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what doth it portend, but the preparing of a yoke of iron for the neck of the Nation? <hi>Elian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that in one of the States of <hi>Greece,</hi> when the ſheep of one <hi>Nicippus</hi> brought forth a lyon, it was Juſtly concluded that it por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a tyranny, and change of the State, from a peaceable to a bloody government: ſo when fair, juſt, and peaceable actions in inferiors, ſhall produce fierce, violent, and mennacing oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and deportments in ſuperiors, it is a ſigne fully demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114354:7"/>
that they are in travel with oppreſſion, cruelty, and blood: yea and begin to cry out to be delivered.</p>
               <p>So then, there being theſe and many other moſt apparent ſymptomes upon the Nation of a death of their liberties, and all their juſt rights and comforts, approching; and withal, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no viſible, no nor probable means to prevent the coming and prevailing of this great deſtruction over it, but onely that intereſt of power and ſtrength which yet remained in the Body of the Army; in caſe the Army had deveſted themſelves of this intereſt at the inſtance and demand of thoſe who demanded it, what had this (in due conſtruction) bin, but the delivering of that ſword out of their hands, for the ſmiting of the Nation with violence and oppreſſion, which both God and the Nation it ſelf (by their Truſtees) put into their hand, for the preſervation and protection of it from, and againſt theſe evills? <hi>Qui non vetat, peccare, cumpoſſit, jubet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, from one principal branch in that Covenant, which they ſolemnly ſware and covenanted both with God and men: I further argue,</p>
               <p>If the Army <hi>promiſed, vovved, and proteſted in the preſence of God</hi> (promiſing, vovving, and proteſting herein nothing but what was lavvful) <hi>to maintain and defend, as far as lawfully they might, vvith their lives, powers, and eſtates, the lavvful rights and liberties of the Subject,</hi> &amp;c. then are they not to be blamed, but honoured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as Covenant-keepers in their proceedings.</p>
               <p>But this is the caſe, the Army did thus <hi>promiſe, vovv, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt,</hi> and therein promiſed, vowed, and proteſted nothing but what was lawful.</p>
               <p>Therefore not to be blamed, but rather honoured as Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-keepers in their proceedings.</p>
               <p>The former part of the Aſſumption is evident from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the firſt branch of the Covenant, together with the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114354:7"/>
known Act of the Army (at leaſt of the chief and greateſt part of them] in taking it. The latter part is granted by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament themſelves, and all thoſe, who having taken the ſaid Covenant, do not repent thereof.</p>
               <p>The Conſequence in the Propoſition is evident alſo upon this ſuppoſition, that the Army in what they have done, have gone no further then lawfully they may, to maintaine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the lawful rights and liberties of the Subject.</p>
               <p>The truth of this ſuppoſition is fairly demonſtrable thus. That is lawful for men to do: which upon good and warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able grounds they judge neceſſary to be done, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing and effecting of that which by duty they ſtand bound and obliged to do. That the Army ſtood bound in duty, and by the band of their Covenant, to maintain and defend the lawful rights and Liberties of the Subject, is evident, and above all contradiction. The grounds upon which they judged it neceſſary to ſteere the courſe which they have hitherto held; partly in not disbanding; partly in impeaching ſome members of Parliament in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their Covenant, in the particulars mentioned, are theſe [with their fellows] Firſt, they cleerly ſaw, and the world round about cleerly ſeeth, that the lawful Rights and Liberties of the Subiect, were not onely threatned, or aſſaulted, but ſorely wounded and endangered alſo, [and conſequently ſtood in eminent need of mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and defence] havock and ſpoyl being made of them from day to day; in burning their Petitions, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe Enemies to the State, who onely petitioned, and that in a peaceable way, for what the Parliament it ſelf acknowledged to be juſt and equal to be granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: beſides the numerous Arbytrarie and illegall, yea cauſleſs and reaſonleſſe impriſonments of the perſons, ſequeſtrations of the eſtates, and many grievous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt moleſtations otherwiſe, of the free-born ſubjects of the Nation. The Civil Law ſaith (and not without ground)
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114354:8"/>
                  <q>That he which hath hurt one, hath threatned many: and by the rule of proportion it may be as truly ſaid, that they who have hurt many, have threatned all.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, They cleerly ſaw and underſtood, that there was no viſible, nor in any degree probable means now left unto the Nation, for the maintenance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the ſaid lawful RIGHTS and LIBERTIES of the Subject, but onely that Intereſt which was veſted in them, being yet an Armie, and an united body. The prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing party of thoſe men, who EX OFFICIO and according to the ducture and engagement of the great Truſt repoſed in them, ſhould have aſſerted theſe RIGHTS and LIBERTIES, had turned head upon their Truſt, and judgement into WORMWOOD; and had not only laid their foundations; but being active in their way, made no ſmal progreſs in building up themſelves and their own exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Greatneſs, in the ruines of the RIGHTS and LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIES of the people, (as hath been ſhewed) Yea, by the lawleſs Law of Prerogative and Priviledge conſpiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, had now the ſee-ſimple of thoſe places, and that power ſetled upon them; by the advantage of which, they might have done not onely what they pleaſed (and what this is, and was like to be, they have reſolved us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting it to the Queſtion, by their actions) but whileſt they pleaſed alſo; and this without any bridle of fear in their lipps of being countable unto any for whatſoever they ſhould doe. So that now the Army was the onely SPES GREGIS, the ſole hope of recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under God, to the drooping and dying freedoms of this Nation.</p>
               <p>The Army could not but apprehend, that had they willingly walked after the Commandment of thoſe, who required their disbanding, and not ſtood faſt by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of union and power (at leaſt for a ſeaſon) they had been like water ſpilt upon the ground; or (in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114354:8"/>
compariſon) <hi>like unto a Potters Veſſel, ſo broken in pieces, that there vvould not have been found in the bursting of it, a ſheard to take fire from the harth, or to take water withal out</hi>

                  <hi>of the pit.</hi> * they had been wholy unuſefull and unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that great Intereſt of the Nation, <hi>the maintenance and defence of the lavvful Rights and Liberties of the Inhabitants thereof:</hi> and ſo had deprived the Kingdom of all hope (yea and poſſibility in an ordinary way) of receiving their <hi>dead</hi> (Liberties) raiſed to <hi>life again;</hi> * the ſoft breathing of which<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> hope, is now of more value and refreſhing to the Nation, then all the ſilver and gold that is in it, and all the Treaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is no whit leſs then evident, that they who made tryal of a pretended or imaginary right to diſſolve and ſcatter a reall power, in the disbanding of the Army, (for no perſon nor perſons of what capacity ſoever, have any power, either to act, or to enjoyn any thing deſtructive to the lawful Rights of any man, much leſs of a Kingdom) no waies intended to eaſe the Nation of the burthen of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but onely to caſt down and make a plain of that mountain of men which ſtood in their way, and obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted their paſſage to that Lordly paradiſe of a perpetual and unaccountable domination, the figure whereof they had taken up and committed folly with in their imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As for the Nation, the caſe is plain enough, that their intent was, to take off the weight of the <hi>little finger</hi> of the Army, that they might gain an opportunity inſtead thereof, to lay the weight of their owne <hi>Loynes</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, (and laſtly for the impeaching of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers) ſuppoſing their guiltineſſe, or be it but a ſtrong preſumption of Truth, in thoſe high miſ-demeanours, which are now charged upon them (beneath which their greateſt Friends (I preſume) and Confederates cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:114354:9"/>
them) the Army had reaſon in aboundance to lift up their hand to this expedient alſo. Becauſe firſt, Had not this ſalt been caſt into the Parliamentary fountain, the bitter waters thereof could not have been healed; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to any ſuch ſweetneſs, that the Families of the Kingdome might with comfort and ſafety drink of them. It was no waies likely that ever this fountaine would have purged or clarified it ſelf, as naturall Fountains being roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and muddy, ſometimes do: becauſe the mudde and filth that was in it, was in ſo great a quantity, and ſo compacted withal, that the vent or iſſue, through which, being open, the freſh waters ſucceſſively ſpringing and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up, ſhould have wrought the cure, was hereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durated, damm'd, and quite ſtopt up. Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There was none other hand in the Kingdom, but onely the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant and dreadleſſe hand of the Army, that probably durſt, or however, could with that Authority or hopefulneſſe of ſucceſſe, lift up it ſelf to ſo great and honourable an attempt as this. He had need of the ſtrength and courage of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> that ſhall take a Lyon by the beard. And to ſay to a Junto of Parliamentary Grandees, ye are wicked; requires an Army at leaſt in the Reere.</p>
               <p>Now whether the grounds mentioned be not fully warrantable and ſufficient for the Army, to judge that courſe which they have ſteered, neceſſary for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that great duty, <hi>the maintenance and defence of the</hi> LAWFVLL RIGHTS and LIBERTIES of the SVBJECT, which by ſolemne VOW <hi>and</hi> COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT, they ſtood bound to perform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſequently whether juſtifiable and lawful, I leave to the Judgements and Conſciences of their greateſt Adverſaries to conſider; and upon conſideration, either to build them up by an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and free ſubſcription, or by a cleer and ſolid refuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to caſt them down.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:114354:9"/>That which is, or indeede can be objected againſt the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is of little value, and very opportune for ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>1. The Army with their proceedings, are burthened with diſobedience to authority, and reſiſtance againſt the higher powers, in refuſing to disband, upon an Ordinance of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I anſwer.</p>
               <p>1. The Army did not, neither yet doth abſolutely refuſe to disband, and that in ſubmiſſion to Parliamentary Authority. They onely deſired, that their disbanding might be reſpited for a time; and have humbly offered their grounds and reaſons of this their requeſt, unto the Parliament. A Servant is not therefore unfaithfull or diſobedient to his Mr. if now and then upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and due conſideration had of the nature, or conſequence of ſome command which he ſhall receive from him, he ſhall for a while ſuſpend his obedience, and ſubmiſſively debate with his Mr. either the equity or expediency of his command, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in order to his own affaires. <hi>Ioab</hi> was never charged by any man with diſſobedience unto <hi>David,</hi> though a King, and that of divine deſignation, and this in an extraordinary way too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not preſently upon his Command, and without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, <hi>go and number Iſrael and Judah,</hi> the Scripture is playne, that <hi>Ioab</hi> did argue and reaſon the caſe with his Lord and Mr. the King, before he would ſubmit to his Command: and how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a thing it had been both for the King himſelfe, and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if this Command of his had never been obeyed, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel of the ſtory ſufficiently manifeſts.</p>
               <p>2. Neither is all diſobedience to ſuperiours, or men in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, a diſobedience to authority, or to that <hi>higher power,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſuch perſons are lawfully inveſted, the luſts or arbitrary deſires or wills of men in authority, are no part of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for certaine it is, that neither God, nor men ever gave unto rulers, or men in authority, any authority or power to do whatever they liſt; but onely that which upon good grounds they judge to be juſt, and expedient for the weale and ſafety of the people under them, ſo that it no way followes that becauſe the Army hath not obeyed the perſons of men ſitting in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inveſted with Parliamentary power, therefore they have not obeyed Parliamentary authority. Though, <hi>Shadrach,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114354:10"/>
Meſhach, and Abe dnego, changed the Kings word,</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 3. 18. 28.</note> refuſed to obey it, yet did not they reſiſt his authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or if they did, the King himſelfe ſoone after bleſſed God for it.</p>
               <p>3. There are many Commandements of God himſelfe though unqueſtionably lawfull and good (for ſuch are all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands) a non-performance whereof notwithſtanding in ſome caſes is very lawfull, and free from offence. It was a juſt and righteous Command of God that <hi>Aaron and his Sonnes onely, and not ſtrangers ſhould eat of the holy things</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 29. 32. 33. Levit. 24. 29 Mat. 12. 4.</note> and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Shewbread;</hi> yet <hi>David</hi> and his men, though they were none of <hi>Aarons</hi> Sons, in a caſe of neceſſity, eating of this bread, are acquitted by our Saviour himſelfe, from ſin in ſo doing, In like manner the Command or law concerning the ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath, was a juſt and holy and good Law: Yet Chriſt himſelfe out of the Law, pronounceth the <hi>Prieſts blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,</hi> though prophaining the Sabbath, though they did that which was contrary to the letter of the Command concerning the Sabbath, as it related unto, and obliged the generality of men. So then, if the Commands of God which are unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly juſt, holy, and good, and of univerſall expediency unto men, yet as occaſion and circumſtance may be, may very law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and without the leaſt touch of ſin be tranſgreſſed, much more may the Commands of men, eſpecially ſuch Commands, the equity and expediencie whereof for publike good are very dubitable, upon juſt occaſion, and in due order to ſome impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant good, be diſobeyed, not onely without ſuch height, and heighnouſneſſe of guilt, as the paſſionate, but withall rediculous exclamations of many import to be contracted to the Army; but without any touch or tincture of guilt at all.</p>
               <p>4. And laſtly, as the ſaying is that <hi>there is no generall rule but hath its exception,</hi> one or more; ſo there is no ordinary or ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Law, but muſt give place, and yeeld obedience to that Law, which is the Law of Lawes, the Law of neceſſity; when this ſpeaketh, it is like <hi>a King upon his Throne, againſt whom there is no riſing up;</hi> all other Lawes muſt keepe ſilence before it, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114354:10"/>
bow downe to it as their Soveraigne. It is true, this law when it ſpeaketh, commonly troubleth the world; by turning the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed and ſetled courſe of things in it upſide downe. The voice of it ſomtimes is like the <hi>roaring of a Lyon,</hi> which maketh the beaſts in the <hi>Wilderneſſe to tremble,</hi> but herein it maketh ſome kind of recompence, it troubleth not the world often, it but ſeldome interpoſeth, to the prejudice, or non-obſervance of ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<note place="margin">Neceſſity is by the Iewes called lex ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rae 1. the law of an houre and by others lex temporis the Law of the times.

And though the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially in their doctrinalls, were very ſtrict and rigid for the obſervation of their Sabbath, yet it is a knowne rule amongſt them, that <hi>Periculum, vitae pellit Sabbathum,</hi> 1. dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of life drives away the Sabbath. But the ſaying of <hi>Iunius</hi> a late learned Divine, is very memorable to this purpoſe. This (ſaith he) <hi>belongeth to como<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n Law &amp; equity, that unto extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry evils, extraordinary remedies muſt alſo be applyed.</hi> It were eaſie to multiply both rules &amp; examples, out of the beſt approved Authors, to juſtifie the doing of many things in caſes of neceſſity, which out of ſuch caſes are unlawfull, as being contrary to ordinary Lawes, and ſtanding rules. So then, the Law and Command concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning obedience to Magiſtrates and Rulers, being an ordinary and ſtanding Law; it is, and ought to be ſubject to the Law of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, neither ought any man, or any ſociety of men in or for his obedience to this to be judged culpable, or any wayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent, though it be with diſobedience to that other. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it no wayes followes. The Army have diſobeyed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Superiours, therefore they are not cenſureable as evill doers. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is like it will here be yet further objected and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114354:11"/>
ſaid. Yea but who ſhall Judge of a caſe of neceſſity? if inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and they that are under government, and ought to obey ſhall be allowed to Judge, and to determine of caſes of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is like, that whenever the commands of their Superiours do not pleaſe them, or ſuit with their ends or deſiers they will pretend and plead <hi>Neceſſity</hi> in way of barre to their Obedience And ſo the Ordinance and law of Maieſtracy, will upon the matter be made void, and of no effect, and then a Chaos and confuſion of Anarchywil ſoon overſpread the world. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent caſe, the Patliament who is the moſt competent Judge, if not the only Judge of a caſe neceſſity eſpeciallyin order to the publike good and wellfare of the eſtate and Kingdome, did not apprehend any neceſſitie at all. for the Army to deny their obedience and ſubiection to their ordinance and command for disbanding; and is it lawfull for inferiours, and by name for the Army to oppoſe the judgment of the ſupreame Iudicatory of the Kingdom, eſpeſially in a caſe of ſuch a referrence and import as that? To this alſo I anſwer. 1. in generall. 2. in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for caſes of neceſſity they are for the moſt part very eaſie to be judged and diſcerned, mens ſenſes uſually infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming their underſtandings when they fall. When <hi>David</hi> and his men were an hungry, and ſaw no poſſibility of being ſupplyed, or relived otherwiſe (ſuppoſe them all perſons of far leſſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding then they were) they were and had been (ever under ſuch a ſuppoſition) the moſt competent, and beſt quallified Judges in the world of that caſe of neceſſity which was now in upon them, <hi>viz.</hi> to do that <hi>in eating the Show-bread which in other caſes was not lawfull for them to do.</hi> By the way, this inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cerning <hi>David,</hi> and his men, being made a <hi>Booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>caſe</hi> by Chriſt himſelfe, cleerly proveth that extremity of hunger, is a reall and authoriſed <hi>caſe of neceſſity;</hi> and conſequently priviledgeth thoſe that are under it, whilſt it continueth upon them, from ſubjection to ſuch Lawes, which oppoſe the reliefe of it, and whereunto they are, and ought to be ſubject, at all other times. And if hunger, though but of one or of a ſmall number of men, be warranted by Chriſt, for a caſe of neceſſity, and as a diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114354:11"/>
from an ordinary and ſtanding Law; much more are the like, and eſpecially greater concernments of greater numbers of men, to paſſe in our judgments for caſes of like nature name and import.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though ſome may pretend and plead a caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity where none is, to exempt themſelves from ſome lawes or commands, which they have no mind to be ſubject unto (who are juſtly puniſhable upon ſufficient evidence of their diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) yet this is no competent ground or motive to deny a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe of power unto mea in generall, to judge of ſuch caſes of neceſſity, whereof they are capable by principles of common ſence, and ordinary underſtanding. Though many are hipocrites in Religion, and profeſſe they beleeve in God, when they doe nothing leſſe, yet this is no reaſon to interdict any man, either the triall or judging of his faith, or the profeſſion of it. when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he hath it and doth beleive.</p>
               <p>3. Though men in places civill Iudicature and Magiſtracy be ordinarilyand in the generall the moſt competent Judges of ſuch caſes of neceſſity which are of publick <hi>Intereſt</hi> and concernment: yet firſt, conſidering what was ſaid towards the begining <hi>viz.</hi> that a guift (and conſequently any thing of like influence and operation upon the heart of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as vehement deſiers, and hopes of irregular &amp; undue injoynments in anykind &amp;c) <hi>blinds the eyes of the wiſe, and pervert the words of the righteous;</hi> 2.

               <p>Fourthly, Suppoſe Rulers and Judges, ſhould be men of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grety (for the maine) yea and for wiſdom and vnderſtanding in their appropriate affaires, men not much, lower then <hi>Angels of God,</hi> yet we know the common ſaying <hi>humanum eſt errare,</hi> men have nothing more incident to them then error and miſtake: and this many times in matters of very materiall conſequence both to themſelves and others, yea the wiſeſt of men have their <hi>turbidaintervalla,</hi> and now and then <hi>dead flyes</hi> are found in their <hi>Oyntment. David</hi> was a man <hi>after Gods own heart</hi> for uprightnes and ſincerity and had a very rich annointing alſo of the ſpirit of wiſdome and underſtanding; Yet we know the time was, when he commanded, and that with much importunity and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of conteſt, that which was of very ſad conſequence, both to himſelf and many thouſands of his people: the evill tendency of which command, though himſelf for the preſent apprehended nothing of, yet was it as it ſeemes reſented by <hi>Ioab</hi> a ſouldier and Generall of his Army, who conteſted with him a while for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal of it.

to their owns prejudice, and the prejudice of many millions of men, whoſe wealth, and ſafety they ſtand bound in conſcience with the beſt of their intereſts, and endeavours to procure. It Chriſt doth not onely allow the generality of Chriſtians to try, examine, and judge, of the Doctrines of their teachers, if they be able; but injoynes them (as we heard) at the perill of their ſoules to veſt in themſelves ſuch an ability, by which they may be able ſo farre to diſcerne and judge of their Doctrines, as to determine whether or no their teachers be <hi>blind</hi> or <hi>ſeeing,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing them further if they be <hi>blind,</hi> at no hand to be <hi>led by</hi> them, for feare of <hi>falling into the ditch</hi> doubtleſſe, he alloweth (at leaſt) the generallity of men, a right and intereſt of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcerning, if they be able (and what ſhould hinder of being able to acquire a faculty of judging temporall and civill things, when Chriſt himſelfe ſuppoſeth them capable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an ability to judge of ſpirituall and heavenly things) the politick Doctrines. 1. the Injunctions and Commands of their civill Rulers: and if he alloweth them to judge and determine of them, whether they be truly politique, and conſiſtant with the publike good and ſafety, or no, certainely, he allowes them withall, either to obey, or diſobey according as upon good grounds, they ſhall judge them to be.</p>
               <p>It is like it will be here replyed and demanded.</p>
               <p>Yea, but by what rule ſhall inferiours judge of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of their Superiours? Or by what Character or marke, ſhall ſuch Commands which may lawfully be diſobeyed, be ſo cleerly diſtinguiſhed from ſuch others, which are neceſſary to be obeyed, that the conſcience of him that obeyeth not, may be ſecured in peace, in, and under his non-obedience? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the conſcience of the inferiour who diſobeyeth, may upon every whit as cleere, and ſatisfactory termes, be ſecured, concerning the lawfulneſſe of his non-obedience, as the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Superiour, concerning the lawfulneſſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Nay, of the two, there are more ſnares and temptations upon the ſuperiours to impoſe unrighteous Commands, then upon the inferiour to miſſ-judge or miſtake, thoſe which are righteous for unrighteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Superiour is in little or no danger
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114354:13"/>
at all (I mean in reſpect of any civil puniſhment or ſufferings, if he judgeth any command of his whatſoever unjuſt, refuſing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to obey it: yea he is in danger of ſuffering both from God and men in caſe he miſ-judgeth any ſuch command upon ſuch termes, ſo that there is nothing ſo much danger, that the inferiour himſelf ſhould miſ-judge his ſuperiours command, as that the ſuperiour himſelf ſhould miſ-judge it, and ſo ſin in the propoſall of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Were it to be granted, that the Inferiour who is to obey runs ſome hazard of miſtake, when ever he judgeth and concludeth any command of his ſuperiour to be unjuſt: yet, 1. the ſuperiour runs the ſame (or a greater) hazard, (as hath been ſaid) whenſoever he judgeth that which he commandeth to be juſt; ſo that if the poſſibility or a danger of a miſtake, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, be a ty or engagement upon his Conſcience, to forbear any act of judgement at all about the command of the ſuperiour: the ſame of greater poſſibilitie or danger in the ſuperiour muſt oblige his Conſcience alſo from impoſing any command at all upon the inferiour, and conſequently, all both commanding and obeying ſhould ceaſe from the world, and the intereſt of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy and government wholly be diſſolved. 2. As the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhall run a hazard of miſtake, whenſoever hee ſhall judge it righteous: it being every whit as difficult cleerly to determine what is righteous and juſt, as what is unrighteous and unjuſt, ſo that if the danger of a miſtake, in judging the command of his ſuperiour to be unjuſt, be an engagement upon his conſcience, to forbear all ſuch judgement, by the ſame rule, and upon the ſame ground, he ſhould never judge any ſuch command to bee juſt neither: in which caſe all his obedience muſt needs be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, as not being performed in faith: 1. Out of a knowledge or wel-grounded perſwaſion of the lawfulneſſe of it. But</p>
               <p>3. Evident it is, that in ſome caſes there is no danger at all, no hazard run, in judgeing the commands of ſuperiours, unlawfull: no not when the ſuperiours themſelves ſhall be moſt confident of the lawfulneſſe of them: <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach and Abednigo</hi> ran no danger of a miſtake, when they judged the command of <hi>King
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114354:14"/>
Nebuchad-nezar,</hi> for the worſhiping of his golden image, to be unlawfull and unjuſt: and yet the King himſelf (as appears by the ſtory) yea and all his Nobles, were violently confident of the equitie and juſtneſſe of it. Nor did <hi>Daniel</hi> run hazard of a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, when hee judged the command of <hi>Darius</hi> his Prince and Councellours, that <hi>no man for thirty dayes ſhould ask any Petitions of any God, or man, but of the King only,</hi> to bee unjuſt: though it is no wayes like, but that at leaſt the major part of them, judged it very reaſonable and juſt. That mixt Aſſembly of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Prieſts (Act. 4. 5. 6.) were confident more then enough, that they did well, in <hi>commanding Peter and Iohn, to preach no more in Chriſts name,</hi> (verſ. 17. 18.) yet the men ran no hazard at all of miſtake in refuſing to obey it, as unjuſt. So by the way, it no wayes followes. The Parliament it ſelfe, (at leaſt the major part of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> judged their Ordinance or Command for the preſent disbanding of the Army, to be juſt: therefore the Army ſinned, or ran a hazard of ſinning, in refuſing to obey it according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But</p>
               <p>4. In caſe the inferiour ſhould at any time miſtake, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome command of his ſuperiour unlawfull, having conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly uſed compitent means for his due Reformation, and judging of it as he doth, in the ſimplicity of his heart, not out of any ſiniſter end, or reſpect as neglect of Magiſtracy, &amp;c. yet ſuch a miſtake, with the new obedience accompanying it, is a far leſſe offence, much more pardonable or excuſable, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſwallowing downe of all commands whatſoever from ſuperiours without examination, and much more then his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to this or any other command againſt judgement and conſcience would be: ſo that though a non obedience in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour upon ſuch a miſtake, as was now diſcribed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his ſuperiour, be not ſimply juſtifiable or lawfull, yet it is comparatively juſtifiable, being a far leſſer ſin, ſuppoſing the invincibleneſſe of the errour, or miſtake, by ordinary meanes, then the contrary, yea then any other department would bee miſtakes upon diligence, and reaſonable m<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

               <p>5. (And Laſtly for theſe) There are theſe three characters and ſymptomes very incident (amongſt ſome others) to the commands of ſuperiours, which being found upon them, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and declare them manifeſtly unjuſt, (in which caſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour runneth little or no hazard in judging them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Firſt, When they are calculated and formed with a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar and cleere antipathy to the comforts and peace of ſuch as are religious, and withall peaceable in that way of Religion wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they worſhip God. This is one character of an unjuſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. It is not material in this caſe, whether the ſuperiours we ſpeak of or others void of Religion, know who are Religious <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. That may bee clear and manifeſt to Religious perſons themſelves, which is either unknown or doubtfull, unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Secondly, When ſuch commands ſmile upon the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Commanders themſelves, or any prevailing party or faction of them, as upon their profits, pleaſures, honours, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, &amp;c. and withall lowre and frown upon the eaſe and acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations of the comminalty of the people under them. This is another manifeſt character or ſigne of their injuſtice, eaſie e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be diſcovered. Thirdly, (and laſtly,) When they have ſtrong and pregnant conjunction, in point of converſallity, whether privative or poſſitive, with any ſuch deſigne, whether reall, or juſtly ſuſpected, which tends either to the enſlaving of the generallity of the people, or to the extinguiſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating of their juſt rights and liberties; and withall, have no connexion at all, with any imaginable benefit or good, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall conſideration unto the people. This alſo is a pregnant character of iniuſtice in ſuch commands. Suppoſe there be no ſuch deſigne as wee ſpeake of really intended, as for the enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a free people (or their liberties) yet if there bee any ſtrong preſumption (much more i<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> many) that there is indeed ſuch a deſigne intended, ſo that there is a great Jealouſy and feare of ſuch a thing, generally fallen upon the people, yet in this caſe, for ſuperiours, eſpecially thoſe who are moſt ſuſpected
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114354:15"/>
for contrivers and drivers on of ſuch a deſigne, to command ſuch a thing, which hath a palpable and notorious conſiſtency, with ſuch a deſigne in caſe it be intended, and withall but a faint and ſlender connexion, eſpecially if none at all, with any proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable benefit unto the people, is at leaſt even in the beſt and moſt innocent tendency of it, to torment the people with fears and Jealouſy, which is uniuſt for theſe to do, whoſe intereſt of duty is, to be Nurfing Fathers unto them: and though there be no demonſtrative, or Logick ſentence, that ſuch or ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as we ſpeak of, comming from a perſon, one or more ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, of the deſigne ſpecified; hath a reall coniunction with ſuch a reall deſigne, yet if there be a politicall or morall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which ſtands in ſtrength and pregnancy of probability and preſumption, this is ſufficient to cleare and juſtifie, as well the iudgement, as the practice of thoſe; who iudging the ſaid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to be unlawfull and uniuſt, ſhall accordingly yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it. It is well obſerved by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> that a conſidering man ought onely to require and bee content with ſuch Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofs, as the nature of the ſubiect under conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whatſoever it be, will bear and admit. From Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians we may expect cloſe and exact demonſtrations, becauſe the ſubiect of this ſcience will beare it; but from Oratours, or men handling politicall, and morall matters, we ought to bee ſatisfied with probabilities, and topique arguments; becauſe the nature of ſuch ſubiects as theſe, will not admit of regular and perfect demonſtrations. Suppoſe a perſon, one or more, have a reall intention to deſtroy or enſlave a nation? it is not lightly poſſible for any other man poſſitively and with a Mathematical evidence, or certainty of knowledge to affirm it, untill it be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and then it is too late to prevent it. Therefore when there is a grand probability before us, a reſult of many circumſtances, ſtrongly inducing a beleef of ſuch an intention, it is ſufficient to build any ſuch practice or engagement upon, which is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the prevention of it. Thus in generall for anſwer to the main obiection and demand laſt propounded.</p>
               <p>For the particular I ſhall need to add little, all circumſtances

relating hereunto, being generally known unto this Kingdom. The command for the diſ-banding of the Army, being contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and procured by, and comming from ſuch perſons (though haply in coniunction with others) who are ſtrongly, and upon grounds wel-nigh irreſiſtable, ſuſpected of a machievation or deſigne deſtructive to the peace, lawfull Rights and Liberties of the Kingdom; and moreover, the ſaid command notoriouſly comporting with ſuch a deſigne as directly tending to breake in ſander that bar of Iron which only obſtructed the birth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of it; and yet farther, having no complyance at all with my conſiderable or proportionable good unto the nation: and yet more, being ſo exactly bent againſt, and level'd at the faces of ſuch as are really conſcientious and religiouſly peaceable in the Land; to whom the Army by reaſon of their union and power, were <hi>a little Sanctuary,</hi> and as that ſhaddow of a Rock in a weary Land. Theſe things laid together, and duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered cannot in the eye of any reaſonable or diſ-ingaged man but abundantly, and with honour acquit and vindicate the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in what they have done, though ten thouſand angry and impertinent Querents more, ſhould be levied againſt them, to attempt the avilement and abaſement of thoſe to whom the God of heaven hath ſaid, <hi>Be ye honourable amongst men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for that which is wont to bee objected, touching breach of priviledge of Parliament, it is of no conſideration or compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with the objections already anſwered; and beſides, there is abundantly ſufficient in the premiſſes, to cut the ſinewes of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch objection. Though priviledge of Parliament, really ſuch, and not ſimply but truely ſo called, bee truely honourable and little leſſe then the light, and life, and ſtrength of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the nation: yea, no man as yet hath, nor whileſt I live ſhall take away this crowne from my head, of beeing cordially zealous in the defence and maintainance of them; yet are they not of equall conſideration with the holy Lawes, and righteous commands of God. Therefore if theſe may, and ought not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the jealouſy of God over them, ſometimes want

Yea, it is a truth unqueſtionable, that nothing that it ſinfull, nothing that is inconſiſtent with the honour, peace, ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, juſt rights or liberties of the people, can for ever be, or make a priviledge of Parliament. And whileſt men act in a due and cl<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

And whether the Army have thus acted or no, I am freely willing to leave to the judgements and conſciences of all thoſe who have diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read, duly conſidered, and retain in memory what hath been argued in their behalf in their papers, to judge and determine.

               <p>The God of all grace and glory, continue the Parliament in a full and peaceable inioyment of all their priviledges and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; make ſtreight that which is croocked, ſweet that which is bitter, righteous that which is unjuſt, peaceable that which is troubleſome, holy that which is profane amongſt them; lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing in their Aſſembly that may offend either the eyes of his own glory, or the mindes of the ſober and wel-affected people of the Land.
