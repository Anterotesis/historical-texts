            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CONCERNING
<hi>Church-Communion,</hi>
WHEREIN
'Tis enquired whether the Doctor's
Notion of <hi>Church-Communion</hi> be not
too narrow and uncharitable, both
to Dissenters, and Men of larger
Principles.</p>
            <p>By a <hi>LAY-MAN</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
and in constant Communion with it.</p>

            <pb facs="tcp:52130:2"/>
            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>I Hope these Papers will not fall into any Man's
Hands, who counts it not a great blessing to have
Kings for <hi>Nursing Fathers</hi> to God's Church:
To have the true Religion establish'd and guarded
by humane Laws. And perhaps 'tis no absurdity
to suppose, that Men may as well continue Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the National Church, notwithstanding their break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
many positive Laws made for the outward manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ordering of it, tho' not fundamental and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to its being: As he who incurs the Penalty of any
Statute of the Realm about Civil Affairs, may however
be a sound Member of the State, if he keep from Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or other Capital Crimes.</p>
            <p>Nay possibly, That there should be several Religious
Assemblies living by different Customs and Rules, and yet
continuing Members of the National Church, is not more
inconsistent than that particular Places should have their
particular Customs and By-Laws differing from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law of the Land, without making a distinct Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, an outward Government in the Church is
requisite, if it were only for the restraining those Men who
out of confidence of their own Abilities, will be venting
Notions, which none but Men of great subtilty can make
one believe to be agreeable, either to Scripture, or to that
Doctrine to which they have subscribed and declared their
<hi>unfeigned Assent and Consent.</hi> And me-thinks it
were enough to remove Mens prejudices against Episcopal
<pb facs="tcp:52130:3"/>
Government, to consider how needful it is that some of the
most learned and discreet should be chosen from among the
Herd of Clergy-men, to oversee, admonish, and censure
those who are apt to go beyond their due Bounds. Yet
even within this Government, it may sometimes become
the Duty of one of the Laity, to take upon him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his Teacher, when he apprehends the Doctrine to be
dangerous: In which case, unless he remonstrate against
it, he may be thought to <hi>communicate</hi> with him in his
Error, which possibly may be as sinful as <hi>communicating
in a Schism,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> frights us with. Out
of respect to whom I must say, that I had rather be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken
in that sense which I conceive ought to be put upon
his Sermons about <hi>Church-Communion,</hi> than be able to
justify, That the Objections to which he never vouchsafed
an Answer, were meither impertinent to his Discourses,
nor frivolous.</p>
            <p>His Notion of a <hi>Political Union</hi> of true Believers to
Christ, I had long since read; but the hearing of it, fix'd
my Attention, and put me upon sending him my Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against it in a private manner.</p>
            <p>The more I think of his Sermons, the more I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
that they are contrary to the <hi>whole Tenor of the
Gospel,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of our <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Scripture tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10. 34, 35.</note> 
               <hi>That</hi> God is no respecter of
Persons: but in every Nation he that feareth him, and
worketh Righteousness, is accepted with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Doctor says, That the</hi>
               <note place="margin">Resol. of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pag. 5.</note> only visible way of
forming a Church, (for I do not now speak of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
Operations of the Divine Spirit) is by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Church-Covenant, which is the Divine Charter
whereon the Church is founded: And investing some
Persons with Power and Authority to receive others
into this Covenant,<note place="margin">lbid.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c. And then</hi> to be taken into
<pb facs="tcp:52130:3"/>
Covenant with God, and to be received into the
Church, is the very same thing.</p>
            <p>So it seems, according to him, no Man is in Covenant
with God, who is not actually received into Covenant by
a <hi>visible Church;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> that is, by the <hi>Bishops and Ministers
of the Church,</hi> As he elsewhere has it, speaking of what
<hi>makes any thing in a strict sense an Act of Church-Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed he may seem to have a reserve, when he says,<note place="margin">P. 5. supra.</note> he
<hi>speaks not of the invisible Operations of the Spirit:</hi> Yet
what room he leaves for that out of the Pale of a <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
visible Church,</hi> is a great Question, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
the <hi>Influences and Operations of the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to the Unity of the Church:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note> if he speaks
to the purpose, to Vniformity to that sound part of the
Catholick Church where a Man lives. But if a Man fall
into a Nation where there are no Bishops or inferior Clergy
authorised by them, the Lord have Mercy upon his Soul:
for 'tis a question how that Scripture can be fulfilled, which
saith, <hi>God is no respecter of Persons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if the Bishops where he lives, fall out, Wo be to him
if his Bishop be singular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And God knows, but one of the Primitive Fathers,</hi>
Tertullian, <hi>notwithstanding all his Zeal for the Christian
Religion, lies in Purgatory to this day, with all his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
to</hi> St. Austin'<hi>s Time: For though, as</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cave</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. Apostol. Fol. 211.</note> 
               <hi>Dr. Cave
says in his excuse,</hi> He lived in an Age when a greater
latitude of opining was indulged; and good Men
were infinitely more solicitous about Piety and a good
Life, than about the Modes of Speech, and how to
express every thing so critically, that it should not be
liable to a severe Scrutiny and Examination. <hi>Yet this
good Man having had Disputes with others of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Fathers; the Doctor tells us,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ib. Fol. 210.</note> Whether ever he was
<pb facs="tcp:52130:4"/>
reconciled to Catholick Communion appears not: 'tis
certain, for the main, he forsook the <hi>Cataphrygians,</hi>
and kept his <hi>separate Meetings</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> and his
Church was yet remaining in St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s time: By
whose Labours, the very Reliques of his Followers
called <hi>Tertullianists,</hi> were dispers'd and quite disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
            <p>What our Church determines in this case, we may see in
the 19th Article.<note place="margin">2dly.</note> And I will leave it to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> to
reconcile himself to its Doctrine in this Point: Which is,
That,</p>
            <p>The Church visible of Christ,<note place="margin">19th Artic.</note> is a Congregation of
faithful Men, in which the pure Word of God is
preached; and the Sacraments be duly ministred, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Christ's Ordinance, in all those things that
of necessity are requisite to the same.</p>
            <p>If any Man tax me with undermining the Authority
of the Church, in objecting against Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s way
of supporting it, Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> has furnish'd me with
a sufficient Apology;</p>
            <p>Men of any common understanding (<hi>says he</hi>)
would distinguish between the necessaries of Life and
of civil Society:<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> Answer to several Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by his Book about Idolatry. Pag. 275.</note> So would any one but <hi>S. C.</hi> or <hi>N. O.</hi>
of the Necessaries to Salvation, and to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Church. For Men must be considered
as Christians, and then as Christians united together.
As in Civil Societies they are to be considered, first as
men, and then as <hi>Cives.</hi> To say that a Man hath all
that is necessary to preserve his Life as a Man, doth
not overthrow the Constitution of a Society, altho'
it implies that he might live without it. So when Men
are considered barely as Christians, no more ought
to be thought necessary for them as such, but what
makes them capable of Salvation. But if we consider
<pb facs="tcp:52130:4"/>
them as joining together in a Christian Society, then
many other things are necessary for that end: For
then there must be Authority in some, and Subjection
in others; there must be Orders and Constitutions,
whereby all must be kept within their due Bounds:
And there must be Persons appointed to instruct the
Ignorant, to satisfy the Doubting,<note place="margin">Pag. 276.</note> to direct the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful,
and to help the Weak. It belongs to such a
Society, not barely to provide for Necessity, but
Safety; and not meerly the safety of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but of it Self: which cannot be done, without
prudent Orders fixing the Bounds of Mens Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and not suffering every pretender to Visions
and Revelations, to set up for a new Sect, or which is
all one, a new Order of Religious Men.</p>
            <p>This I should think were enough, not only to justify
me, but to draw to my side all the moderate Church-men;
yet that it may not be said that I bring but one Doctor's
Opinion against another, I shall take in the Suffrage of
the worthy Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and that delivered very
solemnly in the presence of his Sacred Majesty.</p>
            <p>I do assure you,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Tillot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son's</hi> Serm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 1 Cor. 3. 15. last Ed. Pag. 59.</note> (<hi>says that great Man in his Sermon at Court</hi>)
I had much rather perswade any one to be
a good Man, than to be of any Party or Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Christians whatsoever; for I doubt not but
the belief of the Ancient Creed, provided we entertain
nothing that is destructive of it, together with a good
Life, will certainly save a Man; and without this, no
Man can have reasonable hopes of Salvation, no not
in an infallible Church, if there were any such to be
found in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But since the setling the true Notion of</hi> Schism <hi>will go
a great way towards the satisfying our Enquiries in this
Matter,</hi> it may not be improper to transcribe some part of
<pb facs="tcp:52130:5"/>
Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s <hi>sense of it, where he vindicates the
Church of</hi> England <hi>from the imputation of Schism;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stilling.</hi> Rational Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. <hi>p.</hi> 359.</note> The
Being of the Catholick Church, <hi>says he,</hi> lies in essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials,
for a Particular Church to disagree from all
other Particular Churches, in some extrinsecal and
accidental Things, is not to separate from the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Church, so as to cease to be a <hi>Church;</hi> but still,
whatever <hi>Church</hi> makes such extrinsecal things the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Conditions of Communion, so as to cast Men
out of the <hi>Church,</hi> who yield not to them, is Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
in so doing; for it thereby divides it self
from the <hi>Catholick-Church;</hi> and the Separation from
it, is so far from being Schism, that being cast out of that
Church on those terms only, returns them to the
Communion of the <hi>Catholick-Church.</hi> On which
ground it will appear, that <hi>the Church of Rome</hi> is the
<hi>Schismatical Church,</hi> and not Ours. For, although
before this <hi>imposing Humour</hi> came into particular <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
Schism was defin'd by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> and others,
to be a <hi>voluntary departure out of the Church;</hi> yet that
cannot in reason be understood of any Particular, but
the <hi>true Catholick Church:</hi> for not only Persons, but
<hi>Churches</hi> may depart from the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> and
in such Cases, not those who depart from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of such <hi>Churches,</hi> but those <hi>Churches</hi> which
depart from the Catholick, are guilty of the Schism.</p>

            <head>Three LETTERS to Dr. Sherlock,
upon his Sermons concerning Church-Communion.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>NOT doubting but you will be willing to
stoop to the capacity of the meanest of
your Auditory; I who have often heard
you with great satisfaction, and I hope not
without edifying thereby, take leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
to you, as nigh as I can, in your
own words, what I conceive to have been the substance of
your Discourse this last <hi>Sunday,</hi> upon I Cor. 12. 27. [<hi>Now
ye are the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.</hi>] And
to propound some <hi>Queries,</hi> which perhaps you may think
fit, in some part at least, to take notice of in your further
progress upon this nice Subject. However I hope you will
candidly interpret this friendly Intimation from one who is
a Member of the same Church with you, and is as hearty
<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> his desires of a firm Union amongst Protestants as any
Man can be: And therefore is the more concern'd at any
Discourse which may represent all Dissenters, as such, as
Men depriv'd of the ordinary means of Salvation, and
consequently to be in as bad a case as the Moral Heathens.
And (as most Men of such Notions believe, or would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer)
in a worse condition than those of the Romish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:52130:6"/>
Which I hope was not in your Intention, how
liable soever your Assertions may seem to that Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Not but that many things which you then taught us
are of a far different import.</p>
            <p>Be pleas'd to take your own again, with as little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the words, or order in which they were delivered,
as may be, without the Repetition of many things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
'tis convenient to lengthen out a Sermon.</p>
            <p>You may remember that you told us, That,
<q>The Church is a Body of Men separated from the
World, and united to God and themselves by a Divine
Covenant: That 'tis an entire Body, and every Member
united to the whole Church by Christian Communion.
That our Saviour ordained the Apostles, and gave the
Government of the Church to them and their Successors,
with a promise to be with them to the end of the World.
That there can be but one Church where all Priviledges
and Duties are common, And but one and the same Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of God's Appointment: That the Gospel-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
is the Foundation of the Christian Church. God
only can make a Church, not Man's Invention. The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
way God has of forming a Church is, by granting a
Church-Covenant, and investing some Persons with
power of receiving others according to the Terms, with
such Rites as they are pleas'd to institute. As that can
be no Church which is not in Covenant with God, so he
can be no Member who is not visibly admitted into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:52130:6"/>
You farther observ'd, under distinct Heads,
<q>
                  <p>1. That a Covenant-State, and a Church-State, is the
same.</p>
                  <p>2. Every profess'd Christian received into Covenant is
a Member.</p>
                  <p>3. Nothing else is necessary to make Members but Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism.</p>
                  <p>4. A Church-State cannot depend upon humane Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
or Covenant: 'Tis God's Covenant which is in our
Church required of the Adult. The Independents found
their Church upon humane Contract, which they will not
say is any part of the Baptismal Vow.</p>
                  <p>5. 'Tis absurd to gather Churches out of Churches of
Baptiz'd Christians.</p>
                  <p>6. The Doctrine of the Unity of the Church confirm'd
from the Notion of a Charter to any Body Politick. They
who are not admitted into the Corporation, have no
right to the Privileges; and are Usurpers, if they exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
any Act belonging to the Members. God considers
all Men as united into one Church or Body, has made no
Covenant with <hi>Geneva</hi> or <hi>England</hi> in particular. The
only thing that can give us right to Church-Membership,
is to observe the Conditions of the Covenant. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroys
the Unity of the Church, who is not subject to its
Censures. Every Member is a Member of the Whole:
Baptism does not make us Members of any particular
Church, but of the Universal, founded only on Divine
Covenant. Every Act of Christian Communion must be
an Act of Communion with the whole Church: And 'tis
impossible to live in Communion with the whole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Communion with some part, when it <hi>may be had:</hi>'
Tis necessary to communicate with some Church, by
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52130:7"/>
Communion with the Church in which we live, <hi>if it be a
sound</hi> Member; I communicate with the whole. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Primitive Rule of but one Bishop in a City,
they who divide from the National Church are guilty of
Schism. Nothing can justify Division, but such a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
as hinders the Exercise of Joint-Communion.</p>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>To sum up what I take to be the force of all this.</p>
            <p>The Apostles and their Successors were by our Saviour
invested with a power of receiving Members into his
Church upon his Terms, and with such Rites as they should
think fit. And they who are not so receiv'd into the
Church, have no right to any of the Benefits promis'd to
the Members of Christ's Body.</p>
            <p>This Power is by an uninterrupted Succession derived
upon the Governors of our National Church; Wherefore
all others that pretend to the exercise of this Power within
this Nation, are Usurpers: And all the Laity baptiz'd by
their Pastors, not being duly admitted into any particular
Church, are so far from being Members of Christ's Body,
that they are Usurpers and Traitors to that Power which
is deriv'd from him in a right Line. <hi>Durus hic Sermo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I may well upon the whole desire, that you
would seriously consider;</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>Whether</hi> a pious Dissenter, suppos'd to be received
into the Church by such as he believes to be fully invested
with sufficient Church-power, is in as bad a condition as a
moral Heathen, or in a worse than a Papist?</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>Whether</hi> the submission to the Power and Censures
of this Church (which all must own to be a sound Church)
be part of the Divine Covenant, which unites the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52130:7"/>
of the Catholick Church to God and to each other?
If it be, then as he who is not admitted into this Church,
is no Member of the Catholick, and has no right to the
Benefits of being a Member of Christ's Body: So it is
with every one excluded by Church-Censures, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
for a slight contempt or neglect, nay for a
wrongful Cause.</p>
            <p>If it be no part of the Divine Covenant, then a Man
that lives here may be a true Member of the Catholick
Church, though he is not in Communion with this sound
Church.</p>
            <p>But you will say, (which I think is not much to this
Question), That he ought to communicate if Communion
may be had.</p>
            <p>But then <hi>Query, Whether</hi> the Dissenters may not reply,
That they are ready to communicate, if the Communion
be not clogg'd with some things which are no part of the
Divine Covenant? As for instance, An adult Person would
be baptized if he could be admitted without the Sign of
the Cross: Or would receive the Sacrament, if he might
not be obliged to kneel; Which he supposes to have been
in use, and required, only since the Doctrine of Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation
divided the Church.</p>
            <p>Yet however, <hi>Query;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>Whether</hi> where Communion may not be had upon
those Terms which our Saviour Instituted, a Church may
not, at least in some cases, be gathered; without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
derivation from other Church-Governors besides
Christ himself? if it may not, What think you of a Lay-Christian
quietly permitted to teach the Word of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Heathens, and to Disciple such as will receive his
Doctrine? If a Church in such case may be erected, then
surely <hi>God's only way of forming Churches, and investing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52130:8"/>
some Persons with Power of receiving others,</hi> is not from a
constant succession from the Apostles, but from under his
Institution who has appointed a Power in his Church,
which expires no more with any particular Governors than
the Power of Kings, his Vicegerents, dies in any Nation
for want of some Monarch just going before, from whom
the Claim is to be made. Though the Power of a King
be God's Power, yet I dare say you will own, that at least
in some Kingdoms, a King may be duly chosen to this Power
by Men.</p>
            <p>You will say perhaps, (though still the force of my
Objection will remain) that this is an extraordinary Case
of utmost necessity, not to be instanced in amongst us.
But then I ask;</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Whether</hi> upon allowing no other Case, you will not
put the Being of our Church upon a very hazardous Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
and oblige your self to prove that it was a True
Church before the Reformation?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Whether</hi> supposing this Church to have been Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
before, (which I think is the Doctrine of our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies);
The Case I put of a Layman's discipling Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,
supposes a more violent necessity of acting without
Authority from a succession of Church-Officers, than at
least 'tis possible may be the Case of our own Church?</p>
            <p>(4.) <hi>Q. Whether</hi> from the Supposition, that there ought to
be but one Church-Covenant throughout the Catholick
Church, that there cannot be one True Church within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother;
and that the nature of Catholik-Communion is
such, that one ought to be ready to communicate with any
sound Church, from which one is not hindred by reason of
the distance of place? It do's not not follow;</p>
            <p>1. Either that the French Protestants have no Church
here, but are Schismaticks in not communicating with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52130:8"/>
ours; Or that ours is guilty of Schism, in making the
Terms of Communion so streight, that it is not the Duty
of every one (though a licensed Stranger) to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
with this Church.</p>
            <p>2. Does it not follow from the Obligation to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate,
or to be ready to communieate with any True
Church where distance does not hinder, that a Member
of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not obliged to constant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Church, but may occasionally commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate
with the French Church; Nay with Dissenters too,
if he believes that any of their Congregations is a true
Member of the Catholick Church?</p>
            <p>If they may, then constant Communion is not always a
Duty where occasional is lawful.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> indeed says, That if a Man were <hi>obliged
to be a Member</hi> of the French Church, or the like, and
<hi>thought it lawful to communicate sometimes, constant Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
would be a Duty.</hi> But according to you no Man is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to be a Member of one sound Church more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
provided the distance is not so great, but that he may
communicate with both.</p>
            <p>(5.) <hi>Query, Whether</hi> a true Christian, though not visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
admitted into Church-Communion, where he wants
the means, has not a virtual Baptism in <hi>the Answer of a
good Conscience towards God?</hi> according to 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21.</p>
            <p>(6.) <hi>Query, Why</hi> a profess'd Atheist who has been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd,
and out of secular Interest continues a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
with this Church, is more a Member of the Catholick
Church than such as are above described?</p>
            <p>(7.) <hi>Query, Whether</hi> as the Catholick Church is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
to a Body of Men incorporated by one Charter,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52130:9"/>
upon supposition of a possibility of the Forfeiture of a
Charter to the whole Body, by the miscarriages of any of the
Officers, Does it likewise follow that the Miscarriages of
Church-Officers, or the Church Representative, as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
Bishop <hi>Sanderson</hi> calls the Clergy, may forfeit the
Privileges given by Christ to his Church, or at least may
suspend them? As suppose a Protestant Clergy, taking
their Power to be as large as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> claim'd,
should deny the Laity the Sacraments, as the Popish did in
<hi>Venice,</hi> and here in King <hi>John</hi>'s Time, during the Interdicts.
<hi>Quid inde operatur?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But more particularly I shall make Observations upon
these following Positions.</p>
            <p>1. You say, Our Saviour made the Apostles and their
Successors Governors of his Church, with promise to be
with them to the end of the World.</p>
            <p>2. That 'tis absurd to gather a Church out of a Church
of Baptiz'd Christians.</p>
            <p>3. That the Independents separate from Catholick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
by adding a New Covenant, no part of the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal
Vow.</p>
            <p>For the first: I desire to be satisfied in these Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p>1. Whether our Saviour's Promise of Divine Assistance,
did not extend to all the Members of the Church, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
every Man in his respective Station and Capacity, as
well as to the Apostles as Church-Governors? for which
you may compare St. <hi>John</hi> with St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Therefore <hi>Query,</hi> Whether it signifies any thing to
say there is no Promise to Particular Churches, provided
there be to Particular Persons, such as are in Charity with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52130:9"/>
all Men, and are ready to communicate with any Church
which requires no more of them, than what they conceive
to be their Duty, according to the Divine Covenant?</p>
            <p>3. Whether if the Promise you mention be confin'd to
the Apostles, as Church-Governors, it will not exclude
the Civil Power?</p>
            <p>4. What was the extent of the Promise, Whether it
was to secure the whole Church, that its Governors should
never impose unlawful Terms of Communion, or that there
should never be a general defection of all the Members of
the Catholick Church; but that there should always be
some true Members?</p>
            <p>But secondly, you say, 'Tis absur'd to gather a Church
out of a Church of baptized Christians.</p>
            <p>By which I suppose you mean that Men ought not to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
from such, and live in a distinct Church-Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from any Church of baptized Christians; which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
needs explaining.</p>
            <p>But as it was worded, I desire to know,</p>
            <p>1. Whether it is absurd for Protestants to live in Church-Communion
with each other in <hi>France,</hi> separating from the
Papists, whose is the National Church?</p>
            <p>2. Whether the Civil Power did not make a lawful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
and Separation from the Popish Church in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Whether as in the Primitive Times there was but one
Bishop, and consequently but one Church in a City, there
are not now as many Churches within the National as there
are Bishopricks?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:52130:10"/>
4. Whether is it more absurd that there should be Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
or Presbyterian Churches within the National, than
that there should be so many Bishopricks?</p>
            <p>5. Suppose it possible for every of their Congregations
to be a Church, with sufficient Church-Officers and Power,
then may they not communicate with a sound part of the
Catholick-Church without actual Communion with the
National: And consequently all that you have said of
their Schism will fall.</p>
            <p>6. Admit they bring but colourable Proof for this, yet
if it be enough to make honest-minded Men believe it,
dare you say that those who so believe are no true Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ's Body? For God's sake, Sir, consider
this, and think with your self, whether your Charity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
that of the Romish Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3dly,</hi> You suppose that the Independents exclude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from Catholick Communion, by requiring of their
Members a New Contract, no part of the Baptismal Vow-Upon
this I ask,</p>
            <p>1. Whether any Obstacle to Catholick Communion
brought in by Men, may not be a means of depriving Men
of it, as well as Covenant or Contract?</p>
            <p>2. If it may, which I suppose you will not deny, will
you not then, upon this account, make the Church
you live in more guilty than you do the Independents?
Baptism you own is the only thing which admits into the
Catholick Church; but they require no New Covenant
at Baptism, <hi>ergo,</hi> they admit into the Church without any
clog or hindrance of humane Invention.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52130:10"/>
But <hi>Query,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The</hi> 30th <hi>Canon calls it,</hi> a lawful outward Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and honourable Badg; <hi>Whereby</hi> the Infant is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Service of him who died upon the Cross.</note> Whether if an adult
Person may not be received to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
without being sign'd with the
sign of the Cross: Which some,
at least, may honestly scruple, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
such as read the Canon,
which explains the sense in which
'tis used. How is this justifyable upon your Ground?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I take leave to ask a few <hi>Questions</hi> about the
meaning of your Text and Context.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Query.</hi> Whether to say ye are the Body, and ye are
of the Body, be the same?</p>
            <p>2. Whether therefore the Individual Church of <hi>Corinth</hi>
is not here made an entire Body, of which every Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
in Communion with it was a particular Member?</p>
            <p>3. And whether 'tis absurd that our Saviour should have
a Metaphorical Body, which is in him, and he in it;
Where-ever there is a number of True Believers following
all the Institutes, and exercising all the Discipline which they
can have, according to the best of their understanding and
means?</p>
            <p>4. Whether when Schism is in the <hi>25th</hi> Verse used in
opposition to having <hi>the same care for one another,</hi> it does
not shew that Schism consists not in the dividing Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
through difference of Opinions, but through want
of Charity, and that care which Christians in the same
Neighbourhood ought to have of each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:52130:11"/>
After all that I have offer'd to your consideration, I
must own that these are the sudden thoughts of one who
believes he may be saved without understanding the Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Church-Government as 'tis intreagu'd between
Clergy-men of all sides. And believes the Church of
<hi>England</hi> to be a True Church, notwithstanding it and the
Romish might formerly have been Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;<note place="margin">

            </opener>
            <p>NOT doubting your candor and integrity, I went to
Church this day with full expectation of your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting,
at least, to clear your way from the Objections
I had sent you, before you expatiated upon your, as I
may call it, uncharitable Hypothesis. Surely every thing
which I urged is not to be contemned; but I must needs
say, I could not meet with one Passage in your last Sermon
which look'd like so much as an offer towards my satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
Wherefore I conjure you, as a Protestant Divine,
to answer my Doubts categorically. For which end, I
hope you will not refer me to what Mr. D—or any
profest Papist has wrote on this Subject, unless you will
avow all that they have said on the necessity of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Priest to concur with his Acts, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>Your last Discourse occasions only my adding this far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Query.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether if the nature of Catholick Communion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a readiness to communicate with any sound Church,
and yet a Church obliges us to communicate with that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
while distance does not hinder the occasional and
frequent communion with others? Is not that Church guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Schism in such an Injunction, contrary to the nature
of Catholick Communion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:52130:12"/>
Or at least is it not impossible that he who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
sometimes with one True Church, sometimes with
another, can be a Schismatick, or any more than an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
against a positive humane Law.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce it is more than probable that I have occasioned
the speedy printing of your Discourses concerning
<hi>Church-Communion.</hi> I am now become a Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to the <hi>Churches of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> to publish those
Objections which arose in my mind, and
which you have not yet thought fit to answer, though ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
press'd thereunto.</p>
            <p>And me-thinks you who have heretofore been a zealous
Patron for universal Grace, should be very ready to clear
your self from the least imputation of stinting it more than
our most gracious God, nay than your most narrow prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipled
Adversaries have ever done.</p>
            <p>Though he who questions the Dictates of his Spiritual
Guids, had need run to the protection of Obscurity; yet
one would think, that he who prints in the dark what he
<hi>publish'd on the House top,</hi> before the Face of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
brings a foul suspition upon his Doctrine. 'Tis well
known that the Pulpit is more licensed from Contradiction
than the Press; wherefore the former is most properly as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
for a Clergy-mans Recantation: Nor indeed did I
think you far from making publick satisfaction, when you
own'd, (in your Sermon preach'd <hi>Feb.</hi> 11. on <hi>Luke 12.
vers. 4, 5.)</hi> 
               <q>That the Censures of the Church are <hi>formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable</hi>
only when duly applied; and that God Almighty
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52130:13"/>
has not trusted <hi>fallible</hi> Men with a power of shutting out
those whom he will receive.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Keep to this, and make good your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>Schism</hi> if you can:<note place="margin">The Dr's. Resol. of Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to Church-Com. p. 49.</note> 
               <hi>If Schism be,</hi>
as you say, <hi>a very great Sin, and such as
will damn us, as soon as Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
God forbid that it should consist in
such ticklish Points as would place many
thousands of truly charitable and pious Men within the
fatal Roll.</p>
            <p>But to my thinking, while you blame Men for having
<hi>no Notion at all of a Church, or no Notion of
one Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib.</hi> pag. 50.</note> and that they <hi>know not</hi> wherein
the Unity and Communion <hi>of this Church
consists,</hi> you remove their Guilt, and grant that their
Schism is involuntary, and only an Error of their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings.
Alas! mistaken honest Men, how unhappy
is your condition, who must be damn'd for not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> when he fancies that he puts Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<hi>past all doubt!</hi> tho others may think he only amuses
People with equivocal Words and Terms.</p>
            <p>I beg of you to consider, whether you do not impose
upon your self, or would not upon others by a confused
notion of the <hi>Church,</hi> and of separation from it, wherein
you make <hi>Schism</hi> to consist.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great is Diana of the Ephesians,</hi> and great is the use of
the word <hi>Church,</hi> when good <hi>Crafts-masters</hi> have the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it; and of all Men those of <hi>Rome</hi> have succeeded
best at this play of words. By the using it indefinitely
as you do, the Pope keeps the Kevs of Heaven and
Hell at his Girdle; and truly this in some Cases compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
things as different as Heaven and Hell are, such as
shall be sav'd, and such as are already under the dominion
of Satan. If you use it for several purposes, I hope for
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52130:13"/>
the future you will define what you mean by the
<hi>Church,</hi> when you are to consider it as Catholick
and Universal, what when you take it in a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd
sence, otherwise you speak not like a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of the Gospel, but as one that would pervert
that use of words which in you especially God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
designed for instructing us candidly in the
Truth.</p>
            <p>Indeed you may play a little more securely with
the word <hi>Schism,</hi> because (unless it be taken to lie
wholly in want of Charity) People may not so well
understand what it is, how distinctly soever the
Notion of <hi>Churches</hi> be taught them; surely 'tis much
a question whether it lies wholly in causless separation
from a sound part of the <hi>Catholick Church.</hi> To my
thinking, St. <hi>Paul</hi> when he speaks of it, supposes a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
still of the same Body, and ascribes it to
Christians continuing such, nay, and communicating
with each other. Thus writing to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> of
whom he says;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ye are the Body of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> 
               <hi>and Members in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi>
He tells you, to this effect, that there is but one
Spirit which communicates it self amongst them in
various Dispensations, and enables them, according
to their different Capacities and Attainments, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
each others growth in Grace. And then
having compared them to the several parts of a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Body;<note place="margin">Vers. 24.</note>
            </p>
            <p>God, <hi>saith he,</hi> hath tempered the Body together, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
given more abundant honour to that part which
lacked.</p>
            <p>That there should be no Schism in the Body,<note place="margin">Vers. 25.</note> but that
the Members should have the same care for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:52130:14"/>
Which seems no more than that God obliges the
Members of his <hi>Church</hi> to live together charitably,
and to be ready to assist each other from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the distribution of his Gifts and Graces in
such manner, that even the meanest and most despised
Christian may administer Aid and Comfort to those
that are in the highest Station.</p>
            <p>But all this was written to the <hi>Church</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note>
that <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> there, which assembled together
<hi>in the same place,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 3.</note> and yet the <hi>Apostle</hi> charges them
with <hi>real Schism;</hi> for, says he;</p>
            <p>Whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and
divisions; are ye not carnal, and walk as Men?</p>
            <p>But from the Apostle's Notion of <hi>Schism,</hi> I shall
come to yours, as you have jumbled it together with
the equivocal word <hi>Church;</hi> of which you would
make one believe, that there can be no true <hi>Idea,</hi>
but as particular visible, nay, and that <hi>national too;</hi>
wherefore be pleased to weigh a little with your
self:</p>
            <p>1. Whether you do not appropriate that to the
<hi>National Church,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cases of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corning Church Commun. <hi>p.</hi> 10.</note> which belongs to the <hi>Catholick</hi> visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and invisible? As where you say,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>No Man has</hi> a right to any Act of Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
but he who is in a state of Communion with the
Christian Church.<note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> 
               <hi>that</hi> no Man is in Communion with
a Church which he is not a Member of:<note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> 
               <hi>And that</hi> he is
no Member of the Church, who is not at least visibly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into God's Covenant by Baptism.</p>
            <p>Now I would ask you this plain Question.</p>
            <p>Whether a Man has a right to be of a particular
<hi>Church,</hi> as he is a Christian; that is, I should think,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:52130:14"/>
a true Member of the <hi>Catholick Church:</hi> or becomes a
Christian only as receiv'd into a particular <hi>Church?</hi>
I take it, Infants are received with us, by virtue of
the federal right in the Parents; and as the Apostle
says, <hi>The believing Wife sanctifies the unbelieving Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
else were the Children unclean.</hi> Nor I conceive
doth our Church receive any adult Person, whom it
does not believe to be a true Christian before?</p>
            <p>But to make your Fallacy the more evident,
you tell us;
<q>The Divine Spirit confines his Influences
and Operations to the Unity of the Church,<note place="margin">Pag. 48.</note>
as the same Apostle tells us, That there is
but one Body, and one Spirit; which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
signifies that the Operations of this one
Spirit are appropriated to this one Body, as
the Soul is to the Body it animates.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would fain know what need any Man
has to deny this for avoiding the Consequence,
that therefore 'tis an improper way for <hi>edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
to forsake Communion with a National
sound Church where he lives; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
makes it as plain as words can make it,
that he speaks of the <hi>Invisible,</hi> as well as Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<hi>Church.</hi> For the Passage you cite, <hi>Ephes.</hi>
4. 4. is but a continuation of what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:52130:15"/>
taught in the foregoing Chapter, where
he says;</p>
            <p>For this cause I bow my Knees unto the Father of
our Lord Jesus Christ.<note place="margin">Eph. 3. 14.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Of whom the whole Family in Heaven and in Earth
is named.<note place="margin">Vers. 15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This which is there called a <hi>Family,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4. 16.</note> is else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<hi>the whole Body</hi> of which <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Head,</hi>
the increase and <hi>edifying</hi> of which Body <hi>in love</hi>
is ascribed to his Influence. If I should enter
my self of another Family, not owned by
Christ, I <hi>thereby</hi> should renounce all claim to
the Promises of the Gospel: But admit seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of this great Family live by different
Customs and Rules,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> not <hi>owning each others
Members for their own;</hi> in which case you will
have them <hi>separate Churches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 22.</note> as well as upon
the account of <hi>Doctrine, Government,</hi> or <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi>
provided the things wherein they differ,
and for which they make distinct <hi>Communions,</hi>
are not destructive of common Christianity;
doth he put himself out of Christ's Family,
who can and actually doth comply with the
Rules and Customs of both? One would think
that a Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
with <hi>Presbyterians</hi> here, does not
<hi>thereby</hi> enter into a state of Separation, even
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:52130:15"/>
from this Particular Church, because he does
not <hi>thereby</hi> so much as virtually renounce the
Communion of our Church, being nothing is
required of him to capacitate him for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them which is not required in
our Church, much less any thing contrary to
it; and perhaps the Independents may come
within the last circumstance: But to be sure,
neither of them forsake our Church in what
essentially constitutes it a Church of Christ: and
therefore it does yet remain a Question, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this can be a separation from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> that happy Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>You know even, in the Primitive Times, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the end of the second Century, there fell
out a Division between the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Asian
Churches,</hi> and that upon what one would think
were neither Matter of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> of <hi>Government,</hi>
nor of <hi>Worship,</hi> for it was only about the Time
of keeping <hi>Easter Holy-day. Victor</hi> the Bishop of
the <hi>Latin Church,</hi> in a <hi>Council,</hi> or as some will
have it, a full representative of that <hi>Church</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates
the poor <hi>Asians</hi> for a little mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake
in Arithmetick; each Church was far
from <hi>owning the others Members as its own.</hi> Here
was a <hi>Schism.</hi> perhaps on both sides, especially
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52130:16"/>
on theirs who were so peremptory in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
their own computation for <hi>Catholick.</hi> But
what should the poor Lay Christians do in this
divided state, could they not Communicate
with both, or either, without danger of Schism
themselves? or, was it as necessary to know
which was in the right,<note place="margin">Pag. 37.</note> as to know <hi>which is the
True Religion?</hi> 'Twas not enough in such case
to know <hi>which of these divided Communions</hi> was
<hi>a true and sound Member of the Catholick Church;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note>
which when known, they were <hi>bound to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
with;</hi> for here both were sound Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
at least they might be, notwithstanding
this Difference: And yet according to you,
they who communicated with both these, were
<hi>contrary to themselves,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 40.</note> 
               <hi>and on one side or other went
sure to be Schismaticks:</hi> and if you please, you
may say the <hi>Prayers and Sacraments</hi> in those
Churches,<note place="margin">Pag. 17.</note> were <hi>not Acts of Christian Communion,
but of Schismatical Combinations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, secondly,<note place="margin">2dly.</note> I must desire you to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
whether you do not enforce the necessity
of communicating with the <hi>National Church,</hi>
from Arguments which prove no more, than
that Men ought to serve God in publick in
distinct Congregations, as well as in private
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52130:16"/>
and so apply that to a <hi>National Church,</hi> which
belongs to the <hi>Church</hi> in a more limited sense?
But this is no wonder, since you manifestly
go upon the Supposition, that there can be no
True <hi>Church</hi> which is not National, at least,
which is not the only true Church within the
Nation or City where one resides. Upon
which Ground you affirm; That,
<q>Actual Communion,<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> during our residence
in any certain place, must be confined to that
particular Church in which we live, if it be
a sound part of the Christian Church;</q> 
               <hi>or, as
you elsewhere vary it,</hi> 
               <q>the sound and orthodox
Part of the Catholick Church which he finds
in that place.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if there be a possibility that there
should be several sound and orthodox Parts
in the same place, be it the same City or same
Nation, all your building here falls to the
Ground. Wherefore I desire you to consider,
whether it is not possible that at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> for the
purpose, or any other place where the <hi>Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>
Religion is Ethnick, there may be several
sound parts of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as the <hi>Greek</hi>
or the French Protestants, and the English
Churches, with either of which one may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
as sound parts of the <hi>Catholick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:52130:17"/>
But to come back to your method of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all into the <hi>National,</hi> you tell us that you
<q>suppose no Man will deny but that every
Christian is bound to worship God according
to our Saviour's Institution;<note place="margin">Pag. 33.</note> and what that is,
we cannot learn better than from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the Primitive Christians; of whom
St. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us this account,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 42.</note> 
                  <hi>They continued
stedfast in the Apostles Doctrine and Worship, and
in breaking of Bread.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>According to your own Argument here,
would it not seem that the only Church of our
Saviour's instituting, is such an one as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 23. where 'tis said, <hi>If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole Church be come together into one place,
and all speak with Tongues, and there come in those
that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say
that ye are mad?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Pray, <hi>Sir,</hi> is it absurd to suppose, that there
should be several such Churches in a City?
May not every one of these have lawful terms
of communion, such as an honest minded Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
may submit unto, though some of them
may have harder than others? May not such a
Man be more especially united in Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
(be it as a Member, or how you will
call it) to that which he thinks the best, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:52130:17"/>
yet occasionally communicate with others,
without being an occasional Member of
Christ's Body which, is but one, united in
Charity under differences of Opinions and
Practices?</p>
            <p>Admit that two of these Churches divide
from each other by separate <hi>Communion,</hi> and
by making more things necessary to <hi>Communion</hi>
with either than Christ made,<note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> make <hi>a Schism
and Rent in Christ's Body;</hi> why does it follow
that he who can and does communicate with
both, as requiring nothing of him which he
looks upon as sinful, must needs be guilty of
Schism? which if you think it a clearer Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
you may call <hi>communicating in a
Schism.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To follow you in your Repetitions, to this
purpose you assert,<note place="margin">Pag. 41.</note> 
               <q>That we must perform
the constant Acts of Communion in that
part of the Catholick Church, in which we
constantly live and communicate occasional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
with that part of the Church where we
are occasionally present.</q> And that,
<q>There cannot be two distinct Churches in
the same place,<note place="margin">Pag. 42.</note> one for occasional, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for constant Communion without
Schism: for it is evident those two are distinct
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:52130:18"/>
                  <hi>Communions,</hi> and that our Relation to them is
as different as it is to an House we live in, and
to an Inn where we lodg for a Night.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it is evident that one of these must need
be cut off from Christ's Body; if not, why
may I not communicate with one, or both,
and thereby communicate with the <hi>Catholick
Church?</hi> But besides, how came you here to
talk of a different Relation, and as if that
look'd like <hi>occasional Membership,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 39.</note> by which you
elsewhere would expose such Communion?
When before you had told us,<note place="margin">Pag. 14.</note> That <hi>the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Church does not make us Members of
any particular Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then again, how does it appear that it is
necessary to communion with the <hi>Catholick
Church,</hi> that <hi>we must perform the constant Acts of
Communion,</hi> in that part of the <hi>Catholick Church</hi>
where we constantly lives.</p>
            <p>Farther, is it self-evident that I am bound
to communicate so much as sometimes with a
sound part of the Catholick Church, because
I live where there is such an one? You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
vvhat Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> said to this
purpose, with the approbation of the great
Learned Men of this Time.
<q>If, <hi>says that Admirable Author,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 15.</note> your require
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:52130:18"/>
the belief of any Error among the conditions
of your Communion, our Obligation to
communicate with you ceases, and so the
imputation of Schism to us vanishes into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but lies heavy upon you for making
our Separation from you just and necessary,
by requiring <hi>unnecessary</hi> and unlawful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
of Communion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Truly I should think that that which essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
makes one a Member of Christ, and so of
his Church, is the Faith of the Lord Jesus
Christ, this is fundamental to it, intrinsecal
and essential. What is external and visible in
respect of the Members which are gathered to
Christ the Head of the Church, is subject to
changes and various circumstances of this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
World. And 'twould be an hard case
with us, if what is not within our power, as
the derivation of an uninterrupted succession
of Church-Officers, or the like, should be
the concernment of our Souls.</p>
            <p>To this purpose, I cannot omit another Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s.
<q>I believe, <hi>says he,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pag. 13.</note> our Saviour ever since
his Ascension, hath had, in some place or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
a visible true Church on Earth, I mean,
a company of Men that professed at least so
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:52130:19"/>
much as was necessary to Salvation; and I
believe there vvill be somevvhere or other
such a Church to the World's end.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am sure your Notions tend to the destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the foundation of all Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi>'s
Arguments: and methinks you should be loth
to deprive Protestantism of such a Champion,
though by the bafling him, you might the
more securely triumph over that part of it to
which you seem to oppose your self.</p>
            <p>I will not here dispute (because it alters not
the state of any Question which I sent you)
whether I mistook you, or you have since cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
what you preach'd concerning <hi>the Rites
of Admission into the Church.</hi> Now you tell us
that the Persons invested with <hi>Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to receive others into the Church-Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 5.</note> must
do it <hi>according to the terms and conditions of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant;
and by such Covenant-Rites, and Forms of
Admission, as he,</hi> viz. <hi>God, is pleased to institute;
which under the Gospel is Baptism, as under the Law
it was Circumcision.</hi> Truly I had thought you
had said, such Rites as they, <hi>viz.</hi> the Church-Governors,
fallible Men, had thought fit, which
is but needful to your Hypothesis. But if the
<hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Forms of Admission</hi> must be of God's
institution, what think you of the Sign of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:52130:19"/>
the Cross, of which Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> says,<note place="margin">Mischief of Separat. p. 351.</note> 
               <hi>As Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism
is a Rite of Admission into Christ's Catholick
Church, so the Sign of the Cross is into our Church.</hi>
But then, as Baptism is compared unto Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,
does not the Apostle decide the
Question, when he tells us,<note place="margin">Rom. 2. 29.</note> That <hi>Circumcision
is that of the Heart?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have only one farther Consideration to
press to you, which is, That you would seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
bethink your self, whether your method
of converting these damnable Schismaticks,
who are in your Opinion as bad as <hi>Murderers</hi>
and <hi>Adulterers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 49.</note> be not the most effectual means
of keeping up the Schism? If want of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
makes Schismaticks, surely this is not the
way to convince them that that guilt lies at
their Door. Certainly if our Church requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
conformity to its Rites and Ceremonies as
necessary to Salvation, it could not blame
Men for dividing from it; and he who tells
us, or he says nothing,<note place="margin">Vers. 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> That <hi>the Divine Spirit
confines his Influences and Operations to the Unity of
the Church,</hi> in such Conformity, not only
makes such Conformity necessary to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but imputes to the Church the Damnation
of many thousands of Souls, who might expect
to be saved upon other terms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:52130:20"/>
I hope you are none of those that think Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
come in too fast, and that they are to be
preach'd out again. I heartily wish they could
conquer all their Scruples, that we might not
only have such <hi>love and sympathy as is peculiar to
the Members of the same Body:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 47.</note> which I hope all
good Christians have as Members of Christ's
Body, though of different Communions, but
that all might be able to go to the House of
God together, as Friends, of one Mind and one
Heart.</p>
            <p>For my part, if I had any Scruples of this
kind, they would arise from what our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
infuse; and when you talk of the danger
of <hi>communicating in a Schism,</hi> it would make me
bethink my self, whether the Church with
which I communicate, may not be guilty of
imposing something or other contrary to the
nature of Catholick Communion, or beyond
the Power entrusted with it, for <hi>edification</hi> and
not for <hi>destruction.</hi>

            <p>THere is now published the third Edition of the
<hi>Conformist's Plea for the Nonconformists.</hi> Or a
Just and Compassionate Representation of the present
State and Condition of the Nonconformists. As to
1. The Greatness of their Sufferings, with some Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
thereof. 2. Hardness of their Case, as to what i<gap reason="illegible: in gutter" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
enjoined. 3. Reasonableness of their Proposals of
Amendments. 4. Qualifications, and Worth of their
Persons. 5. Peaceableness of their Behaviour. 6. The
Church's Prejudice by their Exclusion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> With an
humble Apology for their Publick Preaching, and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension
of the Penal Laws against them.</p>
            <p>By a Beneficed Minister of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Edition is added a full Vindication of the
Nonconformists, from the foul Charge of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the late King, the whole Matter of Fact is
here related, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>London</hi> Ministers, about sixty
in number, with many more from several Counties,
appeared and presented their Testimony to the
Council of Officers, declaring their utter abhorrency
of the Army's Proceedings against the King's Life,
and Monarchical Government.</p>
            <p>And the Author hath also thought fit to give a
full account out of the Writings of Dr. <hi>Du-Moulin,</hi>
and others, that the Jesuits (assisted by a Faction in
the Army) contrived and executed that horrid Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany.
