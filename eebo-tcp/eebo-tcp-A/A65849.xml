         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>PREFACE</hi> to the Unprejudiced Reader.</head>
            <p>IT is real Love and Zeal for God's living Truth and People, which constrains me thus to appear in these Controversies, against such inveterate scornful Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits and Antichristian Principles, as tend to invalidate and make void the very Life of Christianity and Power of Godliness, by their slighting and reviling the <hi>Light within,</hi> professed by us the reproached People called <hi>Quakers</hi>: Which Light, being the very Principle which vvould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the mind to God and Christ, by whom it is given.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> such occasions of publick contest are not of our seeking, nor is it desirable to us, thus to appear against any People professing Religion (called <hi>Sectaries</hi>) but it hath been some few angry men called <hi>Baptists,</hi> and some other Professors partly of their Faith, who have publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both in Preaching and Print given us such occasions, by their implacable Enmity vented against us and the truth professed by us, as also by their dis-ingenuous, false, and injurious dealing with us and our Principles, by mistaking and perverting of them in many things, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves matter and work to make War with us, as this <hi>John N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>wman</hi> hath in several things, which he hath forged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us as our Principles, which are none of ours. But its prejudice and pride makes such blind men presumptuous.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> we find no new thing, nor any more profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity


<pb facs="tcp:106341:3"/>
brought forth, by these prejudiced <hi>Baptists</hi> against us, than the persecuting Hireling Priests did nigh twenty yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>s ago, in their Railing Pamphlets, and Pulpits; One main Subject of this <hi>John Newmans,</hi> in his Book, is to prove the Light in every man, not to be Christ; which he should not need to have done, until it had been so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by us; for though we do affirm a spiritual divine Light of God, and of his Son, to be in every man, yet it is not our Principle to say that Christ is in every man, or that every man hath the Son; but a measure of his Light, Grace, or heavenly Gift in all, which would lead out of darkness, and give the knowledge of God's Glory in the face of Christ, and so reveal the Son of God within, whom he that hath, hath the Father also. But this <hi>J. N.</hi> his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity against the Light within hath led him so far besides any true sense of God, or reverence to his Gift, as to call it but <hi>a feigned Light within,</hi> (though he hath neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated what the Light within is in its self, nor shewn any reason against it) and also to endeavour to exclude both God and Christ out of all his People, endeavouring to perswade us, that neither God nor Christ can be in any man, contrary to the manifest Testimonies of both the holy Prophets and Apostles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> in moderation peruse what follows, and let the Truth and its Light within (not prejudice and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>dge concerning these matters which are principal things in Controversie between us called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and the <hi>Baptists,</hi> with other Professors of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> same Spirit) and here thou mayst see the Controversie is about the Word; 2dly about the only Rule of Life; 3dly, About Jesus Christ; 4thly, and about the Scriptures, whether they be properly


<pb facs="tcp:106341:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be called the Word, the Foundation and only Rule of Life for all men (as <hi>J. N.</hi> asserts of them) or Jesus Christ his Spirit within to be the only Way and Rule, yea or nay. These Controversies are Scripturally and Rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discussed in the Sequel. The Principal Passages of this <hi>John Newmans</hi> Book against our Principle, are in the same Book contradicted, and plainly confuted by himself, and his chief Principles and Contradictions are herein laid down, as collected out of his own Book and briefly noted. <hi>Reader,</hi> It may seem very wonderful to thee, that any men should have the confidence to undertake to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute others, when they can write very few Pages without contradicting and confuting themselves, and thereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesting their own Folly, Distraction, and Confusion, as this <hi>J. N.</hi> hath done against us, as much as ever I knew any of our Opposers do: What reason can any have to follow or depend on such who have neither Soundness, Stability, nor Consistancy in their own Principles, let the Moderate and Rational <hi>Reader</hi> judge. This <hi>J. N.</hi> had been answered, when his Book was newly Published, but that we had several more noted <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>agonists</hi> to deal withal, wherefore I waved his Book, and did not take time so much as to read it over till very lately, being desired by some Friends, a little to take notice of it; we have a large Answer to part of it by another Friend, which is laid by till the rest of his Books be published.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> I have waved much Falshood and Nonsence, and many Tautological Impertinencies in <hi>J.N.</hi>'s Book, as not willing further to obtrude upon thy Patience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; also thou mayst take notice that divers of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects here treated on, (as that about the Light within, and


<pb facs="tcp:106341:4"/>
the Scriptures, with other matters of Controversie) are more fully Discussed and Resolved in our dear Friend <hi>Samuel Fisher</hi>'s Book, entituled, <hi>Rusticus ad Academicos,</hi> in Answer to <hi>John Owen, Tho. Danson, John Tombs,</hi> and <hi>Rich. Baxter,</hi> wherein <hi>Presbyterians, Independants,</hi> and <hi>Baptists</hi> are concerned, though none of them could ever Reply to it, but it lyes upon their heads, not Answered by them until this day: Also several considerable Books besides, have divers of us writ, in Answer to many pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vish Reviling Pieces of the <hi>Baptists,</hi> which they never yet Replyed to; but the Truth is and will be over their heads, and over those envious Spirits among them.</p>
            <p>Moreover, The Contradictions of some Principal <hi>Baptists,</hi> and others (about their Assertion of <hi>the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being the only Rule)</hi> [in Two late Discourses in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>] may be taken notice of in the sequel. â€”As also here is Finally a Bill of Excommunication given forth by divers of the principal <hi>Baptists</hi> about <hi>BOW,</hi> against one that forsook them and their dead wayes; wherein the <hi>Reader</hi> may also take notice of their envy and falshood.</p>

               <p>The first Proposition, in that it renders Christ and the Word both one, contradicts himself in his denying Christ to be the Word. For, however it must follow from this Argument, That <hi>Christ</hi> was, when the <hi>Word</hi> was. Christ being the Word, and so the <hi>Word, Christ.</hi> So that, <hi>if the Word was from, and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning; then Christ was from the beginning</hi>; but the <hi>Word</hi> was from the <hi>beginning,</hi> &amp;c. And then this flatly contradicts his whole Assertion, and proves it false, which with the pretended Reason thereof being not grounded upon any general Rule, or Maxim, of either Truth, Scriptures, or Reason (as all Arguments ought to be) but upon a meer Heretical Opinion that denies the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Christ, in denying him to be from the beginning, either <hi>as Christ,</hi> or <hi>as the Word.</hi> Now, doth not this deny Christs very <hi>being</hi> in the beginning, and make way for that old Heretical O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>That Christ, or the Son of God, was not in being before the Virgin</hi> Mary. But to give my Opposer his Due every way, I judge he has out-run himself in this matter at unawares, for he

hath (though to his own Confutation) confessed, <hi>That Christ was the Son of God from the beginning</hi>; and was He not then the Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? For, if the Son, then the Anointed; And his words (<hi>Christ as Christ was not</hi>) supposes that He was in some other capacity; yet his denying Him to be, either <hi>as Christ,</hi> or <hi>the Word,</hi> from the beginning, is contrary to plain Scriptures. For, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This Inference and Conclusion is false, and contrary to the Apostles plain Testimony. For as whatsoever might be known of God, is manifest within; So the Revelation of Jesus Christ the Son of God, is within, to the true believers in his Light: And no man knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him; And God revealed his Son in <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 1.16. his Glory was to be revealed in the Believers and Sufferers for Christ. And surely, as they hoped, looked, or waited in the measure of Grace or Light received for the Revelation, Appearance, or second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Christ to Salvation in their dayes, their hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation therein was not void, nor they disappointed thereof; as theirs is like to be, who are expecting that Christ's second Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, or Appearance to Salvation will be a Personal Coming, and his Reign a Personal Reign; which word [Personal] they add to the Scripture, and to the Book of the Prophesie of <hi>John</hi>; to wit, the <hi>Revelation</hi>; not truly minding the penalty they incur by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, as mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. And so where they add the word [Personal] or [in Person] to his Coming again; [or Personal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c.] do they not herein shew their carnal expectations, mean thoughts, and unscriptural conceptions touching Christ, his Divine Life, <hi>Being,</hi> and coming to Salvation? And their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not to be divine, nor after the Spirit? For where doth the Scripture say, That Christ shall come the second time in <hi>Person</hi> to save? Or, that he shall Reign in <hi>Person,</hi> or <hi>Personally</hi> Reign? &amp;c. [But about this Point, and several other things, <hi>Baptists</hi> do

This is both contrary to the true Faith and its Righteousness, and savours not of any real knowledge of Christ, in this scornful man. For the true Faith, and its object or foundation, are inseparable; see 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. Examine your selves, whether ye be in the Faith: Prove your selves: Know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates. So that their knowledge and proof of their being in the Faith, was their knowledge of Jesus Christ in them, as their foundation, &amp;c. and this was not a feigned Christ, and in him the Remission of sins is known, to them that are in the Faith. <hi>Paul</hi> was sent to turn the Gentiles from darkness to the Light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the remission of sins, and an inheritance among them that are Sanctified. And this was the Light of Christ within. And the Righteousness which is of Faith, speaketh in this wise, Say not in thine heart, who shall ascend into Heaven (that is, to bring Christ down from above) or who shall descend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Deep (that is,<note rend="inter">

And I ask, Is that Word the Scriptures, or Letter, which thou sayest Christians are nursed with the sincere Milk of? Does Milk flow from Letter, or Spirit? And is the nourishment of the new-born Babes (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2.) the Letter? Or, are none true Babes but who have the Letter?

thou doest not deny the Spirits sufficiency as Rule and Guide, nor darest thou assert the Scriptures sufficient without the Spirit, though thou grantest, That <hi>the Spirit is sufficient apart from the Scriptures</hi> (which thou callest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But 'tis no strange thing for thee, and such, to be found in such manifest self Contradictions. â€” However thou wouldst have us take notice that thou art both a Divine and a Scholar.

And, where hast thou these words, <hi>Personal being,</hi> in thy Rule? Is the Essence or Being of the Son of God, Personal? Was not his Being Divine, before his Incarnation or Appearance in Person?

               <p>Now let the impartial Readers note how confused and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory they were in the management of their Affirmation:</p>
               <p>As first, when we had excepted against their Affirmation, the particle <hi>Only</hi> being exclusive of any higher <hi>Rule</hi>; yea, even of the Spirit of Truth it self, and importing the <hi>Scriptures</hi> as the <hi>chief,</hi> or <hi>sole,</hi> singular, and alone <hi>Rule</hi> of Faith, <hi>excluding</hi> all other.

But yet, though one while the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and another while the <hi>Doctrines contained</hi> in them, were asserted to be the <hi>only Rule</hi> of Faith; in Contradiction to this, he would assent to the guidance of the Spirit of God, and would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the Holy Ghost in the comfort of the Scriptures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess at length, <hi>That the Scriptures, without divine illumination, are but the foundation of an historical Faith, and not a saving Faith; and that a man may believe the historical part, and not be saved; and that the divine illumination of the Spirit, is the Foundation and Rule of saving Faith.</hi>

His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight, was a very mean and pitiful one in this case, to answer the Ground and Rule of true and living Faith, which is the Gift of God, and whereof Christ is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.

               <p n="2">2dly. Supposing that in some places they have neither the Scriptures, nor their outward Preaching; it were a sad sentence to conclude them all in a state of Damnation for want thereof; and to conclude, that therefore God doth not afford them of his Spirit or Light, to be an inward Rule of their Faith without the Scriptures: What cruelty doth this charge upon God against his Creatures? And what a narrow limitation doth this put upon his Spirit, to allow him his path but only where the Scriptures are? Or <hi>Presbyterian</hi> or <hi>Independant</hi> Teachers, or such-like, go? What a pitiful narrow Spirit and Principle is this among them? And had not those Gentiles (spoken of <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.) those things contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law, written in their hearts, when they had not the Law or Scriptures outwardly? And were they not either accused or excused before God by his Law written in their hearts?</p>
               <p>T.D. <hi>They not walking up to the Light they had, was the cause of their Codemnation, and they were left without excuse.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Then from this it follows, That all was a case whether they walked up to the Light they had or not, they were like to be Condemned, do what they could (a sad Doctrine, charging God with no less than Cruelty and Injustice); then for what Reason was the Light given to them? and what was God's End therein, if it was insufficient? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> Still he could not hide himself from contradicting his Brother <hi>W.K.</hi> and the terms of their own Question; For if the Spirit's Illumination be included (as in <hi>Rule</hi>) then to say, the Scriptures are the <hi>only Rule</hi> of Faith, is not true; and wholly to exclude the Spirit <hi>as a Rule,</hi> is erroneous: And to instance in this case, That God <hi>only</hi> hath Immortality, which is dwelling in the Light, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. Was this a fit comparison for their Assertion <hi>of the Scriptures being the only Rule?</hi> For, hath not God Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality above and before all others? And hath he not it only dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Light? And have any it out of him, or out of his Light? But hath he it not only as more eminently and above all others? As he is the <hi>only</hi> Wise God, the <hi>only</hi> Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.15. where [<hi>Only</hi>] is both used in a most eminent sense, and excluding all others from that eminence. And if in this sense (according to <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) the Scriptures be taken as the most eminent <hi>Rule,</hi> before and above all other <hi>Rule</hi>; what is this but to set the Scriptures above the Spirit that gave them forth? and above all Divine Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations? (although without it the Scriptures cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood) which is as much as to set them above God and Christ. And yet <hi>Jer. Ives,</hi> in Contradiction to their own Assertion, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That <hi>they did not intend that none have Faith but they that have the Scriptures (some may have Faith who have them not, &amp;c.</hi>) It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows therefore, that that [<hi>some</hi>] have the Rule of Faith without the Scriptures. See what a deadly blow he hath given to his (and their) own Cause?</p>

Ives. <hi>God doth not require any thing to be believed (as a Point of Faith) or to be practised as a Duty, for which there is not a Rule laid down in the Scriptures; and that there is not any sin committed but what is there mentioned; there is no sin that I commit, but I may correct it by the Scriptures, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obs.</hi> See how both these passages do egregiously vary from the state of the Question, and their general Assertion before; Of the Scriptures being the <hi>only Rule</hi> of Faith. For <hi>a Rule in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> and they to be the <hi>only Rule,</hi> are much different. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if it were granted (which 'tis not) That God doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any thing to be believed, &amp;c. or practised as duty, for which there is not a Rule laid down (which imports a particular Rule or measure specified for every particular point or practice, or else not to be believed nor practised) then it follows, That if there be not a particular Rule in Scripture to prove, That <hi>the Scriptures are the only Rule of Faith,</hi> nor which so saith of them; We are not bound to believe these men's Assertion therein as any Point of Faith, for God doth not require us to believe it, however they contend for it, and would impose it upon our Faith.</p>
               <p>But further, 1. If by <hi>a Rule laid down,</hi> it be intended that there is a particular <hi>Rule,</hi> Command or Precept specified, exactly to measure every particular duty or thing to be believed or practised by all Christians (as there are many express Commands and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts expressing the particular duty, and forbidding the offence;) this is not so expressed under a general Command (nor yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) as <hi>Jer.

               </p>
               <p>To this <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> granted, That God might (for any thing he knew) do so: But suppose there may be Prophets now, sent with immediate Commission to a particular Place, <hi>as Rome, &amp;c.</hi> (said he) <hi>The Scripture hath a Rule in it, that such Prophets ought to obey their Master; and that the Scripture commands to hear Christ in all things, and not to quench the Spirit nor despise Prophesie, &amp;c.</hi> (Thus far <hi>Jer. Ives.)</hi> â€” But while he cannot prove that all those things are particularly prescribed in Scripture, which they are to hear


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:106341:24"/>
and learn of Christ, and which are to be prophesied: but hath granted the contrary (to wit) <hi>That there may be immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions and peculiar Messages from God to particular Places, &amp;c.</hi> (suppose <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>London</hi>) which are not particularly specified in Scripture (however Christ is to be heard in all things, and his Spirit not to be quenched) â€” Therefore it follows, that the Scriptures are neither the Rule of those Prophets Faith, either for such their Commission or peculiar Messages, for they have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Scriptures, but immediately from God: (And therefore if they should go to question their Commission, and try such their Messages by the Scriptures, and not find them there, this would argue unbelief, and cause disobedience) whereas their particular Commissions and Messages, are evidenced to them by the Spirit and Power of God (whether it be by Vision or Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) which is the immediate Object, Rule, and Foundation of their Faith therein.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, And in our dayes there hath been such Prophets raised up, both to this Nation, and City of <hi>London</hi>; witness <hi>Humphry Smith</hi>'s Vision of Fire to <hi>London; Jo.

Yea, many more have truly foretold of the Judgments and Calamities of this Nation and City; and it would be voluminous to repeat what hath been truly foretold by divers of the Servants of the Lord, concerning <hi>O.

                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:106341:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>3dly, As the Scriptures are not the Rule of Faith, nor is there a particular Rule therein for every individual motion or action; so are they not the sole Rule of discovery of sin and evil in men particularly (though they witness against all sin.) â€” Nor are they the immediate, or original Obligation upon the Conscience to Righteousness or Duty in the sight of God; for it is the Light of Christ within (that immediately opens an inward eye) that discovers to men their particular sins and guilt; and that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately obligeth to Righteousness (and did so oblige man in the beginning before it was so written in letters) because of God, who both telleth unto man his thoughts, and what he ought to do as his duty; And, <hi>whatsoever makes manifest is Light; all things that are reproved, are made manifest by the Light,</hi> yea, by that Lig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that it's evident, the Light is that Rule that tryes and manifests all things; and this was before the Scriptures, and is where they are not. Many over-look (and will not see) their own evils, though they read those very Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that testifie against them: but if they turn to the Light of Christ <hi>within,</hi> it will make them manifest, and bring them under a sense of their own guilt therein, that they may repent and cease from sin, and so receive remission.</p>

               <head>Here followeth a Copy of the said <hi>Hester Bird</hi> (now <hi>Hester Andrews</hi>) her Answer.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>GEorge Barret, Benjamin Dennis,</hi> and the rest concerned; I do not own you to be the Church of Christ as you call your selves: For the true Church never gave out such a false Bill of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as you have against Me; therefore your pretended Authority therein I deny. Whereas you falsly charge me with turning from the Communion of Saints; I have sensibly known and felt the Communion of Saints, blessed be the Lord, since I have been from amongst you. As to the Personal Reign of Christ, I never owned it when I was amongst you; but his Spiritual Appearance I am a witness of. Your outward Bread and Wine satisfies not the Soul; I have had more peace when I did not touch your Shadows, than when I did. As to the Water-Baptism, I never found any thing in it, I was the same when I came out as when I went in; Blessed be the Lord, I have known one Baptism, the Baptism of Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> being Baptized with the Holy Ghost and with Fire; for he will throughly purge his Floor. As to departing from the Foundation, Doctrine of Justification by Grace, as you falsly and slanderously charge me; I know the Foundation of God standeth sure, and another Foundation can no man lay than that is already laid, which is Christ in us, which is the Hope of Glory, by whose Grace I am Justified freely: and this I find to be the Doctrine of Christ, and his Ministers, which I own.</p>
               <p>A Word from the Lord unto you, That you would come out from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong your dark Customs of this World, and come to the Appearance of Christ in you,</p>
               <p>As to your Excommunication, it's known I came from you some years ago; take heed your Censure falls not on your own heads: but it shews of what spirit you are.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106341:28"/>Your charge of departing from the Resurrection of this Body, as you state it; Its neither truth nor sense, nor have you told me your meaning: For, what Resurrection and Body have I come to, that I have departed from: Howbeit the Resurrection I believe according to the Testimony of Christ and his Ministers; see <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.25. 1 Cor. 15.42. <hi>to the end: And Christ's Answer to the Saduces,</hi> Mat. 22.29, 30.</p>

               <head>A few brief <hi>Observations</hi> on the <hi>Scriptures</hi> in the Margent of the <hi>Baptists</hi> Bill (or rather <hi>Bull</hi>) against the said <hi>Hester Bird,</hi> alias <hi>Andrews</hi>; which they have perverted and misapplyed: As,</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>FIrst,</hi> That of <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.8, 9. was against the Rebellious <hi>Jews,</hi> who were backslidden, and knew not the Judgment of the Lord, and had rejected his Word, who were all given to Covetousness, and to deal falsly, from the People to the Priest, <hi>vers.</hi> 7, 10. None of which Evils have these angry <hi>Baptists</hi> proved against this Person whom they have Rejected, or Excommunicated; for she did first reject them, as she was perswaded she had good reason for; and that therein she did not reject the Word of the Lord, but such as have rejected it, whom she denyes to be either Called by Christ to the Ministry, or to be of his Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. was against those Antichrists who went out from the true Apostles, and Church: where <hi>note,</hi> these <hi>Baptists</hi> have neither proved their Call to the Ministry, nor themselves to be either true Apostles, or a true Church;


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106341:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor yet Convicted this Woman to be such an one mentioned 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.18, 19. for she is now directed to (and owneth) the <hi>Vnction</hi> within from the Holy One, which preserves out of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist's Delusions, Lyes and Deceits, &amp;c. which if she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues in, and obey to the end, she shall continue in the <hi>Son,</hi> and in the <hi>Father,</hi> and not deny Jes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Christ, or the Father, as the Antichrists did, <hi>vers.</hi> 22, 23. But this <hi>Anointing within,</hi> these <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi> have never turned People unto, that they might follow and obey it in all things; for they impose upon People their own Practises, without the immediate guidance of the Spirit: And therefore this Woman hath cause for ever to bless the Lord th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> she turned from them, if she continue in this <hi>Anointing within</hi>; which is true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As to that, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17. &amp; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. These concerned such as did blaspheme, and used profane and vain bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; of whom was <hi>Alexander,</hi> and also <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who said, <hi>That the Resurrection was past already, and overthrew the Faith of some:</hi> But no such thing as vain Bablings, Blasphemy, or saying, <hi>That the Resurrection is past already,</hi> have these <hi>Baptists</hi> proved against this Person whom they have Excommunicated: And therefore it is,</p>
               <p n="1">1st. A great sin in them thus to misaply the Scriptures against such as they were never intended. And,</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, A great presumption in them, to assume an Authority from the Apostles words, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. to deliver up to Satan, when they have no Commission, Power, or Authority given them of God so to do, as the Apostles had, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, What great folly and madness do they shew and bewray, in Rejecting, Excommunicating, or Delivering up to Satan, such as have before rejected and denyed them, and refused to have any Communion with them, as this <hi>Hester</hi> for some time hath; for such as were rejected and cast out of the true Church, they were either such as would have continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in scandalous Practises, as Fornication, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Or, 2dly, Such false Brethren, as by Blasphemies,

or Heresies, troubled the Church, and would have sown Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and Strife amongst them; for Testimonies in truth (against such) we own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> As to that of <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. It's on the behalf of Christ, that great Prophet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>hom every one ought to hear in all things; And it's said, <hi>Every Soul that will not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed from among the People, &amp;c.</hi> Now it is not every Soul that will not hear you <hi>Baptists</hi> (and come under your Water and Ordinances, as you impose them) that must therefore be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>troyed, however you pretend to deliver such to Satan; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Soul that will not hear Christ, that great Prophet of God in all things, that Soul must be cut off: And can you say that you have ever heard the Voice of Christ, who pretend your selves to be his Church (which we both deny you to be)? As also, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that you have any Call from Christ to the Ministry. Do you judge that none hear his Voice but such as you plunge in Water? And that all must be condemned who cannot own you in your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Shadows, called Ordinances, upon pretence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being your <hi>only Rule?</hi> when you never yet did either prove or demonstrate that ever you heard the immediate Voice of Christ, or had a Call from him for your plunging People under Water (which is but a Shadow) Much less can we believe that you hear him in all things else, which you practise and impose; for Christ is the Life and Substance, and they who hear him in all things, receive Life, and the One Spiritual Baptism, which yours is not.</p>
