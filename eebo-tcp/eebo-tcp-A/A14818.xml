            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE, vertuous and learned Ladie, the Ladie Mary, Countesse of Penbroke.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ine afflicted mind and crased bodie, together with other externall calamities haue wrought such sorowfull and lamentable effects in me, that for this whole yeare I haue wholy giuen ouer my selfe to mournfull meditations. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, Amintas is one, which being first prepared for one or two, was afterward by the meanes of a few, made com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to manie, and so pitifully disfigured by the boistrous hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of vnskilfull pen men, that he was like to haue come abroad so vnlike himselfe, as that his own Phillis would neuer haue taken him for Amintas. VVhich vtter vndoing of our poore shepeheard, I knew not well otherwise how to preuent, but by repairing his ragged attire, to let him passe for a time vnder your honourable protection. As for his foes, they either gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie mislike this vnusuall kind of verse, or els they fancie not my peculier trauaile. For the first, I neuer heard better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of them then this, such an one hath done but ill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can doe well, which reason is much like their own rimes, in condemning the art, for the fault of some artificers. Now for the second sort of reprehenders who think well of the thing, but not of my labour therein, mine answere is at hand. If there were anie penaltie appointed for him that would not reade, he might well complaine of me that publish it to be read.
<pb facs="tcp:11666:3"/>
But if it be in euerie mans choise to read it, or not to reade, why then not in mine also to publish or not to publish it? He that will, let him see and reade; he that will neither reade nor see, is neither bound to see nor read. He that taketh no delight in reading, let him thinke that among so manie men so diuersly affected, there may be some found of a contrarie humor. If anie begin to read, when he beginneth to take no delight, let him leaue of and goe no further. If he folow on in reading without pleasure, let him neither blame me that did what I could, nor be angrie with the thing which hath no sense, but reprehend himselfe who would continue in reading without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pleasure taking.</p>

            <head>The First Lamentation.</head>
            <l>IN flowre of young yeares fayre Phillis lately departing,</l>
            <l>With teares continual was daily bewayld of Amyntas,</l>
            <l>halfe mad Amyntas, careful Amintas, mournful Amintas.</l>
            <l>Whose mourning al night, al day, did weary the mountains,</l>
            <l>Wearie the woods, and wyndes, and caues, and weary the fountains.</l>
            <l>But when he saw in vaine his cheekes with teares to be watred,</l>
            <l>cheeks al pale and wan, yet could not finde any comfort,</l>
            <l>comfortles then he turns at length his watery countnance</l>
            <l>Vnto the shril waters of Thames, and there he beginneth:</l>
            <l>Here, O nimph, these plaints, here, O good nimph, my bewailings,</l>
            <l>And conuey them downe to thy kinsmans watery kingdome,</l>
            <l>Down to the world washing main sea with speedy reflowing:</l>
            <l>World washing main-sea wil then conuey to the worlds end</l>
            <l>This grieuous mourning, by the shore, by the sands, by the desert,</l>
            <l>Desert, sands, and shore which witnes were to my mourning.</l>
            <l>And great God Neptune perchaunce, his mightily thundring</l>
            <l>Triton, wil commaund to recount what I feele, what I suffer,</l>
            <l>Raging heate of loue, passing outragious Aetna.</l>
            <l>So th'infamous fame of wretched louer Amyntas,</l>
            <l>Blown from th'east to the weast, by the sounding trump of a Triton,</l>
            <l>Through deepe seas passing, at length may pearce to Auernus,</l>
            <l>And fyelds Elysian where blessed souls be abyding.</l>
            <l>And there meete Phillis, sweete soule of Phillis among them,</l>
            <l>Sweete soule of Phillis, stil, stil, to be mournd of Amyntas,</l>
            <l>O what a life did I leade, what a blessed life did I leade then,</l>
            <l>Happy shepheard with a louing lasse, while destiny suffred?</l>
            <l>Vnder a beech many times wee sate most sweetely together,</l>
            <l>Vnder a broade beech tree that sunbeames might not anoy vs,</l>
            <l>Either in others armes, stil looking either on other:</l>
            <l>Both, many rimes singing, and verses both many making,</l>
            <l>And both so many woords with kisses so many mingling.</l>
            <l>Sometimes her white neck, as white as milk, was I tutching,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11666:4"/>Sometimes her prety paps, and breast was I bold to be fingring,</l>
            <l>Whil'st Phillis smyling and bushing hangd by my bosome,</l>
            <l>And these cheekes of mine did stroke with her yuory fingers,</l>
            <l>these cheekes with yong heare like soft downe all to bee smeared,</l>
            <l>O ioyful spring time with pleasure wished abounding,</l>
            <l>O those blessed dayes while good lucke shyn'd fro the heauens,</l>
            <l>But since Phillis, alas, did leaue most cursed Amyntas,</l>
            <l>Pains haue plagued, alas, both flesh and bones of Amintas,</l>
            <l>No day riseth, alas, but it heares these grones of Amintas,</l>
            <l>No night commeth, alas, that brings any rest to Amintas,</l>
            <l>Night and day thus, alas, stil Phillis troubleth Amintas.</l>
            <l>Now if northern blasts should sound their feareful alarum,</l>
            <l>And boistrous tempests, come thundring down fro the heauens,</l>
            <l>So that I were compeld with sheepe and kidds fro the pastures</l>
            <l>Down to the broad brancht trees &amp; thick set groues to be skudding,</l>
            <l>There to remain for a while, and al for feare of a scowring,</l>
            <l>Phillis then do I want, then my sweete Phillis is absent,</l>
            <l>Phillis then do I want: whose wont was then to be harckning</l>
            <l>Al that I could of loue, and goddes louely remember:</l>
            <l>Songs of lusty satyrs, and Fauni friends to the mountains,</l>
            <l>And cheerefull Charites: such songs, as none but I onely,</l>
            <l>Onely Amintas made, for none compar'd with Amintas.</l>
            <l>But now, Phillis I want, and who shal now bee my Phillis?</l>
            <l>Who shall marke what I sing, what I say, forsaken Amintas?</l>
            <l>If that I praise Phillis, these hills giue praise to my Phillis,</l>
            <l>And Phillis, Phillis, from rocks with an Eccho, reboundeth,</l>
            <l>Thus by the whistling windes my mournings, made but a iesting.</l>
            <l>If that I grone, these trees with bending, yeeld many gronings:</l>
            <l>And very ground for griefe shews her complexion altred:</l>
            <l>So this ground, these trees, these rocks, and Eccho resounding,</l>
            <l>All that I heare, that I see, giues fresh increase to my sorrow.</l>
            <l>Go poore sheepe and kidds, sometimes the delyte of Amintas,</l>
            <l>Seeke now somewhere else both gras and boughs to refresh you,</l>
            <l>Make your way by the fields, and neuer looke for Amintas,</l>
            <l>Lodge your selues at night, and neuer looke for Amintas.</l>
            <l>Some pitiful goodman wil take compassion on you,</l>
            <l>And feede you wandring, and bring you home by the euning.</l>
            <l>And I alone, yeelding due mourning vnto my Phillis,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11666:4"/>Phillis mine and yours (for you also shee regarded)</l>
            <l>Ile now wander alone, stil alone, by the rocks, by the mountains,</l>
            <l>Dwelling in darke dens by the wilde beasts only frequented,</l>
            <l>Where no path for man, where no man's seene to bee passing:</l>
            <l>Or to the woods Ile goe, so darke with broadshadoe braunches,</l>
            <l>That no Sunne by the day, no starre by the night do anoy mee,</l>
            <l>And that I heare no voice, but Goblins horrible outcries,</l>
            <l>Owles baleful scrikings, and crowes vnlucky resoundings.</l>
            <l>There shall these myne eyes be resolud in watery fountains:</l>
            <l>There shall these fountains flow ouer along by the pastures:</l>
            <l>There wil I make such plaints, as beasts shal mourn by my playnings,</l>
            <l>Such plaints, as strong trees shal rent and riue fro the rooting,</l>
            <l>Make wylde Panthers tame, and mollify lastly the flintstone.</l>
            <l>And if I needs must sleepe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I'le take but a nap by my sleeping,</l>
            <l>On bare and cold ground, these lims al weary reposing:</l>
            <l>No greene turfe to my head, shal stand in steede of a pillow,</l>
            <l>No bowes or braunches geeue cou'ring vnto my carkas,</l>
            <l>That some foule serpent may speedily giue me my deaths wound:</l>
            <l>That this poore soule may from flesh and bloud be released,</l>
            <l>And passing stygian waters, may come to the faire fields,</l>
            <l>Elysian faire fields, and daily resort to my Phillis.</l>
            <l>Meane while, friendly shepheards &amp; plowmen, mark what I tel you,</l>
            <l>Marke what I say (for I think you knew and loued Amintas.)</l>
            <l>Disdaine daintie Venus, giue no ground vnto the blind boy,</l>
            <l>Yong boy, but strong boy: take heede, take heed by Amintas.</l>
            <l>Th'one with a fire hath burnt, and th'other pearst with an arrow</l>

            <l>WHen by the pleasant streams of Thames poore caitif Amintas</l>
            <l>Had to the dull waters his grief thus vainly reuealed,</l>
            <l>Spending al that day and night in vainly reuealing,</l>
            <l>As soone as morning her shining heares fro the mountains</l>
            <l>Had shewn forth, and dryu'n al star-light quite fro the heauens,</l>
            <l>Then that vnhappy shepheard stil plag'd with vnhappily louing,</l>
            <l>Left those barren banks and waters no pity taking,</l>
            <l>And on a crookt sheephooke his lims all weary reposing,</l>
            <l>Climed a loft to the hills, but, alas, very faintily clymed,</l>
            <l>Kiddes, and goats, and sheepe driuing, goodman, to the mountains,</l>
            <l>for sheepe, goats, and kidds with pastures better abounding,</l>
            <l>Then by the way thus he spake, to the sheep, to the goats, to the yong kidds.</l>
            <l>O poore flock, it seems you feele these pangs of a louer,</l>
            <l>And mourne thus to behold your mournful maister Amyntas.</l>
            <l>Your wont was, some part to be bleating, some to be skipping,</l>
            <l>Some with bended browes and horned pates to be butting,</l>
            <l>Sheepe to be gnapping grasse, and goats to the vines to be climing.</l>
            <l>But now no such thing, but now no lust to be liuely,</l>
            <l>Sheepe and seelly sheepheard with lucklesse loue bee besotted,</l>
            <l>You for Amintas mourne, for Phillis mourneth Amyntas,</l>
            <l>O with what miseries poore mortal men be molested?</l>
            <l>Now do I know right wel what makes you thus to be mourning,</l>
            <l>Thus to be tyred, thus to be quailed, thus to be drooping:</l>
            <l>Phillis while she remaynd, milkt my goates euer at euning,</l>
            <l>Goats that brought home duggs stretcht with milk euer at euning.</l>
            <l>Phillis brought them flowres, &amp; them brought vnto the welsprings,</l>
            <l>When dogdayes raigned, when fields were al to be scorched,</l>
            <l>Whilst that I lay sleeping in cooling shade to refresh mee.</l>
            <l>Phillis againe was woont with Amyntas, sheepe to be washing,</l>
            <l>Phillis againe was wont my sheepe thus washt to be shearing,</l>
            <l>Then to the sweete pastures my sheepe thus shorne to be driuing,</l>
            <l>And from fox and woolfe my sheepe thus dryu'n to bee keeping</l>
            <l>With watchfull bawling and strength of lustie Lycisca,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11666:5"/>And in folds and coates my flocke thus kept, to be closing:</l>
            <l>Least by the Northern winds my sheepe might chance to be pinched</l>
            <l>Least by the frost or snow my kids might chance to be grieued.</l>
            <l>Phillis lou'd you so, so Phillis lou'd Amintas,</l>
            <l>Phillis a guide of yours, and Phillis a friend of Amintas.</l>
            <l>But sweete sheepe, sweete goates, spare not to be liuelie, for all this,</l>
            <l>Looke not vpon my weeping face so sadly, for all this,</l>
            <l>Harken not to my plaints and songs all heauie, for all this,</l>
            <l>Harken not to my pipe, my pipe vnluckie, for all this.</l>
            <l>But sweete sheepe, sweete goates, leaue of your maister Amintas,</l>
            <l>Leape and skip by the flowring fields, and leaue of Amintas,</l>
            <l>Climbe to the vines and tender trees, and leaue of Amintas,</l>
            <l>Climbe to the vines, but runne for life, for feare of a mischiefe,</l>
            <l>When th'old Silenus with his Asse comes lasilie trotting,</l>
            <l>Let me alone, me alone lament and mourne my beloued,</l>
            <l>Let me alone celebrate her death by my teares, by my mourning:</l>
            <l>Like to the siluer swan, who seeing death to be comming,</l>
            <l>Wandreth alone for a while through streames of louelie Caïster,</l>
            <l>Then to the flowring bankes all faint at length he repaireth,</l>
            <l>Singing there, sweet bird his dying song to Caïster,</l>

            <l>Yeelding vp, sweete bird, his breath and song to Caïster.</l>

            <l>What for fieldes, for woods, for medowes careth Amintas,</l>

            <l>Euery beast which heares these woful plaints of Amintas,</l>

            <l>And fro the sight of man, fro the light of sunne to remoue it,</l>

            <l>But yet <hi>I</hi> wish in vaine, and nought can I get by my wishing,</l>
            <l>And of my wishing these lewd winds make but a whistling.</l>

            <l>With dolorus gronings, his fatall howre he bewailed.</l>
            <l>This day, this same day, most blessed day of a thousand,</l>
            <l>Shall be the first of ioy, and last of anoie to Amintas,</l>
            <l>This shal bring me my selfe to my selfe, and bring me to Phillis.</l>
            <l>Let neither father, nor mother mourne for Amintas,</l>
            <l>Let neither kinsman, nor neighbour weepe for Amintas,</l>
            <l>For Venus, onelie Venus, doth laie this death on Amintas,</l>
            <l>And Phillis sweet soule in faire fields staies for Amintas.</l>
            <l>If you needs will shew some signe of loue to Amintas,</l>
            <l>Then when life is gone, close vp these eies of Amintas,</l>
            <l>And with Phillis corps lay this dead corps of Amintas,</l>
            <l>This shall Phillis please, and Phillis louer Amintas,</l>
            <l>And thou, good Damon, driue forth those sheepe of Amintas,</l>
            <l>Least that Amintas sheepe die with their maister Amintas.</l>
            <l>And thou faire Amarillis, when thou gang'st to the mountains,</l>
            <l>Driue on Phillis goats, faire Phillis goats to the mountains:</l>
            <l>For now tis certaine, Ile leaue this life for a better,</l>
            <l>And seeke for mending in a most vnnatural ending.</l>
            <l>Hils and dales farewel, you pleasant walks of Amintas,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11666:19"/>Wells and fludds farewell, sometime the delyte of Amintas,</l>
            <l>Now shal I neuer more my sorrowes vtter among you,</l>
            <l>Now shal <hi>I</hi> neuer more with clamors vainly molest you.</l>
            <l>Must then Amintas thus but a stripling murder Amintas?</l>
            <l>O what an imperious princesse is Queene Cytheraea?</l>
            <l>For still watching loue would neuer let me be resting,</l>
            <l>Nor neuer sleeping, since Phillis went from Amintas.</l>
            <l>And no longer I can susteine these infinite horrors,</l>
            <l>And pangs incessant, which now are freshly renewed,</l>
            <l>And much augmented: therefore am I fully resolued</l>
            <l>Of lingring lou's wound to be speedily cur'd by a deaths wound.</l>
            <l>Thus when he had contriu'd in his heart this desperate outrage,</l>
            <l>And meant fully to die, with an hellish fury bewitched;</l>
            <l>What do I stay, quoth he, now? tis losse of time to be lingring.</l>
            <l>Then with a fatall knife in a murdring hand; to the heauens</l>
            <l>Vp did he looke for a while; and groan'd with a deadly resounding,</l>
            <l>VVith these words his life and Lamentation ending.</l>
            <l>Gods, and ghosts, forgiue, forget this fault of Amintas,</l>
            <l>Pardon I craue of both: this knife shall bring me to Phillis,</l>
            <l>And end these miseries, though desteny flatly deny it.</l>
            <l>Eu'n as he spake these words downe fell deepe wounded Amintas,</l>
            <l>Fowling hands and ground with streames of bloud that abounded.</l>
            <l>And good natur'd ground, pytying this fall of Amintas</l>
            <l>In most louing wise very gent'ly receiued Amintas</l>
            <l>And when he fell, by the fall, in mournefull sort she resounded.</l>
            <l>Iupiter in meane time, and th'other gods of Olympus,</l>
            <l>When they saw his case (though great things were then in handling,)</l>
            <l>Yet lamented much, and then decreed, that Amintas</l>
            <l>Soule, should goe to the fields where blessed Phillis abideth,</l>
            <l>And bloody corps should take both name &amp; forme of a faire flowre</l>
            <l>Called Amaranthus; for Amintas friendly remembrance.</l>
            <l>VVhylst these things by the gods wer thus decreed in Olympus,</l>
            <l>Senses were all weake, and almost gone from Amintas,</l>
            <l>Eyes were quite sightles, death pangs and horror aproched:</l>
            <l>Then with his head half vp, most heauily groned Amintas,</l>
            <l>And as he gron'd, then hee felt his feete to the ground to be rooted,</l>
            <l>And seeking for a foote, could finde no foote to be sought for.</l>
            <l>For both leggs and trunck to a stalk were speedily chaunged,</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:11666:20"/>And that his olde marrow to a colde iuyce quickly resolued,</l>
            <l>And by the same cold iuyce this stalk stil liuely apeared.</l>
            <l>Which strang chang whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he felt, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he lifted his arms to the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</l>
            <l>And when he lifted his arms, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his arms were made to be branches.</l>
            <l>And now, face and heare of Amintas lastly remayned,</l>
            <l>O what meane, you gods, to prolong this life of Amintas?</l>
            <l>ô what meane you gods, with an hollow sound he repeated,</l>
            <l>Vntil his hollowe sounde with a stalk was speedily stopped,</l>
            <l>And faireface and heare bare forme and shape of a faire flowre,</l>
            <l>Flowre with faire red leaus, faire red bloud gaue the beginning.</l>
            <l>Then with bow and shaft and painted quiuer about him</l>
            <l>Vprose Lord of loue, from Princelike seate in Olympus,</l>
            <l>And when t'was too late lament's this losse of a louer,</l>
            <l>Speaking thus to the gods of this newe flowre of Amintas.</l>
            <l>Myrtle's due to Venus, greene Laurell's due to Apollo,</l>
            <l>Corne to the Lady Ceres, rype grapes to the yong mery Bacchus,</l>
            <l>Popplar t'Alcides, and Oliues vnto Minerua,</l>
            <l>Gentle Amaranthus thou fairest flowre of a thousand</l>
            <l>Shalt be my floure he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceforth, &amp; though thou cam'st from a bleeding,</l>
            <l>Yet bloud shalt thou staunch: this gift will I giue thee for euer:</l>
            <l>And by the pleasant fields where gentle minded Amintas</l>
            <l>Lately bewaild his loue, there thy leau's louely for euer</l>
            <l>Boyes, and gyrles, and nymphs shal take a delyte to be plucking,</l>
            <l>Take a delight of them their garlands gaye to be making.</l>
            <l>And now in meane time whylst these things were thus a working,</l>
            <l>Good louing neighbours for a long time missed Amintas,</l>
            <l>And by the caues of beasts, by the dungeons darke, by the deserts,</l>
            <l>And by the hills, by the dales, by the wells and watery fountains,</l>
            <l>Sought for Amintas long, but neuer mett with Amintas.</l>
