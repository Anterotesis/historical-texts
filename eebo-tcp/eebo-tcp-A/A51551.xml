            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But as you are a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of ingenuous Studies, and have exprest a particular respect to me by your many Civilities, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reckoned my self bound to an humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement; which Sir, if you will accept this as a token of, it will yet more oblige me to be</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>AMong the ingenuous Sciences practised in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Perspective ought not in right to have the least esteem; For that it is full of most ravishing Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I think none that knows what it is will deny. But that it is most absolutely necessary for all Painters, Engravers, Architects and others that have occasion to draw Drafts &amp;c. all must confess: For indeed without it the Painter can neither paint Landskips, Houses or other Figures proportionable and true, or the Architect designe any more than an Orthographick Structure on his Ground-plot. But on the contrary, If an Artist works by the Rules of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective, he may paint a remote peece with many Figures in it, and give every Figure its true place and size, and so sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow his work that shall seem more like the thing it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents than a representation of the thing: And the Architect may draw on his Ground plot the appearance of several sides of his Building, and place on them either doors, windows, Balconies, &amp;c. each in its proper shape and scituation.</p>
            <p>Since therefore it is both necessary and delightfull, I have for the accomodation of English Artists taken the pains to write this following discourse of <hi>Practical Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective:</hi> And I was the rather induced hereunto, because as yet nothing of this nature hath been published in English except <hi>Sebastian Serlio,</hi> who though he where a man of skill and fame, yet his book being originally written in Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, was first translated into Dutch, and afterwards from Dutch into English: One of which translators (if not both) doubtless understood the language better than the Art; for therein (as the generallity of Ingenuous Artists do with me confess) the words are translated, but not the Science.</p>
            <p>In this work to save my self the trouble of making all new designes I have collected from several Authors such Figures as I found most usefull for the Instructions of a
<pb facs="tcp:105730:4"/>
learner, as from <hi>Albert Durer, Neceron, Jean Cosin, Desargues,</hi> but the generallity from <hi>Hondius,</hi> who had them as himself saies (and you may see) from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolois.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such hath been my care in writing these Instructions, that I dare promise thee they are all true: Such my curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in chusing the Terms that some good Authors, and able Artists as well as my self have thought them most signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. And such my desire that thou shouldst learn by this Book, that all along in it I have observed my wonted plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, so that by it (as I say in the Title) is <hi>Perspective made easie.</hi>

               <p>The knowledge of Scenographie comprehends so much of the Art of Perspective, that without scruple many Authors call it <hi>Perspective,</hi> when in their works they frequently say the Perspective appearence, though they only treat of a Sceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick Figure: As if they concluded, that he who arrives to so great a perfection in Perspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, as Scenographie understands or with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty may understand the whole Art of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective.</p>
               <p>The Scenographick Appearence differs from the Orthographick in this; The Orthographick represents the side of a Body, or Building, as it is seen when the Plain of the Glass stands parallel
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105730:6"/>
to that side. But Scenographie represents the side of a Body, or Building, as it seems through a Glass erected not parallel to that side.</p>

This you may experiment if you lay the Muscovie Glass in <hi>Definition</hi> VI. flat upon the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a b c d, for then so much of your Scenogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Figure as is made of Visual raies, as the lines <hi>a b</hi> and <hi>c d,</hi> shall run into a point opposite to the point <hi>e:</hi> which point elevated to the height of the Ey is the Visual point, as a foresaid.

                  <hi>e.</hi> This Plain is by some Authors called the <hi>Section,</hi> by others the <hi>Table,</hi> and by others the <hi>Glass.</hi> They that call it a Section call it most properly, Because it cuts or intersects the Plain whereon it stands, as here it cuts the Plain or Base <hi>a b c d.</hi> And they that call it a Table, call it so allusively as they do other Planis whereon any thing is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther painted or written. But they that call it a Glass have some good reason for it too, Because we know as yet no other matter so apt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate the changing of an Orthographick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure into a Scenographick as Glass: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though I confess the word Section to be more proper than the word Glass, yet because (as I said before) my design is Practice: I shall all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in this Book (when I have occasion to name this Plain) call it <hi>Glass</hi> and not Section.</p>
               <p>This Glass or Section is absolutely necessary to be understood by all young Studients in the Art of Perspective. Because (as by what hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been said) without knowing what it is they cannot know what Perspective means: Neither can they know the reason why the Scenogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Figure alters from the Orthographick, or one Scenographick Figure from another. But by rightly understanding this Glass they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily perceive the Various affections of Sceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick appearences. For first, If the Glass be placed near the Visual point and far from the Object, the Figure appearing therein will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry small: Because all the raies which inclose both Orthographick and Scenographick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures though wider asunder at the Object run into the Visual point as into a common Center: As you may see in the first Figure, where the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle a appears much smaler in the Plain or Glass d e f g, which stands neer the Visual point and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105730:9"/>
farther from the Object than in the Glass h i k l, which stands farther from the Visual point and neerer the Object. Secondly, If the Visual point be placed higher, though at the same distance from the Object the greater the Scenographick form appears: As you may see if you place the Visual point at m, and delineate the same Circle Scenographically as d, it becomes bigger in length and bredth; for the Visual raies being e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levated the several Perpendiculars erected on the Glass intersect them in wider distances, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause futher from the Glass. As you may see in the Scenographick Circle d. Thirdly, If this Glass were set oblique to the Plain, the Figure would again alter; For if it Incline to the Visu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al point the Scenographick appearence of this Circle (for Example,) shall on the Glass lengthen between the Visual point and the Object: Because the Plain of the Glass gathers in more of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual raies: And if the Glass Recline from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual point the Scenographick appearence shall grow rounder and more like the Orthographick Figure. But if the Glass be placed parallel to the Plain the Object lies on, the Scenographick and Orthographick Figure shall appear the same; Because the Figure is not seen in Section. And all this you may easily experiment by erecting the Muscovy Glass in <hi>Defin.</hi> VI. of this Chap. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween your Ey and the Figure: For if you keep your Ey steddy in one point, and with a black-lead pencil trace about the edges of the same Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure as you find it on the Glass, you will have the true Scenographie of that Figure: As you may try by comparing it afterwards with the same Figure drawn by the Rules of Perspective, as they are taught in this Book.</p>

               <p>Several Methodical Rules and Observations, that may facilitate your Practice in <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p n="1">1. ALL Lines that in the Object or Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Figure are straight lines, are in Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographie also straight lines.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Lines that in a Geometrick Figure are Perpendiculars, must in Scenographie also be Perpendiculars.</p>
            <p n="3">3. All Lines that in a Geometrick Figure are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105730:10"/>
Parallel to its Base, must in Scenographie be also Parallel to the Base.</p>
            <p n="4">4. All Lines that in Geometrick Figures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn at Right Angles from the Orthographick or fore-right side, must in Scenographick Figures be drawn from the Visual point.</p>
            <p n="5">5. All Right Lines that in a Geometrick Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure return from the Orthographick or fore-right side, in a Scenographick Figure run into the Horizontal Line. And</p>
            <p n="6">6. All Lines that in the Geometrick Figure are Parallel to that return-line, shall in a Sceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick Figure be drawn from that point found in the Horizon.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If a Right Angle having one of its sides a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Base be to be cut off, so as the two sides of it shall remain equal: Then a line drawn from the point of Distance shall so cut it off.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If the Figure you designe to draw stands on your right hand, you must place it on the right hand of the Visual point. If on your left hand, you must place it on the left hand of the Visual point. But if on neither hand, the Visual point must be placed in the middle of it.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If you set off the Height of Columns, Posts, or other things, you must measure the designed Height from the Base-line upwards in the Front or Orthographie, and a Visual raie drawn from that point in the Front shall shew the Height of your Columns, or Posts, all the way behind the Orthographie, even to the Visual point. As in <hi>Oper.</hi> XXIX. &amp;c. This is a Rule in all Figures, aswell wherein there is an Orthographick side placed before it, as where there is none.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If you are to make Circles, Arches, Crosses, Cross-Arches, or any other Figure in the Roof of any Room, you must first project the same on
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105730:11"/>
the Ichnographie, and so with Perpendiculars from the eminent points of the same, carry it up into the Ceiling: as in <hi>Oper.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. And then from those several points carry on your Circle, or Arch &amp;c. As in <hi>Oper.</hi> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 25, 26, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If you would find the middle point of any Scenographick Square, Cross it in the Diagonal Angles with two lines, and in the point where they cut each other is the middle of the Square. As in <hi>Oper.</hi> 17, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="12">12. A Ground Plain of Squares is the same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizontal line it is below: Only if it be farther distant above or below the Horizon the Squares will be so much the wider. As in <hi>Oper.</hi> 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, &amp;c. and all other wherein Roofs, or Ceilings are described.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These brief Rules will much help you in your Practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>A Caution or two for your more profitable reading this Book.</head>
               <p>YOu must take special notice of the several shapes of Letters wherewith the several points of each Figure is marked; for in some Figures there come so many Letters, that I was forc'd to reitterate them: But then the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are made in an other shape; either in Capitals, as A, B, or smal Romian, as a, b: when as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they are set down in Italick Letters, thus, <hi>a, b.</hi> For if you do not take notice that the Letter you seek in the Figure be of the same sort with that you read in the <hi>Operation,</hi> you may easily mistake one part of the Figure for another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:105730:11"/>
Secondly, The different Letters are sometimes made to shew the corrospondent points of the Geometrick and Scenographick Figures; as in <hi>Oper.</hi> VI. the several points in the Geometrick Hexagon are marked with Italick Letters, thus, <hi>d e f g h i,</hi> but in the Scenographick Hexagon the respondent points are marked with Romain Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thus d e f g h i.</p>
               <p>You are sometimes directed in this Book to draw a line from the Point <hi>a b c d,</hi> &amp;c. when the point intended is not in the Plate, but lies out of the Plate in the Horizontal line. As in <hi>Oper.</hi> XXXIII. you are directed to draw a line from the point <hi>c,</hi> but it is thereby meant you should draw a line from that point where <hi>c</hi> should stand, viz. where the line <hi>d</hi> 13 <hi>c</hi> if conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued would cut the Horizontal line, which is the Visual point; and is in that Figure marked <hi>c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Take this advice in Drawing a Perspective Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, wherein there comes many Lines: For I have observed one main thing that makes Perspective be thought so difficult, is the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of many Lines directing to many designed points: Therefore when you draw some busie peece in Perspective, you may for the directing your Ey, Draw the Diagonals in Red, the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual Raies in Black, Perpendiculars in Green, or any other different Coullers from that you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your Perspective Figure shall be of.</p>
               <p>There may be some more Rules worth your Notice: but as yet not comeing to my memory, Take these for the present; and as the rest offer themselves to me, I shall present them to you. In the mean time, If you meet with any words of Art you understand not, Look over the Leaf, where I have digested them in an Alphabetical order, and to them annexed their explanation.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe given Height from the ground to the Ey, or which is all one from the Base to the Horizon is <hi>a b,</hi> the Distance from the Foot to the Glasse is <hi>a c.</hi> The given point or Object to be represented in the Glass or Section is <hi>d.</hi> The Glass ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted perpendicularly on the Base is <hi>e f g h.</hi> Draw a Visual ray from the Ey at the point <hi>b</hi> to the Object at the point <hi>d,</hi> as <hi>b d,</hi> and another line from the point of Station <hi>a</hi> to the same point <hi>d,</hi> as <hi>a d;</hi> then erect a Perpeneicular on the point where this line <hi>a d</hi> cuts the line of Section as at <hi>c,</hi> and where this Perpendicular cuts the Visual ray <hi>b d</hi> as here it does in <hi>i</hi> is the point that the Object <hi>d</hi> appears in the Glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To find the Scituation of a Line in the Section or Glass,</hi> You must have the Height given, as <hi>a b,</hi> and the Distance as <hi>a c,</hi> And as you were taught before to find the place of one point in the Glass, so now by the same Rule the Operation must be doubled to find the place of two points in the Glass, and then a straight line drawn between those two points is the line required. <hi>Example.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The given Line is <hi>d e,</hi> Therefore from the Visual point <hi>b</hi> I draw two straight lines or Visual rays to the two points at the two ends of the line <hi>d e,</hi> and two other straight lines from the point of Station <hi>a</hi> to the same points <hi>d e,</hi> And from the points where these two lines intersect the Glass (as here they do in the points <hi>c f)</hi> I erect Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars into the two Visual raies, and where these Perpendiculars inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sect the two Visual raies (as here they do at <hi>g h)</hi> is the points <hi>d e</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the Glass, and a straight line drawn between the points <hi>g</hi> and <hi>h</hi> represents in the Glass the straight line <hi>d e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To find the scituation of a Square figure in the Glass.</hi> You have the given Height <hi>a b,</hi> the Distance <hi>c.</hi> Draw Visual rays from the Visual point <hi>b</hi> to every angle of the Square <hi>d e f g,</hi> and draw also lines from the point of Station <hi>a</hi> to every angle of the Square: and where these lines of Station cut the line of Section (as here they do in the points <hi>h i k l)</hi> erect Perpendiculars into each respective Visual ray, and where these Perpendiculars cut each respective Visual ray (as here in the points <hi>m n o p)</hi> shall be each respective point of the Square in the Glass, and straight lines drawn from point to point shall include the Square.</p>
               <p>These three Operations (though in effect but one) are sufficient
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105730:13"/>
to shew the nature and quality of the Appearence in Section or Glass: but this way is not much used among Artists; nor is it so ready for use as laying the Figure along on the Base-line drawn Parallel to the Horizon; because this way you must draw several Base-lines, even so many as you have given points in your Figure; for in this Square you have four Base-lines, as the lines <hi>d a, e a, f a, g a,</hi> are all Base-lines, which together with the line of Section and the several Perpendiculars ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted on them would so pester a large Designe that it would be both tedious to draw and difficult to understand when drawn: Therefore I shall hereafter in the rest of this Book leave out the Glass thus erected, and shew you how to perform the same by laying the Figure along on the Base.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105730:13"/>
in <hi>k</hi> and <hi>l)</hi> shall be two points, between which the straight line <hi>k l</hi> being drawn shall be the Scenographick appearance of the line <hi>d e.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If you understand these two Operations rightly, you have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made a good progress in Perspective; for knowing how to place every point and line, you must needs know how to draw all Lines Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures and Bodies: Lines being but a progression of points. And all Figures are made of Lines, and all Bodies made of Figures, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Definition of Geometers.</p>
               <p>Having shewed you how to draw a Point and a Line: I come next to Figures, for the drawing of which Scenographically, I shall give you this general method, which after (by a little practice) you have made your self familiar with, will serve you to draw all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Figures.</p>
               <p>Having considered your Height and Distance, and in what Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition your Figure shall stand, and drawn it accordingly, either with its Side or Angle against the Base: Erect Perpendiculars from the several Angles, or other designed points in your Figure into the Base, and transfer the length of each Perpendicular from the point where it touches the Base, to the Base on the side contrary to the Point of Distance: For then Diametrals drawn to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars in the Base, and Diagonals to the several transferred distances shall at the intersection with their respective Diametrals give the Angles of the Figure. That is, where any Diagonal drawn from any transferred distance on the Base, shall intersect the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral drawn from the Perpendicular on the Base of that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred distance, shall be the point where the Angle shall be placed, that represents in Scenographic the Angle from whence the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular was erected on the Geometrick Figure: and lines drawn from point to point, shall inclose the Scenographick Figure.</p>
               <p>This is a sure method and plain; yet because I will make it more casic, I shall give you several Examples of this way of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in several Figures; viz. the Square, a Triangle, a Hexagon, a Pentagon, an Octagon, a Circle, an Oval, and an irregular Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure in several Positions.</p>

As you may see by the corresponding Romain and Itallick Letters.</p>
               <p>The other Octagon is also made by drawing Perpendiculars from each Angle up to the Base: And (as before) transfer the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105730:16"/>
distances of every Angle from the Base to the Base: Then from the Visual point draw Diametrals to the Perpendiculars in the Base, and from the point of distance Diagonals to every transferred distance on the Base., so shall the mutual intersections of each Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral, and Diagonal give the Angles of the Octagon, and so much of the Visual raies and lines of distance as are comprehended between e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very two Angles shall be the several Sides of the whole Figure.</p>
               <p>By this <hi>Operation</hi> therefore you may perceive an Octagon with one of its Side against the Base, is readier to be drawn than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Figure: Because in all other Figures after you have found the several Angles of the Figure, you must draw straight lines from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle to Angle to represent the Sides: But herein you describe the Angles and Sides all at once. And hereby you may (if you will consider it) apprehend the nature and quality of the three most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Lines used in Perspective viz. the Parallel or Fore-right Line, the Return Line, and Diagonal Line: For as was said in the <hi>Preface,</hi> those Lines that are Parallel to the Base in a Geometrick Figure, must be Parallel to the Base in the Scenographick Figure: And those Lines that return from the Base right Angularly in the Geometrick Figure, must in the Scenographick Figure be drawn from the Visual point, and Diagonal Lines viz. those lines that cut off a part of the two sides of the Right Angle at equal distance from the Angle in the Geometrick Figure, shall be drawn from the points of distance. Thus you see the Lines <hi>d e</hi> and ih in the Geometrick Figure are Parallel to the Horizon: so are their representatives de and ih in the Sceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick Figure: And thus you see the lines <hi>f g</hi> and <hi>l k</hi> in the Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick Figure Perpendiculars, and their representatives fg and lk in Scenographie are drawn from the Visual point.

               <p>The making of these two Scenographick Plains full of Squares is of great use in Perspective, for the ready designing and placing all sorts of Buildings and moveables in their proper distances one from another, and in their various appearences to the Ey: For in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing of Stools, Tables, Crosses, and many other Figures your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is as much facilitated as by coppying a Picture when it and what you draw on arc devided into squares, and is indeed vertually the same thing.

And so for any number of Squares.</p>
               <p>Again, For the various appearence to the Ey. All Buildings or Moveables whose fore-sides are scituate in an Orthographick Plain are drawn upon the Squares in Operat.

               <p>THis is performed by help of a Ground-plain of Squares made by lines drawn from the Visual point <hi>a,</hi> and the point of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <hi>b</hi> to the Base, as by Operat. XV. This Ground-plain contains seven Squares in length, and seven in bredth, whereof
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:105730:20"/>
the thickness of the wall on either side takes up one quarter of a Square, as is seen at a b. In the Wall is made a Door, containing in bredth three Squares on the Ground-plain, as <hi>s x t v;</hi> and if you draw two lines from the opposite angles of the Door, where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect each other shall be the middle of the Door; as you may try on the other side of the Wall, where lines drawn from <hi>f h</hi> and <hi>g i</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect each other at <hi>k,</hi> which by the Perpendicular <hi>k l</hi> you may find falls in the middle between six Scenographick Squares: that is, three is contained between <hi>l</hi> and <hi>i,</hi> and three between <hi>l</hi> and <hi>f.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the furthermost side of the Wall is a Thorow-fare made of the same height the Door is, by drawing the Diametral <hi>t v</hi> from the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual point <hi>a</hi> and continuing it to <hi>e</hi> at the angle of the two Walls, and from thence by drawing the line <hi>e d y</hi> parallel to the Horizon, which Thorow-fare (being of the width of three Squares, as between <hi>e</hi> and <hi>g j</hi> is described by erecting Perpendiculars from the points <hi>e z</hi> to cut the Parallel <hi>d y</hi> in the points <hi>d y,</hi> as you may see in the Figure: And so the Thorow-fare <hi>d y e z</hi> Orthographically becomes equal to the Scenographical Door <hi>t v s x.</hi>

Do the like for the rest of the Joysts, all but the middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, which because the Ey lies just under it shews but two of its cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; as you may see in the Figure at <hi>n.</hi> Then if you will cover these Joysts with Boards, or Plancks athwart, you may for your better guidance divide the Ceeling into four Scenographick parts by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines from the Angles h i to the Angles <hi>r p;</hi> for where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect one another as in the point k, draw a line Parallel to <hi>r p,</hi> and that line divides the Ceeling into two Scenographick halfs: And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lines drawn from the points h i <hi>r p</hi> to the two ends of this Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>To describe the inside of a Chamber with three Doors, one on either side, and one right before.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is performed upon a Ground-plain of nine Squares in length and nine in bredth, (drawn as by Operat. XV.) I shall not need say any thing of the sides of the Wall, it having been taught in the last Operation: But the Doors standing partly open and partly shut require a little instruction to shew the designing of them in Perspective.</p>
               <p>You must understand that a Door being hung upon hinges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes in its opening and shutting a Semi-circle. As for Example, If it stand wide open with the back side of it against the Wall, it fetches the sweep of a Semi-circle before it can shut upon the Door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frame that runs range with the Wall. Therefore having the width you intend your Door shall be of, and pitcht upon what place in the side of a Wall it shall move, (as on its Axis,) you need but describe on a loose paper a Geometrick Semi-circle in the same number of Squares that you intend your Door shall describe its Semi-circle in, and observe the points of the Parallels and Perpendiculars that this Semi-circle cuts, for the Scenographick Semi-circle must pass through the same points of the Diametral and Diagonal lines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed on the Scenographick Ground-plain: As you may see the Door <hi>a</hi> a <hi>d</hi> d, containing six Squares (as from the center <hi>a</hi> to <hi>e</hi> three, and from <hi>a</hi> to <hi>f</hi> three) describes on the Ground-plain the Semi-circle <hi>e l h i d g f,</hi> which if you draw a Geometrick Semi-circle in six Squares you will find that this Scenographick Semi-circle passes through the same points of Diametrals and Diagonals as your Geometrick Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi circle does through Parallels and Perpendiculars. Then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how neer open or shut the Door is you intend to describe; that is, what angle it makes with the Wall; for the same quantity you must set off on your Scenographick Semi-circle; as here it stands open by the distance <hi>f d g:</hi> Therefore draw a straight line between <hi>a</hi> the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Door moves on and <hi>d</hi> the edge of the Door, and prolong it into the Horizon, and that line <hi>d a</hi> shall be the under side of the Door: Then describe the same Semi-circle over the Door that there is on the Ground-plain, by erecting Perpendiculars from as many points as you please of the Semi-circle on the Ground-plain, and by drawing straight lines from each of those points into the center <hi>a</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing them into the Horizon; for where the Perpendiculars cut straight lines drawn from those several points in the Horizon through the upper center a of the Door and so prolonged shall be the points that the upper Scenographick Semi-circle e l i h d g f must run through.</p>
               <p>If you would have the Door stand wider open that you may see more of the entrance as at <hi>i</hi> i, Draw (as before) a straight line from <hi>i</hi> to the center <hi>a</hi> and prolong it into the Horizon, as <hi>i a k,</hi> so shall <hi>i</hi> be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105730:21"/>
the under edge of the Door; and if from the point <hi>i</hi> you erect the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular <hi>i</hi> i for the edge of the Door, a straight line drawn from the point <hi>k</hi> in the Horizon to the point a in the upper center of the Door and prolonged shall give the line <hi>i</hi> a for the upper edge of the Door.</p>
               <p>Thus may you describe a Door standing open to what width you please, as at <hi>a</hi> are the Door stands wide open with its back side a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Wall; at <hi>a</hi> a <hi>l</hi> l it shews less open; at <hi>h</hi> h it shews a Door whose edge lies almost in the same line its Axis does, and so the Door shuts neerer and neerer, as at <hi>g</hi> g <hi>a</hi> a the Door appears quite shut: the Door on the other side is made just after the same manner, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needs no more Descriptions.</p>
               <p>The Door in the middle stands also on three Squares, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens through six, and if you describe the Scenographick Semi-circle <hi>m p q</hi> as you were taught just now you may set this Door also open to what width you please. Thus, Erecta Perpendicular on the point of the Semi-circle you intend to open the Door to, and prolong it quite through the Door as <hi>r n s,</hi> and with your Compasses measure on the Perpendicular, the distance between that point in the Semi-circle and the Diameter of the Semi-circle, which is the line <hi>m n,</hi> where the Squares end; for that distance set off on the same Perpendicular from the Base as from <hi>r,</hi> shall give a point through which a straight line drawn from the Center of the Door <hi>o</hi> to the Horizon shall be the point in the Horizon from whence a straight line drawn to the upper end of the Doors Axis shall give the shortning of the upper edge of the Door, and the points where the two straight lines cut the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular shall be the points that shall shew the shortning of the fore edge of the Door.</p>
               <p>Above this Door is made a round Hole of the same width the Door is, and of the thickness of the wall; which because the lines by which it is made, are so plain and the manner of working so easie I shall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear farther Instructions on it.</p>
               <p>Under this Arched Roof are drawn Parallel prickt lines to shew the devisions of the Roof: and by these devisions either with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, or else a steddy hand, you may describe the Arches as you may see them in the Figure.</p>
               <p>By the making the foresaid Doors may be understood how to make Casements standing open at any width; and several other <hi>Operations</hi> pleasant and necessary for all that Study Perspective.</p>

                  <p>To Describe in <hi>Perspective</hi> the inside of two Chambers one above the other.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis is also performed by help of a Ground-plain, as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Figure: but the difference between this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is. I. This hath another Chamber over it. 2. A
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105730:21"/>
Portal and Hole on one side of the Wall, and another right before you on the middle of the Ground-plain. 3. Steps placed just within this Portal. 4. A square Hole in the middle of the Ground-plain. 5. Shelves on the other side of the Chamber.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For what concerns barely the Chamber over the lowermost Room you may see by the Figure that its Operation is the same with the former; where you see all the three sides of the Chamber wholey, but because the Ceeling <hi>a b c d</hi> of the lower Room lies so much above the Ey, you only see so much of the upper Chamber as is un-obscured by the Ceeling. That is, all above the Catuzes <hi>a d</hi> resting on the two Catuzes <hi>e f:</hi> the rest are only noted with prickt lines, as they would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if the Ceeling were not interposed between the Ey and them: and the Joysts over head are wrought as in the last <hi>Operat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Portal on the side of the Wall you may see that it stands on three Squares on the Ground-plain, as doth the Portal right before you. Now to make the Arch over this Portal correspond with the Arch of the Portal right before you, viz. of the same height as that Portal is do thus. Draw a line just where the Arching begins paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel to the Horizon as <hi>g h,</hi> and prolong it to the corner of the fore-right Wall as at <hi>g:</hi> Then laying a Ruler to the Visual point and the point <hi>g</hi> describe the line <hi>m g,</hi> then draw another Parallel line on the top of the Arch of the Portal and prolong it also to the corner of the fore-right Wall as to <hi>i,</hi> and laying a Ruler to that point <hi>i</hi> and the Visual point draw the Diametral line <hi>n o i,</hi> then erect two Perpendiculars <hi>n l</hi> and <hi>o m</hi> from the sides of the Portal to intersect these Diametrals, so shall you by crossing the Angles of intersection have the Center <hi>p,</hi> and upper and lower bounds of the Arch; which a steddy hand may easily reduce into form.</p>
               <p>This way of working is exact enough for Painters or other Artisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. But if you will be yet more precise, See <hi>Oper.</hi> XXV. XXVI.</p>
               <p>The Hole in the side of the Wall in the upper Chamber is made af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same way, viz by crecting Perpendiculars to the designed width, as here it is three Squares on the Ground-plain, (the same with the Portal) and by drawing Diametrals from the Visual point for the depth of the Hole; for where the Perpendiculars and Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals intersect each other shall be the Angles of the Square that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Hole, and straight lines drawn from Angle to Angle shall intersect each other in the Center of the Hole.</p>
               <p>By the same way of working you have the back side of this round Hole described to the thickness of the Wall, and also the back side of the Portal (as you may see in the Figure.</p>
               <p>In the other side of the Wall on the Ground-plain is made another half-round Hole; which being performed after the same manner needs no further Explanation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Just within the Portal are placed four Steps going straight up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; which are thus made. Draw the two slope lines <hi>q q</hi> and <hi>r r</hi> (to what slope you please) parallel to each other for the width of the Steps: then assigne a depth for the first Step, as to <hi>s,</hi> and Parallel to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:105730:22"/>
the Base draw a line for the bredth of the Step, as <hi>t s,</hi> then draw Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrals from the points <hi>s</hi> and <hi>t</hi> to the slope line <hi>q q,</hi> so shall the first Step be made. The rest of the Steps are made after the same manner; observing that all the several Steps on their several Perpendiculars are equal in depth to the first.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the middle of the Ground-plain is made a square Hole as <hi>v x z z,</hi> which may serve for an Entrance down a pair of Stairs leading to some Vault or Cellar. These Stairs are in length three Squares, and in depth the transferred distance of one Square, as you may see the depth of the first Step downwards is <hi>v x,</hi> which is the transferred di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>v y,</hi> the bredth of the Step is <hi>x,</hi> a so that a Diametral drawn from the Visual point to <hi>x</hi> and so prolonged directs you to the second Step at b, and by placing one foot of your Compasses at the point c, which is in the same Diametral the point <hi>v</hi> is, and extending the other to the point d (which also is in the same Diametral the point <hi>y</hi> is) you transfer the distance of d c to c b which is the distance <hi>y v</hi> trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>v x;</hi> and another Perpendicular erected from the point b to c shews the depth of the second Step. 'The rest of the Steps are made after the same manner.</p>
               <p n="5">5. On the other side of the Chamber against the Wall is set three Shelves, two above the Horizontal line, and one below, as e f g: The further ends of them rests in the Wall right before you, and the higher end is fastned to a Post erected Perpendicularly on the Ground-plain; the bredth of these Shelves are one Square on the Ground-plain, as you may see by the line h i, from which Diametrals prolonged to the Post the several Shelves are described.</p>
               <p>Here you may note that by the several places of these three Shelves you have several appearances of them; for the Shelf g lying under the Horizon shews its upper Plain. The Shelf f lying a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon shews its under Plain, though much fore-shortned. The Shelf e lying pretty high above the Horizon discovers the under Plain more intirely. But on the other side the Wall you have the Shelf k, which because it stands just in the Horizontal line discovers nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the upper or under Plain, but only the very edge of the Shelf.</p>

               <p>Having thus projected these Scenographick Squares whereon the Columns must stand, you must erect Perpendiculars from every angle of these Squares through the Horizontal line and so upwards to the height your outmost Column ought to be, as here to the line <hi>i k</hi> parallel to the Horizon; for the points where Diametrals in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersect this line and the Perpendiculars <hi>a i</hi> and <hi>d k</hi> shall be angles impending perpendicularly over the respective angles of each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Square in the Ground-plain: As here the angle <hi>i</hi> hangs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly over the angle <hi>a,</hi> and the angle <hi>k</hi> hangs directly over the angle <hi>d:</hi> Then from the points of Distance draw Diagonal lines to the points <hi>i k,</hi> and where those Diagonals intersect the Perpendiculars erected on the Diagonal angles of the Square in the Ground-plain must another line be drawn parallel to the Horizon, and also o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diagonal lines which shall include the Squares that hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the two first Squares in the Ground-plain.</p>
               <p>The other Squares are found after the same way, viz. by the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual intersections of the Diagonals with the Perpendiculars. As may be seen in the Figure.</p>
               <p>The Arches over these Columns are very easily made: for by drawing the Perpendicular through the Visual point in the Horizon into <hi>l</hi> you have all the lines drawn parallel to the Horizon devided into two equal parts, And by placing one foot of your Compasses in the middle of the respective Parallel lines and opening the other to the angles of the Square that lies in the same Parallel line you may describe those respective Arches. As for example. If you place one foot of your Compasses in the middle point on the line <hi>i k</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the other to the point <hi>i</hi> or <hi>k</hi> you may describe the outmost Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-circle, and by closing the Compasses to the other angle of the Square which lies in the same line, you describe the second Semi-cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; for the third Semi-circle you may place one foot of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes in the middle of the next parallel line and extend the other to the point <hi>o</hi> in the same line, and describe the Semi-circle <hi>o p.</hi> This work
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:105730:23"/>
is so plain and easie to be understood by the Figure, that I need di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse no further upon it.</p>
               <p>In this Figure you may note, what correspondence the Squares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Horizon have with those below the Horizon. Yet as the Squares above the Horizon have a greater distance from the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon than those below the Horizon have, it falls out that the upper Squares are larger than the under Squares: The reason whereof you may easily see by consulting the Figure.</p>
               <p>And as the Squares have a correspondence, so also have the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonals; for the crossings of the Diagonals above the Horizon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spond with the crossings of the Diagonals below the Horizon.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:105730:23"/>
the side with <hi>a b c d e f g h:</hi> Then erect a Perpendicular on the corner of the Ground-plain of the height you intend your side Wall shall be as <hi>h i,</hi> and erect another Perpendicular on the corner of the Ground-plain as 5 5, and by drawing two Diametrals through the Visual point the point <hi>i</hi> and the point 5 on the top, and from the Visual point through <hi>h</hi> to 5 on the Base, you shall have the Scenographick appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the side of the Wall wherein the Arch shall be made. Then from the point h (which you may see by the Orthographick or fore-right Arch is the point where the Arching begins,) draw another Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametral into the Perpendicular line 5 5 as h i, and you will find the same distance between 1 5 on the Perpendicular as there is between 1 5 on the Base: But the rest of the distances you must transfer, as the Distance between 1 2 on the Base you must transfer from 1 to 2 on the Perpedicular, and the distance 1 3 on the Base you must trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from 1 to 3 on the Perpenicular: And so for the rest.</p>
               <p>Then from the points <hi>a b c d e f g</hi> on the Ground-plain erect Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars into the Ceeling and where Diametrals drawn from the points 1 2 3 4 5 intersect these several Perpendiculars shall be the points through which the Arch must pass.

               <p>For finding the other points through which the Arch must pass, you must go back again to 4 and see where that Diametral intersects the Perpendicular <hi>e</hi> for there shall be another point, and where the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrals from 3 2 1 intersects the Perpendiculars <hi>f g h</hi> shall be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther points through which the Arch is carried.</p>
               <p>Having finisht this Arch the other Arch is easily made, for by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parallels through the points 1 2 3 4 5 in the top to the points <hi>k l m n o,</hi> and also Parallels from the points a b c d e f g h, Diametrals drawn to the points <hi>k l m n o</hi> will intersect the Parallels drawn from a b c d e f g h in the points through which that Arch must also pass.</p>

                  <p>The making of Cross Arches in <hi>Perspective.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN this Figure is described four Arches, viz. one Orthographick Arch, which is the great Semi-circle marked 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, an Arch behind it Perspectively deminished, marked 9 <hi>a b,</hi> and the two side Arches, whose Diametrals are 1 9 and <hi>b</hi> 9. These four Arches are required to be made before you can make Cross-arching, As in the Operation you will find. Therefore having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed the two side Arches (as by the last Operation) you must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Orthographick Arch or Semi-circle into eight equal parts, and from the Visual point draw Diametrals to every one of them, as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, Then from the points where the Perpendiculars cut the Diametrals of the side Arch, as in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9, Draw lines parallel to the Horizon to intersect the respective Diametrals of the Semi-circle; for those respective intersections shall be the points through which the Cross-arching must be drawn. As for Example. Draw a line parallel to the Horizon from the point 2 in the side Arch to the Diametral 2 in the Orthographick Arch, and that shall be one point through which the line of Cross-arching must run: Then draw another parallel line from the point 3 in the side Arch to the Diametral 3 of the Orthographick Arch, and there shall be another point through which the Cross arch must run. Then draw another Parallel line from the point 4 in the side Arch to the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral 4 of the Orthographick Arch, and there shall be another point through which the Cross-arch must run. Do the like from the points 6 7 8 9, so shall you have all the points through which one of the lines of the Cross-arch must run.</p>
               <p>The other Cross-arching viz. the Arch <hi>b</hi> 8 9 on the other side, is drawn by continuing the Parallels which you drew from the points 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 of the side Arch into the Diametrals 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1, for at the intersections of the Parallels with these Diametrals shall be the points through which the line of Cross-arching must pass; which is indeed nothing but the Arch on the other side reversed.</p>
               <p>This way of working is very easie, and the truth of it very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous. For as this line of Cross-Arching impends the Diagonals <hi>k l m n</hi> on the Ground-plain, so would you find that if Perpendiculars were erected from the points <hi>o p</hi> &amp;c. on the Ground-plain, they would run into the points where the Parallels and Diametrals cut each other above in the Crossing of the Ceeling which is a proof sufficient to verifie the truth of this <hi>Operation.</hi>

               <p>As for Example. Having on the Base set off the bredth of the Pedestal as <hi>a d</hi> from the Visual point <hi>c,</hi> draw a Diametral, and that Diametral shall be the range of the whole row of Columns: And by drawing a Diagonal from the point of Distance to the point <hi>a</hi> you have at the intersection of the Diametral with the Diagonal in the point <hi>e</hi> the fore-shortning of the inside of the Pedestal <hi>d e,</hi> then by erecting the two Perpendiculars <hi>d f</hi> and <hi>a g</hi> for the height of the Pedestal, and by erecting the Perpendicular <hi>e h</hi> at the point of intersection with the Diametral <hi>c e d</hi> and the Diagonal <hi>b e a,</hi> and by drawing the lines <hi>f g</hi> and <hi>h i</hi> Parallel to the Base, and the Diametrals <hi>h f</hi> and <hi>i g</hi> you have the Pedestal included in all its visible sides, and the Square <hi>h i f g</hi> shall be the Scenographick Plain of the top of the Pedestal, and the intersecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Diagonals <hi>h g</hi> and <hi>i f</hi> shall be the Center of the Plain as at <hi>k.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this way of working all the other Pedestals are erected, and all their visible and invisible Sides and Angles found. For Example.

               <p>A Square that hath Steps to ascend on all four sides hath all the sides of those Steps parallel to the undermost Step: Therefore in making the Ichnographie of this Figure you must include so many Squares as you think good with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in your outmost Square, all equidistant from and parallel to the outmost Square: And from one half of the Ichnographie produce the Scenographick Ground-plain for what Height and Distance you please.</p>
               <p>Having therefore designed the Height <hi>a b</hi> of the first Step <hi>b c,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe a parallel Scale, Thus, Draw a straight line from the Base to any convenient part of the Horizon, as here to <hi>d e,</hi> then prolong the line <hi>b c</hi> into this line, as into <hi>f,</hi> then from the Visual point draw a line through <hi>f</hi> into the Base, as at <hi>g,</hi> and from the point <hi>g</hi> draw a line to the point <hi>e</hi> in the Horizon, Then transfer the distances a h, a i, and a k on the Diagonal line in the Scenographick Ichnographie to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal line <hi>a l</hi> in the Structure, as to <hi>a h, a i, a k,</hi> and from those points on that Diagonal line raise the Perpendiculars <hi>h m n, i o p, k q r,</hi> Then from the point <hi>b</hi> draw the Diagonal <hi>b m,</hi> and where that Diagonal <hi>b m</hi> cuts the Perpendicular <hi>h m</hi> shall be the bottom of the under Step <hi>m s,</hi> which Parallel line must be continued into <hi>t,</hi> for by drawing the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual ray from <hi>t</hi> to the Visual point you will cut the line <hi>d e</hi> in <hi>v,</hi> from
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105730:26"/>
whence the line <hi>v n</hi> drawn parallel to the Horizon gives the top of the second Step: Then by drawing the Diagonal <hi>n o</hi> you have the bottom of the third Step at <hi>o,</hi> from which point a Parallel drawn into <hi>g e</hi> and a Visual ray drawn from that point in <hi>g e</hi> shall cut <hi>d e,</hi> from which intersection in <hi>d e</hi> a Parallel drawn into <hi>p</hi> shall give the top of the third Step. The like you must do for the fourth Step. Then lastly, draw a Visual ray from the point <hi>a</hi> and a Diagonal from the point <hi>x</hi> to <hi>y,</hi> and where the foresaid Visual ray cuts this Diagonal erect a Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular into the Visual ray <hi>b z,</hi> and from the point <hi>z</hi> draw a line pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Horizon as far as the second Step, which shall shew how much of the hind part of the first Step will be seen. The same way you may find how much of the other Steps appear, as you may see in the Figure: for where the Diagonal <hi>x y</hi> cuts the several Visual raies, in those points the Perpendiculars erected into the Visual raies before, it shews how much of the hind part of each respective Step appears.</p>
               <p>On these Steps you may place a Fountain; a Pyramid, or a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn, as is lately erected in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> in the middle of the <hi>Pietzo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Parallel Scale is of great use, for by help of it you may set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Object in its true place, as well as with a Ground-plain of Squares: But you must remember to place your Perpendicular at the point of Distance, and so let it fall into the Base, for then by drawing a slope line from the point of Distance to any devision of the Base, and by drawing a Diametral to the Prependicular in the Base, where the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metral cuts the slope line shall be the Height of the first parallel line of the Scale: and by drawing another Diametral to the point where the first Parallel cuts the Perpendicular the Diametral shall cut the slope line in a point through which a Parallel drawn shall be the second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel line, &amp;c.</p>

               <head>OPERATION <hi>XXXII.</hi>
               </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>How an Object that is to be placed high above the Horizontal line, shall be made that it appear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to an Object placed but a little above the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEcause those Visual Raies that proceed from the Center of the Ey straight and directly forwards are more strong than those that decline towards the right or left hand, or are either ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated or depressed above or below the Horizontal line. Therefore any Object that stands at a convenient distance in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal line directly before the middle of the Ball of the Ey appears more perfect and true in shape and demension than if it were placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny where else; as may be proved by placing two Objects of the same shape and demension one in the Horizontal line just before you on a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105730:27"/>
Wall, and the other right above it at some considerable height on the same Wall; for you will find that the Object thus elevated will appear less than that which is placed on the Horizontal line: and that if the same Object be placed yet higher it will appear yet less and less. Therefore to know how big you shall make an Object for any given Height and Distance above the Horizontal line that it appear equal to an Object placed right before you in the Horizontal line, You must first consider, That as the Object that lies right before the middle of the Ball of the Ey in the Horizontal line appears most perfect, and by consequence shews its truest demension; So the Object that is placed higher or lower, or on the right or left hand appears less perfect, and by consequence requires a greater demension to make it appear per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for the Sight moving circularly in the Ey makes on a Wall the devisions of a Tangent line; and by so much as a Tangent increases upwards, in such proportion does the strength of the Optick faculty of the Ey deminish upwards. Therefore the Object that shall be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced any considerable height above the Horizontal line, and to be seen from a designed Station must exceed the Object placed just above the Horizontal line in such proportion as the Tangent of that Arch does the Tangent of the Arch just above the Horizontal line.</p>
               <p>This Rule is very brief, and perhaps may not be understood by all Speculators in Perspective; Therefore I shall a little inlarge hereon, Because it is of eminent concernment in the true Seeing, Judging and making of Figures.</p>
               <p>Having designed your Distance from the Wall; Set it off from the point your Ey is placed in; then set one foot of your Compasses in that point, and with the other describe the arch of a Circle, and devide it into so many equal parts as you please. So shall the raies that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from your Ey continued to the Wall shew on the Wall in what proportion the Object ought to increase to appear so large as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that is to be placed just before you on the Horizontal line.</p>
               <p>For Example. Your Distance from the Wall is <hi>a b,</hi> Therefore at the point <hi>a</hi> describe the arch 1 2 3 4 &amp;c. which you may devide into so many equal parts as you please, and by laying a straight Ruler on the point <hi>a</hi> and on every one of those devisions, that straight Ruler will point out on the Wall or on the line <hi>b c</hi> which represents a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular line on the Wall the several sizes that an Object is to be of placed on those several Heights to make it appear equal to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject placed just above the Horizontal line.</p>
               <p>But that great Master <hi>Albert Durer</hi> hath very handsomly handled this Operation in an erected Pillar, wherein he hath made an Inscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption in Letters, thereby demonstrating how much those Letters that stand high above the Ey must be made bigger than those that ly neer the Horizontal line: as you may see by this annexed Inscription.</p>
               <p>Having thus performed the Operation, you will see how much big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Letters far above the Ey are than those that ly neerer to the Ey. And this Rule is to be observed not only in the magnifying of Letters thus placed one above another, but also in magnifying of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures

               <argument>
                  <p>To Describe in <hi>Perspective</hi> a pair of Winding Stairs.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HItherto we have imagined the Glass to be placed Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to the Base, and therefore as hath been said in CHAP. III. Those lines of a Figure that in a Geometrick Figure are Perpendiculars, are in the Scenographie also Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars; as here is seen in these winding Stairs; where because these Stairs should diminish upwards, the Glass is placed Oblique to the Base. But to the matter.</p>
               <p>This Geometrick Ichnographie is divided into sixteen equal parts, as 1 2 3 4 5, &amp;c. which represents sixteen Steps that wind once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Newel. Therefore reduce this Geometrick Ground-plain into Scenographie, as you were taught in <hi>Operat.</hi> X. by erecting Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars into the Base &amp;c. and mark the Scenographick Ichno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie with the same Figures the Orthographick is; then on the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Scenographick Ichnographie at the point 13 erect the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular 13 <hi>a,</hi> and divide it into so many equal parts as you please or intend to have Steps, and erect another line on the same point 13 into the point of deminution as 13 <hi>b:</hi> Then from every one of these devisions on the Perpendicular 13 <hi>a</hi> draw a Visual raie from the Visu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al point <hi>c</hi> to the line of deminution 13 <hi>b,</hi> and from the points where those Visual raies cut this line of deminution 13 <hi>b,</hi> draw Paralles to the Base into the middle of the Newel, and those Parallels shall show the Distance or Height of every Step one above the other on the Newel. And for the Distance or Height of the further end of every Step you must erect a Perpendicular on the extream point of the Ichnographie as <hi>d e</hi> of the same length your Newel is; and devide it into so many equal parts as you have Steps, or as your Newel is devided into unequal parts, as <hi>f g h i k</hi> &amp;c. to <hi>t,</hi> and from the Visual point draw Visual raies through every one of them to intersect e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very respective line of deminution raised out of the Ichnographie so shall Parallels drawn from every intersection shew the height of the further end of every respective Step, as the first intersection is made on the first line of deminution <hi>d</hi> 17 at 1, therefore a Parallel drawn from the point 1 where the first Visual raie intersects the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel line 1, shall shew the height of the further end of the first Step. The second Visual raie is drawn into the second line of deminution to the line 2, therefore the Parallel drawn from that point shall shew the height of the further end of the second Step. The like is to be understood of all the other Steps.</p>
               <p>Then for the length of every Step, instead of erecting a Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105730:28"/>
on the several points of the Ichnographie to find them as you have been often taught before; Draw several lines from the point of deminution which is in the top of the Newel into every one of those devisions on the Ichnographie, and those lines of deminution shall bound every respective Step: As that raised out of the point 1 of the Ichnographie shall shew the length of the first Step. That rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the point 2 of the Ichnographie shews the length of the second Step: and so for all the rest.</p>

               <p>BEcause the multiplicity of lines in the last Figure may somewhat confound a Practitioner, here is inserted another Figure of a pair of winding Stairs, quite finisht, made by the Precepts of the last Operation.

               <p>If you would have more turnings about the Newel, you must devide the two lines of deminution on each side into so many the more parts: As you were taught in the last Operation.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Description of a pair of Double Stairs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on two persons the one ascending the other descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall not come at one another.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THese double Stairs are insersed as a peece of Rarity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed only in Orthographie, and not by the strickt Rules of Perspective, lest with many lines the work should be obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yet such as list to be curious therein may in the last (and several other) Operations find Rules whereby they may effect their purpose.</p>
               <p>Describe a Circle (or which is equivalent a Semi-circle) for the Ich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nographie, as 1 2 3 &amp;c. to 13, and in it describe a smaller Circle, as <hi>a b c</hi> for the bigness of the Newel: Then devide the great Semi-circle into twelve equal parts, as 1 2 3 to 13, and draw lines from those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions into the Semi-circle made for the bigness of the Newel, so will that Semi-circle also be devided into twelve equal parts: Then on every one of the points in the great Semi-circle erect Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and those Perpendiculars shall shew the ends of each respective Step. As the Perpendicular at 1 1 bounds the outward end of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105730:28"/>
first Step: The Perpendicular at 2 2 bounds the second Step, &amp;c. to 24. which makes good a whole Circle in the Ichnographie; and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars erected from the inner Semi-circle marks on the Newel the ends of the same Steps. Work the same way with the Steps on your right hand.</p>
               <p>You may perceive that the winding of these Steps about the Newel may properly be compared to the winding of a thred about the Spindle of a Screw. And that as those Spindles that have but one thred winde not so suddenly about the Spindle as those that have two threds; So these Stairs having two Ascents, each begun Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically opposite to the other winde more suddenly about than those that have but one Ascent: and therefore it is requisite the whole Circle be devided into twenty four parts for these sort of Stairs, when as other Stairs have the Ichnographie devided but into twelve or six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen equal parts.</p>
               <p>The Newel is pierced through in several places only to let in Light.</p>
               <p>Who was the first Inventer of these Stairs is not well known. But at <hi>Sciamburg</hi> in <hi>France</hi> in the Kings Pallace is a pair of them, made by <hi>Piedro del Bergo,</hi> and <hi>Ichan Cosin.</hi> They are also set forth by <hi>Vignola,</hi> in his Book of Perspective, from whence this is taken.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>YOu were shewn in <hi>Operat.</hi> XXVI. that an Object placed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Ey deminishes. It is the same thing with an Object placed far below the Ey. For as you were told in Chap. II. <hi>Desin.</hi> III. The Visual raies do at last meet in a point: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this <hi>Operat.</hi> the Ey being placed above the Edisice, the upper Railes seem larger and wider than the under Railes, and the Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters under the upper Railes in <hi>a b c d</hi> appear greater than the Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in <hi>e f g h,</hi> because the upper Rails and Bannesters ly neerer the Ey than the under, and so gradually the Object deminishes till you come to the Plat-form <hi>i k l m,</hi> on which Plat-form you may note that the Square devisions being fifteen in length, and ten in breadth, are all equal among themselves; because the Glass is placed Parallel to the Horizon. And as you were told in Chap. II. <hi>Desin.</hi> VI. where the Glass is Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the Horizon, all Objects on the Horizon have a true Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick appearance, but where the Glass is erected to cut the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon the Object seems a wry and shortens proportionable to the Angle the Glass makes with the Horizon, and so produces a Scenogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick appearance. For, for this cause you have the Plat-form Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thographie,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105730:29"/>
and the Structure thereon erected Scenographie; for as was said, the Plat-form lies parallel to the Glass, But the Structure is perpendicularly erected thereon.</p>
               <p>This being rightly understood, you have already learnt the making this Edisice: For this Structure of Rails Bannesters Pilasters and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns are erected on the four sides of the Base of the Plat-form by Visual raies drawn from the Visual point <hi>n.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Example of the whole. In the first place, That the upper Rail ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears greater than the under, is (as was said) because it lies neerer the Ey: for if the Plat-form were elevated above the Pilasters the Squares thereon would appear as large as the Squares <hi>o p q:</hi> and if the Plat-form were elevated above the Columns, the Squares would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear yet greater by so much as the Diametrals are wider assunder: And by consequence, if the Plat-form were elevated to the upper Rail (which is neerest the Ey) the Squares would appear yet greater: But the Plat-form being so much farther off the Ey than the upper Rail, the Squares thereon draw neerer to the Visual point. Whence it also follows, that the Ranges of Bannesters in <hi>e f g h</hi> appear less than the Ranges of Bannesters in <hi>a b c d,</hi> But the Pilasters, Columns. Banne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, &amp;c. are all erected upon Visual raies, as you may see in the Figure.</p>

But if you behold any thing decline, from this Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphick Front, though it be in the Fabrick a line Parallel to the Horizon, you are to draw it Scenographically, viz. from the Visual point, as you may see in the Walls that decline from the Front, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angles therewith: and all the windows that you see in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said Fabrick, how they do notly Parallel to the Horizontal line, nor the side range of Columns on the one side, or Wall on the other: but all are drawn from the Visual point, as was said before.</p>
               <p>This being considered the Operation proves easie, yet that this smal Figure and all the curiosities appertaining to it may be the better understood, I shall explain the whole designe, which briefly is this.</p>

                  <p>To Describe in <hi>Perspective</hi> a Folding-chair a Frame chair, and a Bedsted.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving designed the space in the Ground-plain that the Fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-chair shall stand upon, as here upon the Angles of four of the Squares, viz. <hi>a b c d.</hi> That is, The distance of each foot is two Squares from the next foot; set off such an height from the Base as is proportionable to the length and bredth of the Chair: As here its heighth not being two Squares on the Base, viz. not so much as its length and bredth, the height wants somewhat of the Diagonal length of two Squares on the Base, which you must set off from the points <hi>a</hi> to <hi>c, b</hi> to <hi>f, c</hi> to <hi>g,</hi> and <hi>d</hi> to <hi>h,</hi> but you must note that for every foot you change your measure; for to the foot <hi>a</hi> that stands on the Base you take almost two of the Squares on the Base, to the feet <hi>b d</hi> that stands one Square above the Base, take almost two of those Squares, and for the last foot that stands neerest the Visual point, take almost two of the Squares in that place, so that the measure of each foots height be taken from that Square in the Ground-plain that each foot stands on, as is taught in <hi>Operat.</hi> XVI.</p>
               <p>And because the Square of the seat of the Chair is broader than the Square space that the feet stands upon in the Ground-plain the sides of the Seat hangs over the sides of that Square. Therefore in this case you may erect a Perpendicular from the points <hi>a b c d</hi> up to the Seat towards the point <hi>e f g h,</hi> but you must draw the Seat some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beyond it according as in your discretion you find the Seat of the Chair hangs over the said Square, so have you the corners of the Seat <hi>e f g h:</hi> and by a Diagonal line the height of the Back <hi>i k.</hi> The Rails in the Back, and the Rails between the feet are all drawn by Diagonal lines, as you may see in the Figure.</p>
               <p>If you would have the Corners of this Folding-chair turned more or less towards you, you must draw an Ichnographie of it, as you are taught in <hi>Operat.</hi> L. and then you may turn the Corners of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:105730:30"/>
that Ichnography into what position you will against the Base, and by perpendiculars erected on the Angles of the Ichnographie, as you were taught in the foresaid <hi>Operat.</hi> the Corners of the Chair shall stand in their elected place.</p>
               <p>The other Chair stands with its Foreside directly before the Ey, and is between the two Forefeet, two and an half Diagonal Squares, and between the side feet two Diagonal Squares, so that from these points in the Ground-plain the feet or posts of the Chair are made, by erecting Perpendiculars to your designed height, and then all the fore Rails of the Chair are Parallel to the Base and Horizon, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn or side Rails are Visual lines, as you may see in the Figure.</p>
               <p>The Bedsted stands with its feet <hi>a b</hi> ranging directly forward, and is in length six Squares, and in bredth five Squares; so that the Posts are perpendicularly erected at this Distance to what Height you please: All the fore-Rails are parallels to the Base and Horizon, and the side-Rails are Visual lines, as in the fore-right Chair. Therefore this Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is very easie, unless it be the Tester or Covering of the Bedsted, which because it is ridged at the top, and the fore and hind ends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards each other, may seem somewhat difficult. For design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, Find the middle between the two Posts <hi>a b</hi> in the Base, as at <hi>c,</hi> and draw the Visual line <hi>d c,</hi> and therein designe how much the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Bedsted shall fall away inwards from the upper Rail at the Feet, as from <hi>c</hi> to <hi>e;</hi> Therefore from the point <hi>e</hi> erect a Perpendicular to what convenient height you will above the upper Rail, as into the point <hi>f,</hi> and from the upper ends of the Post <hi>a b</hi> at the points <hi>g h</hi> draw straight lines into the point <hi>f</hi> for that part of the Frame of the Tester that belongs to the Foot end of the Bed-sted. And to draw the hindmost slope of the Tester you may do thus: Make a parallel Scale, (as you were taught in Operat. XXXI.) and on that Scale you may measure how much the angle <hi>e</hi> is erected above its Base, as here you will find a little more than one Square; therefore in the Ground-plain at the distance of a little more than one Square of that Parallel, under the line <hi>i k</hi> which is the bottom of the hind Feet, Draw an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult Parallel inwards within the Bedsted, because the Tester slopes inwards, as <hi>m l,</hi> and where that parallel cuts the Visual line <hi>d e c</hi> shall be the angular point, as at <hi>l,</hi> and a Perpendicular erected on that point shall cut the Visual line drawn to tho point <hi>f</hi> in the point <hi>g,</hi> which is the point that the hind part of the Frame of the Tester must be drawn unto from the two hind Posts. See the Figure.</p>
               <p>These Posts are made square because the hind sides and corners of them may be represented by prickt lines, For in Frame-work it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that one half of the Rails &amp;c. be drawn from the hind sides and corners as well as from the fore sides and corners, which by the help of these prickt lines you are directed to.</p>

                  <p>To describe in <hi>Perspective</hi> a <hi>Form,</hi> a <hi>Table,</hi> and an <hi>Andiron</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Form stands with its ends before the Ey upon the width of two Diagonal Squares on the Ground-plain, as <hi>a b,</hi> and in length ten Diagonal Squares, as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10. You may make the Form of what height you please, as you may see by the Perpendiculars marked <hi>a c, b d,</hi> on the Seat of the Form. The Seat projects or hangs over the Form half a Diagonal Square on each side and end, therefore you must draw an occult Parallel at the distance of half a Diagonal Square within the Base on the Ground-plain as <hi>e e</hi> and <hi>f f,</hi> and two occult Diametrals at the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of half a Diagonal Square on the Base from the Perpendiculars <hi>a c</hi> and <hi>b d</hi> inwards, as <hi>g b,</hi> which must be prolonged to the hind end of the Form; and where these Visual lines cut the Parallels shall be the outward bounds of the four Feet in the Ground-plain, which must be erected perpendicularly into the Seat. The fore and hind Rails of this Frame are Parallels, and the side Rails are Visual lines.</p>
               <p>The Table on the left hand is placed with its corners against the Ey, and stands in length upon ten Diagonal Squares, and in bredth upon six; of which the Leaf of the Table projects over its Frame one Square on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:105730:31"/>
each side and end: The side lines for the Rails and the Leaf are drawn from the point of Distance <hi>a</hi> on the right hand, and the end lines for the Rails and Leaf from the point of Distance <hi>a</hi> on the left hand; and the Posts of the Frame stand each upon one Square, and are all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars erected into the Leaf: So that here remains nothing of difficulty in this Figure, unless it be the projecting of the Leaf over the Frame, which thought it be performed after the same manner of that on the Form, yet because the Table stands not in the same Sight the Form does, I shall explain this also.</p>
               <p>The Leaf of this Table hangs perpendicularly over ten Squares one way, and six another, in the Ground-plain; and this Square projects over the Frame one Square on each side, as hath been said: Therefore find the lines in the Ground-plain that include the ten Squares, viz. <hi>b 6</hi> and <hi>10 c,</hi> and by taking away one row of Squares on every side the Ground-plain, you will have eight left one way and four another, which is the bounds and gives the sides and angles the Frame stands on. So that you see thought this projecture seem difficult it is easily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed on the Ground-plain.</p>
               <p>If you would place any thing on the Table at a Designed Distance from either side and end on the Table (as below, which is the same with this, only that is shadowed, that the lineaments may appear the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:) For instance upon the edge of the hithermost side of the Table within six inches of the hither end, you would place the Candlestick; Then imagine the Table to be four foot long, and three foot broad, so shall each Square on the Ground-plain of the Table represent six inches. Therefore count to the end of the first Square as to the point 1, and there erect a Perpendicular, and where that Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar cuts the edge of the Table shall be the place of the Candlestick. Again, If you would place the hither edge of the Bottom of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker within two foot three inches of the hither end of the Table, and within one foot of the hither edge of the side of the Table, then count in the row of figures that runs up on the right hand 1 2 3 4 and half one more in the Gound-plain which is two foot three inches, and from that point erect a Perpendicular into the Leaf of the Table, then count in the line of figures that runs down on the left hand from the point 6 to 4 which is one foot and erect a Perpendicular from that point up to the edge of the Table and draw a Diagonal from that point and the point <hi>a</hi> on the right hand, and where that intersects the Perpendicular erected on the point of 4½ shall be the point where the middle of the hither edge of the Beker shall stand. If you would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compass that point in the ends of the Legs of the Table which appear through the Leaf, you may work as follows in this next example.</p>
               <p>Count from the point <hi>b</hi> to the point 1, which is one Square of the Ground-plain, and the point where one Angle of the Leg is placed, and from that point 1 erect a Perpendicular into the side of the Leaf of, the Table, as at 1, and from the line <hi>a</hi> on the left hand draw a line to, that point for the bounds of the force side of the two fore Legs: Then because the Legs are one Square, viz six inches every way, erect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:105730:32"/>
Perpendicular on the point 2 to the point 2 on the edge of the Leaf, and to that point draw another line from the point <hi>a</hi> on the left hand, and that line shall bound the hind side of the fore Legs; Then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Perpendiculars from the angles of the Legs; And to the points where these Perpendiculars cut the former lines draw other lines from the point <hi>a</hi> on the right hand; and the lines drawn from the points <hi>aa</hi> on either hand shall bound the top of the Legs: As you may see in the Figure. Do the like when you describe the hind Legs.</p>

               <p>THis Press is placed on a Ground-plain of Diagonal Squares, made as by Operat. XVI. with its angles towards the Base. Its undermost Planck contains eleven Squares in length and nine in bredth, and projects over its Frame on every side one Square: so that the Frame stands upon nine Squares in length and seven in bredth, and in thickness one Square. These Legs are to be erected perpendicularly up into the under Planck of the Press, as the Legs of the fore-going Table were into the Leaf: And this Planck is also made as the Leaf in the fore-going Table.

               <p>THis Frame stands with its angles against the Base upon seven Squares one way, and six the other. It is Railed round the bottom, and hath one Shelf below the Horizon and two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove it. The manner of making it hath sufficiently been taught in the foregoing <hi>Operat.</hi> viz. The Posts are Perpendiculars e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected on the Ground-plain; and the Rails, Shelves, &amp;c. are all drawn from the points of Distance <hi>a a</hi> on the right and left hand.

The Chair contains in the bottom four Squares each way, as you may see in the Ground-plain. The making the Chair hath already been taught in <hi>Operat.</hi> XXXV. Only the sight of this Chair is changed, for the Legs are placed against the Base. For finding the middle of the Back of the Chair, in order to making the peak in the upper Rail behind, draw from the points <hi>b c</hi> and <hi>d e</hi> two lines, and where they cross each other, draw a Perpendicular through the whole Back of the Chair, and that Perpendicular shall be the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Back posts of the Chair, to which point you must draw up the Peak.</p>
               <p>On the left hand you have the Frame of a Door described standing on four Squares in the Ground-plain. The thickness of the Frame is one of those Squares: It is easie to be understood by the Figure alone.</p>
               <p>Above the Frame of the Door you have a four-square Hole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, with one of its Angles downwards, which is two Squares high and two Squares broad: Therefore from the point 2 in the Ground-plain erect a Perpendicular, and on that Perpendicular designe what height the lower Angle of the Hole shall stand at above the Door, as here at <hi>f,</hi> then draw a Visual line through the point <hi>f</hi> into the said line of the Figure as to <hi>g,</hi> and from the point <hi>g</hi> set off four devisions of the Base upwards, as 1 2 3 4, and draw another Visual line through the Perpendicular into the point 4, and where the Visual line cuts the Perpendicular, as here at <hi>b,</hi> shall be the upper Angle of the Square Hole; Then erect two Perpendiculars one from the point <hi>o,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the point 4 in the Ground-plain, and where these Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars cut the Visual line <hi>i</hi> 2, as here in the points <hi>k l,</hi> shall be the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two opposite Angular points of the square Hole; and straight lines drawn from <hi>f</hi> to <hi>l,</hi> from <hi>l</hi> to <hi>h,</hi> from <hi>h</hi> to <hi>k,</hi> and from <hi>k</hi> to <hi>f,</hi> shall include the fore-side of this square Hole.

               <p>SHadows are made by the position of Opacous Bodies before Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous Bodies, which Opacous Bodies stop and hinder those Lines of Light which else would pass from the Body of Light to the Plain whereon the Oparous Body stands.</p>
               <p>By Lines of Light, I mean those straight lines that pass from the Body of Light to the Plain. Thus the line <hi>a b</hi> is a Line of Light.</p>
               <p>These Lines of Light, the Plam or Line of Saddows, and a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular let fall from the Body of Light makes alwaies a Triangle, as is the Triangle <hi>a b c,</hi> where <hi>a b</hi> represents the Line of Light <hi>c b</hi> the Plain or Ground-line of Shadows, and <hi>a c</hi> the Perpendicular.</p>
               <p>If in this Triangle any Opacous Body be placed so as to break the lines of Light, that opacous causes a Shadow: Thus the Staf <hi>d e</hi> erected perpendicularly at <hi>d</hi> breaks all the lines of Light inclosed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>d e b,</hi> and makes the Shadow <hi>d b:</hi> by which instance alone you may see the manner and properties of Lines of Light; and how a straight line drawn from the line of Shadows through the point the Opacous body stands on, and a line of Light drawn from the body of Light through the top-point of that opacous body shall cut each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the point of termination of Shadow. By this proposed Staf I would have you understand a Line, though in this place it would be unproper to call it so, because that having no Geometrick bredth makes no shadow. But as was said in the third Operation, where a Line was laid down in Perspective, knowing how to draw a Line in Perspective you know how to draw all Figures, because they are bounded by Lines; so I may say in Shadows, for though the Object be a Body, yet the Shadow is but a Figure, and by knowing how to draw the Shadow of every Line properly you know how to draw the whole figure of Shadow.

Then if you make a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection whose Reflection on a Cilinder shall shew the same shape and number of Squares: It follows by consequence that if you transfer all the Lineaments in the Figure, A to this Projection, and place every Lineament in its proper scituation so as to correspond with the same space from the top and sides of this Plain, every one of these Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Projection shall also appear in the Cilinder in the same shape and scituation they do in the Square Plain.</p>
               <p>Therefore to make this Projection, descibe on the Center <hi>a</hi> the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle <hi>b 4 cd,</hi> of the same Diameter you intend the Cilinder shall be, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose about an Inch and an half; devide the Semidiameter of this Circle into 4 equal parts, as 1 2 3 4, then on the devision at 3 place one foot of your Compasses and extend the other to what width you intend your outmost Circle should be, as hereto <hi>e,</hi> and describe the Circle <hi>f e g:</hi> Then devide one of those parts of the square Plain into 20 equal parts or sub-devisions, and make the first devision frome <hi>e,</hi> 6 of those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts or sub-devisions bigger than one Square, which you must set off on the Diametral line from <hi>e</hi> towards <hi>a</hi>: the second from <hi>e,</hi> 5 of those sub-devisions bigger than a Square which also set off from <hi>e</hi> towards <hi>a,</hi> the third 4, the fourth 3, the fifth 2, the sixth 1, and the seventh equal: the eighth 1 sub-devision less than a Square, the ninth 2 less, the tenth 3, the eleventh 4, the twelfth 5 sub-devisions less than a Square, which successively set off from <hi>e</hi> towards <hi>a:</hi> then on the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:105730:37"/>
Center at 3 (aforesaid) place one foot of your Compasses and extend the other successively to each of the devisions set off on the Diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral line, and through every one of those divisions describe so much of a Circle as the Plain will bear, so shall all these arches of Circles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present those straight lines in the Plain square A that run athwart the Plain from the left hand to the right, and reflected on the Cilinder they shall become straight lines parallel to each other.</p>
               <p>To represent in this Projection the Perpendiculars on the Plain square, you may on the Center <hi>a</hi> describe an occult Circles as large as you can within the Projection, as the Circle <hi>h i k l,</hi> devide half of this Circle as <hi>k g h</hi> into 8 equal parts, and through every one of these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual parts draw lines from the Center <hi>a</hi> into the Circumference of the Projection, and these lines shall represent 8 Perpendiculars on the Plain square. To draw the other 4 transfer the distance of one of the devisions in the Circle <hi>h i k l</hi> twice from <hi>l</hi> towards <hi>k,</hi> and twice from <hi>i</hi> towards <hi>k,</hi> and draw straight lines (as before) through these di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances into the Circumference of the Projection: so shall the whole Projection be finisht.</p>
               <p>Note that in this Projection the whole Circle is not devided into 12 equal parts, but only three quarters thereof, because the Cilinder will not well gather in more raies, for the other quarter lies hid behind the Cilinder.</p>

                  <head>Of Dioptricks or Broken Beams.</head>
                  <p>THe Broken beam is to be seen in a Tube, through a Christal or Glass that hath its surface cut into many Faces: as is the Fig. <hi>A:</hi> for every one of these Faces making Angles with the Base or Flat side of the Christal shew an Object each as through its own Face and not through the Flat of the Christal: And so is said to break the Raies of an Object: because to the Flat of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stal the Raies run straight, but afterwards they break into the same Angle the Face on the other side of the Flat makes with the Flat.</p>
                  <p>Thus it comes to pass that when these Faces on the Christal are turned towards a Plain placed directly before it, these Faces of the Christal dis-sever themselves at a considerable distance on the Plain, because they are all directed to several remote parts of that Plain.</p>
                  <p>Now though there hath not as yet been any Geometrick Rule found for the assigning a place on the Plain of each of these Faces, yet is there found how they may be placed on a Plain; as you shall learn by the next <hi>Operation.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>How among a great many Pictures on the Plain, to see one elected and peculiar Picture quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any on the Plain.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving fixed your Plain fast, and also fixed your Tube fast di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly before the Plain, look through the little Hole at the hither end of the Tube, and with a point or black-lead pencil mark where the several Angles of each and every Face of the Christal falls upon the Plain; so may you with your black-lead pencil draw a line by the side of a Ruler from point to point of each Face thus found on your Plain. But you must remember to mark each Face on your Plain with numerical figures or some other mark, so as you may know to what Face of your Christal each belongs: for you will find them all reverted; that is those seen through the top-faces of your Christal will be in the bottom of your Plain: and those seen through the right hand Faces of your Christal will be on the left hand on your Plain.</p>
               <p>Having thus prepared your Plain, you must draw the figure of your Christal (on a plain paper) exactly of the size of your Christal, and devide it into so many parts your Christal is devided and cut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Faces; and mark each devision thereon in a reverted order from that on your Plain: As if the bottom Face on your Plain be marked 1, then mark the top. Face in your paper 1; And if 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. be marked towards the right hand on your Plain mark them towards your left hand on your paper; as you see in the Figure. On this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per therefore you must draw the Picture you intend shall be seen on the Plain: Suppose the Picture of King <hi>Charles</hi> the first: and having drawn it, transfer all the lineaments and stroaks you find in each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective Face on the paper to the responding Face on the Plain. As for example: What lineaments you find in the Face marked 1 on the paper, transfer to the Face marked 1 on the Plain: what lineaments you find in the Face marked 2 on the paper, transfer to the Face marked 2 on the Plain. And so for all the rest.</p>
               <p>Then looking again through your Tube, you will see all the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Faces on the Plain unite, each Face contributing the lineaments drawn in it to form your intended Picture of.</p>
               <p>If you have a mind further to amuse Spectators, you may to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of the Faces on the Plain draw another Picture: as in the Face marked 10 on the Plain you find an Ey, to this Ey make up an whole Figure; To the Face marked 12 you find the Mouth, to this make up another whole Figure &amp;c. But you may alter the likeness as much as you list, both in countenance and dress: So will the conceit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear yet so much the stranger. I have inserted one Example, where about the Face 1 on the Plain, I have set the Picture of a Woman.</p>
