         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Palatine of the Rhyne, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>MOST ILLVSTRIOVS PRINCE,</hi>
The great respect I receiued from your Highnes at
<hi>Leyden</hi> two severall times after my comming out of
<hi>Barbarie,</hi> and the great desire your Highnes expressed (as be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cometh Princes) to vnderstand, and be informed in foraigne
afaires, and the State of other countries, hath encouraged me
(hauing novv againe been imployed into that countrie) to
present to your Highnes, for a <hi>Nevv-years-gift,</hi> this short
relation, of the life, &amp; death of the late King <hi>Muley Abdala
Melek,</hi> as vvas related to me by vvaie of discourse onlie, at
seuerall times, by those vvho for the most part vvere eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvitnesses:
<hi>Oculati testes.</hi> VVhich also may serue your Highnes
for matter of discourse, and further information likewise, to
discerne betwixt a blessed Christian gouernment, vvhereunto
God hath ordained you, and a cruell tyrannous <hi>Mahometan</hi>
gouernment (as is the <hi>Turkish,</hi>) vnder vvhich those miserable
mis-belieuers: yea and manie Christians likevvise there in
most miserable slauerie, groane: the Lord deliuer them
from it. And giue vs grace to make vse of it: both Prince.
<pb facs="tcp:17114:3"/>
people, and acknovvledge our owne happines. Prince, vvho
commaund ouer Christian, obedient, and dutifull subiects:
and subiects vvho liue vnder so peaceable, and Christian a
gouernement, <hi>bona si sua norit agricola,</hi> free from tyrannie,
<hi>rebuel: as,</hi> and tumults, vvhereunto that countrie of <hi>Barbaric</hi>
hath this long time been subiect. Such is the miserable state,
and condition of tyrannie, and of tyrants, euen of Kings: as your
Highnes may perceiue, by the sodaine, fearefull, and miserable
end of this King: <hi>qualis vita sinis ita:</hi> his life vvas bloodie, and
so it ended in blood, in his owne blood. And thereafter may
your Highnes, and all other yong Princes, vvho haue so good
tuitors, and ouerseërs to informe them learne: (as that famous
<hi>Buchanan</hi> tuitor to your grand Father <hi>King Iames</hi> of blessed
memorie, in his epistle dedicatorie before his Tragaedie called
<hi>Baptistes,</hi> admonisheth, vvorthie to be read ouer, and ouer,
and remembred of all yong Princes, his vvords, as I remember,
are these) <hi>maturé odisse quod tibi semper est fugiendum.</hi>
VVhich I pray God both your Highnes, and all other Princes
may remember, and make vse of. Hoping your Highnes vvill
accept of this small present out of a <hi>Barbarous</hi> countrie, for
vvant of a better. vvhither I should haue returned, for the
releasse of the remainder of my poore countrymen, in captiuitie
vnder the new King <hi>Muley Elvvalid,</hi> vpon a new treatie.
Hauing alreadie been a means to releasse aboue two hundreth

againe vpon a late breach: besides vvhat are dispersed vp and
dovvne the countrie: all promised by that King to be releassed
vpon his treatie. VVhither (I say) I should haue returned
long before this time, longed, and long looked for by those poore
captiues.<note place="margin">Isa. 51. 14</note>

               <hi>and all those that haue
caried them avvaie captiues, to pitie them:</hi> othervvise no hope
at all. And so I leaue them to Gods mercie: and both them, &amp;
all others in like distresse, both there, and elsvvhere, to your
Highnes, and all other Christian princes to commiscrate, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to a proposition, or petition, I haue hereunto annexed,

in Gods hands: <hi>For the hearts of Kings</hi> (as Salomon saith) <hi>are in</hi>
Gods hands, he turneth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvhich vvaiesoeuer he pleaseth.
In the meane time (as my dutie is, hauing been imployed in
these affaires) <hi>I</hi> can but sollicit, and petition, though vvithout
effect, <hi>in hope contrarie to hope:</hi> hauing hitherto receiued
so small encouragement: but discouragements: and so <hi>goe on
mourning</hi> still, and like to doe: <hi>finis vnius mali gradus futuri.</hi>

AND DEATH OF
MVLEY ABDALA MELEK,
the late King of Barbarie.</head>
            <p>IF <hi>Plutarch</hi> (vvho did vvrite, and paralel the lives, and
acts of the most famous men of those times) vvere
novv living, to vvrite and paralel on the contrarie the
lives and acts of the most infamous men of the vvorld, I
think he vvould haue much adoe to finde out a fit match,
either auncient or moderne, vvherevnto to paralel the
late King of <hi>Barbarie Muley Abdala Melek:</hi> yea rather I
thinke he vvould leave him vnparalel'd. And so must I,
only setting dovvne so much as in that short time I staid
at <hi>Morocco</hi> (vvhich vvas but tvvo monthes) hath been rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me by vvay of discourse, by such both of our ovvne
nation and others as vvere for the most part eye-vvitnesses,
vvhich is scarce the hundreth part of his cruel acts, and
mad-pranks he plaid in that short time of his raigne:
vvhich vvas scarce foure yeares, mad-pranks I may call
them, for so is he commonlie called the mad King.</p>
            <p>He vvas Son to <hi>Mulay Sidan</hi> by a <hi>negra,</hi> so by complexion

commonlie the eldest, though by a concubine, carieth the
crovvne: and sometimes the yonger getteth the blessing
from the elder: <hi>quo iure &amp;c. capiat qui capere potest.</hi>

strong drinke, vvhich added to his naturall disposition:
(vvhich needed not) inclyned to crueltie euen from his
infancie. Of a manlie stature: and of a most couragious
disposition. A good horseman, vvith his launce &amp; target;
vvould euer be the first man in the face of his enemies:
vvho indeed durst neuer look him in the face, but presently
faces about: his svvord making vvaie for him vvhich waie

I vvil be bold to saie (as before) not to be paraleld by any.
As by these fevv passages, gessing at <hi>Hercules</hi> by his foote,

            <p>An other time a <hi>Levantado</hi> or rebell (one of their saints)
comming against his Father <hi>Muley Sidan</hi> vvith 3000. horse,
like to surprize him on a sodaine, he vvith his drums, musik
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17114:5"/>
and ensignes, and not aboue fortie horse, vvent out against
him, chardged so furiously, as put them, al to flight: pursued
the victory, &amp; (as they say) vvith his ovvne hand vvounded
the <hi>Levantado</hi> that he dyed, his head after brought in, to
<hi>Muley Sidan,</hi> hanged vp in the <hi>Alcasaua,</hi> and quarters like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
on the vvals of <hi>Morocco,</hi> on the gates of the citie. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
be ore challenged his Father of neglect, and too much
securitie: of vvhom not only his enemies, but euen his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(as they say) stood in feare, yet his Father calling him
Father. Such is the praeposterous maner of the Moores, to
call their eldest Son Father, out of a reuerence (as they say)
they giue to him being the first born, &amp; to be (as it seemeth)
<hi>Pater familias,</hi> Father of the familie for the time to come,
other reason I can not giue of their praeposterous inversion
of that relation, (or rather confusion) for the Father, to call
his Son Father. Our Heauenly Father I am sure did not so,
the King of Kings: <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> &amp;c. as it is in the
Psalmes. Nor <hi>Dauid</hi> the King in that his patheticall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of his Fatherly affection, far beyond theirs, yea beyond
all expression: <hi>Absalon my Son, my Son.</hi> After his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to be King some of the frends of the <hi>Leuantado</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
by stealth taken dovvne his quarters to bury them, he
commanded a great number of the neighbours heads who
dvvelt neere there aboutes to be cut of, executing many
vvith his ovvne hands as he met them in the streets.</p>
            <p>And not long after immediatlie vpon the death of his
Father, being nevvlie proclaimed King, his brother <hi>Muley
Flvvallid</hi> (this King) comming against him vvith a great
force, better affected of the comminaltie than the other,
in respect of his crueltie: (vvhich they greatlie feared,
and not vvithout cause, as aftervvards they found)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17114:6"/>
               <hi>Muley Abdala Melek</hi> giuing order first for his ordnance, to
be dischardged, immediatlie after himself, being the first,
man (hauing but a fevv horse) chardged so furiouslie, and
so throughlie, as he rovvted them all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vvhervpon his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
fled tovvards <hi>Sallie,</hi> but not long after vvas betrayed
&amp; brought back againe by <hi>Alkaid Hamuda</hi> dvvelling neare
<hi>Azamore,</hi> vvhose <hi>horma</hi> or sanctuarie he tooke, invited and
encouraged by him to some further attempt: but indeed
betrayed, vvho after vsed him in a verie base &amp; vnseemlie
manner, stripping him, beating him, and carying him,
chained vpon a horse to the King. VVherevpon the King
(they say) vvhen he savv him relented, yea vvept, not
vsing any extremitie, but rather out of his lion-like mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie,
contemning vvhat either he, or any other had
don, or could doe against him. Yet did his brother liue in
continuall feare, diuers times threatned by the King in his
mad humor, sending to him to prepare himself, and to
knovve vvhat kinde of death he vvould dye: but by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation
of his sisters and others still put of. At one time
(the King being at <hi>Saffia</hi>) in his drunken humor, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
pronounced, and an <hi>Alkaid</hi> presentlie sent tovvards
<hi>Morocco,</hi> vvhere his brother was then prisonner to execute
it: but the next morning the King comme to himself, and
by mediation (as before) reversed, and a messenger dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
to countermaund the other, vvhom he ouertooke
but at <hi>Tansift</hi> a riuer vvithin foure myles of <hi>Morocco,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
vpon his life to ouertake him: the other making
no great hast, othervvise it had been executed.</p>
            <p>One time at <hi>Saffia</hi> his <hi>Almahalla</hi> or campe (vvherein
his brother <hi>Muley Semyn</hi> vvas then) comming to pitch
neare thereaboutes, he in steed of a vvarning piece to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17114:6"/>
remoue further of, shot a bullet amongst them. An other
time (as I heard) in iest among the market folke: yet did
no hurt but killed an asse.</p>
            <p>An other time in his <hi>Almahalla</hi> (hauing been all the
daie abroad drinking as he vsed) and coming riding in late
at night vpon the spur, as he passed by the ordnance,
vvhereof the English had the chardge, he commaunded on
the sodaine svvearing a great English oath, giue fire: vvhich
they presentlie did, they durst doe no othervvise: so shot
avvaie his ovvne vncle being in companie vvith him all
to peeces,</p>
            <p>His yongest brother, yea and his ovvne yong sonne,
sometimes vvould he hang vp by the legs, and beate them
vvith his ovvne hands. No merveile then if he vvere cruell
to others, being so vnnaturall to his owne flesh and blood.</p>
            <p>Euerie daie must see blood (blood shed) vvere it but of
a hen, els not satisfied. Possessed (as some of the Moores
haue told me manie are, &amp; that he vvas) vvith a she deuill,
frequent amongst them as (it seemeth) amongst the heathen
in times past, vvhereof a heathen philosopher writeth a
set treatise of <hi>Incubus</hi> and <hi>succubus.</hi> And the partie vvho
told me this said, that one daie going a hawking hauing
other Moores vvith him, one follovving a good distance
in the high vvaie, on a sodaine stood still, and not long after
they savv a smoake arise in the same place, vvhereat they
vvondered, &amp; vvent back, finding the man much amazed.
Asking the reason, he said a vvoman met him there verie
faire &amp; in good attyre, vvho offered herself to be his wife,
he ansvvered, he had one alreadie, she replyed he might
take an other (for so the Moores may by their lavv) being
verie importunate vvith him: at length looking dovvne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17114:7"/>
perceiued her clubbed feet, &amp; vvhat she vvas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he vvent back, and absolutly refused, and therevpon
she vanished in that maner in a great snuffe. The man
presently therevpon falling sick, and so continued a good
vvhile. Hovv true this is I can not say, but vvas reported
to me verie seriously, and for a certaintie. But of this I am
sure that the deuill can transforme himself into an Angel
of light: much more take vpon him the shape of a man,
or a vvoman, as God permitteth to delude those that obey
not the truth. And this likevvise I knovve to be true and
certaine, that he is both a lyer (the Father of lyes) and a
murderer from the beginning: euer a thirst, and neuer satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
vvith blood. And therefore no merveile if this tyrant
vvere so possessed as before, that euerie daie he must see
blood els not satisfied. And if euery day, hovv much blood
may be thought he shed in that time of his life &amp; raigne.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he vvould cut of mens heads vvith his
ovvne hands, and vvith his ovvne sharp svvord, saying,
those vvhom he commaunded did not cut them of vvell,
and at once: vvhich don vvould aske one of the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
if it vvere not vvell done, he must say yea <hi>Muley.</hi> Yea
six or seauen mens heads in one day.</p>
            <p>Once by euermuch drinking distempered in his bodie,
hauing his armes and hands benummed, his Doctor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>svvaded
him to enter into a bath. After his bathing mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
vvith one of his concubines, drevv out his svvord and
cut of her head, to trie the strength of his arme if it vvere
sound againe. Also an other for going out of her bite or
chamber to the next doore to one of her fellovves, for the
Moores are iealous euen of their vvomen, and vvill not
suffer them to companie together.</p>
            <p>Made one man stand still vvhile he threvv stones at his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17114:7"/>
face, threatning if he offered to stir or moue he vvould cut
of his head. So likevvise abroad in the fields, ofttimes
vvould cause some one of his seruants to lie dovvne gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
&amp; sit vpon him in steed of a stoole a vvhole night
together drinking: and the man durst not for his life stir.
And some to stand by him vvhole daies and nights vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
moouing hand or foote, othervvise vvould haue cut of
their heads.</p>
            <p>VVould cause men to be drubbed, or beaten almost to
death in his presence, vvhich vvas but a common &amp; gentle
correction, fiue or six hundreth blovves at once, and after
they must kisse the ground, &amp; giue him thanks. To whom
in this particular, &amp; others likevvise, I may paralel a great
Lord in this part of the vvorld: vvho (hauing slaine an other
in a privat duell, and, vpon iust occasion offered, taxed by
one to vvhom he had don vvrong, disgracing, &amp; disabling
him, and that in an open assemblie, &amp; displacing him too:
and therefore had the partie reason there also to right him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and reply, <hi>par pari referre,</hi> and disable him likevvise for
shedding of blood, vvhich by the Lavv of God is murder)
caused the partie to be committed to prison (closse prisoner
at the first) and there kept, and <hi>fed vvith the bread of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
till in the end he vvas forced: (his imprisonment, and
punishment both of bodie and purse, besides the disgrace,
no sufficient satisfaction) to kisse the ground, that is, make
an humble submission, and subscribe that he had offended,
and abused his Lordship vvith opprobrious, and vnciuill
language &amp;c. that is to say, that the Lavv of God is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious
&amp; vnciuill language, vvhich saith: <hi>He that smiteth
an other vvith an instrument of yron, that he dy is a murderer
&amp;c.</hi> vvhich submission he novv vtterly disclaimeth, as most
blasphaemous against God &amp; his Lavv, &amp; don of infirmity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17114:8"/>
and <hi>by dares of imprisonment,</hi> hauing no meanes at all to
maintaine himself any longer in prison, but there to starve:
praying God to forgiue him, and them likevvise vvho im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
it. To vvhom (euen to that great God) that great
Lord ought rather to make submission, for violating his
holie Lavv, as <hi>David</hi> did, (a King and vvas not ashamed.)
I haue sinned &amp;c. yea and after fell to the ground, and
kissed the ground vvith manie teares. Therefore is he a
saint in heauen: and <hi>Muley Abdala Melek,</hi> and all such
bloodie tyrants, &amp; murderers (vvithout repentance) deuills
in hell. For <hi>Topheth is praepared of old euen for Kings,</hi> and
Lords too if they repent not: For vvith God there is no
respect of persons. Nor vvas vvith this King <hi>Muley
Abdala Melek,</hi> in the cruell course of his tyrannie: vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
all, both great and small, vvere subject.</p>
            <p>Yea he vvould, cause some to be beaten on the soles of
their feet, and after make them run vp, and dovvne among
the stones, and thornes. And so also vsed some that vvere
lame, &amp; hurt, pulling of there shooes, &amp; making them run
barefooted in such places: or els vvould cut of their heads.</p>
            <p>Did cause one of his Alkaids (his chieffe falconer) to
be drubbed and beaten, manie hundreth blovves on the
buttocks (as himself told me) and after forced him to
ride in that painfull maner after him a havvking. Also
the same Alkaid told me, that the girth of his sadle being
broken, and he allighted: an other Alkaid comming to
help him, and holding his stirrop, the King called that
Alkaid to him, and caused him to be drubbed for holding
his stirrop, and not long after the like occasion falling out
againe, caused the same Alkaid to be drubbed againe, for
not holding his stirrop.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:17114:8"/>
He run a mans thigh thorovv vvith his launce to the
saddle, and after because he vvas not able to ride after him a
pace, giue him tvvo or three hundreth blovves.</p>
            <p>VVould vvith his sword cut and flash men for his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
and after himself giue them plaisters to cure them.</p>
            <p>VVould cast men to the lions to be devoured, an other
of his torments.</p>
            <p>To one among the rest he promised that if he vvould
fight vvith them, and could escape he should be perdoned:
vvhich he did manfullie (as I vvas told) beating them from
him either vvith stones or som such meanes clearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
yet af<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er vvas put to death</p>
            <p>Some he caused to be rastrar'd, or dragged by the feete
at the horse heeles, their back and head against the stones:
as he did the <hi>Hacam</hi> of <hi>Morocco</hi> (the chieffe officer of that
citie) round about his Almahalla or camp till he died.
Others iointed, their fingers, and toes first cut of by euerie
jointe, armes and legs, &amp; so head and all. An other hanged
vp by the priuie members, one caused to sit vpon him to
vveigh him dovvne: and vet the man liuing.</p>
            <p>Another (a hole digged in the ground) set in the earth
vp to the head, as Schollers in some places use to shoote
at the cock at Shrouetyde: so did he cause the captiues vvith
their peeces to shoote at this poore mans head. They all
missing, he himself came neere vvith his ovvne peece and
shot him, calling him a deuill because they all missed him.</p>
            <p>He cut of a Moores head (a church man, or Sexton) for
crying on the church tovver or steeple, and cursing all that
did drinke vvine, forbidden by their lavve. An other also
for crying and singing more then vsuall. For the Moores
haue noe bels, but in steed thereof, these cryers to call them
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:17114:9"/>
to their devotions: in the name of God, one God, the
great God, and his Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> the Messenger of
God. Some say this mad King did once threaten that he
vvould haue one of the Friars, French or Spanish, to sing
masse before him: vvhich I thinke vvould haue pleased
him little better.</p>
            <p>He caused a French captiue to turne Moore, and be cut,
that is made an eunuch, onlie for extolling the King of
France to be one of the greatest Monarches of the vvorld.
An other, vvho kept his horse, neuer vvithout slashes and
vvounds. An other Frenchmans doublet vvith a paire of
sizers did he cut all ouer in slashes vvith his ovvne hands,
saying, he vvas novv a right French Cavallero, like to the
rest.</p>
            <p>If in his drunken humor abroad in the fields (as he vvas
seldome sober) he did fall from his horse, all his Alkaid<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
and seruants must doe the like, and lie dovvne, and doe as
he did. Much like the catching of the dotterill: and not
offer to rise or get on horseback till he did, nor to hold his
stirrop, or come neare him all the vvhile, if they did he
vvould giue them blovves. One of his Alkaids, for some
such like offence, caused he to sit 24. houres on he top of
his tent in the Almahalla (as it vvere on the pillorie) for
all men to gaze vpon. And novv and then vvould he giue
them a pill called <hi>Shishai</hi> (the effect vvhereof is to make
men merie drunke) to make himself sport. But indeed his
onlie sport vvas in cutting of mens heads, and (as before)
in shedding, and seeing of blood. No one day escaped but
one or other sacrificed in most bloodie manner to this
vnsatiable deuill: and she deuill together, if that opinion
of the Moores be true, as before.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:17114:9"/>
On a time the Christian captiues, at <hi>Saffia</hi> the port town,
had laid a plot to breake the prison, and escape by sea in a
boate, but in the acting thereof vvere discouered, all taken
and beaten in most pitifull maner to make them confesse
the Authors, most of them Spaniards, and French: the
chieffe plotter a Spaniard (as it seemeth) of some account,
called <hi>Don Pedro,</hi> vvho vvas sent for to the King (then in
his Almahalla) vvho therevpon called all the English, and
others to kneele before him, setting the Spaniard also right
before him. Then said to the English, youe see this mis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
that vvould haue run avvaie, if any of youe be like
minded, run sure, and cleare avvaie: othervvise, if youe be
taken see here your doome. Then caused he first the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
eares to be cut of one after an other: then his nose:
then his lippes one after an other: then his mouth, on both
sides slit vp to the eares: then his fingers disiointed one
from an other: vvhich don the King fell a laughing, ha,
ha, ha. Then said the Spaniard to him (hauing all this while
looked him in the face &amp; indured it verie manfullie) novv
Tyrant doe thy vvorst. vvherevpon presentlie he cut of his
head. So dyed this valiant champion, euen in death
triumphing ouer his tyrannicall tormentors.</p>
            <p>An other time a Moore being brought before him for
some misdemeanor fearing death, said vnto him: <hi>Muley,</hi>
I haue liued all the daies of my life hitherto a Christian,
if thou vvilt novv pardon me, I vvill turne true Moore
againe. His meaning vvas that he had liued a vvicked, and
levvd life, as many Christians haue don, and doe, both
in that and other countries, I speake it to their shame,
vvhereby the name of Christ, &amp; his religion is scandalized,
and blasphaemed: but yet, notvvithstanding that his
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:17114:10"/>
confession, that he had liued a Christian, and profession
to turne Moore againe, (that is to say,) to lead a godly life,
vvas executed. For vvith this King there vvas no respect
of persons, or religions, or occasions great or small. Sins
veniall, or mortall all one, that is to say mortall, Occasions?
nay oft times vvithout any occasion at all but onlie as he
met vvith any by accident, in his drunken and deuilish
humor, vvould try (as before vpon his ovvne vvomen) the
strength of his arme, and goodnes of his svvord and chieff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
vpon his ovvne nation vvithout respect of persons: he
had no minions, or favorits at all: one good propertie in
him. VVhat shall I say. But (as an Alkaid telling me of
these and other his mad and tragicall acts exclaimed) a
deuill, a deuill. His Alcasava, or court the verie picture of
hell: vvhich made the greater and better forte to flee away
into the mountaines, or stand vpon their guard a far of:
like those <hi>vvylie foxes in AEsop seeing all foote steps going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard
into the lions den, but fevv or none retrorsum, back
againe.</hi> And those that did, hovvling, and crying, vveeping,
and vvayling sighing, and vvringing their hands, either
for themselues, or their friends. This vvas the dailie, and
dolefull musick both vvithin and vvithout: the verie gates
of hell. Friends? nay rather fiends, daylie tormenting one
an other. For so vvould he commaund his Alkaids, and
servants to drub one an other at his pleasure, &amp; cut of one
an others heads too.</p>
            <p>He vvould commonlie say in a iesting maner, that it
seemed to him whensoeuer he executed any of the Moores,
that they had tvvo or three heads: meaning to cut of but
one, he left none: vvishing (as it seemeth) like that Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
tyrant, that all the Romanes had but one neck, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17114:10"/>
vvould cut them all of at once: So <hi>Muley Abdala Melek,</hi> the
Moores, of vvhom he vvas <hi>Flagellum,</hi> the onlie vvhip that
euer vvas. And (as some thinke) the best King for the
Moores that euer vvas: requiring not a blocke, but <hi>AEsops
storke</hi> to keepe them in subiection, they othervvise prone
to rebellion, affecting alteration, and innovation: as their
refran or proverb is:<note place="margin">Cus-cus a dish of meat in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest with them.</note> 
               <hi>Everie day a new cus-cus, euerie day a
nevv vvife, and euerie day a nevv King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And though he vvas thus cruell and tyrannous to the
Moores, and others, yet did he favour much and respect the
English, to vvit the captiues, both before and after he vvas
King. Making one of them once to ride behinde him, but
vvithall bidding him not sit too closse to him for filling
him full of lyce. Threatning sometimes, but yet neuer
giuing any of them so much as a blovve. VVho in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
time were kept in chaines both by the neck and legs,
but he comming to be king releassed them, and made
them, his gunners, giuing them free leaue to goe vp and
dovvne vvhere they vvould at their pleasure, and doe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
vvhat they vvould: and not a Moore that durst con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll
them, but rather stood in avve of them. Though their
allovvance but short, yet, hauing that libertie, they made
the better shift. And somtimes the king himself in a good
humor vvould giue them money: yea, and sometimes in
his mad humor. Yet did he cause some English boyes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
to turne Moores, cutting them, and making them
capadoes, or eunuches: but aftervvards (as they say) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented,
saying: he vvould neuer more force Englishmen
to turne Moores, for he found them better seruants to
him being christians, then Moores: for that being chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
they vvould stand by him, and stay vvith him: but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17114:11"/>
being Moores run avvaie from him, hauing more libertie
and opportunitie.</p>
            <p>And as he vvas (as I may say contrarie to his nature)
thus favourable to the captiues, so vvas he likevvise to the
Merchants, or others that came as hoare. He being at <hi>Saffia</hi>
one time standing vpon the vvals, an English boate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
as hoare, he called to one of the men to come to him:
vvho, not knovving him to be the king, al the while stood
talking vnto him vvith his hatt on his head in Spanish,
after the King going into the castle, called one of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
captiues to him, asking him if his countriemen had
no better maners? bidding him gofetch the partie to him,
vvho being come, the King vvould say nothing to him, but
only made him to attend there a good time, and caused the
English captiue vvhom he loued vvell, to be committed
to prison in the others steed, and chaines to be put on him.
But the next day sent for him, causing his svvord to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to him, and so, in a mad humor, made him, both
vvith his svvord about his side, and chaines about his legs,
to vvalke after him round about the vvals, talking, and
iesting vvith him familiarlie as he vvas vvont: and then
after this chaines also vvere taken from him. This onlie he
did in iest, to teach Englishmen good maners against an
other time. But to the Moores his iests vvere in good
earnest, a vvord and a blovve.</p>
            <p>At the same place at <hi>Saffia,</hi> he vvould take the vvomen,
a vvashing at the sea side vpon the sands, set them vpon
their heads, &amp; cause vvater to be powred (vvith reverence
be it spoken) into their vnseemly parts, to see if it vvould
come out at the mouth againe.</p>
            <p>He mustered all the faire vvomen in <hi>Morocco:</hi> (vvhereof
it seemeth he had a Catalogue) causing them all at once, &amp;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:17114:11"/>
on a sodaine to come forth into his great garden, called
<hi>Monsarat:</hi> (being a mile in length, planted vvith Orange,
and lemmon trees, and all kinde of fruits) and there pitch
their tents for 14. daies together: praetending a pilgrimage
vvith his vvomen to <hi>Gometta,</hi> tovvards the hils of <hi>Atlas,</hi>
no man to come neare them (no not their husbands) but
only their negras, &amp; seruing maids: himself onlie vvalking
the round, all these vvomen dailie and nightlie sitting, and
attending in their tent doores as he passed by to vievv
them: modestie m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y not repeat the rest. At <hi>Gometta</hi>
there is the monument of <hi>Siddie Blabbas</hi> one of their great
saints, and there a great stonne, vpon vvhich the Moores
vse to rub their bellies, saying it cureth the chollicke and
diuers other diseases. Som Christians say this <hi>Siddie Blabbas</hi>
vvas <hi>saint Augustine,</hi> and that vpon this ston he preached:
both vvhich savour of superstition. But <hi>Muley Abdala
Melck</hi> had no such devotion, for he vvent not there at all,
nor those vvomen neither, almost famished and starved
vvith hunger, and cold: for no man durst come neare them
all that time to bring them any provision. This vvas one
of his tragicomicall parts.</p>
            <p>One of the Englishmen vvhom he loued aboue the rest,
vvho had the chardge of one of his chieffe horses, vvhich
vvas verie vnrulie, &amp; vvould bite any man that came neare
him, therfore alvvaies fast tyed vp: the king comming into
his <hi>rovva,</hi> or stable, &amp; spying some thing amisse about the
horse, vvould not strike the Englishman, but commanded
the horse to be let loose, &amp; the Englishman to stand fast by
him, suffering the horse to bite him at his pleasure, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the flesh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his armes: durst not stir till the king called to him.
An other time, the same Englishman complayning to him,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:17114:12"/>
that he had nothing to eate saue barlie, the King caused
the horse his <hi>Sabadera</hi> or bag in vvhich they vse to giue
them provander, to be hanged about the English mans
necke full of barlie: (as they doe vpon their horses heads)
and so made him eate the barlie like a horse. An other time
the King, hauing taken offence at some thing, threatned
to kill the Englishman, and that vvithout delay: an Alkaid,
vvilling to saue his life, offered the King I knovve not how
manie hundreth Duccats for him, to buy him of the King.
VVhy thou foole (said the King) doest thou thinke I
meane to kill him? No, I vvould not for so manie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Duccats: but to the Moores (as I said before) his iests,
and threats vvere in good earnest.</p>
            <p>One of his <hi>Negros</hi> vvhom he loued, and called brother,
hauing offended him, being in his <hi>Obadia,</hi> that statelie
pallace, vvalking in his garden, a little paradise, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
vvhereof are diuers pleasant tankes or ponds, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him to be cast into one of them, forbidding any to
come neare him to help him out againe: at length, hauing
vvalked a turne or tvvo, bade one goe pull him out: vvho
brought him vvord he vvas drovvned. VVhat my brother
drovvned, said he? Goe pull him out, and burie him: there
vvas all the mourning.</p>
            <p>An other he caused to eate his ovvne excrement: asking
hovv it relished. Yea he himself cut a peece of the brawne
of a mans arme vvhom he had killed, broyled it on the
coales,<note place="margin">Gago fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence al their gold cometh conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by his praedeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</note> and did eate it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King of Gagoes son,</hi> not ouer a day or tvvo before
the Kings death (some say the same day) drinking toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because he vvas not able to pledge him so much as he
drunk, being all <hi>aqua vitae</hi> (for so must euerie one doe as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:17114:12"/>
he did, and drinke as he did) caused the vvhole bole full of
<hi>aqua vitae</hi> to be giuen him backvvard like a glister, till it
reversed in their faces againe that gaue it. Hauing not long
before made him to stand tvvo daies, and tvvo nights in
the vvater. And before throvvne dovvne an other of the
sons from the vvals of <hi>Saffia,</hi> and broke his thigh.</p>
            <p>Vnder a colour of going a hawking, vvould lie vvhole
daies, and nights abroad in the fields a drinking: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his death manie daies, &amp; nights together. God hauing
bereaued him of his vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding as he did <hi>Nebuchadnezer,
and driuen him from men to dwell vvith the beasts of the field.</hi>
Yea he himself not long before, hauing driuen avvaie from
him all his most trustie servants, (saue one or tvvo) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to prison: And vvithall <hi>a vvatchfull dog</hi> vvhich he
loued, &amp; fed vvith his ovvne hand, for some small offence
he tooke, likevvise committed to prison vvith them: com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding
he should but haue so much bread, and vvater a
daie. All these his vvatchmen at once sequestred from him,
and the other so ouer toyled, &amp; vvearied vvith vvatching
day &amp; night: (perhaps also vvearie of him as vvere others:)
all seemed to conspire his death. Plotted (as it seemeth)
before by some of the <hi>Elchies,</hi> or <hi>renegadoes,</hi> vvhom the
King had threatned the next time he came to his house in
<hi>Morocco</hi> to cut, and make Eunuches, to the number of two
hundreth: vvhereof they vvere sore affraid. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one among the rest (a Frenchman as is reported)
vvatched his opportunitie vvhen the King came back to
his tent at night (hauing been all the day abroad a drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king)
and vvith a peece chardged vvith tvvo chained bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets,
shot him in by the fundament, and privie members
into the bodie, as he vvas lying along in his tent. A iust
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:17114:13"/>
iudgement of God, in respect of that glister of <hi>aqua vitae</hi>
he gaue to the <hi>King of Gagoes Son:</hi> &amp; threatning likevvise
the elchies as before.</p>
            <p>As also in respect of that abhominable impudent and
filthie act he did at <hi>Saffia</hi> to those poore vvomen. But
chiefly (vvhich God in the end vvill punish vpon those
<hi>Mahometans,</hi> both <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moores</hi>) in causing poore
Christians (boyes and others) to be circumcised perforce,
yea cut, and made eunuches. A iust iudgement of God
(I say) of all those Tyrants, both Turkes, Moores, and
others, to be trembled at: and so I leaue him.</p>
            <p>Immediatly after his death his younger brother <hi>Muley
Elvvallid</hi> vvas saluted King: being at that time a prisoner
in the <hi>Alcasaua,</hi> the Kings house in <hi>Morocco,</hi> expecting
dailie nothing els but death. VVherevpon some of his
frends (as at such a time, and in such a case all are frends, &amp;
happie he that can be the first; and svviftest Messenger)
running in all hast to the prison doore, and crying out
aloud to him to come forth: he thinking it had been to
execution, to be put to death: lingering, &amp; excusing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
that he vvould but take leaue of his vvife, and make
himself readie (vvhich he did only to die) they calling, and
crying more and more, at length he came forth, and so
vvas <hi>pregoned,</hi> and proclaimed King of a prisoner (I say)
on a sodaine become a King. Of a far more soft nature, &amp;
disposition than his brother: yet cruell and Tyrannous to
poore Christians, and to the English, vvhom of late he
hath most Barbarously entreated some of them. Eight at
once taken, and circumcised perforce: beaten, vvounded,
and one mans head almost cut of, to make them turne
Moores, and forsake their faith. The rest fearefull, dailie
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:17114:13"/>
expecting the like measure: as by letters latelie vvritten
from the Merchants there may appeare: vvhich I reserue,
vvith other passages, to a further account, leauing them to
his mercie, vvhich indeed is crueltie: <hi>For the mercies of the
vvicked are cruelties:</hi> and him and them to God to iudge
betwixt them, which in time might haue been preuented,
by a seasonable dispatch long since expected: the losse of
so manie poore Christian soules, as necessarie I dare say
as some other dispatches: if the bodies, and soules of
Christians be esteemed of any value novv a daies: as they
are in Gods sight right precious: <hi>precious in the sight of
the Lord is the death of his saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And novv vvill I addresse my selfe (vvith this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
and petition herevnto annexed) to Christian
Princes, to condole, and commiserate the distressed, or

more than miserable, creatures, if more may be: not only
the English, but all other nations, vvho this long time
haue indured a most miserable, and intollerable slauerie

            <p>MOST HIGH AND MIGHTIE PRINCES,
Hauing been heretofore diuers times imployed
into <hi>Barbarie,</hi> for the redeeming of poore Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
out of Slauerie, and other affaires: and hauing been
an eye-vvitnes of those great miseries, or rather indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
don to those poore Christians in those Countries by
that Barbarous people: indignities (I say) not to be vttered,
not to be expressed, but rather vailed ouer: as did that pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the sorovvfull, and mournefull, or rather more than
mournefull countenance of that heathen Prince for his
daughter, adiudged to be sacrificed to that heathen God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
or rather Idoll: by no painters pensill to be expressed.
More than mournefull (I say) <hi>maiora lachrymis:</hi> so manie
poore Christians dailie taken by those infidels, <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Moores,</hi> and caried captiues into those cruell lions dens, <hi>as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17114:14"/>
sheepe appointed for the slaughter:</hi> bought and sold in the
merket, as beasts, and not men: and devoured by those
blooddie monsters: vvhose <hi>soules lie vnder the Altar,</hi> daily
sacrificed to those heathen deuills, <hi>crying: Hovv long, o Lord
holie and true, doest thou not iudge, and auenge our blood on
them that dvvell on the earth?</hi> Yea beaten, and tormented
euen to death, to make them forsake their faith: as not only
men, but children also haue been forced, (and are daily)
taken perforce (I say) and circumcised, yea made <hi>Eunuches,</hi>
and so disabled at once, both from being men, and Christian
men, &amp; othervvise most shamefullie abused by those filthy
<hi>sodomites,</hi> not to be vttered. <hi>Quis Italia fando &amp;c. temperet
a lachrymis?</hi> Indignities (I say) <hi>maiora lachrymis,</hi> don, not
onlie to those poore Christians, but euen to Christ Iesus
himself, and his vvhole Church, and so to be apprehended,
vvithout any Nationall difference: vvhose members vve all
are, and ought to haue a fellovv-feeling of one an others
miseries, or els vve are no Christians at all, nor vvorthy
that name. I say, hauing been an eye-vvitnes of those great
miseries, and indignities don to the poore members of
Iesus Christ, (and consequently to himselfe:) as a poore
member of his bodie, I could not but be sensible thereof.
And present the bodies, and soules of those poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of Christ (like that <hi>Leuite</hi> in the booke of Iudges) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
cut in peeces, and quartered, to the eyes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise
of all the tribes of Israel: that is to say, the vvhole
church of Christ, both Prince and people, of vvhat nation
soeuer, all members of that his mysticall bodie, &amp; all alyke
interest therein: obliged, like the <hi>Israelites,</hi> to ioyne toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>as one man,</hi> to right, and revenge, euen vvith the
hazard of their liues, &amp; estates, these so great injuries, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17114:15"/>
indignities: <hi>consider of it, take aduice, and speake your mindes.
Open thy mouth for the dumme in the cause of all those that are
appointed to destruction.</hi> Those poore sheepe appointed for
the slaughter: the slaughter both of bodie, &amp; soule bought
vvith so deare a price, vvhose blood els vvill be required:
required (I say) at the hands of all those, to vvhom God
hath giuen power, &amp; meanes, (<hi>For to vvhom much is giuen
of him much shall be required</hi>) but vvant hearts, and mindes
to right, and redresse it: <hi>speak your mindes. Consider</hi> of it
(noble Princes and States) by your Embassadors one vvith
an other, both for the present hovv to relieue all those
poore soules that are in miserie, both vnder the <hi>Turks</hi> and
<hi>Moores:</hi> and hovv to prevent the miseries of others for the
time to come, like to be taken by their ships at sea more
and more, and made slaues, that is to say more than mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable:
if not preuented. VVhich a fevv good ships, (had
Christian Princes <hi>considered</hi> of it all this time, and been so
minded (that is to say of one minde <hi>hinc illae lachrymae</hi>)
might haue prevented: and may yet for the time to come.
To youe I speak (most noble Princes and States) that are
of one minde: <hi>consider of it take aduice, &amp; speak your minds.</hi>
And in youe to the whole church of Christ: let it be a <hi>free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvill
offering,</hi> both of Prince and people to Christ Iesus,
tovvards this so Christian, honourable, and charitable a
vvorke. A seacond redemption of his poore distressed
members, out of the hands of those infidels, verie easie to
be tamed, and subdued: &amp; vvith no great chardges to any,
out of a voluntarie contribution of manie. And (if I vvere
vvorthie to advise, and this my proposition, and petition to
take effect) this <hi>free vvill offering,</hi> or contribution, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited

great store of ships, and can most convenientlie manage
such affaires by sea: and are so noble, and so honourable,
as no doubt they vvould advance it to the vtmost. That so
this sacred seruice, being managed by one vndertaking
State, consisting of so manie vvise States-men, and prudent
Senators, may by Gods blessing receiue better successe, than
those expeditions in former times, frustrated by the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
