            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hereupon I found a double Care incumbent upon me, both to secure it from Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the Press, and procure its Recommendation to the World, by the Patronage of some Honourable Person, which the Author's Modesty has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd more needful.

            <head>The Author's PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE true design of a Preface (according to my Apprehension) being to explain the meaning of the Title, and to give the Reader a more copious Notion of the ensuing Treatise, with its Design, I must first tell you, why we call this, <hi>A Memorial for the Learn'd.</hi> A <hi>Memorial</hi> implies something that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us of what we have known before; but the Memory has almost lost it, or some part of it, which makes our Notion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, till it be recol<gap reason="illegible: damage" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cted by this means. And by <hi>A Memorial for the Learn'd,</hi> we mean, a succinct Account of those things, wherewith the studious have been unacquainted by large and learned Tracts, which being apt to be forgotten, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently remitted to memory by this small Treatise. The Propriety therefore of this part of our Title, I suppose no body will deny. As to the Books we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to epitomize, they are certainly the
<pb facs="tcp:56353:6"/>
best that could be thought on; the fame of whose Authors will certainly remain to the Worlds <hi>Nè plus ultra.</hi> It remains therefore, that we acquaint you with our Proceedings, and justifie our Method.</p>
            <p>First then, You have a short Memorial of <hi>English History,</hi> beginning before the Invasion of <hi>Britain</hi> by <hi>Julius Caesar,</hi> and from thence continued to <hi>September, 1682.</hi> wherein you have, The Length and Breadth of <hi>England;</hi> an Account of its first Inhabitants; the <hi>Romans</hi> Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it; its Division into Parishes; the <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Invasions; the Foundation of Universities and Colledges; with all remarkable Passages before the Conquest: And from thence an Account of the Life and Death of each King; his most notable Acts, Coronation, Heirs and Issues, to the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, of ever blessed memory; abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the best Chronicles, and from thence continued, with the notable Passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of our present blessed Monarch's Reign, till the beginning of <hi>September, 1685.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, You have a Collection of the most remarkable Occurrences, Adventures, notable Exploits, and wonderful Casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in Sir <hi>Richard Baker</hi>'s Chronicle,
<pb facs="tcp:56353:6"/>
discoursed with all possible Brevity. So that having had the material Remarks of a Chronicle before, Both together make One perfect; whereby you have in this small Treatise, what is most worthy no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in the largest Volumes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, You have an Epitome of the most eminent Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Works; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Abstracts from his History of Life and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ath; the length and shortness of Life in living Creatures; length of Life in Man; Medicines for long Life, and the Porches of Death: In all which, we have scarce omitted any thing, though expressed here with much Brevity. We <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> deseend to his Centuries; wherein there is much curious Learning, but most part fit only for Chymists and Physicians, that dive into the most hidden Secrets of Nature. Those Experiments that are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pleasant, or practicable, or of use, we have taken; wherein are many admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Curiosities of Nature, especially fit for Countrey-Gentlemen to practise, and others to discourse of.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, You have the Epitome of Vulgar Errors; wherein we found a vast number, such as are most worthy Notice, or not publickly known. All which things our Author has handled with so curious a
<pb facs="tcp:56353:7"/>
Pen, that every Sentence carries with it something that is extraordinary. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have all along followed his Sayl as close as we could, omitting (to the best of our judgment) nothing that is remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or pleasant.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, An Abridgment of Honour; wherein you have, first, The Priviledges due to Gentility; and afterwards all the several Titles of Honour, and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges due to the female Sex; and lastly, the Precedence amongst the Nobility and Peers of the Land, with their Issues; extracted chiefly from <hi>Carter</hi>'s Analysis of Honour, and other Treatises on that Subject. Wherefore this <hi>Compendium,</hi> if truly look'd into, we question not, but the ingenious Reader will find it to answer its proposed Ends, in being a Memorial for the Learn'd, or Miscellany of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings most useful Parts. And that it may accordingly prove of Advantage to all that peruse it, is the only Hope and Aim of him, who will ever endeavour to prove himself, (as every Man ought)</p>

               <hi>Eleanor Davis,</hi> Wife to Sir <hi>John Davis,</hi> the King's first Serjeant at Law in <hi>England,</hi> who was a Lady that has the greatest Character for Piety, Vertue, Wit and Prudence, that I ever read; and her Predictions most wonderful: Of the death of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> long before: In the most flourishing condition of the Nation, she foretold its unparallel'd Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and in the depth of those Troubles, she foretold that happy Restauration to Peace and Settlement, which we at this day (through the mercy of God) enjoy

under our most Gracious Sovereign; and in every one she long before prefixed the Time of their Accomplishment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anno</hi> 1656. It was related by the young <note place="margin">Rain of Fire from Heaven.</note> Marquess <hi>Francisco de Lopez,</hi> who with his Brother and Sisters was brought up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> being lately come from <hi>Peru,</hi> that the Cities of <hi>Luma</hi> and <hi>Calao</hi> in <hi>Peru,</hi> were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed by an Earthquake, and Fire rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Heaven, in which Ruine perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 11000 <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and about 100 <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other Events occurring in the late King's, and this happy Monarch's Reign, I shall omit them here, being so extraordinary and innumerable, that they cannot be comprized but in large Volumes, of which upon that occasion we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny extant.</p>

               <p>It is generally observed, that there are <note place="margin">Birds and Beasts.</note> more Birds long-liv'd than Beasts, though most come to their full growth in a year: The Reason is thought to be, because they partake more of the substance of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than of the Father, and so are not so hot; and also their mixt and easie motion is a great help.</p>
               <p>Upon this account it is noted, that those <note place="margin">What men live longest.</note> Men who more resemble the Mother than Father, live longest, as most participating of her substance, and thereby the cooler.</p>

But soon after the Flood, <note place="margin">Man shorter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd.</note> Man was brought down to a 4th. part of his primitive Age. Here the Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> numbers up many long livers since the Flood; and here also he observes, that though <hi>Virgil</hi> divined, and men are wholly <note place="margin">Of man's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay.</note> carried away with an opinion, that there is a continual decay by succession of Ages, as well in the term of man's Life, as in the stature and strength of his Body, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in these last 3000 years, a time whereof we have sure memory, there hath been no sensible alteration.</p>
               <p>It is also observed, that in cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries <note place="margin">Where men live longest.</note> men live longer commonly than in hot, and in Islands, than in the Continent.</p>

               <p>Often letting of Blood is certainly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial <note place="margin">Blood-letting.</note> for long Life; as also emaciating Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seases, if well cured.</p>
               <p>Saffron often taken in Meat, is a great <note place="margin">Strong Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> help: Spices, Wine, and strong Drinks, must be used very moderately, for they yield a predatory heat unto the Spirits.</p>
               <p>There conduce to the robust heat of the <note place="margin">Venus.</note> Spirits, <hi>Venus</hi> often excited, rarely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
               <p>A spare Diet, as is approved by Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">Spare Diet.</note> rendreth a man long liv'd.</p>
               <p>Exercises, wherein the Strength is too <note place="margin">Exercise.</note> much extended, hurteth much; but used moderately, benefit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:56353:74"/>
Great Joys attenuate the Spirits; fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <note place="margin">Joys.</note> Chearfulness strengthens them.</p>
               <p>Joy communicated sparingly, comforts <note place="margin">Grief and Fears.</note> the Spirits; Grief and Sadness, if void of Fear, and not too violent, prolong Life; but great Fears injure much.</p>
               <p>Anger suppressed is an Enemy to Longe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, <note place="margin">Anger and Envy.</note> but let loose, it helpeth it; but of all Passions, Envy is the greatest Abbreviator of Life.</p>
               <p>Pity without Fear is good, otherwise <note place="margin">Pity and Shame.</note> dangerous; light Shame hurteth not, but much and of long continuance is pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</p>
               <p>Love, if not too unfortunate and violent, <note place="margin">Love and Hope.</note> hath good effects; and Hope, if not too much frustrated, is the most beneficial of all Affections.</p>
               <p>Admiration and light Contemplation, <note place="margin">Admiration.</note> are very powerful to the prolonging of Life.</p>
               <p>Note, that all these produce their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, by the several operations on the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>

Now the Spirits are contained in the same state, by a restrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Affections, temperateness of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, abstinence from <hi>Venus,</hi> moderation in Labour, indifferent Rest and Repose.</p>
               <p>

Certainly living in Caves and Dens, <note place="margin">Desarts and Mountains.</note> where the Air is not heated with the Sun, helps length of Life, as hath been always observed: Also living upon Mountains, as those in <hi>Barbary,</hi> produceth the same ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>
               <p>But that which hath the most potent ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <note place="margin">Anointing the Skin.</note> to long Life, is the anointing the Skin very finely every morning, either with Oyl of Olives, or sweet Almonds, which stops the Pores, and exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshes and advantages the Spirits. And 'tis certain, that Sweats commonly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth <note place="margin">Sweats.</note> Health, but derogateth much from long Life.</p>
               <p>But note, that Anointing is very subject to many Inconveniences.</p>
               <p>Woollen worn next the Body, is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <note place="margin">Woollen.</note> very advantageous.</p>
               <p>The next thing for the advancement of <note place="margin">Clysters and Bathings.</note> long Life, is the keeping of the Blood cool, which is done by often taking Clysters, and in the Summer-time Bathings.</p>
               <p>To keep the juice of the Body some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what hard, which much conduces to long <note place="margin">Meats.</note> Life, these Meats are necessary: Beef, Swines-flesh, Deer, Goat, Kid, Swan, Goose, Ring-dove, especially a little poudered; Fish likewise salted and dried, old Cheese, and the like; and for Bread, any Corn makes more solid Bread than Wheat.</p>
               <p>Generally all Fish-eaters are long liv'd; <note place="margin">Fish-eaters.</note> likewise little and dry Aliment is very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous.</p>

                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:56353:75"/>
Pure Water usually drunk, benefits <note place="margin">Water.</note> much; but more, if you add a little Nitre.</p>
               <p>Cold Baths are much better than hot; <note place="margin">Swimming.</note> and Swimming, as all other Exercises a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad are, very good.</p>
               <p>For Liquors, very old Beer or Wine is <note place="margin">Liquors.</note> very profitable, especially if you put Swines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flesh or Deers-flesh well boyled in the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, that the sharp Spirits feeding upon these might lose their mordacity.</p>
               <p>Likewise Ale would be very useful for <note place="margin">Ale.</note> long Life, if it were made not only of Grain, but that it were mixed with a third part of sweet Roots, as Potado-roots, and the like.</p>
               <p>Such things as are good for the Stomach, <note place="margin">Simples for the Stomach.</note> above other Simples are these: Rosemary, Elecampane, Mastick, Wormwood, Sage, Mint.</p>
               <p>And note, that nothing is worse than in <note place="margin">Note.</note> a morning fasting to put any thing into the Stomach which is purely cold.</p>
               <p>It is altogether requisite to long Life, <note place="margin">Motion.</note> that the Body should never rest long in one posture, but that every half hour at least it change the posture, save only in Sleep.</p>
               <p>Great variety of Meat without doubt is <note place="margin">Variety of Meat.</note> a great prolonger of Life; as also good and well chosen Sawces.</p>
               <p>Roast and bak'd Meats be much better than boyl'd.</p>
               <p>It is certain that Diets that are now in <note place="margin">Changing the Juyce.</note> use, as Guaiacum, Sarsaperilla, China, and Sassafras, if they be continued for any time, do first attenuate the whole Juyce of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:56353:75"/>
Body, and after consume it and drink it up, and thereby is very useful and benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in Age to alter the old Juyce, and after to place new Juyce, which must needs be a great promoter of long Life; for it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently manifest, that men who by these Diets are brought to be extream lean, pale, and as it were Ghosts, will soon after be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fat, well coloured, and apparently young again.</p>
               <p>We do confidently affirm, that often <note place="margin">Purges,</note> Purges, and made even familiar to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, do much conduce to long Life; but the best Purges for this intention are those, which are taken immediately before Meat, because they dry the Body less, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must be of those Purges which do least trouble the Belly.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Causes of Common Errors.</head>
               <p>THE first and Father-cause of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Error, is the common Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of humane Nature; which may well be excused in us, by the depravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of those Parts, whose Traductions were pure in our first Parents, who committed the first and greatest Error.</p>
               <p>Yea, his Error is so much the greater, in that he is supposed by some, to have been the wisest Man that ever was; and as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have conceived, he was not ignorant of the Fall of the Angels, and had thereby Example and Punishment to deter him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:56353:82"/>
But Man was not only deceivable in his Integrity, but the Angels of Light in all their Clarity. He that said, he would be like the Highest, did err, if in some way he conceived himself so already; whereby vainly attempting not only Insolencies, but Impossibilities, he deceived himself as low as Hell. In brief, there is nothing infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but God, who cannot possibly err.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="chapter">
               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A further Illustration of the same.</head>
               <p>BEing thus deluded before the Fall, it is no wonder if their Conceptions were deceitful, and could scarce speak without an Error after: For what is very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (and what few have as yet observed) in the Relations of Scripture before the Flood, there is but one Speech delivered by Man, wherein there is not an erroneous Conception; the Pen of <hi>Moses</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded but six: The first that of <hi>Adam,</hi> when upon the Expostulation of God he replied, <hi>I heard thy Voice in the Garden, and because I was naked, I hid my self.</hi> In which Reply there is a capital Error, in infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Omnisciency and essential Ubiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Maker, who as he created all things, so is he beyond, and in them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:56353:83"/>
The second is that Speech of <hi>Adam</hi> unto God: <hi>The Woman whom thou gavest me to be with me, she gave me of the Tree, and I did eat.</hi> Wherein there is involved a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Error, in accusing his Maker of his Transgression; as if he had said, <hi>If thou hadst not given me a Woman, I had not been deceived.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third was that of <hi>Eve: The Serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.</hi> In which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, there is an erroneous translating her Offence upon another, to excuse the Fact; much more upon the suggestion of a Beast, which was before in the strictest terms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by her God.</p>
               <p>The fourth was that Speech of <hi>Cain,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the demand of God, <hi>Where is thy Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> and he said, <hi>I know not.</hi> In which Negation, beside the open Impudence, there was implied a notable Error, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning a Lye unto his Maker, and deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Omnisciency of God. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer of Satan, in the case of <hi>Job,</hi> had more of Truth, Wisdom, and Reverence, than this: <hi>Whence comest thou Satan?</hi> and he said, <hi>From compass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>g the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth is another Reply of <hi>Cain,</hi> upon the denouncement of his Curse: <hi>My Iniqi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is greater than can be forgiven.</hi> The As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion was not only desperate, but the Conceit erroneous, overthrowing that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attribute of God, his Mercy, and conceiving the sin of Murder impardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:56353:83"/>
The last Speech was that of <hi>Lamech: I have slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt:</hi> If <hi>Cain</hi> he avenged seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, truly <hi>Lamech</hi> seventy and seven-fold. Now herein there seems to be a very erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Illation, concluding a regular Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from a single example: he despaired of God's mercy in the same Fact, where this presumed it; though the sin was less, the error was as great.</p>
               <p>Thus may we perceive, how weakly our Fathers did err before the Flood; how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually and upon common discourse they fell upon Errors after; it is therefore no wonder we have been erroneous ever since.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the second Cause of popular Errors; the erroneous disposition of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</head>
               <p>HAving thus declared the infallible Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, even from his first Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, we have beheld the general Cause of Error. But as for popular Errors, they are more nearly founded upon an errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Inclination of the People; the sensitive quality most prevailing upon vulgar Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities. Thus they conceive the Earth to be far bigger than the Sun; the fixed Stars les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:56353:84"/>
than the Moon, their Figures plain, and their Spaces from the Earth equi-distant; for thus their Sense informeth them.</p>
               <p>And their individual Imperfections be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great, they are moreover enlarged by their Aggregation; and being erroneous in their single Numbers, once hudled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they will be Error it self. By this means, <hi>Thudas</hi> an Impostor was able to lead away 4000 in the Wilderness, and the Delusions of <hi>Mahomet</hi> almost a fourth part of Mankind.</p>
               <p>Now how far they may be kept in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, there is a great example in the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Rome,</hi> who never knew the true and proper Name of their own City; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side that common Appellation received by the Citizens, it had a proper and secret Name concealed from them; lest the Name thereof being discovered unto their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, their <hi>Penates</hi> and patronal Gods might be called forth by Charms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations: For according to the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Magicians, the tutelary Spirits will not remove at common Appellations, but at the proper Names of things, whereunto they are Protectors.</p>

               <p>THE first is a Mistake, or a Mis-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of things, either in their first Apprehensions, or secondary Relations. So <hi>Eve</hi> mistook the Commandment, either from the immediate Injunction of God, or the secondary Relation of her Husband. Thus began the Conceit of <hi>Centaurs,</hi> in the mistake of first Beholders, as is declared by <hi>Servius:</hi> When some young <hi>Thessalians</hi> on Horse-back were beheld afar off, while their Horses watered, they were conceived by the first Spectators to be but one Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; and answerable hereunto have their Pictures been drawn ever since.</p>
               <p>Next there is the Fallacy of Equivocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Amphibology, which conclude from the ambiguity of one Word, or the ambiguous Syntaxis of many put together. By this way, many Errors crept in, and perverted the Doctrine of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> whilst men received his Precepts in a different
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:56353:85"/>
sence from his intention, converting Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors into Proprieties, and receiving as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral Expressions, obscure and involved Truths: So he commands to deface the print of a Cauldron in the Ashes, after it hath boyled; which strictly to observe, were condemnable Superstition. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he covertly adviseth us, not to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in Anger, but after our Choler hath boyled, to retain no impression thereof; and the like in several others.</p>

               <p>A Third Cause of Common Errors, is the Credulity of men; that is, an easie Assent to what is obtruded, whereby men often swallow Falsities for Truths, without examination assenting unto things, which from their Natures and Causes do carry no Perswasion. Thus many wise <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenians</hi> so far forgot their Philosophy, that they descended to a Belief, that the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of their Nation was from their great Mother, Earth.</p>
               <p>The fourth is a Supinity, or Neglect of Enquiry, even of Matters whereof we doubt, rather doubting with ease, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving with difficulty. Had our Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers sat down in these Resolutions, the face of Truth had been obscure to us,

whose lustre in some part their Industries have revealed.</p>

               </head>
               <p>HEreof the common Opinion hath been, That Chrystal is nothing else but Ice, by duration of Time congealed beyond Liquation; of which, if the numerosity of Assertors were a sufficient Demonstration, it would pass for an unquestionable Truth; <hi>Pliny, Seneca, Basil,</hi> and <hi>Austin,</hi> being posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in this Opinion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheless it is with much more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son denied, than is as yet affirmed, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:56353:89"/>
that likewise by very learned Authors; as <hi>Diodorus,</hi> who saith, <hi>Crystallum esse lapidem ex aqua pura concretum, non tamen frigore, sed divini caloris vi. Solinus,</hi> who transcribed <hi>Pliny,</hi> hath in this Point dissented from him, with several others.</p>
               <p>Now besides Authority, there are very strong Reasons to the contrary: For if it be a Stone, as it is confessedly received, it must have lapidifical Principles of its own; therefore whilst in a fluid Body, 'twas very unfit for Conglaciation; for mineral Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits do generally resist, and scarce submit thereto.</p>
               <p>But whether this Congelation be simply made of Cold, or by the operation of any nitrous <hi>Coagulum,</hi> or Spirit of Salt; (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we observe, that Ice may be made with <note place="margin">How to make Ice at any time of the year.</note> Salt and Snow by the Fire-side, as is also observable from Ice made of Salt-peter and Water, duely mixed and strongly agitated at any time of the year;) were a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Enquiry.</p>
               <p>But as Ice is several ways dissolvable, this is only one, and that with very great difficulty; which is by reducing it by Art to a subtil Powder, and then with a vitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commixture, it will be dissolved by a violent dry Heat.</p>
               <p>Again, It differs from Ice, in that Ice will swim in the thinnest Water that can be, and this will sink, be it never so thick; which shews that there is in it a greater Ponderosity.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:56353:89"/>
Ice is likewise of a homogeneous Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whose Material is properly Water, and but accidentally exceeding the simplicity of that Element: But the body of Chrystal is mixed, and its Ingredients many; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the Spirit and Mercurial Principle, it containeth a sulphureous, or inflamable part, and that in no small quantity, and upon Collision with Steel will actively send forth its Sparks, not much inferiourly unto a Flint.</p>
               <p>It containeth also a Salt, and that in some plenty, which may occasion its Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gility; as is also observable in Coral. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it consisteth of Parts so far from an icy Dissolution, that powerful <hi>Menstruums</hi> are made for its Emollition. As for its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, when reduced to powder, it hath a vail and shadow of Blue.</p>
               <p>They have also contrary Qualities ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental; for Ice is cold and moist, and Chrystal cold and dry, according to the condition of Earth.</p>
               <p>Having thus declared what Chrystal is <note place="margin">WhatChrystal is.</note> not, it may afford some satisfaction to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest what it is. To deliver therefore what with the Judgment of approved Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and best Reason consisteth: It is a mineral Body in the difference of Stones; transparent, and resembling Glass or Ice, made of a lentous Percolation of the Earth, drawn from the most pure and liquid Juyce thereof, owing to the coldness of the Earth some Concurrence or Co-adjuvancy, but not immediate Determination and Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency;
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:56353:90"/>
which are wrought by the hand of its concretive Spirit, the seeds of Petrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Gorgon of its self: As sensible Philosophers conceive of the Generation of Diamonds, Iris, and Beryls.</p>

               <p>But to leave this: It is observable that Steel and good Iron, though not excited by the Loadstone, have a polary Faculty, whereby being conveniently placed, they do septentrionate at one Extream, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stralize at another. And a Needle un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd, being hanged above a Loadstone, will convert into a parallel Position there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Likewise Iron being heated in the Fire red hot, and cooled in the Meridian from North to South, will presently contract a polary Power; and being poised in Air or Water, convert that part unto the North,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:56353:90"/>
which respected that Point in its Refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Likewise if a Loadstone be made r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d hot, it loseth its former magnetical Vigor, and acquires another from the Earth in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigeration.</p>
               <p>It is observed, that Attraction is recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal between a Loadstone and Iron, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Experiments. For if a piece of Iron be fastned in the side of a Bowl or Bason of Water, a Loadstone swimming freely in a Boat of Cork, will presently make unto it, as a Needle doth to a Loadstone. Again, if a Loadstone be finely filed, the attoms or dust thereof will adhere to Iron that was never touched, even as the filings of Iron doth also to a Loadstone.</p>

In which number we place Diamonds, Sapphires, Carbuncles, Iris, Opals, Amethysts, Beryl, Chrystal, <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stol-stones,</hi> Sulphur, Mastick, hard Wax, hard Rosin, Arsenick, Sal-Gem, Roach-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,

               <p>But their Attraction is very different; for refinous or unctuous Bodies, and such as will flame, attract most vigorously, as Anime, Benjamin, and most powerfully good hard Wax, which will convert the Needle almost as actively as the Loadstone, but most of the other but very weakly.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But the main Axis which supported this Opinion, was daily Experience, and visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Testimony of Sense; there being many who carry about Roots, which handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make out the shape of a Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But these are not Productions of Nature, but Contrivances of Art, as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiolus</hi> plainly detected, and learnt the way to make them of one of those Cheaters; which is thus: They take the Roots of Canes, Briony, and other Plants, and in these, yet fresh and virent, they carve out the Figures of Men and Women, sticking Grains of Barley or Millet, where they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Hair should grow; then bury them in Sand, till the Grains shoot forth their Roots. All which, like other Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:56353:92"/>
once discovered, is easily effected, and in the Root of white Briony may be practised every Spring.</p>
               <p>Some assert, That it naturally groweth under Gallows, and Places of Execution, arising from Fat or Urine that drops from the Body of the Dead.</p>
               <p>Another affirmeth, That Roots of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drakes do make a noise, or give a Shriek, upon Eradication. Both which are indeed ridiculous, and false, below Confute.</p>
               <p>The last was, That some evil Fate pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues those that pull it up, and they live not long after; which were to introduce a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond forbidden Fruit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Cinamon, Ginger, Clove, Mace, and Nutmeg, are but the several Parts and Fruits of the same Tree, is the common belief of those which daily use them; whereof to speak distinctly, Ginger is the Root of no Tree, but of an herbaseous Plant, resembling the Water-flower De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luce, very common in many Parts of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia.</hi>

Now this noise is only made by a little sheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winged grey Insect, found often in Wains<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, Benches, and Wood-work, in the Summer, which knocketh against the Wood with a little Trunk, (like a Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecker against a Tree) and striketh 10 or 11 strokes at a time.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the Basilisk.</head>
               <p>MANY Opinions are passant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Basilisk, or little King of Serpents, commonly called, the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice. It cannot be denied, but there is such an Animal; but certainly that which we vulgarly call a Cockatrice, is not the Basilisk of the Ancients, of which such Wonders are delivered. For this of ours is <note place="margin">A description of a Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice.</note> generally described with Legs, Wings, a serpentine and winding Tail, and a Crist or Comb somewhat like a Cock; but the <note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Basi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk.</note> Basilisk of elder Times was a proper kind of Serpent, not above three Palms long, as some account; and differenced from other Serpents, by advancing his Head, and some white Marks or coronary Spots upon the Crown, as all authentick Writers have delivered.</p>
               <p>Nor is the Cockatrice only unlike the Basilisk, but of no real shape in Nature, but a meer Hieroglyphical Fancy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:56353:96"/>
The Existency only of a Basilisk is not considerable, but many things delivered thereof, particularly its Poyson and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Concerning the first, it is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That it killeth at a distance, and by priority of Vision; of which there is no high improbability in the Relation, no more than that of the <hi>Torpedo</hi>'s delivering their Opium at a distance, and stupifying beyond themselves.</p>
               <p>But as for the Generation of the Basilisk, that it proceedeth from a Cock's Egg, hatch'd under a Toad or Serpent, it is a Conceit as monstrous as the Brood it self.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Wolf.</head>
               <p>SUCH a Story as the Basilisk, is that of the Wolf, That a Man becomes hoarse or dumb, if a Wolf have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage first to eye him; which <hi>Pliny</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. Thus the Proverb is to be understood, When during a Discourse, there ensueth a sudden Silence, it is usually said, <hi>Lupus est in Fabula.</hi> Which Conceit being already convicted, not only by <hi>Scaliger, Riolanus,</hi> and others, but daily confutable almost every where out of <hi>England,</hi> we shall not further refute.</p>

                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:56353:96"/>
The Original hereof, was probably the Amazement, the unexpected appearance of Wolves, do often put upon Travellers, not by a venomous Emanation, but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Fear, which naturally proceedeth from Obmutescence.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Deer.</head>
               <p>THE common Opinion is, That the Deer may live hundreds of Years; which we crave liberty to doubt, from these ensuing Reasons.</p>
               <p>The first is that of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> drawn from the Increment and Gestation of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal; that is, its sudden arrivance to Growth and Maturity, and the small time of remainder in the Womb: Neither of which afford an Argument of long Life.</p>
               <p>And as <hi>Scaliger</hi> saith, Of Animals vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parous, such as live long, go long with Young, and attain but slowly to maturity of Stature. So the Elephant, that liveth an 100 years, beareth its Young above a year, and arriveth unto perfection at 20. On the contrary, a Sheep or Goat, which live but 8 or 10 years, go but five months, and attain to their perfection at two years. And so the Deer that endureth the Womb but 8 months, and is compleat at 6 years,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:56353:97"/>
cannot in a proportionable allowance live much more than 30.</p>
               <p>The next Reason is, its unparallel'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Venery, which is supposed to shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Lives of Cocks, Partridges, and Sparrows; certainly an undeniable Enemy unto Longaevity. Hence it is observable, that castrated Animals in every species, are longer liv'd than they which retain their Virilities.</p>
               <p>A third Reason is, the Marks of Age, of which betwixt 20 and 30 years of Age they have several; as is observed here in <hi>England</hi> in losing their Teeth, and their Horns growing less branched, with several other Marks of Age.</p>
               <p>The Ground and Authority of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit was first Hieroglyphical, the <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> expressing Longaevity by this Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal.</p>
               <p>Another Ground might be that Poetical passage of <hi>Hesiod:</hi>

               <p>Another Reason was, the defect of a Gall: Which Assertion is defective in the verity concerning the Animal alledged; for though it hath no Gall in the Liver like other Beasts, yet hath it that Part in the Guts.</p>

               <p>THAT there are Griffins in Nature, that is, a mixt and dubious Animal, in the fore-part resembling an Eagle, and behind the shape of a Lion, with erected Ears, four Feet, and a long Tail, many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and most, I perceive, deny it not. The same is averred by <hi>Aetian, Solinus, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and was an Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick of the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheless by diligent Enquiry we find a contrary Assertion, by <hi>Albertus, Pliny,</hi> and the learned <hi>Aldrovandus. Matthias Michovius,</hi> who writ of those Northern Parts, wherein men place these Griffins, hath positively concluded against it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the Phoenix.</head>
               <p>THAT there is but one Phoenix in the World, which after many hundred years burneth it self, and from the Ashes thereof ariseth up another, is a Conceit of great Antiquity, and frequently expressed by holy Writers; by <hi>Cyril, Epiphanius, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> All which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, we dare not affirm there is any Phoenix in Nature; for though many Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have much enlarged hereon, yet is there not any ocular Describer; and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Authors herein deliver themselves very dubiously. So <hi>Herodotus</hi> in his <hi>Euter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> delivering the Story hereof, presently interposes, (which account seems to me improbable;) and much after the same manner conclude several others.</p>
               <p>As for that in the Book of <hi>Psalms, Vir justus ut Phoenix florebit,</hi> it was only a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake upon the Homonymy of the Greek word <hi>Poenix,</hi> which signifies also a Palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree.</p>
               <p>But were the Existence of this Animal granted, yet many things are questionable which are ascribed thereto; its Unity, long Life, and Generation. As for its Unity, it is repugnant to holy Scripture; which plainly affirms, There went two of every
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:56353:99"/>
sort into the Ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> and other Places.</p>

               <p>THAT the Toad by pissing diffuseth his Venom, is generally received in all Parts. So <hi>Scaliger</hi> observes, and <hi>Mathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olus,</hi> That it communicates its Venom not only by Urine, but by the Slaver of its Mouth. As for pissing, we may as well ascribe that action to Crows and Kites, which have but one Vent, and common Place of Exclusion.</p>
               <p>As for the Stone, commonly called the Toad stone, there is no substantial Reason, why in a Toad there may not be found such lapideous Concretions; for the like is observed in Cods, Carps, and Pearches.</p>
               <p>Though a thing not impossible, yet a Rarity, that by our Enquiry may be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Whether there be really such a Stone in the Head of a Toad at all; for Writers of Minerals conceive the Stones that bear this Name, to be of a mineral Concretion. When <hi>Brassavolus</hi> after a long search had discovered one, he affirms, it was rather the Forehead-bone petrified, than a Stone within the Crany; and of this belief was <hi>Gesner,</hi> and several others. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, some of these Stones may be mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:56353:99"/>
and few animal, to be met with in Toads, and in substance not unlike the Stones in Crabs Heads.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Generation of Frogs, he tells us nothing but what is vulgarly known.</p>

               <p>THAT a Salamander is able to live in Flames, is an ancient Assertion, and confirmed by frequent, and not contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Testimony; affirmed by very famous Authors: All which notwithstanding, there is on the negative, Authority and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Sextius</hi> and <hi>Dioscorides</hi> affirmed it a point of folly to believe it. <hi>Galen</hi> saith, That it endureth the Fire a while, but in continuance is consumed therein. <hi>Mathio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> affirmeth, That he saw a Salamander burnt in a very short time; and several others that have experienced it.</p>
               <p>The ground might be, Some sensible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of Fire, observed in the Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; being cold in the fourth, and moist in the third degree, may thereby a while endure the Flame.</p>
               <p>Nor is this Salamander's Wooll, so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, desumed from any Animal, but a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Substance, metaphorically so called, from this received Opinion; though it is
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:56353:100"/>
very remarkable what the Ancients called <hi>Asbeston,</hi> whereof were weaved Napkins, Shirts, and Coats, inconsumable by Fire.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Amphisboena.</head>
               <p>THAT the Amphisboena, being a smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler kind of Serpent, which moveth forward and backward, hath two Heads, was affirmed first by <hi>Nicander;</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Galen, Pliny;</hi> and most confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>Aetian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But were there really such a natural kind of Animal, it would be hard to make good those six Positions of Body, which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the three Dimensions, are ascribed unto every Animal; that is, <hi>infra, supra, ante, retro, dextrosum, sinistrosum:</hi> For the Senses being placed at both Extreams, doth make both ends anterior, which is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the Poets <hi>Geryon</hi> or <hi>Cerberus,</hi> would be less monstrous than the Amphis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boena.</p>
               <p>And therefore we must crave leave to doubt of this double-headed Serpent, until we have the advantage to behold, or have an iterated ocular Testimony concerning it.</p>

               <p>THAT the young Vipers force their way through the Bowels of their Dam, or that the female Viper, in the act of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, bites off the Head of the male, is a very ancient Tradition; affirmed by <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodotus, Plutarch, Jerom, Basil,</hi> and several others: Notwithstanding which Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, upon enquiry we find the same repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto Experience and Reason.</p>
               <p>And first this seems not only injurious unto the Providence of Nature, but it fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates the great Benediction of God: <hi>God</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply.</hi> Now if these be the Fruits of fructifying in the Viper, it cannot be said that God did bless, but curse this Animal. Again, it overthrows the paternal provision of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whereby the young ones newly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, are sustained by the Dam.</p>
               <p>For the Experiment, it is found other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise by worthy Enquirers, as <hi>Apollonius, Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger,</hi> and several others.</p>
               <p>It is here observed, That a Viper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth no Humour or Part, which either eat or drank is able to kill any: That the <hi>Remorsores,</hi> or Dog-teeth, are two; and though they bite or prick therewith, yet are they not venomous, but only open a
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:56353:101"/>
way and entrance unto the Poyson, which notwithstanding is not poysonous, except it attain unto the Blood.</p>

               <p>THAT Moles are blind, and have no Eyes, is an Opinion received with much variety.

Of which, the last with some restriction is most consonant to Truth: For that they have Eyes in their Head, is manifest to any, that wants them not in his own; but that they be comparatively incompleat, we need not to deny, being they are not perfectly blind, nor yet distinctly see.</p>

               <p>WHether Snails have Eyes, some learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men have doubted: For <hi>Scali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> terms them, but Imitations of Eyes; and <hi>Aristotle</hi> denieth them. But this now seems sufficiently asserted by the help of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite Glasses, which discover those black and atramentous Spots to be their Eyes.</p>
               <p>That they have two Eyes, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion: But if they have two Eyes, we may grant them to have no less than four, that is, two in the longer Extensions above, and two in the shorter Horns be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. And this number may be allowed in these inferior and exanguious Animals, since we observe the articulate and latticed Eyes in Flies, and nine in some Spiders; and in the great <hi>Phalangium</hi> Spider of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> we plainly number eight.</p>
               <p>But in sanguineous Animals, <hi>quadrupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, bipedes,</hi> or Man, no such number can be regularly verified.</p>

               <p>COncerning the Chamelion, there gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally paffeth an Opinion, That it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth only upon Air, and is sustained by no other Aliment; which is affirmed by <hi>Solinus,</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> and others: Yet upon enquiry I find the Assertion controverta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>And first for its Verity; some have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively denied it, as <hi>Augustinus, Niphus,</hi> with very many more. Others have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally refuted it, as namely <hi>Johannes Landius,</hi> who observed a Chamelion to lick up a Fly from his Breast; and <hi>Belionius,</hi> upon Exenteration, found these Animals in their Bellies: And the Experiments of the worthy <hi>Peireschius,</hi> and learned <hi>Emanuel Vizzanius,</hi> in that Chamelion, which had been often observed to drink Water, and delight to feed on Meal-worms.</p>
               <p>Likewise this Animal hath all Parts offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial unto Nutrition; which were its Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the empty reception of Air, their Provisions had been superfluous.</p>
               <p>It hath likewise a Tongue; for which there is two Ends, Either the formation of Voice, or for Taste. It cannot be used for the first, it being a mute Animal. As for Taste, if their Nutriment be Air, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:56353:103"/>
can it be an instrument thereof, for the body of that Element is ingustible. His Tongue also seemeth contrived for Prey, for in so little a Creature it is at least a Palm long; and it hath in this Part a very great Agility, and hath in the Tongue a mucous and slimy Extremity, whereby up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a sudden Emission, it inviscates and tangleth those Insects.</p>

               <p>THE common Opinion of the Ostrich, <hi>Struthiocamelus,</hi> or Sparrow-camel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives that it digests Iron; which is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Affirmations of many learned Authors: Yet the Negative pleads with more Reason; for <hi>Pliny, Aetian,</hi> and <hi>Leo Africanus,</hi> who lived in those Countreys wherein they most abound, only say, The Digestion is wonderful in this Animal; and <hi>Riolanus</hi> in his Comment thereof, posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denies it. Some have experimental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuted it, as <hi>Albertus magnus;</hi> and most plainly <hi>Ulysses Aldrovandus,</hi> who observed an Ostrich to swallow Iron, but yet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it undigested again: and beside Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, it is in vain to attempt against it by Philosophical Argument.</p>
               <p>The ground of this Conceit is, its swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing down fragments of Iron, which
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:56353:104"/>
men observing, have therefore conceived, it digested them. Just as men swallow Cherry-stones, which conceive a durable and strong Heat in the Stomach, and so help Digestion, and prevent the Crudities of the Fruit; but they themselves came out undigested. And to the same purpose do other Animals swallow small Stones; and thus may the Ostrich swallow Iron.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XXV.</hi> Concerning the common course of Diet, in making choice of some Animals, and abstaining from eating others.</head>
               <p>WHY we confine our Food unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Animals, and totally reject some others: Whether this Practice be built upon solid Reason, or chiefly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by Custom or Opinion, may admit Consideration.</p>
               <p>And first, there is no absolute necessity of eating any: For before the Flood, our Fathers from vegetable Animals, preserved themselves unto longer Lives; and it was after the Deluge, when for the present the nature of Vegetables was destroyed or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. It is delivered, <hi>Every moving thing</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 9. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>that liveth, shall be Meat for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when ever it be acknowledged, that men began to feed on Flesh; yet how they betook themselves after to particular Kinds thereof, is a Point not clearly determined. Whether <hi>Moses</hi>'s distinction before the Flood, were not only in regard of Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that after was in regard of Food, is not yet resolved.</p>
               <p>If we will give credit to Authors, we shall understand, that there is no kind of Animal, but one time or other hath been
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:56353:105"/>
used for Food in some Parts; and many refuse not to eat of that, which is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure than what they reject.</p>
               <p>But to conclude, Without doubt there is an ample sufficiency, without all Flesh, in the food of Honey, Oyl, and several sorts of Milk; and also in Vegetables, which would be very beneficial unto Health, and much prolong our days.</p>

               <p>THAT the Heart of a Man is seated in the left side, is an Assertion, which strictly taken, is refutable by Inspection; whereby it appears, the Base and Center thereof is in the midst of the Chest, though the Mucro or Point inclineth toward the left: Nevertheless we cannot properly say, 'tis placed in the left.</p>
               <p>That Assertion also, That Man hath the largest Brain, is a thing much doubted; but upon tryal is found very true; the Brains of a Man weighing 4, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times 5 pound: If therefore a Man weigh 140 pound, and his Brains 5, his weight is 27 times as much as his Brain. Now in a Snipe, which weighed 4 ounces 2 drachms, the Brains weigh but half a drachm; so that the weight of the Body exceeded the weight of the Brain 67 times and / m?/. A Sparrow in the total we found to weigh 7 drachms and 24 grains, whereof the Head a drachm, but the Brain not 15 grains; which answereth not fully the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Brain of Man.</p>

               <p>THAT men naturally make use of the right, and that the use of the other is a digression or aberration from that way, which Nature generally intendeth; though it is preferred before the other in almost all Parts of the World, yet in submission to future Information, we are unsatisfied to great dubitation.</p>
               <p>For did it arise from a constant Root in Nature, we might expect the same in other Animals, wherein we can discover no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying account.</p>
               <p>Again, Were it so, why have they not the same difference in their Senses, which we find equal on both sides? As for their dextral Activity, it proceeds only from the more use.</p>
               <p>And likewise that a Woman upon a mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine Conception advanceth her right Leg, will not be found to answer strict Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and that Males are conceived in the right side of the Womb, Females on the left, (though supported by ancient Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) will make no infallible account. It is also suspicious what is delivered concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right and left Testicle, That Males are begotten from one, and Females from the other: and therefore that way which
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:56353:109"/>

               <p>But Man alters his natural Posture, and swimmeth prone, whereas he walketh erect. Likewise to support and advance the Body, is a point of Art, and such, that some in their young and docile years could never attain; though it hath somewhat more of Nature than other Arts, for being once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, there is not any who from disuse did ever yet forget it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That Persons drowned, arise and float the ninth day, when their Gall break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, is questionable both in the Time and

               <p>Besides we have an Epiglottis, or Flap, on the opening of the Larinx, or Throttle, which openeth for the admission of Air, but always closeth when we swallow; and when either Meat or Drink get in thereat, it occasioneth a Cough, until it be ejected: and this is the Reason why a Man cannot breath and drink at the same time.</p>

               <p>THE Custom of blessing People upon their Sneezing, is generally believed to have its Original from a Disease, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in such as sneezed died: But though it hath been much used both amongst the <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> yet is it no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that this was the first Rise of it.</p>
               <p>Now the Reason of this might be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Sternutation is taken as a very good sign: For Sneezing being properly a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Brain, suddenly expelling through the Nostrils what is offensive unto it, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but afford some evidence of its Vigor; and therefore, saith <hi>Aristotle,</hi> Those that hear it, honour it, as a sign of Sanity in the diviner Part. And this he illustrates from the Practice of Physicians, who in Persons near their Death, do use such Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines as provoke unto Sneezing; and if that Faculty awaketh, they conceive hopes of Life, and with Gratulation receive the signs of Safety.</p>

               <p>THAT the <hi>Jews</hi> stink naturally, that is, that in their Race and Nation there is an evil Savour, is a received Opinion we know not how to admit: Though we will acknowledge, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Odours attend on Animals, no less than certain Colours and pleasant Smells are found in divers Animals; and in some more richly than in Plants, as the Parde, the Civet-cat, Gazela, and many sorts of Monkeys.</p>
               <p>Upon the Consult of Reason, there will be found no easie assurance to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten a material or temperamental Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety upon any Nation; much more will it be difficult to make out this Assertion in the <hi>Jews,</hi> whose Race however pretended to be pure, must needs have suffered inseparated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtures with Nations of all sorts.</p>
               <p>But should we concede, there were such a National Unsavouriness in any People, yet should we find the <hi>Jews</hi> less subject hereto than any; for they observe a spare and simple Diet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they prevent the generation of Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,

               <p>THAT the forbidden Fruit of <hi>Paradise</hi> was an Apple, is commonly believed and confirmed by Tradition; and some from thence have derived the Latin word <hi>Malum,</hi> because that Fruit was the first oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of Evil; wherein notwithstanding Determinations are presumptuous, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are of another belief; for some have conceived it a Vine, others a Fig. Again, Some Fruits pass under the Name of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Apples, which in common acceptation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

not that Appellation; described by <hi>Mathiolus</hi> to be a very fair Fruit, and not unlike a Citron, but somewhat rougher, chopt and cranied, vulgarly conceived the Marks of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Teeth. But yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not from hence infer, they were this Fruit in question; no more than <hi>Arbor Vitae,</hi> so called, to obtain its Name from the Tree of Life in <hi>Paradise,</hi> or <hi>Arbor Judae,</hi> to be the fame which supplied the Gibbet unto <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, There is no Determination in the Text; wherein is only particularized, that it was the Fruit of a Tree good for Food, and pleasant unto the Eye, in which regards, many excel the Apple; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learned Men do wisely conceive it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable; and <hi>Philo</hi> puts Determination unto Despair, when he affirmeth, the same kind of Fruit was never produced since.</p>
               <p>Now the Ground or Reason that occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned this expression by an Apple, might be the Community of this Fruit, and which is often taken for any other: And to speak strictly, in this Appellation, they placed it more safely than any other; for beside the great variety of Apples, the word in Greek comprehendeth Oranges, Lemmons, Citrons, Quinces; and as <hi>Ruellius</hi> defineth, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>THAT <hi>Aristotle</hi> drowned himself in <hi>Euripus,</hi> as despairing to resolve the cause of its Reciprocation, or Ebb and Flow 7 times a day, with this Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Si quidem ego non capio te, tu capies me,</hi> was the Assertion of learned Authors, and is generally believed among us.

               <p>But to pass this over: <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> tells us, That being accused of Impiety, he withdrew into <hi>Chalcis,</hi> where drinking Poyson, he died: And <hi>Apollodorus,</hi> That he died there of a natural Death, in his 63d.or great Climacterical year.</p>
               <p>It is likewise false what is said of this <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripus,</hi> of its Ebb and Flow 7 times a day; for as we have it from very good Evidence, it ebbeth and floweth by 6 hours; as it doth at <hi>Venice.</hi>
