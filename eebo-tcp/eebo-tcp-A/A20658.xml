         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

relieued by two remedies, according to
that worthie ſaying: <hi>Tristia cuncta exſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perans
aut animo, aut amico.</hi> That is to
ſay all things are to be ouercome, either
with the forteſied power of a patient
minde, or with the fortunate preſence of a faithfull friend.
What comfort can there bee more propitiate or preſent to a
penciue mind, than to powre out the plaints thereof into the
ſecret boſome of a ſincere friend, by whoſe ſweete communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
is receaued a ſodaine delight, and ſoueraigne conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as a moſt cordiall medicine againſt any corraſiue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Architas</hi> of <hi>Tarento</hi> teacheth vs that life is no life being
led without the loyal loue and liking of ſome that are liuing:
neither is his ioy, any ioy, that dooth not enioy ſome friend
with whome he may be iointly ioyned in ſocietie: for if a man
ſhould climbe vp to the ſkies, &amp; take a ful view of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the heauens, and contemplate the beautifulneſſe of
the ſtarres: and behold all the wonderfull workes of GOD
vpon the face of the earth: the admiration thereof would be
but vnpleaſant without ſome friend to whome hee might
make relation of the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scipio Minor</hi> when he went foorth of his houſe at any time
would earneſtly endeuour himſelfe to finde out ſome compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
among whome hee would make one his familiar friend
before he retourned home againe: ſaying <hi>there is no better
poſſeſsion than the fruition of a friend.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Titus Veſpaſianus</hi> the Emperor on a certaine time finding
by feeling his owne conſcience that he had not pleaſured any

duetie of a friend.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dioniſius</hi> the Tirant was ſo amazed at the friendſhip
<pb facs="tcp:5677:4"/>
of <hi>Damon</hi> and <hi>Pithias</hi> that it tranſlated his minde from
being tirannous towards them, to become almoſt amorous
with them, as it may appeare by his owne petition. <hi>Rogo vt

(ſaith he) receaue me alſo into your ſacred ſocietie.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Darius</hi> doubted not to ſay, hee had rather enioy his
faithfull friend <hi>Zopirus</hi> free from wounded face and deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
then a hundred ſuch cities as <hi>Babilon</hi> with al their welth
and ſuperfluitie.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Achilles</hi> being demaunded of <hi>Aiax,</hi> which were the

that hee endured for his friends. And beeing againe
demanded of the ſame, what trauailes and paines ſeemed to
him moſt pleaſant: ſaid, the trauailes and paines he tooke for
his friends. Signifying thereby, that a man indued with an
heroicall heart ſhould alwaies bee inflamed with a deſire of
doing good to his friend. And to the like end and purpoſe, a
certain Philoſopher co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared a perfect friend to a good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
horſe in ſeauen properties as followeth, hauing
<list>
                  <item>A little head by humble conuerſation.</item>
                  <item>A ſharpe eare to be quick of hearing &amp; ready at euery call.</item>

                  <item>A bay colour for his good renowne.</item>
               </list>
Some alſo affirme that true friends ought to bee like mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie
trees which bring foorth their fruite at ſuch times, that
they neither feare the froſts of <hi>May,</hi> as the vines doo; nor the
miſtes of <hi>October,</hi> as the Peaches and Quinces doo. Thus
among the auncient <hi>Romaines</hi> and <hi>Grecians</hi> friendſhip
hath been had in great reuerence, but throw the iniquitie of
our time it is now become, <hi>tam rara auis in terris,</hi> that a
man may as ſoone ſee a black Swan, as find out a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
friend.</p>
            <p>And here I imagine ſome man may aſke me a double que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
<pb facs="tcp:5677:4"/>
Firſt, whether the late famous Famelie of loue, which
bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to creep in among vs, haue any fellowſhip with Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, whether the Holy league may be linked in the
golden chaine of charitie, or contained in the ſiluer band of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.
To them both I anſwere negatiuely: and firſt as for
the familie of loue, I thinke them fitter to be termed the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliars
of luſt, and of the familie of <hi>Lucifer:</hi> they are a ſect gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to ſenſualitie, ſtirred vp by ſome infernall Furie, to
make a confuſion of al things generallie, the which is ſo odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
that as I loath to think of it, ſo wil I leaue to ſpeak of it.</p>
            <p>And as for the holy league, which ſome call the helly lake
or helliſh legion, how farre they are from amitie or honeſtie,
<hi>France</hi> can beſt Iudge, of whoſe loyaltie they haue had expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
but too lately. The firſt original and birth of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was
like to an vntimely monſter ripped out of the bowells of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
and foſtered vp with the poyſoned teats of treaſon,
and will be ſtill mainteyned by their miſtres abhomination,
vntill the breath of Gods wrath worke their deſtruction.
Wherfore the Friendſhip y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſpoken of in this place, is not
the tirannicall friendſhip of the holy league, nor the filthie
friendſhip, of the falſe named familie of loue, nor the froward
friendſhip which a man may finde at <hi>Billingſgate</hi> for a boxe
on the eare, nor the profitable friendſhip which is among
Merchants, nor the pleaſant friendſhip which is among
Courtiers, nor the common friendſhip which is among
Clownes: but it is the true, perfect, and vnfeyned friendſhip,
which is neither for pleaſure partely, nor for profit chiefely,
but for vertues ſake onely.</p>
            <p>And becauſe no man ſhould be deceiued, as the Painter who
ſuppoſed light colours to be linnen cloath, I haue ſet downe
certaine Articles, precepts, or ſtatutes of the lawe of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie</hi>
appertaining to the foreſaid Figure: the which, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
dooth not obſerue and performe, cannot obtaine the
name of a ſincere friend.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is to be eſteemed more than all

2 <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is onely among good men, and cannot be
where vertue is not.</p>
            <p>3 A faithfull Friend is as a mans owne ſelfe.</p>
            <p>4 <hi>Friendſhip</hi> muſt not be deſired for profit or gaine.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Friendſhip</hi> cannot be changed no more than Nature,
but is of continuance.</p>
            <p>6 Couetouſnes is a great plague to <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7 Flatterie is an vtterenemie to <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>8 A man muſt neither grant to his Friend, nor requeſt
anie thing of him that is vnlawfull or vnhoneſt.</p>
            <p>9 If our friends conſpire againſt the commonwealth,
we ought to forſake them, and alſo reueale them.</p>
            <p>10 Friends muſt not flatter, but boldly and freely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe,
admoniſh, and counſell one another.</p>
            <p>11 The chiefe triall of a Friend is in time of neceſſitie.</p>
            <p>12 True friendſhip is hard to be found amongſt great
men.</p>
            <p>13 A faithfull Friend in weale and woe is all one.</p>
            <p>14 A Friend muſt neither be a tale carrier, nor a tale
creditour.</p>
            <p>15 Friends ought to remember good turnes.</p>
            <p>16 A reuerent and modeſt baſhfulneſſe ought to be in
Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>17 Pleaſant ſpeaches and curteous manners bee not
the worſt ſawces in Friendſhip: but lumpiſh ſadneſſe, and
ſullen ſowreneſſe ought to be in anie wiſe ſhunned.</p>
            <p>18 A truſtie Friend is a great treaſure.</p>
            <p>19 We cannot doo too much in Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>20 Among Friends all things ſhould be common.</p>
            <p>Finally, they are all included in this definition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is a perfect conſent and agreement with beneuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
&amp; charitie in all things, appertaining as well towards
God as men.</p>
            <p>Theſe precepts duely conſidered, a true Friend may bee
eaſily diſcerned, &amp; yet you may ſooner by definition declare
what he is, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by demonſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhew where he is: for friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb facs="tcp:5677:5"/>
deſcribed in this forme and faſhion hath been long ſince
as one baniſhed from euerie Nation, not hauing any certain
place to make abode in: No not in <hi>Rome;</hi> for they are too
couetous, ſuperſtitious, and vainglorious: Not in <hi>Turkie;</hi>
for their <hi>Mahomet</hi> is too monſtrous: in <hi>India,</hi> they are too
rude and barbarous, in <hi>Italy</hi> proud and ambitious, in <hi>Spaine</hi>
diſdainfull, vile and vicious: in <hi>France</hi> craftie, fierce and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
in <hi>Germanie</hi> and <hi>Denmarke</hi> they dedicate themſelues
to <hi>Bacchus.</hi> But I would I could iuſtly report our ſelues to
be cleere from all theſe vices, &amp; more apt to embrace <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>
here in <hi>England:</hi> for that it hath the name and fame to
be a moſt flouriſhing Iland, where religion hath appeared,
where peace and concord hath been placed, and the people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
bleſſed manie yeares; which God continue for euer.
And here in this point, I cannot paſſe without ſome reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
and honorable mention of the Quéenes moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie:
neither can anie man ſufficiently admire the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
and rare perfections of her Highneſſe heroicall minde;
by whoſe regall beneuolence &amp; bountie, full many are made
happie, whoſe great mercie, abundant naturall clemencie, &amp;
vnſpeakable lenitie (euen towards her greateſt enemies) do
merit immortal memorie. And if I ſhuld particularly ſpeak
of her Maieſties mightie Friendſhip to forreine Princes: if
I ſhould declare her gracious inclination and readineſſe in
aiding the oppreſſed: if I ſhould ſhewe her godlie zeale in
planting the Goſpell: and to be ſhort, if I could but in the
leaſt part expreſſe her princely care, pitie, and pietie towards
her owne people and countrey, it woulde ſéeme ſuch, and ſo
great, that it might well make all other Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates
rather amazed to heare it, than apt to imitate it.
What ſubiect would not ſhew himſelfe as faithfull as <hi>Zopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus?</hi>
What Courtier would not contend to be as conſtant
as <hi>Curtius?</hi> What Noble man would not offer both life and
ſeruice, as farre foorth as King <hi>Codrus</hi> to the good of ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a Gouerneſſe?</p>
            <p>Wherefore, if Friendſhip were thus imbraced in the
<pb facs="tcp:5677:6"/>
Court, there ſhould be no <hi>Gnatho</hi> ſo often with filed tongue
flattering, nor <hi>Thraſo</hi> ſo commonly with brazen face brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:
nor <hi>Davus</hi> ſo continually with double heart diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
Currifauourers and clawbackes, ſhould be contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as irkſome and perillous: Sicophants and Shifters,
ſhould be pronounced as execrable &amp; odious: Paraſites and
platter-friends, ſhould be proclaimed as peſtilent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious.</p>
            <p>In like manner in the Citie, if they would whip out the
ſpaniels that will fawne when they are emptie, and beat out
the dogges that will bite when they are full, and feare away
the crowes that will eate vp quicke bodies, and flap out the
flies that will ſting <hi>Alexander,</hi> and ridde themſelues of the
Friers fleas that are bred in euerie corner; then ſhould they
not haue ſo manie wilful murthers to moleſt them in the day,
nor ſo manie ſecret robberies to diſquiet them in the night:
then ſhould not our hearts be ſo much heated with hatred &amp;
ſpitefulneſſe, nor our tongues ſo tipped with taunts and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes,
nor our déeds ſo diſtained with miſchiefe and nough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe:
then ſhould reaſon rule onely in the head, &amp; treaſon
ſhould be trodd vtterly vnderfoote: then ſhould Cities bee
gouerned peaceably, and people in all places liue proſperouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie:
which God grant continually.</p>
            <p>SO neceſſarie, great &amp; infinit are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities of <hi>Frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi>
that they ſeeme to take the Sunne out of the world,
which would remooue <hi>Friendſhip</hi> from amongſt vs: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the which, nothing is ſo well ſtaid, but it may bee ſoone
deſtroyed, nothing ſo ſtrong but it may eaſely be beaten
downe, nothing ſo firmly ſettled but it may be vtterly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted:
yea without <hi>Friendſhip</hi> no houſe can be wel guided,
no Citie well gouerned, no Countrey ſafe preſerued, no
State long continued, no nor anie thing in the vſe of man
rightly ordered. It is ſo conuenient for the Court, and ſo fit
for the Countrey; it is ſuch a treaſure abroad in the warres,
and ſuch an ornament to the Citie in time of peace; that as
<pb facs="tcp:5677:6"/>
               <hi>Tully</hi> teſtifieth, there is no gift giuen of God to man (Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
only excepted) more agreeable to nature, more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the heart, more pleaſant to the minde, or more profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to a Publique weale: although ſome rather regard ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
other more eſteeme health, manie chieflie preferre ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
moſt of all vainely delight pleaſure: but yet neither
the vſe of riches, nor the worſhip of wealth, nor the praiſe of
honour, nor the delight of pleſure, nor the happines of health,
may bee compared with <hi>Friendſhip:</hi> for which way ſoeuer
thou takeſt, it turneth with thee: if thou goe forward, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth
thee: if thou call, it is at hand: if thou looke for it, it is
linked vnto thee: in no place is it excluded, at no time out of
ſeaſon, in no cauſe troubleſome: wherefore it may be well
ſaid, that wee vſe neither water, nor fire, nor earth, nor aire,
in more places than we doo <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> It maketh proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
to ſhine moſt glorious, and cauſeth aduerſitie to ſeeme
nothing grieuous. It ſuffereth neither the heart to be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
nor the courage in any caſe quailed: wherefore being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
yet are they preſent: being needie, they haue inough:
being poore, they haue plentie: being weake, are ſtrong: yea
and I had almoſt ſaid that which is more ſtrange, being dead
are aliue: inſomuch, that the death of the one ſeemeth bleſſed,
and the life of the other nothing blemiſhed, ſo great is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
ſo gracious the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance, ſo godly the zeal that is bred
in Friends one toward another. He y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> loketh vpon his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Friend, doth behold a perfect patterne of his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
being as it were an <hi>Alter ego,</hi> that is another himſelfe.
What was it that cauſed <hi>Phocion</hi> to ſay, he neuer denied any
thing to his faithfull friend <hi>Nicocles,</hi> was it not <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>
What was it that vrged <hi>Damon</hi> to yeelde himſelfe a pledge
for the life of his companion <hi>Pithias,</hi> was it not <hi>Friendſhip?</hi>
What was it that mooued <hi>Titus</hi> to come downe from the
Bench of authoritie, and accuſe himſelfe to acquite <hi>Giſippus</hi>
from miſerie, was it not <hi>Friendſhip?</hi> What was it that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed
<hi>Pilades</hi> to preſent his owne perſon to ſaue the life of
<hi>Oreſtes,</hi> was it not <hi>Friendſhip?</hi> To be ſhort, what was the

reaſon that the two honourable <hi>Romanes, Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſo greatly loued: inſomuch that one houſe ſerued them
both, one face, one ioint ſtudie, one delight, one conſent
in all things: not onely in priuate affaires, but alſo in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
in trauailes, in voyages, in ſoiourning, at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
all were alike common: was not this a laudable kind
of <hi>Friendſhip?</hi> Yea, to make our ful period, (thogh <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips</hi>
praiſe be infinite) ſuch is the force therof, that mightie
Kings haue deſired it, it is ſo glorious: famous Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
haue honoured it, it is ſo ſpecious: cruell tyrants haue
been amazed at it, it is ſo victorious: al men in general haue
praiſed it, it is ſo precious: and yet few haue effectually at
any time attained vnto it, it is ſo miraculous.</p>
