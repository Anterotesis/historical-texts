            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A RELATION
Of the Riotous Inſurrection of divers Inhabitants of <hi>Enfield,</hi> and Places Adjacent; Humbly
offered to the Conſideration of the MEMBERS of <hi>PARLIAMENT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS <hi>Enfield Chaſe</hi> was inveſted in the Hands of the Truſtees, for ſale of Kings Lands, by this
<hi>Parliament;</hi> many Officers of the Army became Purchaſors thereof: And being at great Charge to
Hedge, Ditch, and Quick-ſet the ſaid Land; Some having Built, Plowed, and Sowed Corn (upon the
Firſt of <hi>June</hi> laſt) There was a great Riot committed by the rude People of <hi>Enfield,</hi> and places Adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,
who in a tumulteous way did pull down the Hedges, dig down the Ditches, deſtroyed the Quick-ſets, brought in
their Cattell in to the Incloſures, and ate off the ſtanding Corn, cut down Gates and Stiles; to the great Loſs and Damage
of the Purchaſors.</p>
            <p>This Riot being never ſuppreſſed, it hath continued ever ſince the ſaid Firſt of <hi>June,</hi> and daily there hath been more
or leſs Hurt done by theſe Rioters, who did often boaſt, They had Ten thouſand out of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and Ten thouſand out
of <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> that would come to their Aſſiſtance; Threatning to Cut, or Burn down the Houſes of the Purchaſors:
Whereupon there was four Files of Foot-Soldiers, with a Serjeant, ſent by Order, to Quarter at the Houſes, to ſecure the
Houſes, as their Quarters.</p>
            <p>Upon the Eleventh of this preſent <hi>July,</hi> came about Two hundred and fifty People in a Riotous way: Or rather in
way of an Inſurrection; Being Armed with Pitchforks, long Sythes, Axes, and long Poles: And drawing nigh to the
Quarters of the Soldiers, pitching their long Poles in the Ground, with Colours on the Top, and making great Shouts,
Declaring for <hi>CHARLES STEWART;</hi> Hereupon the Serjeant ſent two Soldiers in a peaceable way, to
ask them, What they intended? Theſe Barbarous Crue beat down theſe two Soldiers to the Ground, for Dead; One
of which recovering himſelf, ran back to the Serjeant, and Informing him what was done, and that his Fellow-ſoldier
was taken Priſoner: the Serjeant went with about Twelve, or Fourteen more to reaſon with them, about the Soldier
they kept Priſoner: Whereupon this Rude and Barbarous Multitude fell upon the Serjeant, and Soldiers, beat them
down for Dead, ſorely Wounded them, run the Serjeant through the Thigh with a Pitchfort, and ſo overcame them.</p>
            <p>But it ſo hapned, that one Soldier in Defence of his own Life, and his Fellows, ſhot a Country-man dead: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
they dragged theſe poor Wounded Men to <hi>Enfield,</hi> beat them about the Face, and uſed them as barbarouſly as ever
did the <hi>Iriſh Rebells</hi> any <hi>Engliſh Man:</hi> And Juſtice <hi>Rich</hi> living at <hi>Enfield,</hi> out of his Favour to theſe Inhumane Fellows,
ſent theſe Soldiers by <hi>Mittimus</hi> to <hi>Newgate,</hi> with their Wounds bleeding, without taking any Courſe at all to Suppreſs, or
Commit any that were in the Inſurrection, though the Serjeant, and many of the Soldiers were Mortally Wounded:
ſuch Juſtice we are like to receive from his Hands.</p>
            <p>Upon this Countenance received from the ſaid Juſtice, they upon the ſame Day did fall upon the Incloſures, ſet fire on
the Hedges, burnt up the Stack-wood, cut down a Barn, demoliſhed Houſes, brake, tore, cut, and burnt what ever they
could come at of the Purchaſors.</p>
            <p>And that which we conceive hath much encouraged theſe Rioters, is; That after they have committed ſuch Outrages,
they have the Confidence to come with their Petition to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and boaſt of their great Reception, ſaying; They
have more Friends in the <hi>Parliament,</hi> then we the Purchaſors: and in that we have made our Application to the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
and <hi>Councel of State,</hi> and could obtain no ſpeciall Order to ſuppreſs theſe Inſurrections, they take it for Grant, and
gave forth in Writing, and read in many Churches the laſt <hi>Sabboth-day,</hi> that the <hi>Parliament</hi> would not Aſſiſt us, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the ſale of the ſaid <hi>Chaſe:</hi> And ſo invited the People to this laſt Inſurrection. Wherefore We offer theſe <hi>Queries</hi> to
be Conſidered of:</p>
            <p>
               <label>I.</label> Whether the Alarum given by this Inſurrection may not Inflame the whole Nation; inaſmuch as it hath been ſuffered ſo long
to continue, untill it come to Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <label>II.</label> Whether it will not much diſ-engage the Army and Soldiers, that theſe Men for Defence of themſelves ſhould lye in <hi>Newgate,</hi>
and be Arraigned for their Lives, and the other go free, that before threatned to kill All the Soldiers.</p>
            <p>
               <label>III.</label> Whether it concerns not the <hi>Parliament</hi> to Impower ſome Perſons by Commiſsion, to go down to <hi>Enfield,</hi> to enquire into the
Matter, with Power to Impriſon all they can diſcover, untill further Courſe can be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <label>IV.</label> Whether Juſtice <hi>Rich</hi> be fit to be in Commiſsion for the Peace, that hath ſhewed ſo much Countenance to thoſe in the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
And Juſtice <hi>Huxley</hi> hath alwaies been very favourable to them, as we can prove.</p>
            <p>To conclude, All our Workmen are forced away, our Servants being in fear of their Lives forſake our Houſes, which
are left to the Mercy of the Flame, all our Corn deſtroyed. If we cannot have Protection, We are now reſolved to yield up
All to the Mercy of the Adverſary, and ſhall endeavour to truſt God, but ſhall no more look (in vain) for Help from
any ſort of Men.</p>
