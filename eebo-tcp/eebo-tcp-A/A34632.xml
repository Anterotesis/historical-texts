            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Why though this Antick new-vaump't Wit,</l>
                  <l>With no such vain design was writ,</l>
                  <l>That it should either Gallery, Box, or Pit:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Yet my renowned Author sayes,</l>

                  <l>Were writ i'th' Dutchess of——dayes.</l>

               <lg>

                  <l>The sleeping Lioness for waking)</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>And now that she has shot the Pit,</l>

               <l>To see this great Creation,</l>
               <l>The World would be but a dead Mass,</l>
               <l>And our advantages much less</l>
               <l>(Though the strange Fabrick well require it)</l>
               <l>In having no one to admire it.</l>
               <l>Again, as things to us are known</l>
               <l>But only by Comparison;</l>

So if unhappy men were none,</l>
               <l>Our happiness would be unknown;</l>
               <l>And for such benefits as these,</l>
               <l>In stead of giving me large Fees,</l>
               <l>At least great honour for reward,</l>
               <l>You crucifie me, which goes hard,</l>
               <l>That smart unto my feeling Sence</l>
               <l>Must be my Vertues recompence.</l>
               <l>But what! there are Adulterers,</l>
               <l>Murtherers, Robbers, Ravishers,</l>
               <l>Perhaps you'l argue amongst men:</l>
               <l>Why, if there are, I pray what then?</l>
               <l>Are there not amongst us the same,</l>
               <l>As void of honesty and shame;</l>
               <l>And yet for this we don't condemn</l>
               <l>The Heav'n and Earth that nourish't them.</l>
               <l>But you will adde perhaps this more,</l>
               <l>That we've more trouble than before,</l>
               <l>And are put to't to find supplies</l>
               <l>For many more necessities:</l>
               <l>Who ever heard, I know would fain,</l>
               <l>A Shepheard of his Flock complain</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:54617:16"/>
For fruitfulness, though they ean'd double,</l>
               <l>Because they help't him to more trouble?</l>
               <l>If painful 'tis, 'tis profitable,</l>
               <l>Nay pleasant too, and honorable;</l>
               <l>And this advantage brings with't too,</l>
               <l>It finds us something still to do;</l>
               <l>Whereas we otherwise should go</l>
               <l>With hands in pockets every day,</l>
               <l>And nothing have to do but play;</l>
               <l>Or swill and guttle every day</l>
               <l>With <hi>Nectar</hi> and <hi>Ambrosia.</hi>
               </l>

               <l>Of men, who least can be without 'um,</l>
               <l>And if they women meet do rout 'um,</l>
               <l>For the fine knacks they wear about 'um.</l>
               <l>And, though they keep this mighty puther,</l>
               <l>Do love them more than any other.</l>
               <l>Nay, and each day to thousand shapes</l>
               <l>Transform themselves to act their Rapes,</l>

But that they may stick longer to't,</l>

               <l>But some may say, that I had reason,</l>

He had through <hi>Venus</hi> water Gap</l>
               <l>Stuck a <hi>Bull's-feather</hi> in his Cap:</l>
               <l>Which long has made him eye, and watch him,</l>
               <l>Hoping to find a time to catch him.</l>
               <l>He to this purpose then had set</l>
               <l>About his <hi>Bed</hi> so rare a Net,</l>
               <l>Made of so small, but holding Wire,</l>
               <l>(Wherein his art we all admire)</l>
               <l>As without very special heed,</l>
               <l>Was hardly to be seen indeed;</l>
               <l>Which having unperceived laid,</l>

               </l>
               <l>And whips me into Bed to's wife,</l>

               <l>He beat (Oh never such a Drum!)</l>
               <l>A point of War upon her Bum.</l>
               <l>Now as they thus, with pleasing labour,</l>
               <l>Did jump and jigg to Pipe, and Tabour,</l>
               <l>Playing in consort, and time keeping:</l>

               <l>At which the <hi>God</hi> with smutty face,</l>
               <l>Starting, as if to run a Race,</l>
               <l>Throws down his Tools, sans more ado,</l>
               <l>And tript it with his Patten-shoo</l>
               <l>So nimbly, that to (make it short)</l>
               <l>He come's i'th' middle of their sport,</l>
               <l>And like a cunning old <hi>Trapanner,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Took the poor Lovers in <hi>the manner,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And there, as one would take a Lark,</l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Mars</hi> tardy-tane, at first did fret,</l>

And strongly did about him lay,</l>

               <l>When finding 'twas beyond his stress,</l>

               <l>But fair words <hi>Vulcan</hi> little heeded:</l>
               <l>He then to menaces proceeded,</l>

But I shall this dispute decide,</l>
               <l>I my own self will be your guide;</l>
               <l>For I remember well when <hi>Jove</hi>

               <l>Unto young <hi>Ganimede</hi> made love,</l>
               <l>I often on this Hill did light</l>
               <l>To see the little <hi>Favourite,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To bring him Plums, and Mackaroons,</l>
               <l>Which welcome are to such small Grooms,</l>
               <l>And when he carry'd him away,</l>
               <l>I flew about 'um all the way,</l>
               <l>To hold him up, and we must be</l>
               <l>Neer to the place; for now I see</l>
               <l>(Or I mistake) the very <hi>Rock</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Where he sate piping to his flock,</l>
               <l>When <hi>Jupiter</hi> in shape of Eagle,</l>
               <l>Came the young stripling to inveigle,</l>
               <l>And seizing him like any Sparrow,</l>
               <l>With his beak holding his <hi>Tiara</hi>
               </l>
               <l>To make him sure, as swift as <hi>Hobby</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He bare him into Heavens Lobby,</l>
               <l>Whilst the poor <hi>Boy,</hi> half dead with fear,</l>
               <l>Writh'd back to view his Spiriter,</l>

               <l>That fairest is without disputing.</l>
               <l>Besides (to speak the truth) my sight</l>

               <l>For which was which I ne're could tell,</l>
               <l>But seeing each with his half shell,</l>
               <l>His white horse, Javelin, and his Star,</l>
               <l>To me the same they alwayes were,</l>
               <l>And I, when I would seem well bred,</l>
               <l>Did still consound 'um, as I said:</l>
               <l>But since I'me so beholding to thee,</l>

               <l>(I think for to preserve the Breed)</l>
               <l>That one the Destinies should curtal,</l>

               <l>They, like two very loving Brothers,</l>
               <l>By an affection very rare,</l>
               <l>The good and ill alike would share.</l>
               <l>Thus when one dies, the other mourns,</l>

               <l>I doubt both you and I are weary,</l>
               <l>Else I should very much admire;</l>
               <l>Such trumpery a Dogg would tire.</l>
               <l>Yet in the precious Age we live in,</l>
               <l>Most people are so lewdly given,</l>
               <l>Course Hempen trash is sooner read,</l>
               <l>Than Poems of a finer thread.</l>
               <l>Which made our Author wisely choose</l>
               <l>To dizen up his dirty Muse</l>
               <l>In such an odd fantastick weed,</l>
               <l>As ev'ry one he knew would read.</l>
               <l>Yet is he wise enough to know</l>
               <l>His Muse however sings too low,</l>
               <l>(Though warbling in the newest fashion)</l>
               <l>To work a work of Reformation,</l>
               <l>And so writ this (to tell you true)</l>

               <l>Like others much of the same fashion,</l>
               <l>Which all have had your approbation;</l>
               <l>The Rhymer will so kindly take it,</l>
