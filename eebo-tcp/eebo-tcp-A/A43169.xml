            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THIS true Hiſtory of a late famous or infamous <hi>Whore,</hi> laying open her cunning Contrivances. Intrigues, Cheats, Plots and Projects, either for pleaſure or profit, is made publick to no other end then to the Reformation of <hi>Vice,</hi> which is good mens wiſhes, and to the advancement of <hi>Vertue,</hi> which is the aim of all honeſt affections; ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my ſum juſt with mine account, I doubt not but I ſhall diſcharge my ſelf to Poſterity, and by one and the ſame Act give all encouragement to <hi>Chaſtity,</hi> and will not put <hi>Modeſty</hi> to the bluſh, though I ſtrip the <hi>Courtezan</hi> out of all her Finery, leaving her nakedly to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55016:5"/>to the view of all, to the perpetual infamie of debautched Women. They onely are the ſubjects of my preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, whom, though I ſhall ſevere and roughly handle, yet in their diſſection I will neither foul a finger of mine own, nor offend the eye, nor ear of any modeſt Perſon. Neither do I herein deſign any affront to the reſt of that lovely loving Sex; thoſe ſweet, whom, if beautiful, continent and vertuous, I ever honoured in my thoughts, whilſt my ſaucy arms, in ſpight of me, would be familiar with their Perſons. Miſtake me not, I mean not laſciviouſly, but lawfully; he that otherwiſe makes uſe of a Woman, abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes himſelf and her too, and by ſo doing differs not from a Beaſt, but in form, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſame bruitiſh appetites: Men abſolutely blind, and irrational, who having Wives of their own, whoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might diſpute for preheminence with the choiceſt in a whole City, whoſe prudence and diſcretion, by any fooliſh act, was never call'd in queſtion; whoſe love to her Children, fidelity to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and ſpotleſs honeſty, white as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence her ſelf, was a matchleſs Pattern to all her Neighborhood; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all theſe excellencies which are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55016:5"/>poſſeſſed by a brave woman of their own, they muſt ramble abroad, either inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding other mens rights, or hazarding their healths amongſt Proſtitutes, not regarding much the courſeneſs of the face, ſo the <hi>Crack</hi> does but humour him; and becauſe they grow ſo numerous of late, that they ſwarm in all places, (ſome making it a Trade, onely others a Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation) they will not ſtick to ſcruple the honeſty of the whole female Sex, and are ſo cenſorious to all, that they will not ſwear for the honeſty of their own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; a Maid cannot be ſo (they ſay) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eleven, and will juſtifie that a Woman will fee her Stallion well at fourſcore. Theſe are a ſort of Cattel, whom wiſe men look on as a ſhame to mankind, for their ingratitude to that Sex which was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in their Production, and tenderly careful of their Preſervation; and yet theſe <hi>Magi,</hi> theſe <hi>Miſanthropes,</hi> whilſt they accuſe them, are more too blame themſelves, not only in leſsning the real worth of that charming Piece of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, called Woman, but by throwing their unjuſt <hi>opprobriums</hi> on her, whilſt they ſtand indicted themſelves of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand errors, and unpardonable fopperies; and theſe are wont to ſay, (to magnifie
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55016:6"/>their own Prerogative) that Woman is an errour, or imperfection in Nature; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers imagine Woman to be born into the VVorld, onely for the exerciſe of Mans Patience, and trial of his Paſſions; others, for the affliction of Mankind, the Abridgement of his life, and the Diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuller of his Contentment, the Debaſer of his Grandeur, the Murdreſs of his Valour, the decay of Courage, the Ruine of his Advancement, and the Envy of his happineſs. She doubles his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, captivates his freedom, obſtructs all his noble Enterprizes, drowns his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, diſquiets his repoſe, and involves him daily in a thouſand inquietudes; Laſtly, ſhe is the Riſe of moſt quarrels, and the chief Incendiary of miſchief and diſſention.</p>
            <p>It is incongruous to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to vindicate them at this time from theſe aſperſions; onely this I ſhall ſay, that doubtleſly there are good VVomen in the VVorld, but they are ſo few, by reaſon of the ſpreading Contagion of their vicious inclinations, that thereby ſome are are induced to believe, that it is onely a ſuppoſed goodneſs, and as imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary as a Circle in the Firmament. Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging pardon for this digreſſion, I ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55016:6"/>leave the good and bad promiſcuouſly one amongſt the other; onely pick one out of the Flock (a ſcabbed ſheep) whom I ſhall anatomize, or cut in pieces, for the benefit of ſuch, who will take the pains to read a Lecture on her Carcaſs.</p>
            <p>In <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lſter</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> there lived an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman, whom ſome misfortunes in his Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, had driven thither to ſeek ſome ſhelter from the injury that did attend him. Here he had not lived long, ere his own induſtry (improving that little he had) and ſymmetry of Parts, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him (with a handſom woman) a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune not mean, and inconſiderable; ſhe was all <hi>Iriſh;</hi> for, her Relations out of a natural antipathy to their Conquerors, would never ſuffer any of their Family to commix, or Match with any of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Extraction; yet ſuch was the Power of Love, that it broke down all oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that were rais'd againſt it; nay, her Religion (which ſhe ſhould have prized above every thing that is ſublunary) ſhe ſlighted for the ſake of love, and became a Proteſtant, becauſe her Husband (ſo intended) was of that Perſuaſion.</p>

            <p>Every day, nay, every hour offered them an occaſion to diſcourſe, for he lived in this Ladies houſe in the nature of a Chaplain, not to read Common-Prayer to her, that was an abomination to this Lady-Saint, but to ſay Grace, till the Gueſts in their hearts curſed him, for letting the meat be cold; and to pray at night the whole Family aſleep; this was a precious man in the eye of the Lady, though not of the Knight; for ſhe loved him for the workings of the Spirit, and he hated him therefore; and becauſe he would be even with his Lady, this Knight had had ſome Conference with <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and being an honeſt blunt Gentleman, he went not about to preach her into a Compliance, with a tedious ſtory of I-know-not-what, but told her his meaning in plain <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and to that end told her, that very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily he would invent a way to effect his deſign, but did not acquaint her in what manner he would do it; One day, when his Lady and <hi>Cornelia</hi> took Coach to take benefit of the Air he took the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Cornelia</hi> had compleated to lye together, and that ſhe might not be interrupted by her Lady (who frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did call her unto her at midnight, when ſhe ail'd any thing; and for that purpoſe that ſhe might be within call ſhe lodg'd her the very next Chamber to hers) I ſay, to prevent interruption, told <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that ſhe would feign an indiſpoſition up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her return from taking the Aire, and ſo ſhe ſhould have the priviledge of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bed betimes, and he of coming the ſooner unto her.</p>
            <p>This double plot took not its deſired effects; for the Knight cauſed his Lady to go to bed with him, an hour and a half ſooner than they were wont, and that he might lull her to ſleep the ſooner, he gave her in a glaſs of wine, a very ſmal quantity of Opium, which ſo ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wrought upon her, that as ſhe was as deſirous as himſelf to go to bed, ſo ſhe ſoon fell aſleep; the Knight, by her ſnoring finding that ſhe was faſt enough
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:55016:20"/>ſtole out of bed, and being in haſte, forgot to ſhut his own door, being ſo eager to open <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s, which he did without making the leaſt noiſe.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his ſhirt forſook his own bed, to enjoy of that of <hi>Cornelia;</hi> but miſchief on't, as he was groaping in the dark he found a door o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and entring love, though blind, and he in obſcurity, ſoon directed him to the bed, and quickly found the way into it; but expected not to find <hi>Cornelia</hi> in that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs poſture, as if ſhe valued not the loſs of a thing ſhe ſeem'd ſo highly to eſteem, being troubled to find her aſleep, he pulld her by the arm again and again, but could not awake her; tried to wake her by kiſſes; and now the vertue of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium was evaporated, ſo that waking ſhe ſpake ſomewhat angerly, ſaying, prithee, whats the matter, Dear, that thou wilt not let me ſleep quietly? indeed you were a naughty man to wake me. What's this, ſaid <hi>Ignatius?</hi> Why, ſure my <hi>Cornelia</hi> is not diſtracted; Is not this the night you appointed me, wherein we ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence our happineſs?</p>
            <p>The Lady, not knowing what to ſay or think, cryed out, Lord Husband, what's the matter you talk after this manner?
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:55016:20"/>this is enough alone to create a jealouſy in me: Why ſhould you talk thus of <hi>Cornelia;</hi> I am your wife, whom legally you are bound to love, and have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd hitherto that love you owe me.</p>
            <p>It is true, ſaid he, and deareſt Madam grant me your pardon, and I'le confeſs the truth. I have injured that love you hitherto have ſhown me, by affecting any other but your ſelf, and therein I have blackned my Conſcience blacker than that Hypocriticall coat I uſe to wear, by breaking thoſe many thouſand promiſes I made you to be faithful: I am <hi>Ignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and this night I ſhould have enjoyed by agreement <hi>Cornelia,</hi> but I find I miſtook her Chamber.</p>
            <p>This diſcovery ſo nettled the Lady, that ſhe knew not what to ſay or doe, to find her friend falſe, could not but trouble her; but to think what was become of her husband troubled her more; not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to conclude on, ſhe in a rage bid him be gone and ſee her face no more, ſo ſeeing that there was no remedy, he was even content to ſneak away to his own Chamber; being gone, the Lady a roſe and lockt her Chamber door; and going to bed again, her thoughts were ſeriouſly employed about her husband, that he was gone a Catter-Wouling, ſhe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:55016:21"/>queſtion'd not; neither did ſhe doubt he was gone to any other perſon but <hi>Cornelia,</hi> but whether to ſtay within her own Chamber and wait her husbands re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or in a rage go to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge her ſelf on the Whore her ſervant, and the Adulterer her husband, ſhe could not preſently determine: Whilſt ſhe was in this conſultation, her husband came to the door, but finding it ſhut, he was at his wits ends; for now he knew he was diſcovered, and it was but a folly to go about to palliate his crime, ſince it was ſo palpable, wherefore he knockt at the door, his Lady within, as ſeemingly not knowing who was without, ask't, who was there. By reaſon of the coldneſs of the night, and the thinneſs of his cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (being in his ſhirt) his teeth ſo chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, that he could not in the return of his anſwer be underſtood. The Lady knew well enough who it was, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to puniſh his Concupiſcence, ſhe thought it requiſit to let him ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and inſtead of a ſheet, make him do pennance in his own ſhirt. Prithee, deareſt wife, ſaid he let me in, am half ſtarv'd with cold. What ſaucy Jack is that, ſaid ſhe that calls me wife there, what bold impudent Scoundrell; my

            <p>The Lady could be no longer cruell, and fearing what dammage her husband might ſuſtain, ſhe aroſe and let him in; but poor Gentleman his condition was but little better'd; for he did but leap, as I may ſay, out of a cold grave into a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; heated by a womans flaming paſſion. I ſhall not trouble you with thoſe bitter taunts, and ſharp invectives, ſhe then uttered, you may imagine they were not a few. There is nothing more certainly diſcovers the perpetuall notion in a womans tongue, than her jealouſy or the knowledge of her husband's infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In ſhort he endeavoured to leſſon his own error, by telling her of hers; which he ſaid he ſhould in a little time have told her to ſome purpoſe, whither this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:55016:22"/>accident had hapned or no; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſiring her ſilence, and requeſting a pardon on both ſides, for each others in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, with proteſtations never to do the like, and promiſes the next day to remove thoſe perſons who had occaſoned all this diſorder, in their family affections they ſeald the bargain,—which made them the more deſirous of their natural reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ignatius,</hi> that precious, deforming, Non-conforming, diſſembling Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſlept not, nor could he cloſe his eyes that whole night, his thoughts were ſo buſied about this ſtrange adventure; and whilſt he was ready to tare his fleſh for very vexation, to think how he had irrecoverably loſt that fair opportunity, of enjoying the fair <hi>Cornelia;</hi> when he conſidered how highly he had diſobli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Lady Miſs, who loved him but too well, and cheriſht him too much, he was then deſperatly reſolved to hang himſelf. Whilſt thus ruminating his misfortune, a ſervant came and told him that he muſt riſe immediatly, and come to his Maſter; this ſtarted <hi>Ignatius,</hi> and the fear of what the event of this meſſage might be, put him upon a hundred projects, and guilt would have wing'd him for a flight, had not a little remaining reaſon prompted
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:55016:22"/>him to ſtay; whereupon dreſſing himſelf, not without a univerſal trepidation, he appear'd before the Knight, who taking him aſide, in few words told him that he was an ungreateful Raskal, to repay thoſe kindneſſes he had received, by debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and abuſing his wife, that were it not more in reſpect of kindneſs to himſelf, than mercy to him, he would cut his Throat; however he told him, he ſhould not eſcape circumciſing, ſince he believed he would make a better <hi>Jew</hi> than a Chriſtian; and immediately hereupon he ſtept within him, and with that dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty threw him on his back, that the others Amazedneſs, by this ſuddain ſurprize, gave the Knight time enough to draw a Razor, with which he did cut off his Fore-skin. But this was not all his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was immediately turn'd out of doors, with menaces to this purpoſe, that if ever he revealed what he had done, and who it was that dealt with him thus, and the cauſe wherefore; he ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly dye for it, whereever he met him.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Knight was thus ſeverely handling the Man; the Miſtreſs was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to task her woman, who had not the patience to capitulate with her, who

Hold, hold, (quoth <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi>) give me leave to call her by that feigned name, ſince what is proper to her ſhe may be aſham'd to own. Doth not your Maſter know whither you are gone? He loves you without doubt, and how ſhall he extend his love if he be ignorant of your abode? He muſt be therefore acquainted therewith, and that very privately for fear of diſcovery; let me ſee—I think I had beſt to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the work, as being long enough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55016:24"/>in ſuch affairs; but d' ye hear me, quoth this Reverend Matron (whom <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſuſpected not to be, what ſhe ſoon found ſhe was, and was therefore at firſt troubled at her coming thither) I ſay, quoth ſhe, you muſt be ruled by me if I undertake your buſineſs; you are very yong, and want wholeſom inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, you ſhall not want it as long as you are under my roof: the greatneſs of your beauty may be the ruine, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the riſe, of your fortunes, if it be not Houſe-wiv'd to the beſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polyandria</hi> was informed by <hi>Cornelia,</hi> that the Knight did frequently drink, when he was in the City, at the <hi>Clobe</hi> near the Caſtle, and in the Suburbs at the <hi>Nags-Head</hi> in <hi>Oxman</hi>-town; this was Intelligence ſufficient for her pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for going to the firſt, ſhe found him alone, expecting company to come to him: glad of this opportnnity, ſhe gave him to underſtand, that there was an ancient Gentlewoman below would ſpeak with him; he wondring who it ſhould be, in haſte comes to her; and ſhe (to free him quickly from that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement he was involved in at the fight of this veterane female ſtranger)
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:55016:24"/>took him aſide, and whiſpering ſaid, <hi>Sir, it is neceſſary I he ſhort in a buſineſs of this nature;</hi> Cornelia <hi>lies at ſuch an houſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhe languiſhes for none but you, and none but you can give her eaſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Knight, like a man tranſported, was ready for joy to have hugg'd the old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron for her welcome Meſſage; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how inconvenient it was to talk ſo publickly, he diſmiſs'd her, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to be there as ſoon as ſhe, and he was as good as his word, for he left his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany immediately, for, though a ſhort, yet more raviſhing enjoyment.</p>
            <p>Love ſoon conveyed him to the place where <hi>Cornelia</hi> lay, and was there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by her, not as a looſe Proſtitute does her Lecher, but as a deluded Maid does her long abſent Lover, with ſilence, ſighs and bluſhes; whereas he, raptur'd at the fight of her he now ſo dearly lov'd, made all the outward demonſtrations of vigorous and ſincere affection; <hi>Polyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> minded every paſſage and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and was no leſs joyful then they, in that ſhe could by what ſhe ſaw, promiſe her ſelf no ſmall advantage.</p>
            <p>As an earneſt penny of this Knights af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he firſt gave <hi>Cornelia</hi> twenty Guinny's, and then promis'd <hi>Polyandria</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55016:25"/>that he would pay for her Diet, Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what other Neceſſaries ſhe wanted; for ſuch fair Promiſes as theſe <hi>Polyandria</hi> thought her ſelf obliged to withdraw, and leave them alone, which the Knight interpreting to his beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, made uſe of that time to renew his former enjoyment, and to aſſure his Miſs, that her conſtancy ſhould be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified with ſuch an annuity as ſhould Gentilely maintain her, but it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert if ever ſhe admitted a Competitor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> left behind her all her Gowns but what ſhe then wore, and carried off only ſome of her beſt linnen, and ſome Jewels ſhe had given her by ſome that had hopes to have tempted her that way, which had ſhe ſtayd, undoubtedly had taken effect. Being thus but thinly, though finely, garb'd; the good old Gentlewoman that took upon her to be her Tutoreſs, thought fit to put her into a Garb, not only faſhionable, but rich and coſtly, as far as that mony would go: 'twas the firſt-fruits of the Knights ſecond enjoyment of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> who at his next coming, ſeeing her ſo good an Houſ-wife as to lay out her money in clothes, gave her as much more, which was diſpoſed of to make the ſplendid furniture of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55016:25"/>her delicate body exact and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.</p>
            <p>Frequent were the viſits of this Knight, and as he allow'd his Miſs an annual Penſion, ſo he beſtowed coſtly Preſents, of which contributions <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria</hi> would not be deny'd her Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dend. <hi>Cornelia</hi> obſerving this, and how her benefits were much empair'd by the avarice of this <hi>Strepo-grana,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to conſider, that ſhe had wit and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtanding enough to manage her own affairs, and needed not the auxiliary counſels and inſtructions of <hi>Polyandria,</hi> nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55016:26"/>her lucky ſtars, and bewitching eyes, might offer, notwithſtanding, her vows and proteſtations to her Knight made to the contrary, and the hazard of loſing her annual allowance. But leſt ſhe ſhould diſcover her deſign of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſhe demeaned her ſelf to <hi>Polyandria</hi> with ſuch a reſervedneſs, that might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be conſtrued an innate ſeverity, and reverence of her ſelf, derived from her fathers Gentile ſtrain (which indeed wholly makes a Gentleman, that ſhould live not according to the faſhion, but the vertuous mode of his Mind, and reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Vertue his only Nobility;) then any ſhy averſeneſs or indiſpoſition to her ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane Governeſs, that might at pleaſure over-rule her with bawdy experiences, and pocky <hi>Probatum</hi>'s. In whoſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (if you can believe that Crocodile tears may be limbeck'd into compaſſion) ſhe ſeem'd to have gain'd exceedingly.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding all which tenderneſs, ſet off with all the endearments her Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian thirty years practice, in the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of her Art, could ſuggeſt unto her. <hi>Cornelia</hi> kept within her ſelf, after a long conteſt, wherein ſhe plainly told her, it was ſufficient ſhe was largely recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced, for Diet, Lodging, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55016:26"/>and therefore told her it was unconſcionable to expect, beſides all theſe benefits, an Exciſe or Income from her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Exerciſe. She took up this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo firmely, that ſhe could not be won from her main ſtrength to wit, a purpoſe of reſerving her growing fortunes whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her ſelf. And herein the young Gentlewoman did (ſomething above her yeares) very prudently forecaſt what a ſlavery ſhe ſhould bring her ſelf to; if her Patroneſs once came to an abſolute Soveraignty over her affections, or by imperiouſneſs, or forcible inſinuation, make her ſelf Secretary of State to all her thoughts, which would have rendred her only a Cypher, and ſerve to multiply the incomes and revenues of her Guardian; a Rock upon which many featur'd and well formed females have ſplit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done themſelves for ever: For <hi>Argier</hi> ſlavery is not ſo intollerable, as the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and unconſcionable uſage of theſe Beldams. A Baudy-Houſe, or the Community of two or three Bauds, and their well affected people the Wenches, is as like our late Commonwealth as may be, where all ſhould ſhare alike, and the emoluments ſhould be equally univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtributed, but in effect it all comes
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55016:27"/>into private hands, no regard being had to thoſe that drudge for it, and ſweat not with their brows for their daily proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Juſt as <hi>Cornelia</hi> in a great meaſure had got the maſtery over her Miſtreſs, ſhe perceived ſhe was with Child, which ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much diſordered her thoughts, and was the occaſion of her ſuddain Penſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Melancholy. <hi>Polyandria</hi> taking more than ordinary notice thereof, was very inquiſitive to know the cauſe; but <hi>Cornelia,</hi> thinking it might tend to her prejudice, conceal'd it as long as ſhe could; but in a little time it diſcovered it ſelf, by various ſymptoms and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; this Venerable Matron perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſe of her unwonted ſadneſs, came one day to her with a countenance more Cheerful than uſuall and ſaid, Come Daughter, be not thus troubled in your thoughts the grief that thus internally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts you will in a ſhort time be in your arms, and then all will be well again, in the mean time, be of good cheer, the father is able to maintain the Bantling, and we will make him pay dearly for the pains he ſhall put you to, in bringing his ſtolne delights into the world.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> was now conſtrein'd to tell
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55016:27"/>the truth, confeſſing ſhe was with child, and had concealed it ſome ten weeks: that, that was indiſcretion, quoth the Mother, this ſhould have been revealed ſooner; however, it is well enough, the father ſhall know of it at his next come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as ſhe ſpake the word, in came the Knight, who had formerly taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s melancholy, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely check't her for't, and now find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in the ſame moody poſture, blam'd her as before.</p>
            <p>This gave <hi>Polyandria</hi> occaſion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe him after this manner, <hi>Sir, I am not ignorant of what familiarity hath paſt between you, before ſhe came to my houſe and ſince; and it is no wonder, if a Perſon ſo young, plump and tender as ſhe is, meet with a Perſon like your ſelf, middle-aged, ſtrong and luſty, ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive with child, ſince there have been made ſo many endeavors between you to that end and purpoſe. Now Sir, if ſhe be ſad and melancholy her eat, blame her not, ſince ſhe now fears a general Publication of her ſhame and infamy, and that her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation will be for ever ruin'd; beſides, having never tried man before you, and hearing how variable they are in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, ſhe is fearful after this you may deſert her.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:55016:28"/>
            <p>If that be all the cauſe of thy diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented countenance, ſaid he, be cheerfull and aſſure thy ſelf, <hi>Cornelia,</hi> prove but conſtant ſtill, and this will cauſe my love daily to increaſe; and to divert her, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd her with pleaſant diſcourſe, careſſed her Affectionately, treated her in her own Chamber moſt ſumptuouſly, and taking his leave of her, left her Fifty broad pieces, till his return, for he was going into the County of <hi>Tipperary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his abſence, <hi>Polyandria</hi> conſulted nothing more than where and how ſhe ſhould lye in, what coſtly things to be bought, and where the Child ſhould be Nurſt, and all with the greateſt privacy. For her delivery ſhe judgd her own houſe as convenient as any other, but that ſhe muſt then pretend that ſhe is a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman whoſe husband is gone for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> about ſome urgent affair, and that would ſpoil her deſign after ſhe was brought to bed, for ſhe intended that ſhe ſhould paſs for a Maid, till ſhe was detected to the contrary, wherefore ſhe pitch'd upon an obſcure place, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with the people, (payin'g down twenty pounds ready money) they ſhould keep the Child, and never more return it to the Parent; this they gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55016:28"/>yielded to, ſince they nor their frye-fathers never ſaw ſuch a ſum of <hi>Arraget Saffenagh (Engliſh</hi> money) before in their life-time.</p>
            <p>The time of Child-bearing drawing on, the Knight was conſulted about the charge, how neceſſary it was for her to remove into the Countrey, how expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive her lying in would be, having been ſo tenderly and Gentilely educated, and that it would be altogether expedient, to provide for the Child for his life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; and leſt any thing ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry by negligence, or for want of prudent management ſhe would accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and ſtay with her till her up-riſing, though it would conſiderably prejudice her buſineſs at home, ſince ſhe muſt leave all to the guidance of her ſervants, and ſo ſhe might without any great damage, for as yet ſhe kept no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick houſe, having lived but a little while in that place, having furniſhed her houſe very gallantly for the entertainment of Lodgers to begin with.</p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>Items</hi> for charge of one ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng in, made the Knight ſcratch where it did not itch; but ſeeing there was a neceſſity that things muſt be carried privately and that the way propounded
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55016:29"/>could not but be very chargeable, he ordered them two hundred pounds, to defray all expences, a great part whereof <hi>Cornelia,</hi> notwithſtanding her former conqueſt, could not keep from <hi>Polyandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being ſafely delivered, and ſecretly too, without prejudice to her honor, they return'd with triumph to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where burroughing again, <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But part of her hopes were quickly daſh't, by the diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Knights viſits, which were not ſo frequent as formerly, more cold or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and not half ſo beneficial. It ſeems he was cloyd with this delicate bit, (ſweeteſt meats are moſt ſubject to ſurfeit) and was wearied with his annual charge, and diurnal expences, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his life to be ſo vext and diſcontented, that he ſaw there was no remedy for his grief but a poſitive reſolution to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:55016:29"/>this Lady Errant, and be content with his domeſtick Recreations, and that he might have a pretext to acquit himſelf of his Obligation, to allow his Miſs a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable annuity in caſe of conſtancy, he charg'd her one day (ſeemingly in a great rage and paſſion) with diſloialty, and breach of promiſe, and as in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, he became diſcourteous, and uncivil, ſo his actions were rude and boiſterous; in ſo much that Mother-Damuable was forced to flye for it, to ſave her a ſound kicking, whilſt he in the mean time compel'd very unhandſomely <hi>Cornelia</hi> to deliver up to him a paper, he had ſign'd for the payment of the annui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aforeſaid, and going down the ſtairs, he vow'd he would never ſee her more.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Cornelia</hi> was ſo amazed at this ſudden cauſeleſs change, that ſhe was in a manner ſenſeleſs, and ſeem'd to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a well-fram'd white marble Statue, and as that moody ſtone drops tears ſometimes, when Heaven ſeems to look angrily, ſo ſhe for the loſs of that for which ſhe had an equal eſtimation, had her eyes delug'd in tears, whilſt her heart O're-charg'd with ſighs, threatned a breaking every minute.

            <p>Silence again Proclaim'd, <hi>Polyandria</hi> undertook to ſpeak to this purpoſe, (ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral circumſtances I ſhall omit for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake) that whereas her daughter <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi> ſervant to a Knight, had been got with child by him, and that having given her but a ſmall recompence for all her pains, only providing for the Child for life, and allotting her an inconſiderable ſum of about 200 li. ſhe thought it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to make him ſenſible of his nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly unworthineſs, by forcing him to a more liberal contribution. To this end (ſaid ſhe) here is a daughter of ours that broke her leg, much about the time mine broke hers; ſhe muſt be the Inſtrument to do my buſineſs, by carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own child to the Knight, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be Nurſe to <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received nothing of her promis'd Salary, let her threaten to leave the Child at his Gate; and that his Lady ſhould not ſuſpect any thing, this Woman was ordered to wait near the houſe with <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> to ſhew her which was the man. In leſs then four houres ſhe ſpake with the Knight, and ſo cunningly carried the buſineſs, that he verily believed all ſhe ſaid to be true; and that he might not raiſe the leaſtſuſpicion in his Lady's breaſt
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55016:32"/>that he kept a Baſtard; and to be ſure for the future of not being ſerved ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he appointed her to meet him at <hi>Kilmanam</hi> a mile out of the City, the next day, where he would endeavour to make her ſatisfaction; Mrs. <hi>Craftsby</hi> you may be ſure was punctually there at the time appointed neither was <hi>Polyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> far off from her; the Knight came accordingly with ſome friends he durſt truſt, who after they had bandied the buſineſs to and fro, it was concluded, that ſhe ſhould have an hundred pounds to take him off clearly from keeping the child, with this <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would enter into Bond for Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Agreement: I Sir, ſaid ſhe, with all my heart, I will ſend for him; and going out ſeemingly for a Meſſenger, ſhe ſtept to <hi>Polyandria,</hi> and told her what was required, and therefore told her ſhe muſt immediately go into Saint <hi>Francis</hi> ſtreet, and at ſuch a ſign lodg'd her Gallant, giving her Inſtructions what to do, that is, to acknowledge her for his Wife, and enter into Bond upon the Premiſſes.</p>
            <p>This was done in an inſtant, and all things b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing concluded and agreed upon. <hi>Polyandria</hi> appeared, and told the Knight
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:55016:33"/>plainly, that though he had ſtopt the mouths of others, yet hers was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſtopt, and that if he did not open his purſe, ſhe would open her mouth ſo wide, that his Lady ſhould hear what would not tend neither to his quiet nor Reputation; and know Sir, this is a plot of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trving, and I have more of them, this is not your naturall Child, though a Baſtard, as well as yours. The Knight hearing this, made preſently diligent ſearch for the Cheating Nurſe, but ſhe was not to be found, for having received her money, the ſame Coach that brought her Gallant and <hi>Polyandria,</hi> carried her and her Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly back again; leaving this projecting Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron to ſhift for herſelf.</p>
            <p>You cannot imagine what a heat our Knight was in, he walkt up and down like a man bereft of his ſenſes, and ſometimes in his rage would offer to beat the old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman; but his friends hindred him from that as an act ignoble; not being able to uſe his hands, he was reſolved his tongue ſhould not be idle, which tumbled out nothing but the baſeſt expreſſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt with menaces; as that he would indite her for a Cheat, Baud, and what not; and that he would procure a riding in ſtate.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:55016:33"/>
            <p>To all theſe worſt of names, and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threats, <hi>Polyandria</hi> only laugh'd, and bid him do his worſt, adviſing him withal, to have a care how he farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked her, leſt in a very ſhort time he ſhould dearly repent of it.</p>
            <p>The Knight's friends obſerving the impudence and ſubtilty of this long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Matron, adviſed him by all means to make a ſpeedy end with her, cunningly inſtructing him to offer her ſo much money, on condition ſhe and her adopted daughter would ſign an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein they ſhould acknowledge that it was a Lye, and a meer invention of their own to get money, by cauſing <hi>Cornelia</hi> to lay a Baſtard to his charge, which was none of his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polyandria</hi> paus'd a while, and found that this was nothing but a meer trick of theirs, to make them acknowledge un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own Hands that they are Cheats, which would be a ſure evidence againſt them, and make them liable to the puniſhment of the Law; but conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering this would not injure them much if they had ſomthing under his hand to bear them harmleſs upon this confeſſion;

She had not been long among them (concealing what ſhe had received by this other project) before ſhe told them gravely and gratefully, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter deſerv'd a reward, and the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer her hire; to be ſhort, pretending buſineſs, ſaid ſhe it was my plot, therefore I will have fifty pound of the hundred; for Nurſes aſſiſtance, ſhe ſhall have twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pound, and the other twenty ſhall be divided equally amongſt you, for your counſel equally I ſay, that there may be no quarrel and diſſention among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of our ſacul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>This Propoſall was generally liked, and each taking her ſhare, as it was agreed upon, <hi>Polyandria</hi> took her leave of them, taking her precious charge with her. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:55016:35"/>with her ſelf to change her habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with all expedition, finding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many Inconveniences; as firſt the rooms lay too contiguous to each other, without winding Meanders, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of doors; no variety of Stair-caſes, and but one avenue to the houſe, which was the Fore-door, there were no Salli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports but one, and never a Poſtern for an eſcape, if need ſhould require. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe &amp; many other weighty Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions moved her to aſpeedy removall, but whether near the Court, into the City, or Country, ſhe could not well determine.</p>
            <p>She had a months mind to have tried an old Lord, but ſhe feared his ſtate was diminiſhed with his ſtrength, the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred her, and ſhe well knew the latter would never pleaſe her curious young <hi>Cornelia,</hi> whoſe Second Maiden-head ſhe would ſacrifice in an equall flame of youthfulneſs, where a large contribution and donations might ſupply and feed the fire.</p>
            <p>Such a Match, or a <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>-wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhe could eaſily, and in a ſhort time doubted not but to find in the City; to which place the old Gypſie was the more inclinable; for that ſhe had been ſo long, and ſo well verſed and inſight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

I was taken with a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den qualm, and thoſe ſits you know I have been lately troubled with and therefore be not offended but let me hear how matters go.</p>
            <p>Why. there is a young Gentleman, ſaith ſhe, that will be here to morrow, and therefore I would deſire you to cloath your face with your beſt looks, and wear again your Roſie Vermilion colour, for theſe Lillies in your cheeks will hardly admit thoſe bluſhes which your Virgin modeſty did wear, as ſnares for ſuch as this young <hi>Paris.</hi> For all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things I hope you are well enough provided; and I am loth you ſhould be beholden to Paint or Art, to ill uſtrate and grace your firſt view and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:

            <p>Such diſcourſe were for the moſt part the entertainment of <hi>Cornelia's</hi> ſecond loathed rurall life, who conſidering only to what her Mother and Tutoreſs (not bountifull Nature) had deſigned her, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her ſelf wholly to the <hi>Cyprian</hi>-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Cuſtoms.

            <p>But now the time was come, wherein ſhe was to be Manumitted from the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of her unſatisfied deſires, whoſe reſtleſs importunities had ſo long vexed her.</p>
            <p>Luſt is a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> and having once poiſon'd a member, never leaves ſpreading till the whole body be Confounded; ſhe hath now broken one Link in the Golden Chain of Chaſtity, and ſhe cares not if all the reſt be molten with confuſion; hence it comes that ſhe entertains more Devils, variety is pleaſant; one Ship yields ſmall cuſtome, great Navies ſill large Treaſures, and by this means ſhe thought her reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news would flow in ſuch full Tydes, that falſe Pleaſure made her believe there would never come an Ebbing.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:55016:42"/>
            <p>But to proceed, you may imagine this night was one of the longeſt ſhe ever yet counted, from the diſappointed aſſignation ſhe gave that puling precious Saint <hi>Igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> that was to preſent the morning and her Gallant together.</p>
            <p>As ſoon therefore as <hi>Aurora</hi> with her flattering ſmiles had ſaluted her windows, ſhe leapt out of bed, from the ſide of that Sepulchre (whoſe corrupt unſavory ſtench had tainted this ſweet morſel of fleſh) and before <hi>Polyandria</hi> had recovered her <hi>Crapula;</hi> and into the Garden ſhe went to ſacrifice unto <hi>Flora.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to appointment, and by that time, that uſefully ill piece of Antiquity had more then ſnackt to herſelf her cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary ſhare of Bob, and was upon her Trotters, A Gentleman and his Foot-Boy alighted at the door, and was ſo haſty of admitance, that <hi>Cornelia</hi> could ſcarce re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her Chamber, to attire her ſelf in her moſt ſplendid dreſs, of which ſhe had good ſtore of her late Gallants providing. In the entring, this Gentleman was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to walk in the Garden, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, Miſtreſs <hi>Cornelia</hi> ſhould wait upon him, which accordingly he did, and after half an hours ſpace, his fair unknown Miſtreſs entred, and with a winning, or

            <p>Having Admired and Complemented her with an elegant Addreſs, and ſaluted both mouth and hand, he began his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory Diſcourſ with his own raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, telling her, her Perfections ought not, nor could not, without extream bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, be medled with.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, that he intended himſelf a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to her, but his ambition was too high, and had failed him; for her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies had ſo captivated him, that he could be no other than her Slave; to which <hi>Cornelia</hi> was no way wanting for anſwer, nor did ſhe like other weak wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men diſſemble her ſentiments of his true praiſes, nor extenuate, much leſs, deny her beauty, but with a generous confidence told him, that he had taken ſome pains to extoll that which her own pride and her glaſs could flatter ſufficiently, that ſhe conceived the felicity of a Beauty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>She looked now to our enamour'd Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſo wantonly, as that he thought it was a <hi>Cupidian</hi> challenge, though ſhe left off without inferring; That uſe was that only, that gave the right value and eſteem to beauty; yet the imperiouſneſs of her eyes over-aw'd his liberty of queſtioning her meaning, or to entreat her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>This firſt ſmart Rencounter almoſt puzled the young Gentleman; for his intention was to marry a Fortune as well as a Face, and that brought him thither, but ſuch pertinent, home and uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced diſcourſe would put him off from any enquiry into her eſtate, and withal he might chance to marry Fortune <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliter;</hi> for ſuch a ſprightly Girl could not but be ſuſpitions.</p>
            <p>Neither could he handſomly retreat without ſome <hi>devoir,</hi> that might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued to a Love-viſit, and to render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his days Proceedings to <hi>Polyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria's</hi> Factors, (for you muſt know ſhe trotted, not ſo far to duſty it away only, but to ſettle a correſpondence, that might contribute aſſiſtance to her dangerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes) to attempt her, he conſidered it

            <p>Theſe Gallants kept a huge buzzing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Cornelia;</hi> and with a deal of ſoft courtſhip, by turns, did light on her lips, about which they wantoned off and on, till they were moſt damnably drunk with the juice that pearl'd on the brinks of them; nor did ſhe refuſe, or pettiſhly or unwillingly afford them the pleaſure,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55016:44"/>nor with any particular or kinder aſpect to one more than another, entertain their careſſes; whomſoever notwithſtanding her fancy did beſt and chiefeſt commend to her affection: only ſome greater and freer familiarity ſhe manifeſted to that Gentleman that invited her from her Country Lodging to <hi>Kilkenny,</hi> which ſhe might doe the better from their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed acquaintance, and <hi>Polyandria</hi> was obſerved to be very open hearted to that Perſon, between whom <hi>Cornelia</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid there was ſome compact and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that might tend to the foreſtalling of her market.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, the wine went mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily off, with a thouſand healths to Miſtreſs <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and her ſervant, and his happy fortunes extolled to the Sky, that had any intereſt in her breaſt, nothing but admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and ſuch like Hyperboles, from the one Youngſter to the other, vying who ſhould beſt and with moſt Rhetorick ſet off her excellencies and perfections.</p>

Every one fancied himſelf to be the Perſon whom ſhe would peculiarly admit for her ſervant, and was the rather loth to obtrude his reſpects upon her in publick before his Comerades, leaſt he ſhould offend her that was reſolved to ſerve them all.</p>
            <p>Now the Wine and her incomparable Beauty had intoxicated them all, ſo that from admiring and kiſſing they began to amend their Pace, and gave a more then decent liberty, while by ſtrugling ſhe diſengages her ſelf, and being free, cries, <hi>Fy, Gentlemen, are ye not aſham'd?</hi>

            <p>By this time <hi>Polyandria</hi> was laid a ſleep, in a great groaning Chair, and her Landlady out of pure kindneſs to bear her company, ſitting in another Chair next to her, ſnoar'd as bad as Hogs-Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Cornelia,</hi> as ſhe was young, credulous, and little experienced in the humours of men, ſo ſhe was deſirous above all things to be freed from the ſlavery ſhe groaned under of an inſufferable Governeſs, who never prompted the young one to enjoy herſelf, but when the Beldam did deſign to encreaſe her own profit by that means; this made <hi>Cornelia</hi> the more forward to expreſs a ſeeming conſent in the return of her thanks to this her Confident; his Comrades being acquainted with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of her Lodging, gain-ſay'd it not, bieng very well acquainted in the ſame houſe, by a conſtant converſe with their Lodger, contenting themſeives with fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

            <p>To omit all the lewd practices of this witty wanton <hi>Cornelia,</hi> which ſhe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in this Lodging, doe but caſt your eye back, and think what a wretched condition <hi>Polyandria</hi> was in when ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked, raving and tearing, like a She-Bear rob'd of her only Cub, and ingaged in a mortall fray with her Landlady whom ſhe charged with the Spiriting away this young <hi>White-Devil,</hi> beautiful <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and although ſhe denied it with many vows and proteſtations, yet this would not any ways qualifie the inraged paſſion of our furious Matron, nay, what ever ſhe alledg'd in her own defence was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectuall, that inſtead of leſsning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers anger, it rather added thereunto, ſo that ſince words would not doe, the feud
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:55016:47"/>grew to that height, that to't they went tooth and nail, ſo that it may be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured the diſpute was both ſharp and bloody, and might have prov'd fatal, but that the Myſtriſs of the houſe ſtept in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, and parted them, for that great love and eſteem ſhe ever had for their venerable occupation; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite their friendſhip, invited them to lie in her houſe that night, which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they did; and the next morning ſhe treated them very Gentilely during their little ſtay; for <hi>Polyandria,</hi> being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient for the loſs of her <hi>Cornelia,</hi> would not be detained from making all the ſpeedy enquiry ſhe could after her Daughter, who now was on the Ramble, and that ſhe might the better do it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd her Landlady, ſending her home, while ſhe hunts hotly through the Town in queſt of this out-lying Deer.</p>
            <p>All her pains, though ſhe was indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable in her ſearch, availed nothing; for <hi>Cornelia,</hi> fearing ſhe ſhould be diſcovered if ſhe ſtirr'd abroad, kept cloſe within, not only prompted thereunto by that which ſhe enjoy'd, but more encouraged thereunto by large Preſents, liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon her, conditionally for ſome time ſhe would ſtay within. For ſome

            </p>
            <p>The Gentleman overjoy'd to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much her Favourite beyond the reſt, expreſs'd in his face and geſtures all the ſymptoms of the greateſt ſatisfaction;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55016:48"/>and being eager to put her Propoſals in practice, trifled away no time in vain and empty Complements, but taking his leave of her, aſſured her he would return imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and gratifie her expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim, Polyandria</hi> hearing where her beloved Daughter was, come in ſuch haſte, that her over-heated moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture had laid her Waſte-coat under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So furious was her Knock at door, that <hi>Cornelia</hi> and her Gallants were very much ſtartled at it; ſhe knowing her ſelf to be principally concern'd, peeps out at window, and ſeeing that it was the good Gentlewoman her Mother, that had thus put them into a fright, ſhe whipt down ſtairs, and before the Maid could get to the door to open it, <hi>Cornelia</hi> met her, and charging her to deny that ſhe was within, but that ſhe would be within by and by, ſhe ſlipt into the Garden, through which there was a paſſage out into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and withal enjoyn'd the Maid to tell that Gentleman that was gone to contrive a way for her eſcape, that ſhe attended him in the Garden.</p>
            <p>Whilſt <hi>Polyandria</hi> was longingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the return of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man entring the houſe, was inform'd
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:55016:48"/>where <hi>Cornelia</hi> was, who haſtning to her, immediately convey'd her through the Garden-door to an Inn where his Horſe ſtood, and having with more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expedition provided Neceſſaries for their journey mounted and directed their courſe for <hi>Dublin,</hi> leaving the reſt of the Gallants behind, with the aged and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Matron, to procure them other Neceſſaries to ſupply the place of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Coming to <hi>Dublin,</hi> they for the preſent ſetled themſelves in St. <hi>Francis</hi>-ſtreet, where this Gallant briskly proſecuted his buſineſs as long as his money laſted; but finding his amorous Appetite ſatiated, and his ſtock waſted, he gave her the liberty to be a free Trader, which indeed he could not help, for in that ſmall time they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed together, ſhe had privately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a conſiderable acquaintance, which very much advanc'd her intereſt both in money and apparel.</p>
            <p>How to work with her hands ſhe knew not, yet was well acquainted with the way to the Theatre, the Rendezvouz of Gallants of both Sexes, and the Place of amorous Intrigues; there ſhe knew how to plant her ſelf to the beſt advantage, and how to pick and chuſe the ſelf admiring
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55016:49"/>Fops; Having firſt conſulted her Glaſs, with the help of Art, to make her appear as lovely as was poſſible; but certainly, that Beauty is moſt perfect where the Face graceth the Apparel, and not the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel the Face, for none will deny, that the Truth of Nature exceeds the falſhood of all Artificial Beauty; ſo incomparable was hers, that through the natural white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſmoothneſs of her Front, Neck, and plump Breaſts, a man might with wonderful delight perceive the azure of her Veins, circling about in their ſeveral Meanders; the ſplendor of her eyes made her Beholders dim-ſighted, their radiant influence being ſo ſtrong and penetrating; and to compleat her excellency, the rare ſymmetry of every part of her body was ſo charming and magnetical, that it was impoſſible to look on and not be attracted to her.</p>
            <p>As Play-Houſes were her Chappels of Eaſe, ſo ſhe had ſeveral publike Walks, in which ſhe ſubtly contrived a way to make her ſelf known; nor did ſhe refuſe to be courted and treated by the Gallants that frequented thoſe places, provided they were the more noble and civiler ſort of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous Combatants. <hi>Rings-End</hi> ſhe had little reaſon to ſlight, by reaſon of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55016:49"/>of the Air, and Proſpect into the Ocean; nor could ſhe think her time ill ſpent in a Coach, for a miles riding thither over the Strand, if for nothing elſe then for thoſe delicate large Pole-beg Oiſters, which are there plentifully to be had, ſo large an overgrown mouth would hardly contain the moiety of one of them; nor could ſhe chooſe, but now and then for variety, reſort to <hi>Chappel-Izard,</hi> or to <hi>Santry,</hi> (In-land Towns not far remote.) None ever enjoy'd her company once, but they were impatient till they were in it again; for to gain her ſelf eſteem and credit, ſhe ſhewed her ſelf (ſeemingly) modeſt, yet very merry and facetious; and to ſay the truth, Wit ſhe had rather too much, by which ſhe gain'd an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power over her Lovers Perſons and Purſes.</p>
            <p>In this unchaſte progreſs ſhe took an eſſay or taſte of all degrees, profeſſions and conditions, from the Noble to the Gentile, from the Camp to the City, her Fars had heard all Languages that were charming, her Purſe had received all Coins that were tempting, and had not her For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune been ever more favourable then her affections a her body had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded.</p>

            <p>Whilſt <hi>Cornelia</hi> was endeavouring to work her ſelf into a general eſteem, (as ſhe had in a little time indifferently well done it) and had thereby collected a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſum together, <hi>Polyandria</hi> found her out, which raiſed a different paſſion in them both, for the one could not be ſo glad as the other was ſorrowful, the one having found the ſtaffe of her life, (as ſhe vainly did imagine) while the other from that minute concluded her ſelf to be the moſt miſerable creature living.</p>

               <hi>Polyandria</hi> had no ſooner ſetled her ſelf in this reſolution, and ſealed it before Hell
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55016:50"/>and her own evil Conſcience, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhe puts in execution; and that ſhe might frame all accommodations ſuitable to her deſign, ſhe immediately made ſearch for a better houſe then what ſhe had before, for that wanted elbow-room, ſhe muſt have many <hi>Meanders,</hi> and many Paſſages, many Holes and many Hides Deeds of darkneſs do ever require many dark corners.</p>
            <p>At laſt, ſhe chanc'd to light upon an houſe near an Old Caſtle, commodiouſly placed, both for her home-bred Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and foreign Viſitants, as well for the Hawk or Buzzard that flies by day, as for the Owl or Bat that flutters in the night, that ſhe could not wiſh for a place of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter convenience. The Sea was on the one ſide, which though its billows did not beat againſt the walls, yet any Ship of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great a burthen might ſafely ride at Anchor. On the other ſide, it had ſome ſmall or ſleight Intrenchments, which though they were but weak and aſſailable, yet the Sea upon all aſſaults did grant her both Munition and Proviſion. And that a good name might Patronize her many evil actions, ſhe cauſed it to be called, <hi>THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Contract ſhe got poſſeſſion of this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55016:51"/>houſe, and her Purſe being well filled, and wide open, emptied it ſelf for Ornament and Furniture. There wanted nothing for ſtate, nothing for Magnificence, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for delight, nothing for beauty, and nothing for neceſſity; howſoever, ſome bones that lodg'd in it were rotten and unwholeſom, yet the Monument it ſelf was ſtately and ſplendid, ſhe wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now but living Furniture, and that ſhe divided into two ſtations.</p>
            <p>The firſt were two Bulleys, appointed at night for her black Guards, the ſecond a parcel of luſty Queans, to ſupply Offices according to their quality. The firſt of theſe ſhe ſaved from the Gallows by ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming their forfeited lives, and the laſt ſhe picktup out of ſeveral Bawdy-houſes, having had not time as yet to keep any of her own dragging up: for theſe there needed not much ſearch or enquiry, ſince Sin is found in every corner, and theſe Creatures, plying a wealthy Faire, will thruſt themſelves into the Devils arms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Hope, beyond Redemption.</p>
            <p>There was not a Ship that brought in any Perſon fit for her turn, from any part of Wales, or <hi>England,</hi> but ſhe had Pieces of Eight, of greater weight to exchange for it, Not any young or tender Pullet,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55016:51"/>that came fluttering out of the Country, whether <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Iriſh,</hi> of they were plump and bandſome, but ſhe had ſpeedy intelligence thereof, and quickly found out a way to inſinuate into their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and diving into their preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe by that means knew how to ſteer her courſe to her beſt advantage, and by pretending to do them kindneſſes by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to advantagious ſervices, ſhe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her own turn firſt, and by her flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries &amp; large pretences made them her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Creatures. In ſhort, ſhe had varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Charms to intice the ſimple, Money to bewitch the Needy, Splendid habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and other gaudy Ornaments for the proud and Ambitious, Eaſe for Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Pleaſure for wantons, and indeed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, or all things, to keep her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth from falling.</p>
            <p>Being thus generally accommodated, and her Mart, or Fair proclaimed, ſhe need not doubt the want of Cuſtomers, every man hath a penny for a New Taverne.</p>
            <p>She had wound her ſelf into ſo good a credit among ſome young Wine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, this added much to the gaining her a vaſt Cuſtome, and as the Wine did in part attract them, ſo when drawn in, it was no eaſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55016:52"/>out quickly, ſo powerful were the charms of thoſe beautiful Inchantereſſes therein plying or inhabiting: She had no ſooner diſcovered her publick and private Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but that her Viſitants came tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in ſo faſt for entertainment, that her Kitchin was like <hi>Mongibel,</hi> ever flaming; her Hall, like <hi>Augeus</hi> ſtable, ever ſtinking with broken meat; her Dining-Room, like <hi>Babel,</hi> a mixture of nothing but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed noiſes; and her inward and private Lodgings, like Hell it ſelf, where damn'd or wicked creatures, by bathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in luſt as ſouls infernal, lie pickled up in Sulphur; Thus ſhe continued her debautcheries for a long ſeaſon, boaſting her ſelf in the ſtrength of her wickedneſs, and not grieving for any thing more, then that ſhe could be no more wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carnelia</hi> was the chiefeſt Jewel in her whole Cabinet, whom ſhe expoſed not to common view, but reſerved her for her beſt Cuſtomers, ſuch as valued not the expence of their money in the proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their pleaſure; one where of being a very ingenious man, though ſenſual, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his enjoyment of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> wrote theſe lines upon her.</p>

            <p>It was not long ere ſhe had renewed her trade, and by running over her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer practices, ſhe made a ſhift to cram her baggs pretty well again. Among the reſt of her Gallants, ſhe uſed to frequent with a moſt affectionate Dotard, an old fellow that for fear of Taxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Had betaken himſelf to the privacy of a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. ſomething near <hi>Cornelia</hi>'s Lodgings, and made it his buſineſs to enquire o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:55016:58"/>there ever ſince <hi>Cornelia</hi> came to the Houſe, That ſhe was an Orphan well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended, allied to ſuch a Gentleman, and was a moſt modeſt virtuous Lady; This and his own conceit of her, led him into the ſnare.</p>
            <p>Hereupon he forthwith addreſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to her, having prepared his way by the Landlady his good Neighbour, who omitted not to commend him, his Baggs, Parts, and Aldermans abilities, which <hi>Cornelia</hi> well approved of by a ſlight and careleſs laughter at the ſtory.</p>
            <p>But yet it would hardly down with her, although ſhe foreſaw the neceſſity of being married, untill the advice, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate counſels of her Voluptuary Friends had perſwaded her to it (and the old Fop never came to viſit, but he ſaw one of her Cozens, Townſmen, or the like, in her Company;) For they told her that the cold Dew gave the ſweetneſs to Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and that Catarrhs, and Rheums were the irrigations and moiſture that would ſtill keep her blooming, while the violent heat of youth would ſoon wither her, as, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now the Match went on amain, and <hi>Cornelia</hi> well ſatisfied with a pregnant Reaſon one of them had given her, in Reverence to his Age, profeſſed her ſelf bis Hand-maid, and gave him aſſurance of her moſt entire affections, which ſo blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this old <hi>Fribbling Sink-Kater,</hi> that without any more ado, and with all the privacy that could be, as if he had got a moſt ineſtimable Jewel, they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently married; and the old Bride-groom, and the young Bride, were the lovingeſt Couple, as ever eyes and looks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Horn-Fair</hi> began, ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Chapmen followed her, as was hardly ever ſeen before, all forſooth to honour the Eſpouſals of <hi>Cornelia,</hi> and to ſee the Bridal-bed, the old man ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting new ways of Courtſhip, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment for theſe his friends, whilſt
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55016:59"/>her whole time was taken up in ſtudying how to make them welcome.</p>
            <p>This Trade continued till the young Gentlewoman came within Ken of her nine months time, and a ſwelling in her belly to an uſuall bulk at five months time, ſignified a forward inchoation of the Marriage-Rites; and it was ſouniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally taken notice of, that at laſt the old <hi>Chance</hi> himſelf had ſo much ſagacity, as to ſuſpect ſome body had been tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering there before which he could not longer diſſemble; but one night in bed told her of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cornelia</hi> began firſt moderately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute his jealouſy, and proteſted her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and ſpotleſs Chaſtity; but the old man growing ſomewhat wayward and teſty, ſhe fell down-right a railing on him, telling him, that ſhe would acquaint her friends with his Language, whoſe Honour would oblige them to call him to a ſtrickt account of that ſcandalous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; It is true (ſaid ſhe) I was told of this before, but my indiſcreet affection to ſuch a Worm-eaten Slave hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born my felicity, which I might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed with a Noble young perſon, who
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55016:60"/>hath Courted me with the greateſt paſſion; but ſince it is as it is, I would have you know that you have not marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Fool, telling him further, that ſhe would take a ſevere revenge of that his affront done to her Honour, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemiſht reputation, and mounted this diſgrace to ſuch a height, that ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next Morning her uſuall Viſitants came to give them the Good-morrow, and found her and her old Husband quite out of T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> but her eſpecially ſo dogged &amp; ſo diſcompoſed, that they fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe had vowed Penitence, and would loure ſuch Sinners ought of her ſight, when to ſave the fear of ſuch a thought, ſhe preſently tells the ſtory, and with all aggravation either female wit or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice could invent, reports his uſage of her.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>interim,</hi> the old Gentleman ſlips out of doors, to avoid the ſtorms he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from theſe friends of his wife, who preſently, upon notice of his abſence, falls to the old Game, with all the mirth and jollity imaginable; but however, ſhe did
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55016:60"/>not wholly forget her husbands words, which ſhe knew a little longer time would manifeſt to be true. So ſhe reſolved whatever befell, to make the feud irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable, and in order to that to leave him. But before ſhe did this, it was adviſed that two of her pretended Couſens, ſhould go and expoſtulate the caſe with Gaffer Gray beard, and give him a Juniper Leſſon in ſome publick place, to make <hi>Cornelia's</hi> departure from him, juſt and honourable.</p>
            <p>This Counſel was well followed, and her husband well told of the inſufferable wrong he had done their Kinſwoman, but gave him no ſuch hint as leaving him, for now was ſhe packing up her beſt Moveables, Jewels, and Plate, with a good ſumme of moneys, and withall, ſtretching her husbands credit for more (where ever ſhe knew any thing could be raiſed) and thus <hi>viis &amp; modis,</hi> ſhe had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſſed together near the value of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds.</p>
            <p>So with two of her intimate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding friends, ſhe that afternoon depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Dublin,</hi> and went to <hi>Tredath,</hi> twenty miles from thence remote, where
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55016:61"/>like the only Beauty, the only Gallant of that place, ſhe was admired by all, but kept at a diſtance from any thing further, by her Paramours, who were very ſtrict in obſerving her, and very carefull of her ſlipping.</p>

            <p>To which end they adviſed with a Lawyer (that was to go ſnip with them) to ſet a foot her Claim for Alimony, and accordingly drew up a Bill in Chancery, and <hi>Suppaelig;na'd</hi> the old man to anſwer; in which Bill there wanted not ſuch inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctives, as their Plot (and the modeſty and ſeverity of the Law could ſuffer) did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, eſpecially they exagitated, and urged ſtrange things unto him.</p>
            <p>After much trouble, and many vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Orders which her Agents had the opportunity, and pleaſure of procuring him; and no end except of a good one, either in Hope or View.</p>
            <p>At length he makes an Overture of a Treaty, which with much ado was Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to, but with ſuch ſtiff obſtinate terms on her ſide (which for a weight to her lightneſs, were managed by learned Counſel) that it was as bad as holding the the Wolf by the eare.</p>

            <p>But the deſire of quiet prevailed, which he purchaſed at the rate of five hundred pounds ready money, to be paid down, with a condition of two hundred pounds more to be paid by way of Legacy, if he died before her, and Releaſes good in Law to be given each other.

            <p>The Exchanges were her Marts for faſhions, whither ſhe repair'd, and was ſupplied with what ſhe beſt fancied, ſhe viſited the Kings and Dakes Theatres by

            <p>Upon theſe Reſolutions ſhe thought her work was half finiſhed, till looking better, and more ſtrictly into her deſign, ſhe found the Baſis, and ground-work whereon ſhe was to build the foundation of her proceedings, was yet to find out, though not beyond her reach and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that was a Convenient Houſe, ſtanding in a Convenient Place, for the exerciſes of her deeds of darkneſs; an houſe ſo impregnable, that when all ſhall be vanquiſht, it ſhall ſtand in defiance; and that ſhe might attain to ſo great a ſafety, ſhe ranged through every part,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55016:65"/>and promiſing place of the City: half tyred with her ſearch, ſhe is at length informed of a place ſit for her purpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very Commodiouſly planted for all accommodations. It was without the Walls of the City, bordering upon one of the moſt eminent pleaſant Walks that do belong thereunto, and not far diſtant from that famous, or rather infamous place, which had like to have been defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, nay, utterly ruin'd by the giddy many Headed-Multitude.</p>
            <p>This Fort or Citadel, which ſhe had choſen for her Manſion, was ſo fortified, and invyroned with all manner of Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, that had impregnable <hi>Rhodes</hi> taken thence it's Pattern, neither the <hi>Turks</hi> wealth, nor the Traytors Wit could ever have betray'd it; for e're any Foe could approach this, he muſt march a long way, and ſo narrow, that but two could march a breaſt, and at laſt no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance at the Port, unleſs they were known to be friends by a word given out for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Within this Citadel, were Bull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, Orchards, Gardens, Baſe-Courts, and inferiour Offices, every one being
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55016:65"/>capable of maintaining a ſeveral fight, and every fight able for many hours to play with a rabble Army; and ſhould ſhe be over-powered with multitude of men, ſhe had ſeverall Poſterns to permit her eſcape in great neceſſity.</p>
            <p>For the better and ſecurer manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this famous infamous Houſe of Hoſpitality, ſhe thought it Convenient to prepare Men, and Munition for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, as for Houſehold-Ornaments, thoſe ſhe intended to increaſe according to the plenty of her incomes. Her deſires were ſo great, that her haſt in the execution could not be little, ſhe would not loſe a minute, but according to the Proverb, turn'd every ſtone, and making Hay while the Sun ſhined, ſhe had all things befitting this her new deſign. And that which made her more confident in this work, ſhe was inwardly acquainted with a fellow whoſe face look'd no leſs furious than a Lyons, when Hunger prompts him to hunt after prey, to this great Monſter both in ſhape and condition, ſhe gave the charge of her gate.</p>
            <p>Theſe whom ſhe entertained in the houſe ſhe placed in their true equipage,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55016:66"/>gave them their ſeverall charges, read them the Orders of the Houſe, proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtrict penalty for the breach of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very condition; this done, ſhe hung forth her Flagg for Cuſtome, proclaims her preparations, and invited all wealthy Chapmen to a generall entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>As greedy Eagles prey on dead Carcaſſes, Crows and Ravens feed on Carrion, or hungry doggs tear and devour the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trails of ſtinking beaſts, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance came (ſinful Creatures of all qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities) to be undone by her, only the empty Purſe expulſed, and could get no admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, nay, a reaſonable ſtock many times periſhed in the Mid-way, &amp; could not get to the end of his purpoſe, her Taxes and Cuſtomes were ſo many, and ſo mighty; for her <hi>Cerber us</hi> at the firſt Port had a double Impoſt, one for the Gate, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other for the word he muſt deliver at the inner entrance, or elſe he was to proceed no further; nay as I have been informed there were thoſe who had Fees for the Hall, for the Dining Room, and the With-Drawing-Chamber, the reſt which were peculiar to the Bawd her ſelf (beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty blown <hi>Cornelia</hi>) report, hath affirmed they were infinite,</p>
            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55016:66"/>
            <p>All her entertainments (<hi>Proteus</hi> like) were full of variety and changes, and ſhe would ever ſuit them to the nature of him that was entertained; if he were a man of worth and reſpect, he was reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively uſed, hating Over-reckonings and ſold her Winesas good as moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſold, at little more than the rate of Taverns; if other wiſe, beſides the expence of his money a Hat, Cloak, or Sword were forfeited for his rude behaviour, with a good beating many times to boot.</p>
            <p>Theſe Mill dews could not chuſe but breed her a World of Honey, and true it was, that her baggs were ſo many, and ſo maſſy that ſhe had ſearce Trunks enough to contain them. This wealth made her proud, and Pride renew'd her former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, ſhe will not now live at ſo low a rate as lately ſhe hath done; but as ſhe hath plenty of money, ſo ſhe will have plenty of Attendants; and hereupon ſhe inſtantly Contracted, and hired ſeverall Retainers, but more eſpecially an able Chyrurgion, who was a Batchelour, for whom ſhe had more than a common kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and loving him ſo well, perſwaded him to lodg in her houſe, that he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſee, and be continually ready to offer his aſſiſtance to thoſe whoſe infected bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſtood in need of his medicament<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Though Bawds and Whores are a ſort of Cattel that can agree well enough againſt the common enemy, that is, to Rook and Cheat thoſe that are Rogues and Fools that go among them; yet it is well known to all verſs'd in thoſe Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that there have been continual feuds, and ſometimes Civil Wars among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, about ſharing the wages of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:55016:69"/>in the ſame wicked Occupation) ſhe removed to a Place as difficult to finde out as the Head of <hi>Nilus,</hi> where now, as being not much antiquated, ſhe re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the Name of <hi>Miſs,</hi> and acts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; and ſo endeavors by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gallantry, to make her ſelf a <hi>Help</hi> meet for any wealthy Prodigal, who will not be out of faſhion to marry an honeſt woman; Or if he be contrary to the idle opinion of the looſer Perſons of this wicked Age, ſhe knows how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit herſelf, by being a little <hi>ſide-Pillow,</hi> to render the <hi>Yoke</hi> of <hi>Matrimony</hi> more eaſie, and proves an excellent conveniency for ſuch, who have more money then wit, who ſpend their eſtates upon her to her profit, and their own miſery, and bring themſelves by that means to the <hi>Stool of Repentance,</hi> which for ought I know, if the Perſon be truly penitent for his ſins paſt, he may do well.</p>
            <p>Nature (as I have told you before) gave her an incomparable countenance, furniſhed with the beſt of Creatures; neither was her ſtock of confidence, (which ſome call convenient boldneſs) deficient, which ſhe, by prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath now improved into impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, though at ſome times, when ſhe

            <p>Though ſhe is wicked enough of all conſcience, yet I never could hear that ſhe was ſo baſe and low-ſpirited, as to ſally abroad in the night, to pick up drunken Fellows, and in a Tavern, whilſt he was ever-buſily employ'd, pick out the ſtragling <hi>Guinny's</hi> in his Pocket, or anything elſe that is valuable; ſhe hath found out a far ſafer way, which ſhe calls commendable, by perſwading her Gallant to this opinion, That the blood cannot be always kept in a full Tyde, without extraordinary Treats and high feeding; by ſuch like ſubtile inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe hath perſwaded many to keep her in a better equipage then they have done their wives; having coſtly Clothes, Rooms hung with the greateſt Gallantry, and the variety of ſervants, male and female, to attend her, whom ſhe hath taught to call her, <hi>Madam,</hi> that ſhe may be look'd on as a Perſon of quality: In ſhort, by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhe hath arrived to ſo great a knowledge in this Profeſſion, that there was never any ſubtile Whoriſh Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion yet invented, of what ſhe is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,

            <p>When the Appetites of her Gallants begin to be cloyed, their Purſes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, or their Eyes enlightned, and thereupon withdraw, ſhe ſoon finds out ſome other Fool to bubble, with whom, for ſecurity ſake, ſhe will not Trade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Penſion <hi>per</hi> week, or ſometimes an Annuity for life; and having Plurality of Gallants, commands what moneys ſhe pleaſes, which ſhe expends as Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſely, for now the Gallantty of her high ſpirit will not ſtoop to the mean Arts of Frugality and good Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery,</p>
            <p>She is now Arrived to a great height of unexpected glory, her Boys are in Livery, her Houſe ſplendidly furniſh'd, and rarely ſtirs abroad without Sedan or Coach, ſhe glitters in the Boxes of the <hi>Play-houſes,</hi> ſhe draws all eyes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter her whereever ſhe comes, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement
