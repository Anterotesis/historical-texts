            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THIS following Sermon (dear Reader) I ſend to wait upon the foregoing Treatiſe, as being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to both very <hi>neer of Kin,</hi> and <hi>very Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neer of Kin,</hi> as being a Reſtorer of Communion with our Lord; for This laboreth to Reſtore our Communion <hi>with the Father and the Son,</hi> to that <hi>Full joy</hi> which St. <hi>John</hi> declareth to be the Summ of his meſſage; as That doth, to Reſtore our Communion with the <hi>Son in his Fleſh and Blood,</hi> to that Conſtancy which himſelf made due to it: And <hi>Serviceab'l,</hi> not only in caſting out the ſpirit of Fear, which is the common enemy; but particularly in caling to a more ſtrict account that <hi>Self-examination,</hi> which, as preſcribed, and practiſed by the beſt, is the greateſt diſcora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from the Lord's Supper. Here, tht Sermon advanceth beyond the Treatiſe, denying it ſo much as adviſeabl to a good perſon, either upon That or any Other occaſion.</p>
            <p>I ſay, <hi>to a good perſon</hi>: For to others <hi>I</hi> acknowledge the Prophets admonition always neceſſary, that they <hi>ſearch and try their ways, and turn unto the Lord:</hi> but for thoſe who have already do'n this neceſſary work, I ſee no Reaſon to be always repeting it. Many exhortations I find encoraging them <hi>to rejoice in the Lord alway,</hi> but not one to be always tormenting themſelvs, with examining their intereſt in him.</p>
            <p>This, and another (no leſs heterodox) aſſertion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Repentance,</hi> my deſign invited me to Touch, but my time forbad me to Handl, in any proportion to the need: which defect I have now endeavoured to ſupply by additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Annotations, wherein <hi>I</hi> have accounted for ſuch texts as ſeem to diſcountenance them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:105166:2"/>More or Leſs than this cannot be required: A <hi>ſound mind</hi> cannot acknowledg the Scripture to be the adequate rule of faith and manners, yet fear to appeal to it. But to manage the appeal is not every one's work: it requireth good acquaintance with the Original language, ſom Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal improvement of the underſtanding, a Carefuley, a Free Heart, and a Good Key.</p>
            <p>For the laſt of theſe we ſtand obliged to the great <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who hath furniſhed us with This, as <hi>the beſt key to underſtand myſtical Scrpture, that we obſerv what the ſpeaker aims at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With this key <hi>I</hi> have unlocked ſuch texts as ſtood in my way: And <hi>I</hi> add this to <hi>Eraſmus</hi>'s rule, That as every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular word muſt be unlocked by the Author's aim, as by its proper key; ſo muſt every text, and its particular key; conform to the Univerſal Aim of the Goſpel, as their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and Supreme <hi>King-key.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then <hi>I</hi> ſay and inculcate, and wiſh the whole Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian world would hear it. As ſure as St. <hi>John</hi> hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamed, that this is the deſign of the Goſpel, <hi>that our joy may be full;</hi> as ſure as St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath determined, that <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven is Righteouſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſo ſure it is, that the <hi>King-key,</hi> wherewith we muſt unlock every abſtruſe text of Scripture; the Teſt, whereby we muſt try every Doctrine of Faith or Manners; the Oracle, which we muſt conſult in all doubts of Conſcience; is this: <hi>Whatever will moſt exalt the Joy of the Wiſe and Good, is moſt properly Evangelical, and moſt certainly True.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were this as generally believed, as throghout the whole New Teſtament it is plainly declared, how great, how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a change would it work in the Christian world! How would it advance both the Honor and Power of the Goſpel! How would it promote both the Joy of the Godly, and the
<pb facs="tcp:105166:3"/>
Converſion of the Profane! How would it exalt the Glory of Gods love trward Us, and the Ardor of Ours towards Him!</p>
            <p>Whereas, <hi>not to know what ſpirit we ate of,</hi> is the moſt pernicios Ignorance: It made our Lord's Apoſtls uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritabl to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and it ſtill makes his beſt intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned diſciples Tormentors to Themſelvs, and Scare-crows to Others.</p>
            <p>How ſerviceabl the diſcovery may be, God grant Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may verify, as much as Reaſon promiſeth, beyond what this poor Sermon can expreſs; which that it may contribute its mite, offers its ſelf and its unvulgar aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to thy moſt deliberate examination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But remember, we appeal from All Human authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Divine.</hi>

                  <p>How ſhall they preach except they be ſent? as it is written, <hi>How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Peace, and bring glad tidings of good things!</hi>

            <p>WE ſhall not now conſider theſe words as Part of an Argument, but as an Entire one. And ſince an Argument moveth more Gracefully (perhaps) from the Conſequent to the Antecedent, but more Strongly from the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Conſequent; it will be reaſonab'l we ſhould invert the Apoſtl's order: for ſo we find a <hi>Sorites</hi> of three pieces: <hi>The Goſpel is glad tidings,</hi> therefore <hi>the Meſſengers feet are beautiful,</hi> therefore <hi>no man may preach except he be ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Goſpel! A Goſpel of Peace! Glad tidings! Good things!</hi> How doth the Apoſt'l travel to bring forth an expreſſion ſuitab'l? <hi>Such glad tidings of great joy,</hi> an hoſt of Angels found worth a jorny from Heaven to bring; and perhaps for that reaſon its firſt Preachers were ſtiled <hi>Angels of their Churches.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And their reception was ſuitab'l both to this title, and thoſe tidings: <hi>You received me,</hi> ſaith our Apoſt'l to the <hi>Galatians, as an Angel of God, even as Christ Jeſus. —If it had been poſſibl, you would have pluckt out your own eys, and have given them unto me.</hi> And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:105166:4"/>
here he ſaith not much leſs. <hi>How beautiful are</hi> what? the Lips, the Eyes, the Countenances? yea, the very <hi>Feet!</hi> the very feet of <hi>Meſſengers!</hi> the feet of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in thoſe countries, where they muſt needs be <hi>Dirty,</hi> bicauſe naked. The charms of this beauty, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s ointment, run down from the Face to the very Feet.</p>
            <p>And for this reaſon <hi>no man may take this high ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to himſelf, but he that is caled of God, as was Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</hi> For as this encoraged our Apoſt'l in his work, ſo did it temt popularly ambitios ſpirits to dubl his task: he muſt not only Execute his commiſſion, but Aſſert it: His next words ſpeak him no leſs troubled with Rivals, than with Perſecutors; and This makes it neceſſary to urge as in my Text, <hi>they muſt not preach except they be ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus may the order of my Text be inverted, thus may it make a weighty argument, not perhaps ſo proper to the Apoſt'ls own deſign, as to that which hath brought us together.</p>
            <p>If the beauty of the Preachers deſcend from their Heads to their very Feet, needs muſt it deſcend from the head of the family to its neereſt members: and you may juſtly expect, that from this expreſſion I ſhould take occaſion to plead the right of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy widows and orphans, who have nothing left them by their deceaſed husbands and fathers but their merits to adminiſter.</p>
            <p>But oh the diſappointment! Our Apoſt'l, after his ſo great boaſt of the <hi>Galatians</hi> love, quickly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains, <hi>Where is the bleſſedneſs you spoak of</hi>? And well may we demand, Where is this great beauty that ſo deſcends to the very feet? Hath age withered it to a deformity equal to its youthful lovelineſs? Our very
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:105166:4"/>
eyes are as loathſom as the primitive Preachers very feet were beatiful; and the deformity deſcends to our poſterity as their only ſure inheritance: yea ſom are ſo impios as to make God a party with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs in the entayl, pretending that Clergy-mens children are equally hated of God and Man, ſeldom or never attaining, either worth in themſelvs, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in the world. God be bleſſed, we are hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſecured from that malicios ſlander; This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuos, and perhaps matchleſs aſſembly, having for ever rooted that fals toung out of its dwelling.</p>
            <p>Yet, thogh the Toung be rooted out, the Heart is ſtill the ſame; ſo void of Love, ſo full of 'ſpite, againſt this once ſo honored caling. that we muſt think it a great bargain if we can compound for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary charity, and depoſe my Text to this poor plea, <hi>The Preachers of the Gospel bring no evil tidings; therefor they deſerv not to be hated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince it is better to Cure an evil than to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it, I conceve I cannot do better ſervice to my Text, the Goſpel, and its Preachers, than by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the cauſe of the hatred we ſink under; which indeed is no other than that Epidemical mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, the root of all miſery, the taking things by wrong handl.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel hath two handls, Threats, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: its threats are Few, and its promiſes Many: its Threats ſhew us our danger, only that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in our eſcape; its Promiſes immediately raiſe our joys. Threats therefor, both in quantity and deſign, ſit upon the face of the Goſpel, as beauty-ſpots do upon that of a fair Lady; here one, and there another, to this only end, that by their vanquiſhed blackneſs they may ſet off the luſtre of the beauty
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:105166:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is to adorn the very feet; but by the unhappy officioſneſs of melancholy meſſengers, thoſe ſpots have been enlarged to a viſor, which ſo cover the face of Religion, that we cannot ſee its Joys for its Fears; and the very <hi>grace of God which bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> appeareth like the inhumane <hi>Nero,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let them Hate me, ſo they Fear me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ugly viſor ſhall I endeavor to pull off, as my Text directs me, by two Propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Gospel doth not deſign to bring us to God by Fear, but by Love:</hi> For it is a Goſpel of Peace, glad tidings of good things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The mistake of this is the cauſe that the Gospel and its Preachers are ſo hated by the world</hi>: For if Glad tidings make the meſſenger beautiful, Evil tidings muſt make him loathſom.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THE Gospel doth not draw men to God by Fear, but by Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, as it is clearly expreſt in my Text, ſo is it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in every page of the New Teſtament: I ſhall inſtance but in one or two places more, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly offer one handle, and reject the other.</p>
            <p>In this ſame Epiſtle <hi>ch.</hi> 8 <hi>v.</hi> 15. our Apoſt'l de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth as clearly as poſſib'l, <hi>You have not receved the ſpirit of bondage again fear, but the ſpirit of Adoption, whereby we cry Abba, Father</hi>: And no leſs clearly, 2 Tim. 1.7. <hi>God hath not given us the ſpirit of Fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a Sound mind.</hi> In the former place he oppoſeth the ſpirit of the Goſpel to That of the Law; and in the later, he vieth with the Philoſophers, who pretend to exalt the mind to the higheſt freedom and perfection.</p>
            <p>If this can be yet more clear, St <hi>John</hi> hath made it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:105166:5"/>
ſo: for with pomp unmatched by any other pen, he uſhereth his firſt Epiſtl with This proclamation, <hi>Theſe things we write unto you, that your joy may be full</hi>: and throghout the whole body of the following Epiſtl exalteth Love, as the only way to this fulneſs of Joy; <hi>ch.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>There is no fear in Love, but Love when it is perfected caſteth out fear, bicaus Fear hath Torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is impoſſib'l to find Plainer, and therefor need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to ſeek for More declarations of this truth: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can remain, but that we reconcile them with ſuch other words of Scripture as ſeem to contradict them. Two ſuch eſpecially there are: One ſpoken by our Lord, and another by our ſame Apoſtl: <note n="*" place="bottom">See Annot. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> to which may be reduced all others of the ſame air. Theſe two therefore if we can reconcile, we ſhall both State and Clear the truth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our Apoſtl himſelf ſeemeth to contradict this: Phil. 2, 12. <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Doth not this offer ſalvation by that handl which but now he rejected?</p>
            <p>That we may now or at any other time reconcile appearances of contradiction, we muſt carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider which of the two Propoſitions may beſt be broght to compliance.</p>
            <p>It is plain, that what we have heard declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt Fear, cannot be bent to any other ſence: we muſt therefor try whether the <hi>fear and trembling,</hi> which he recommendeth to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree both with his declaration in two other Epiſtl's, that <hi>we have not receved the spirit of fear</hi>; or with his exhortation in the ſame Epiſtl, <hi>ch. v. Rejoyce in the Lord evermore, and again I ſay rejoice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:105166:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>To find out this, it is neceſſary we look about us, and ſee how he uſeth the ſame phraſe upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, poſſibly it may be an Idiom.</p>
            <p>Twice more we find him at the ſame phraſe, and in both places his meaning will very well comply with Love and Joy. <hi>Eph,</hi> 6.5, <hi>Servants obey your Maſters with Fear and Trembling.</hi> What? doth not a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant pleaſe both God and his Maſter better, if he Obey him with Love and Chearfulneſs? And what ſhall we ſay to the 9<hi>th.</hi> verſe, <hi>And you Masters do the ſame things to Them.</hi> Muſt Maſters alſo treat their Servants <hi>with Fear and Trembling</hi>? Yes, but ſuch as may circulate between the beſt Maſters, and the beſt Servants; even ſuch as himſelf explaineth by <hi>good will,</hi> v. 7.</p>
            <p>This poſſibly will be plainer by 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.15. <hi>His inward affection is more abundant towards you, while he remembreth the obedience of you all, how with Fear and Trembling you receved him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titus</hi> came in kindneſs to viſit them, and they welcomed him with ſuch endearing careſſes, as made his (already great) <hi>inward affection more abundant</hi> than before: Here certainly the Fear and Trembling which ſo welcomed and heightned Love, muſt be ſo far from excluding it and Joy, that they import an extraordinary meſure of them.</p>
            <p>Yea, we need look no farther for a good light, whereby to ſee the meaning of this phraſe in That his exhortation to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> than the encorage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherewith he quickneth them in the words immediately following: <hi>For it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to Do</hi> of his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>good will.</hi> It is the very ſame word wherewith the Angels broght their <hi>glad tidings of great joy,</hi> and it were
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:105166:6"/>
ſtrange if out of the ſame breath ſhould come Gladneſs and Fear, Joy and Trembling.</p>
            <p>That we may not ſeem bent wholely to pull down the obvios ſence without bringing a better in place, this we offer as the Apoſtl's meaning: <hi>It was only the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the loving kindneſs of God, which wrought in you the deſire of ſalvation: and the ſame loving kindneſs will crown That deſire with ſucceſs, if it be attended with endeavor: do you therefor your part with ſuch affection, as ſhall make you even Tremble again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that we may give account of the Idiom as well as of the Argument; we muſt obſerve, that Any paſſion whatever, if vehement, will cauſe Trembling: But bicaus this is moſt viſib'l in Fear, therefor Fear is added to expreſs the certainuy of Trembling, as Trembling is uſed to expreſs the vehemence of the Paſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HAVING Thus interpreted one ſaying of our Apoſt'ls by another, we com now to do our Savior the ſame ſervice, who alſo ſeemeth to contradict our poſition, <hi>Lu.</hi> 12.4 <hi>I ſay unto you my friends, be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do: but I will forwarn you whom you ſhall fear: Fear Him, which after he hath killed you, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, Fear Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is plain, that <hi>Fear</hi> in this place can ſignifie no other than the Propereſt, and no leſs than the Greateſt; and is enforced by our Lord in the moſt preſſing manner; inculcated by ſundry repetitions, and urged with a moſt dreadful reaſon. This cannot be denied, but muſt be interpreted by our Lord's own parab'l, <hi>Lu.</hi> 14.16. <hi>A certain man made a great ſupper, and bad many, and he ſent his ſervants at ſupper time to ſay to them that were bidden, Com, for all things
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:105166:7"/>
are now ready; and they all with one conſent began to make excuſe; and the Lord ſaid unto his ſervants, go out into the high ways and hedges, and compell them to com in, that my houſe may be furniſhed with gueſts.</hi> This parab'l will fully reconcile our Lord's threats with the ſpirit of Love: for it declareth, that the Lord's proper deſign was not to Troubl his neighbors, but to Feſt them. His firſt work was to provide a great ſupper, and then many gueſts to enjoy it; to which end he ſecondeth his large proviſions with kind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations: But when few or none can this way be prevailed with, to leav the farms and cattel which they have boght, or the Luſts which they have eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; either all the proviſions muſt be loſt, or ſom other means uſed, more ſuitab'l to the neceſſity than to the nature of a feſt.</p>
            <p>We muſt therefore diſtinguiſh the Principal End from the Subordinate Means, who's whole buiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to ſerv That End: And ſince the End is choſen for its own ſake, and the Means only for the Ends ſake; we muſt advance the ſpirit of Love as much as is Poſſib'l; but That of Fear, only ſo much as is Neceſſary; Comply with it ſo far as to follow it from the Hedg to the Hous, and then diſmiſs it to exerciſe its kind rudeneſs upon others who need it.</p>
            <p>And thus I hope I have fully accounted for my firſt poſition; <hi>The Gospel doth not deſign to draw us by Fear, but Love</hi>; and it is for Love's ſake, if Fear be at all employed. Com we now to our Secund.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>THE miſtake of this is the cauſe that the Gospel and its preachers are ſo hated by the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What can we expect, but contrary cauſes muſt produce contrary effects? If therefor our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:105166:7"/>
be different from that of the Apoſtl's, our recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt be ſo to: if glad tidings make the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers feet beautiful, evil tidings muſt needs make them loathſom. <hi>Ahab</hi>'s inference is Natural, thogh ſcarce Reaſonab'l: <hi>I hate him, bicaus he propheſieth not good of me, but evil</hi>: And whatſoever <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> can ſay to the contrary, ſuch a Prophet ſhall be ſentenced to <hi>the bread and water of affliction.</hi> And hereof the proof is but too evident, in all our enemies, which may be reduced to two regiments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe that hate All religion in general.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Thoſe that hate Ours of the Church of</hi> England <hi>in particular.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Of thoſe who hate All Religion in general, ſom are <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and ſom are <hi>Semi-atheiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THE ATHEISTS are made ſuch by the ſpirit of Fear. Upon This only ground did <hi>Epicurus</hi> build his impudent pretence to that gracios title, which the Scripture teacheth us to pay our Lord THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD. For he boſted, that he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his diſciples from the torment of Fear: But we now heard St. <hi>John</hi> declare, that this is do'n by the ſpirit of Love: <hi>Love caſteth out Fear,</hi> and for this reaſon too, <hi>bicaus Fear hath torment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The queſtion therefor between Atheiſm and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is not whether Fear ſhall be caſt out or no? but whether of the two doth it moſt effectually? <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>Epicurus?</hi> Should we inſiſt upon the Weakneſs or Dangeroſneſs of Atheiſm, we might eaſily prove it both inſufficient to give any ſettled peace to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-that-way ſecure conſcience, and terribly dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros if at laſt it prove fals.</p>
            <p>But my preſent work rather promts me to inſiſt upon this, that it maketh not the leaſt pretence to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:105166:8"/>
the Beauty admired in my Text, but wholely renegs <hi>all glad tidings of good things</hi>: It's utmoſt aim is to <hi>caſt out Fear,</hi> without a thoght of <hi>making our joy full.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this indeed is the proper ground whereon to fight out the quarrel. Whilſt we diſpute whether there be a God and Providence, or no, we maintain but a hedge fight, wherein the enemy may make a bad ſhift to skulk behind his buſhes and ditches: But if we diſpute concerning our own Happineſs, even our Preſent happineſs, whether it be greater in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligios life or in a Senſual, then we charge him home in his own ground, and leav him no ſhelter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Colotes</hi> it ſeems was the firſt <hi>Epicurean,</hi> that ever appeared in this field: For he wrote a Treatiſe profeſſing to prove, that upon the principls of the Religios, it is impoſſib'l to live pleaſantly. Againſt this <hi>Plutarch</hi> oppoſeth another Treatiſe, proving that upon the principls of <hi>Epicurus</hi> a man cannot ſo much as live; and thus boſteth of his work: <hi>This is to trampl upon their bellies, and put them to fight for their very fleſh; to take pleſure from men that do nothing but cry, we are no good ſoldiers, nor ſcholars, nor magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, but we love to make good chear, to banquet, and fill our fleſh with all delights, until the pleſure mount to the very ſoul; to rob ſuch men of pleſure is to rob them of life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus doth he crow, and upon this ground com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the pleſures of the Spirit in Religios Feſts, with thoſe of the Fleſh in Senſual; apparently tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl the <hi>Epicurean</hi> to dirt: yet with force how ſhort of the Goſpel! who's Joys are fed with Hopes more glorios, and Evidences more inconteſtab'l, than could enter into <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s imagination.</p>
            <p>Here then let us take our poſt: Let us not ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:105166:8"/>
much contend for the Truth of the Goſpel, as its Joys: Yea let us argue from its Joys, for its Truth; ſince infinite goodneſs will not fail to make That trueſt which is Beſt. Let us compare the Fruits of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit with That of the Vine; the Beauty of Holineſs with That of a Whore; the Pleſures of an Angel with thoſe of a Beaſt; and he cannot ſcape the evidence, that his choice is as fooliſh as impios.</p>
            <p>True (ſaith <hi>Plutarch</hi>) we muſt be careful to ſhun ſuperſtitios fear, as the moſt pernicios error in the world: and herein he proceedeth ſo far as to ſay, that it is leſs impios to deny God to have Any being, than to character him ſuch as ſuperſtition apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth him. Let the compariſon paſs for odios, our Apoſt'l putteth us above any need of it: When he ſaith, Love caſteth out Fear, he condemneth it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, thogh he ſay not whether it be more or leſs guilty than its daughter Atheiſm.</p>
            <p>Objection. <hi>What then? muſt we not fear God as our Savior admoniſheth</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yes, as our Savior admoniſheth, but no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: For we muſt diſtinguiſh Fear that hath Torment, from fear that hath only Caution. Love caſteth not out That fear that keepeth waking, but that which tormenteth; it Therefor caſteth it out, BICAUSE it hath torment; That is the Reaſon, and That is the Meſure; Juſt the ſame Fear, and in the ſame Meſure, as That Reaſon requireth, but no more.</p>
            <p>The Beſt and Greateſt Subject ſo feareth the Law of his Prince, as to beware he run not upon its Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments; yet is he not thereby hindred from living chearfully upon thoſe honors and riches, which by the ſame Law he enjoyeth: A good man may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:105166:9"/>
careful to avoid the Threats, yet chearful in feſting upon the Promiſes of the Goſpel. Yea, our Apoſt'l himſelf ſo far cheriſheth this kind of Fear, as to ſay, <hi>I keep my body in ſubjection, leſt poſſibly when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. THE SEMIATHEISTS, who mount not the ſcorners chair, ſo as to oppoſe All Religion; yet keep diſtance from a Religios life, and they are kept at that diſtance by Fear: And under this character com not only the Worſt, but the Moſt: Not only thoſe for whom the Apoſt'l declareth the Law to have been made, <hi>the lawleſs and diſobedient, the ungodly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, &amp;c.</hi> but the unſcandalouſly wicked; yea ſuch moral men, of whom we may ſay as our Lord did of the young man, they are <hi>not far from the Kingdom of God</hi>: Such as would paſs thro the world with as litl guilt as poſſib'l, but with as litl troubl too; and therefor put repentance as an evil day far from them, not in love to their Luſts, but their Eaſe.</p>
            <p>They hear an evil report of Repentance, which muſt be their entrance upon a Religios life: Thoſe who preſs it and its conditions, ſpeak in a ſtile op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit to St. <hi>John, theſe things we write to you, that your grief may be full.</hi> Thoſe who adventure upon it, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that ſuch a grief is no more in their Power, than it is for their Pleaſure: And thoſe who have long ſerved under it, are as far from freedom as at firſt; but live as much tormented with fear that their repentance is inſufficient, as at firſt they were with repentance it ſelf.</p>
            <p>For thoſe who are broght to Repentance by Fear, are ſtill to cheriſh That fear, as their beſt ſecurity from relaps: They muſt ever and anon, but ſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:105166:9"/>
when they are to receve the holy communion, be anxioſly examining themſelvs, whether their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be ſound, and themſelvs in the ſtate of grace, or no? and they are directed by Teachers as melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly as themſelvs, and marks, which rather multiply than remove their fears.</p>
            <p>They are told of a twofold hypocriſy, open, and ſecret; and the bounds between the Leaſt that ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace requireth, and the Moſt that a hypocrite may perform, are ſo undiſcernab'l, that they cannot be ſure whether they be in the one ſtate or the other: But ſtill, the more they Examin, the leſs they Satisfie themſelvs; they bate and flutter without End, or any other fruit but this, that they entang'l themſelvs more; and perhaps at laſt ſink into deep melancholy, incurab'l either by Spiritual or Corporal Phyſician: and by ſo ſad a ſpectacl the by-ſtanders take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhun the place of Torment, and hate their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters as Tormentors: So the Chriſtian World is almoſt all divided, between ſuch as are frighted from a Religios life, and ſuch as live fearfully under it.</p>
            <p>It is worth more time than I can allow, fully to convince either party of their error: but it is of ſo great import, that I muſt (however briefly) avow that it proceedeth in Both from taking repentance by the wrong handl.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THOSE who are frighted from Religion by the hardſhip of Repentance. It would not be ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribl if we receved it by the ſpirit of Love: bicauſe it would be neither ſo Difficult to be obteined, nor ſo Troubleſom in the performance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Not ſo difficult to be obteined: Obſerv the Love of God as proclamed in the Goſpel, and anſwer that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:105166:10"/>
Love of God, ſo as to be able to ſay with the Apoſt'l, <hi>We love God, bicauſe he loved us first</hi>; and forbear grieving for your ſins, if you can. I ſay again Love God, and forbear to griev for having offended him, if you can. But be ſure you cannot, for it is utterly impoſſib'l to forbear grieving, when we have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded whom we love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet fear not you that love your Eaſe; this grief will not diſturb it: For as I ſaid of Fear, ſo ſay I of Grief; there is a grief that hath <hi>Torment,</hi> and there is a grief that hath only <hi>Tenderneſs</hi>; a grief that hath Bitterneſs, and a grief that hath only Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and That, ſuch a ſharpneſs, as ſhall not mar your feſt, but improve it with its poignance. This is that <hi>grata aciditas</hi> which recommendeth bankets; it is ſo ſweetned by the ſence of God's pardoning goodneſs, that it is none of the meaneſt part of the joys of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>I pray you take notice, and remember it, I deny not but grief is neceſſary; I confeſs it is impoſſib'l a penitent ſoul can be without it. But this grief as it is Neceſſary, ſo it is Natural; as a gracios foul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without it, ſo can he not Wiſh to be ſo: it coſts him no pain, either to obtein or exerciſe it.</p>
            <p>But the grief that proceedeth from the ſpirit of Fear is every way contrary.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is hard to be obteined. To fear God's pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and for That reaſon to griev for ſin, and thence to love God for pardoning upon ſuch repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; This is to go quite againſt the hair, both in grace and nature: In Grace, bicauſe the Apoſt'l declareth, that Love caſts out Fear, and how can Fear bring in that Love by which it ſelf is caſt out? In Nature, bicauſe That cannot but ſhun Fear and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:105166:10"/>
Grief; and that, not only as it is corrupted, but in its whole integrity:</p>
            <p>When we addreſs our ſelvs to Love, we ſhall not miſs of the grief of Tenderneſs, bicauſe it is Love's certain attendant; but if we addreſs our ſelvs to Grief, we court the Handmaid, which we cannot obtein b<gap reason="illegible: blurred" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n by the Miſtreſs; and if we ad-dreſs to That grief which proceeds from Fear, we court a Scoundrel, that is as coy as worthleſs; no leſs an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Loving grief, than to our own inclinations.</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>Is not Repentance the firſt ſtep to Converſion? and is not Repentance, Grief</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> That duty which the Goſpel preſcribeth as neceſſary to ſalvation, is not only a Step to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but Converſion it ſelf; it is not only Grief for what is paſt, but Change for the future.</p>
            <p>We are miſerably abuſed by a baſe Tranſlation: I appeal to you that underſtand the Greek and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Toungs, whether <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> be any kin to the Latin words, <hi>Repentance, Penance, Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or <hi>Contrition,</hi> by which the Latin Prieſts (<note n="a" place="bottom">Annot. <hi>2.</hi>
               </note> with no leſs injury to the Goſpel, than to the words; to their own great advantage, but ineſtimab'l loſs of ſouls,) have tranſlated them; that ſo they might tranſlate the Duty it ſelf, from Turning to Grieving-</p>
            <p>And I appeal to your <note n="b" place="bottom">Annot. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note>Bibles, whether in the whole New Teſtament you meet any word that declareth Grief neceſſary to ſalvation? I know St. <hi>James</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth it to the inſolent wanton rich, as a ſpecifik for That particular vice; but where do you find it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned as univerſally neceſſary for All kinds of ſinners?</p>
            <p>No, the Spirit of God knew, that the Grief
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:105166:11"/>
which iſſueth from Love, needs not be commanded, bicauſe it floweth naturally from that fountain: and the other grief, which proceeds from Fear, is not worth commanding, bicauſe it is not worth accepting, as having nothing but Torment.</p>
            <p>It is a great maim to the happineſs of mankind, but a much greater to the glory of God's goodneſs in Chriſt; that for That very reaſon it is enjoined, for which it is to be caſt out. For we are told, that Chriſt hath not redeemed us from Temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho he have from Eternal: but we muſt our ſelvs pay the temporal price, either in this life by voluntary grief and penances, proportional to our guilt, or in the other life by the fire of Purgatory, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Were this true, it would make one half of the Goſpel: And as the ſtory it ſelf is a great diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſufficiency, either of our Lord's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or his Love; if Thoſe could not purchaſe, or This would not grant us a full redemtion, as well from the one puniſhment as the other; ſo is it a greater to his Faithfulneſs, if he would concele from us the knowlege of what he had left neceſſary for us to do for our ſelvs.</p>
            <p>How many Souls muſt there now and in all ages ly frying in Purgatory, that had never com'n thither, if our Lord had been as kind as himſelf charactered the damned rich man, who did all his poſſib'l, that his brethren might have warning of that place of Torment! And how can ſuch poor ſouls ſcape the tentation, to blaſpheme that Neglect, that expoſed them to ſuch danger without warning; yea! That Treachery, that deluded them with promiſes of Full and Free pardon, without the Leaſt intimation of any grief or penance, neceſſary to be ſuffered either
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:105166:11"/>
in the one life, or the other! Were this true, the ſum of Chriſt's benefits muſt upon due computation riſe no higher than this, that <hi>he Redeemed us from Hell, and Betrayed us to Purgatory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, who hath ſhewen us a better eſcape than by Grief and Penance: The Love that caſteth out Fear, for this reaſon <hi>bicauſe it hath torment,</hi> will for the ſame reaſon caſt out ſuch Grief too: <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus nothing</hi> elſe is Needful, bicauſe <hi>nothing elſe Avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but Faith working by Love</hi>: Let That ſo inflame our hearts, as to melt them with a genuine ſorrow, purging them from all their droſs; and we need not fear any other Purgatory, nor ſeek any other Grief.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THOSE who make, not Repentance only, but the whole cours of a Religios life a ſtate of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are no leſs abuſed by the ſame ſpirit of Fear; which perpetually tormenteth them with doubts, and putteth them upon enquiries, whether they be in the ſtate of ſalvation or no? This they cal Self-examination, and their Teachers preſcribe it as a Spiritual duty frequently to be uſed, but eſpecially before the holy Communion. But if Fear will hear reaſon, it may conſider, That however Self-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be by all wiſe men of all Religions highly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, yet is it not to be exerciſed by All men in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To thoſe that are Enemies or Strangers to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as it is moſt neceſſary, ſo it is moſt eaſie: They need not much examining whether they be in a good ſtate or no? the firſt glance diſcovereth the contrary; the Queſtion proper to Them is this, Whether it be better to continu in That ſtate, or com out of it? To which queſtion more Serioſneſs than Time is required.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:105166:12"/>2, Thoſe who have forſaken their ſins, eſpecially thoſe who have for any conſiderabl time do'n ſo, may with as great Fruit as Pleaſure examin,</p>
            <p n="1">1. What progreſs they make? By comparing their preſent ſtature in Chriſt, with that of the laſt moneth or year, they may increaſe it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They may daily examin their daily actions, that they may beg pardon for what they ſhall find ill do'n, and pay thanks for what they ſhall find well; and take Warning from the One, and Corage from the Other, to do better the next day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But to queſtion their whole intereſt in Chriſt, whether they be Children or Enemies to God? to be anxioſly ſolicitos upon ſuch a queſtion as This, <note n="c" place="bottom">See Annot. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> I am not ſo ſure that it is a Religios, yea or a Safe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe at all; as I am that there are pernicios miſtakes in the Rules preſcribed for the performance; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in this, that there is too much partiality ſhewen for Fear againſt Hope; whereas plain Reaſon would perſwade us, to judge as favorably for our ſelvs as our evidences can permit, ſince ſeverity can do very litl (if any) good, but may do much hurt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It can do but litl good, for it can only repete the leſſon wherein we are already perfect: Our Fear of the worſt is the very Reaſon which puts us upon examining our ſelvs; when we ſeverely cenſure our ſelvs, this is no more but that we fear the worſt: ſo we end where we began: the whole exerciſe is running a circle of Fear, without the leaſt progreſs in Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is not only a Fruitleſs labor, but a Dangeros tentation, If we fear that God hateth Us, nature will promt us to hate God in our own defence; and ſo far to turn Atheiſts, as to wiſh there were no God.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:105166:12"/>
Such fear as this, Love certainly muſt caſt out, and it cannot be our duty to help It to caſt out Love; but on the contrary to cheriſh the Antecedent of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt'ls argument for the Conſequent's ſake: <hi>We love him, bicauſe he loved us firſt</hi>; and thence take ſpurr to ſerv him by the meſures of thankfulneſs, <hi>i.e.</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meſure.</p>
            <p n="2">II. WE HAVE ſeen what an enemy Fear is to Religion in general: Conſider we now how much it is ſo to our own in particular; and we ſhall ſoon diſcover that our enemies on Both hands, the Papiſts, and Nonconformiſts, are made ſuch by the ſpirit of Fear.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE PAPISTS (it is plain) have corrupted the Goſpel from a <hi>doctrine according to Godlineſs,</hi> to a doctrine according to Intereſt; eſpecially in its two great limbs, <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance. Articls</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> they have multiplied, and in every one multiplied difficulties, on purpoſe to make an infallib'l guide ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to determin them: and <hi>Conditions of Repentance</hi> they have multiplied and imbittered, on purpoſe to fright men, not out of their Sins, but out of their Reaſon and their Mony: They drive men To Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance by fear of Damnation, and From Repentance by fear of its Torments, and allow them no quiet but by the Prieſt's Abſolution.</p>
            <p>If now there be This only difference between Us and Them, that We Drive men to Repentance by the ſame Fear, and Torment them in it with the ſame Grief, but do not reliev them by the ſame Remedies; we have much leſs reaſon to wonder, that ſom half-conſidering peop'l run from us to them, than that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:105166:13"/>
ſo many ſcape the temtation; eſpecially ſeeing how greedily Fear and Pain catch at any (however impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bab'l) offer of help.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the NONCONFORMISTS on the other ſide are poſſeſſed by the ſame evil ſpirit, needeth no other evidence but this, That they are frighted from our Communion, by ſuch things as themſelvs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Indifferent. <hi>Fears</hi> and <hi>Jealouſies</hi> fill both pages, both in their Religion and Polity. Their whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is ſowred by the melancholy humor; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſy both to Themſelvs and others, eſpecially their Governors.</p>
            <p>It is not poſſib'l in fewer and plainer words, both to Deſcribe and Condemn this unhappy ſpirit, than we have found do'n by our Apoſt'l: <hi>You have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceved the spirit of Fear, but of Power, of Love, and of a Sound mind.</hi> Love is oppoſed to Fear; Power, to Weakneſs; a Sound mind, to a Pained one.</p>
            <p>I wiſh he had never ſpoken worſe, who ſaid, that to be much and long troubled with any ſcruple, is a certain indication of a weak and cowardly ſpirit; bicauſe if the weight be conſiderably greater in either ſcale, the ſuſpens will ſoon be ended; if not, the cauſe of doubt muſt be very light; and to be much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about light maters, muſt needs ſignifie great weakneſs.</p>
            <p>Objection, <hi>What then? muſt we think any ſin litl? or can we be too fearful of the leaſt</hi>?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Diſtinguiſh between Sin <hi>Known,</hi> and Sin <hi>Suspected.</hi> We muſt more fear the leaſt <hi>Known</hi> ſin, than the moſt cruel death: But to fear that which we only <hi>Suspect</hi> to be ſin, as much as that which God hath declared to be ſo; This is it ſelf a ſin againſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:105166:13"/>
God, bicauſe it maketh our own Suſpicion equal to his Laws; and againſt our Selvs, our Country, and our Governors; bicauſe we troubl them without competent reaſon.</p>
            <p>Our Lord's parab'l will illuſtrate this: <hi>The Gospel is a great Lord's Feſt</hi>; and at ſuch a Tab'l you may eaſily diſcern the Welbred from the Clown, by the frankneſs of his cariage. He payeth all due deference to his great Inviter; careful not to do or ſay any thing that may offer him the leaſt diſguſt, nor to neglect any thing that may in any degree pleaſe him, ſpecially to cary himſelf with ſuch a decent mixture of Humility, and Chearfulneſs, as may ſpeak his joy and thankfulneſs for the favor do'n him. In the Other, you find not the leaſt air of chearfulneſs; but a Fear to miſ-behave himſelf in every motion of hand or ey, every bit that he bringeth To his mouth, and every word that he uttereth Out of it; and thus by too much fear of misbehaving himſelf falleth into it.</p>
            <p>Thus differ the truly Religios and Superſtitios; the One ſerveth God with a Careful, yet Chearful ſpirit; will rather incurr the worſt death, than the leaſt ſin; yet deſpiſeth litl ſcrupls as unworthy to diſcompoſe his frank ſpirit: the Other diſordereth the whole frame of his converſation, by timoroſnes in ſuch maters as he Knoweth to be Indifferent, yet Suſpecteth to be evil: a mere Spiritual Clown!</p>
            <p>Which of the two is beſt manners in the Kingdom of God, our Apoſt'l taght both the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> Both thoſe Churches were troubled with a ſcruple concerning <hi>meats offered to Idols</hi>; a ſcruple the more conſiderab'l, bicauſe himſelf had taght them, that it is impoſſib'l <hi>to partake the Lord's tab'l, and the tab'l of Devils</hi>: How doth the Apoſt'l treat this
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:105166:14"/>
great queſtion? Why, he ſpurns it, as no other way conſiderab'l, but in the miſchief it might do to the peace of the Churches: <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not meat and drink, but Righteoſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghost: for he that in theſe things ſerveth Christ, is accepted of God, and approved of men: Let us therefor purſue the things that make for Peace, &amp;c.</hi> Apply this deciſion of that Great controverſy, to thoſe pety ones that troub'l our peace, it will Determin them them the beſt way, by Deſtroying them.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom of Heaven is no more <hi>Veſture</hi> and <hi>Gesture,</hi> than it is <hi>Meat</hi> and <hi>Drink</hi>; Righteoſneſs, and Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt, are ſtill the beſt manners in ſight of God and Man: and to purſue the things that make for peace, is ſtill the beſt cours in ſuch litl queſtions as endanger it.</p>
            <p>We have therefore nothing to enquire but this, Who beſt conform to this Rule? They who in ſuch ſmall maters ſubmit to their Governors, or they who diſturb the peace of the Church? However obvios the anſwer be, it is more obvios what the ſpirit is, that maketh men in ſuch things troubleſom to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, and their country: <note n="d" place="bottom">See Annoi. ult.</note>Nothing certainly but fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs can make a man ſo to fly his own ſhadow, as to run into the ditch.</p>
            <p>We ſee the Apoſt'l thinketh no way better to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv the peace, than by ſettling our Fundamental Poſition: Peace and Joy in the holy Ghoſt are the beſt manners in the Kingdom of Heaven, moſt pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God and man, and the beſt preſervative both of Publik and Private quiet: which is in other words, <hi>The Gospel deſigneth not our Fear, but our Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:105166:14"/>I HOPE I have now effectually performed the task I undertook, which was not to exhauſt all the contents of my Text, but to dig up that root of bitterneſs, which ſo undeſervedly troubleth the world, and eſpecially the Miniſters of the Goſpel; and moſt eſpecially thoſe of our Own Church, who are of all others moſt unhappy, becauſe whether they they prevail or no, they are ſure to create them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs enemies.</p>
            <p>If they prevail not, then are they treated by the impenitent, as our Lord was by the Devils: <hi>What have we to do with thee? art thou com'n to torment us</hi>? If they do prevail, they do no better than journy-work; either for the Papiſts, to whom the Sanguin run for Anodynes of Abſolution; or for the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformiſts, to whom the Melancholy run for food for their unſatisfiab'l ſcruples: So we are hated on All hands; by our enemies in Religion, bicauſe we will not torment our ſelvs with Their fears; and by our enemies in Irreligion, bicauſe they ſuſpect we will betray them to that place of torment, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hate us for renouncing.</p>
            <p>But in all that I have ſpoken to this too neceſſary purpoſe, how ſhort am I falen of the requires of my Text? I have not be'n able to diſplay any of the <hi>glad tidings of good things</hi>: cannot ſay, as St. <hi>John</hi> doth, <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken, that your joy may be full</hi>; or as St. <hi>Peter, We rejoice with joy unſpeakable and glorios.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet have we made no ſlight advance toward all this, if we have caſt out Fear: For this viſor once pluckt off, holineſs will ſo diſplay its beauty, that we ſhall ſoon find <hi>Plato</hi>'s aphoriſm verified in its charms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:105166:15"/>And now I have mentioned <hi>Plato,</hi> I ſhall vouch not only his Opinion, but his Experience: He ſpoke ſo much, and ſo well of the excellences and powers of Love, that the beſt Fathers of our Religion have not diſdained to write after his copy, ſtiling him the Chriſtian Philoſopher. <note n="a" place="bottom">Plutarch. <hi>in</hi> Dione.</note> 
               <hi>Dion,</hi> the greateſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man in <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> went to <hi>Athens</hi> to hear him, and afteward prevailed with him to take a voyage to <hi>Sicily,</hi> to convert his unhappy Prince, miſerably corrupted by ill education. He came, and his Firſt labor was to encorage his hearers, that they ſhould not be afraid of vertu: This he perpetually inculca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and having removed that prejudice, he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the whole Court, and eſpecially the young Prince, into ſuch a love of virtu and himſelf, that never was Lover more fond or jelos: He would not endure that <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould go out of his Palace, hardly out of his ſight; was impatient that any beſide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhould have any intereſt in <hi>Plato</hi>'s love, made <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> Lord of all his power and wealth; and had he not be'n countermined upon reaſons of State, was in a fair way to have reſigned up to the love of <hi>Plato</hi> and vertu, that unjuſt Kingdom, from which he was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward baniſhed.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Diogenes</hi> upbraided <hi>Plato,</hi> ſaying, he had flattered a Tyran; and I doubt not, but ſom of the ſame Cynical humor will object againſt me, that I would have the Clergy flatter the Peop'l.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> owned the charge, and ſo do I. It is our work to flatter our peop'l, juſt as <hi>Plato</hi> did <hi>Dionyſius</hi>; not In their luſts, but Out of them; not for our Own benefit, but Theirs: We muſt out-flatter <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:105166:15"/>
yea we muſt out-flater <hi>Plato,</hi> we muſt flater like our Apoſt'l, the greateſt flatterer in the world: Read his Epiſtl's with application; ſee if you can match them for tenderneſs in any of the Romances: He ſaith in one of them, that he <hi>had espouſed his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples to Chriſt</hi>; and in that and all the reſt he courted them with all the arts and inſinuations of a wooer.</p>
            <p>And he plainly telleth us, that His and Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion require it: <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Embaſſadors for Chriſt: as if God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, be ye reconciled to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is a great improvement of my Text, and giveth us title to a nobler welcom: We are not only Meſſengers, to bring Tidings of peace; but Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, to Negotiate for its acceptance: to Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate as in the Perſon of Chriſt, yet in the Poſture of ſupplicants. Chriſt again depoſeth himſelf from his Majeſty, and creepeth to his rebellios ſubjects like a petitioner, begging in moſt humb'l manner (what? that they would not again deſtroy him? no, but) that they would permit him to ſave them: and in this poſture are we commiſſioned to repreſent him.</p>
            <p>True, Embaſſadors, if they find it neceſſary, may ſharpen their importunities for peace, by diſplaying the terrib'lneſs and unavoidabl'neſs of That deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which is to be the portion of the irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab'l; provided they do it with ſuch tenderneſs, as may ſpeak their Maſter's goodneſs equal to his power; more loth to deſtroy them, than themſelvs are to periſh.</p>
            <p>A preacher of the Goſpel (ſure) muſt not com ſhort in kindneſs to a prophet vnder the Law: yet in this poſture doth <hi>Ezekiel</hi> repreſent God: <hi>As I live faith the Lord, I deſire not the death of him that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:105166:16"/>
dieth, but rather that he will turn and live: turn ye, turn ye, why will ye dy, ye hous of Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do ye ſay, that he offereth ſalvation only to a few Elect? Behold, he ſaith, yea he ſweareth, that he deſireth not the death even <hi>of Him that dieth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The difference is very obſervab'l, which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior puts between the two ſentences. The bleſſed are invited to the <hi>Kingdom prepared for them from the beginning of the world:</hi> but the curſed are diſpatched <hi>to the fire that was prepared</hi> (not for Them, but) <hi>for the Divel and his Angels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is therefore great difference between Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation: The one is a Poſitive act, the other a mere reterition, which doth not deprive men of Sufficient, yea Abundant means of ſalvation: The Reprobates are ſo far from prepared for hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, that the fire is not prepared for Them, but only for the Divel and his Angels. Many indeed will at laſt find it their portion, but by their own carving: God uſeth all the means that a Wiſe and Good father can, to hinder them from it: His Wiſdom will not work miracl's except in caſes extraordinary; and in ſuch caſes (poſſibly) he may by irreſiſtib'l grace qualify ſom few choſen veſſels for ſom extraordinary ſervice; but in ordinary, he offereth no ſuch violence to Nature, thogh he uſe all means ſuitab'l to it, for the benefit of the creature whom he endeavoreth to make happy.</p>
            <p>His Laws are far from grievos, he requireth no Satisfaction for the paſt, but Amendment for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur; and That Amendment too, he requireth for This only reaſon, that we may be as happy both now and hereafter as we are capab'l- We are fond of our hedg-fruit bicauſe we know no better, but he
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:105166:16"/>
provideth for us bankets infinitly more delicios; and he Inviteth, he Intreateth; if this will not prevail, he Driveth us, to this purpoſe only that we may be happy in his fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> broght the moſt diſſolute to the love of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu, thogh he had no other motive but its mere beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, unendowed with any other reward than its ſelf.</p>
            <p>But we have commiſſion to promiſe you a dowry great as its beauty, and to embelliſh that beauty with moſt glorios additions. The glory of God's love ſhineth infinitely brighter <hi>in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> than in That of the Sun, which was the beſt glaſs <hi>Plato</hi> had to ſee him in: <hi>The earneſt of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance</hi> (never heard of by <hi>Plato</hi>) is infinitely more valuabl for the inheritance it ſecureth; the joys of Hope being incomparably more raviſhing, than thoſe which taſt nothing but the preſent.</p>
            <p>And is it not both very Sad and very Admirab'l, that <hi>Plato</hi> under ſuch diſadvantages, ſhould ſo ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor a diſſolute company with naked vertu, and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf its preacher; yet We with ſuch great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, prevail no otherwiſe than to drive our hearers into hatred both of our meſſage and our ſelvs? Can any thing be more worth our Conſideration?</p>
            <p>When we have duly eonſidered, we ſhall find that <hi>Plato</hi> better deſerved the title of a preacher of the Goſpel, than moſt have do'n for many ages: For his preaching was in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s ſtile; he preached not the ſpirit of Fear, but of Love: But the modern way hath be'n quite contrary; we have heard litl of Love, but much of Fear, and our ſucceſs hath be'n as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent as our meſſage.</p>
            <p>Now ſhould I apply all this to the ſervice both of the Goſpel and its Miniſters: but as I have not Time,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:105166:17"/>
ſo (if what I have ſaid be well conſidered) there will be no Need: Not in behalf of the Goſpel, bicauſe if it be once freed from this vizor, its beauty will need no other perſuaſive to draw us to its embraces: Not in behalf of its Miniſters, bicauſe your very Preſence upon this occaſion, deſerveth applaus, but ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth exhortation: I ſhall therefor ſay no more, but pray, that as you have begun a good work, you may go on proſperouſly in it; that your kindneſs to thoſe who have at leaſt a dubl titl to it, may return a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fold in bleſſings upon you and yours, both in This world and the better; that <hi>the peace of God which paſſeth all underſtanding, may keep your hearts and minds</hi> &amp;c.</p>

For whereas <hi>[Poenitentia]</hi> in no other caſe ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth any more than <hi>[Repentance]</hi> i. e. <hi>Grief of mind,</hi> they have enlarged it to ſignifie <hi>[Penance,]</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a further <hi>puniſhment of Body or Purs:</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this dubly fals ground they have thus built their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that is fallen into ſin after Baptiſm, cannot be reſtored but by the Sacrament of Penance, which conſiſteth of three parts,</hi> Contrition, Confeſſion, and Satisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> Contrition <hi>is grief of mind in ſence of guilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred. Guilt importeth obligation to Puniſhment; from which the ſinner cannot be abſolved, but by the

Prieſt, to whom Chriſt hath given power to bind and looſe: This power the Prieſt cannot exerciſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowledge of the guilt, wherewith the Penitent is bound: therefor</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.

               <p n="3">
                  <hi>3. The Prieſt muſt not grant Abſolution, without ſuch</hi> Penance <hi>as may bear ſom proportion to the crime. For</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Trent</hi> meeting) <hi>Chriſt hath ſatisfied for the Crime, but not for the Puniſhment;</hi> which the B. of <hi>Condom</hi> hath made eaſier to be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, but not eaſier to he Believed, by this explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>That he hath changed a greater puniſhment into a leſſer,</hi> i. e. <hi>Eternal into Temporal. If therefor the Penitent fail either of fully confeſſing every ſin, or of fully performing the penalty impoſed; Either of Theſe, or ſom other deſects, muſt be abundantly puniſhed with the fire of Purgatory, which cometh ſhort of Hell only in duration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we look for Reaſons for all this, we ſhall find none in Scripture, but abundanco in the world. All the <hi>Abbies, Priories, Chantries,</hi> &amp;c. in Chriſtendom, All the pomp and grandeur of the court of <hi>Rome</hi> &amp;c. are ſo many benefits of this Sacrament to the Clergy; and aſſurance of Abſolution upon eaſie Penance, to the Laity.</p>
               <p>For can it be, but the Prieſt must be highly reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to who's Tribunal the greateſt must creep, to who's ears they muſt communicate their moſt ſhameful ſins, and from who's mouth they must receiv their ſentence? with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out who's help they cannot hope for pardon, and by who's help they are ſecure of it? Or can any perſon of bowels
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:105166:19"/>
think any coſt too much, to pay off the intolerabl torments, wherein their own or their deareſt friends ſouls may fry, they know not how long, in the flames of Purgatory? It was but lately proved that a poor Maid gave, not only all ſhe was worth, but a Bond for a greater Summ, to a gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Prieſt, who refuſed on any cheaper terms to free her father's ſoul; and how often they meet ſuch bargains in the fears of dying perſons, it is impoſſibl to compute.</p>
               <p>God be bleſſed we have reformed from all the baſe gains which are gotten by the word <hi>Penance:</hi> but we ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain too ſtrong a tincture of its firſt princip'l, in point of Fear and conſequent Grief, derived from the word <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> the very ſound whereof ſtriketh ſo hard upon our minds, that we cannot but believ, the great Duty which is expreſsed by That Word, muſt be performed by That Paſſion.</p>
               <p>We do (indeed) well to diſtinguiſh between two kinds of Grief; and we do well to declare, that Grief which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth from Fear, is nothing worth, if it bring us not to that which iſſueth from Love: But ſtill we stick to This, that Repentance is Grief: and that however it be not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted until it amount to Contrition, yet doth it ordinarily begin at Attrition, to which therefor we must firſt apply our ſelvs. But</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> What reaſon have we to believe that <hi>Attrition</hi> will bring us to <hi>Contrition?</hi> Do we conclude them neer of kin, bieauſe they wear the ſame ſurname? Let us not look ſo much to the Name, as the Family. Fear (we know) is no friend to Love; and why ſhall we believ that Grief which iſſueth from the One, muſt be our beſt mediator to the Other?</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Why muſt wee needs make our firſt addreſſes to Grief of either kind? Grief is an Enemy, but Love is a Friend: It is the firſt mover in all our affections, even thoſe which
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:105166:19"/>
ſeem moſt oppoſit to it: We neither Hate, nor Fear, nor Griev, but by the dictates of Love: And the <hi>Love of God</hi> will <hi>conſtrain us</hi> to (do, what without it we can hardly obtein of our ſelvs) griev when we have offended him. If we perform this great duty in the proper ſence of the words, <hi>Turn to God with all our heart;</hi> the <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> will not fail to follow; nor hath the Scripture been deficient, thogh it have not preſcribed them.</p>
               <p>This is not a bare contention about words, but the moſt practical conſideration in the world: Holineſs of life is highly concerned in it, as having ſuffered more by This than All other errors: For on One ſide, men are Fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the apprehenſion of Grief, as an enemy to our quiet; and on the Other ſide, they are encoraged to hope, that this may with more eaſe, and equal ſafety be undergon, <hi>when the days com wherein we ſhall ſay, we have no pleaſure in them,</hi> or when that hour cometh, when we ean do nothing elſe but griev.</p>
               <p>This conceit, however diſcountenanced by Divines, yea by Experience, which ſheweth that generally men dy as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent as they live; yet ſo partial are we to our ſins and ſloth, that the word <hi>[Repent]</hi> ſhall carry it againſt all the weight that can be laid againſt it.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot but applaud the amendment our Church hath made in the first ſentence of our Liturgy. Of old it was, <hi>At what time ſoever a Sinner ſhall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent from the bottom of his heart, I will put all his wickedneſs out of my remembrance, ſaith the Lord;</hi> which was wont to be pleaded in behalf of death-bed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: But now the very words of the Prophet are ſet forth, <hi>When the wicked man turneth away from wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive:</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:105166:20"/>
which may infer, that the promiſe is made, not to Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but Turning; and to ſuch Turning too, as proceedenh to contrary actions. Were our Tranſlation of the New Teſtament ſo reformed, that in ſtead of <hi>Repentance</hi> we might read, <hi>Turning, Changing, Amendment,</hi> or ſom ſuch honest word, as would faithfully render the Original; it would remove that unhappy tentation, which hath ſo much diſcountenanced Converſion, by repreſenting it both Hard and Needleſs in Youth, Eaſie and Safe on the Death-bed.</p>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:105166:20"/>
appeareth most evident in the twelfth chapter of the ſame Epiſt'l, verſ. <hi>20.

               <p>He had in his former Epiſt'l reproved them for not cenſuring a moſt ſcandalous perſon, <hi>1</hi> Cor. <hi>5. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported commonly that there is fornication among you, and ſuch fornication as is not ſo much as named among the Gentiles, that one ſhould have his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wife; and ye are puffed up, and have not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mourned, that he that hath do'n this deed might be taken away from among you,</hi> i. e. in the ſenſe now mentioned, <hi>you have encouraged him, and not puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him by excommunication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Epiſt'l he taketh notice of that affair: in the ſeeond chapter he juſtifieth himſelf for having grieved them, approveth of their obedience, and adviſeth them to abſolve the criminal, now ſufficiently puniſhed. And in this chapter taketh occaſion to reſume it, as appeareth by v. <hi>8. For tho I made you ſory with a Letter, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent thogh I did repent;</hi> and more plainly v. <hi>12. thogh I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cauſe that did the wrong,</hi> (i. e. the inceſtuous Son,) <hi>nor for his cauſe that ſuffered wrong,</hi> (i. e. the injured Faether,) <hi>but that our care for you in the ſight of God might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you.</hi>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:105166:21"/>The eleventh verſe, which ſetteth forth the fruits of their ſorrow, is cloſed with this Epiphonema: <hi>In all things you have approved your ſelvs to be clear in this mater:</hi> which plainly ſheweth that the ſorrow which he ſo applaudeth, was not ſorrow for any crime of their Own, and conſequently was not ſuch Repentance as is neceſſary for every ſinner in respect to his Own ſins; but an Idiom of the Apoſt'l, <hi>whereby he expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Eccleſiaſtical cenſures: which in the tenth vers he compareth with Civil puniſhments, ſaying that the one worketh the greateſt good without the leaſt ill conſequence, but the other</hi> worketh death.</p>
               <p>This expoſition ſeemeth more neceſsary to enlighten the Apoſtl's diſcours, than to anſwer what may be thence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. For whether you accept it or no, you cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voed acknowledging that the diſcours is very obſcure in many of its clauſes, and in its whole deſign: and This very Obſcurity is ſufficient to diſable it from ſtabliſhing a fundamental doctrine.</p>
               <p>Heb. <hi>12.12.</hi> We find <hi>Repentance from dead works</hi> Owned for a <hi>Foundation</hi> of the Gospel: Had he ſaid <hi>Repentance FOR dead works,</hi> Grief might have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſom title; but the partic'l <hi>FROM</hi> importeth more than a Paſſion, and no leſs than Turning: to <hi>Turn from dead works</hi> is a good phraſe in Grammar, as well as a good work in Morality; but to <hi>Griev From an ill work,</hi> is a stile unpractiſed in any language that I know,</p>
               <p>Yet this is a Foundation, and as ſuch oght to be firmly laid: Can we then juſtify our Lord <hi>as no leſs faithful than</hi> Moſes <hi>in all his hous,</hi> if nether by himſelf nor any of his Apoſt ls, he left any One Precept, ſo clear as to be above danger of mistake; but we muſt retein for all our knowledge of our Fundamental duty, to an accidental

But upon full conſideration we muſt find, that the Apoſt'l cannot mean ſuch an Examination as ſhall leav us in ſuſpenſe, or forbid our Communicating, (for the very ſame breath abſolutely requireth us to do it without any exception or limitation,) but ſuch as ſhall prevent the crime he there reproveth, which was their doing it in an unworthy Manner: To which end it is not neceſſary to examin, what Right we have to the Lord's Supper, but what Reverence? not what we have already do'n, but what we are about to do? And whatever ſelf-examination exceedeth this end, will be Impertinent; whatever hindreth the Performance of the later clauſe of the Precept, (<hi>ſo let him Eat,</hi>) will be Oppoſit to the Apostl's intentions, as at large is proved in the foregoing Treatiſe, and is now further confirmed; if the practice of ſuch ſelf-examination be uſeleſs and

prejudicial, not only in order to the Sacrament, but to all other good purpoſes.</p>
               <p>The other word, which ſeemeth expreſly to require us to examin our intereſt in Chriſt, we meet <hi>2</hi> Cor. <hi>13.5.

               <p>This is the plain deſign of the precept: it is preſcribed as a ſpecifik againſt a particular evil, to cauterize the proud fleſh, to lance the ſwelling apoſtem, to divert the ſharp humor, from our neighbors to our own weakneſs or wickedneſs; to paſs from judging another to judging

our ſelvs; wherein we ſhall have better Evidence, better Autority, and better Succeſs.</p>
               <p>And what ſucceſs doth the Apoſt'l promiſe? Is it, thou ſhalt be frighted at thy danger, and confounded with thy guilt? This (indeed) one would expect, as moſt ſerviceab'l to the purpoſe in hand: but bicauſe it is leaſt ſo, to the general deſign of the Gospel, the Apoſt'l turneth ſhort to a quite contrary inference, <hi>and then ſhall he have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</hi> How careful, that no particular precept ſhould croſs the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal! that his Precepts ſhould have no wors conſequent than his Reproofs!

               <p>Our Apost'l hath plainly enogh told us, that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aequate mark is <hi>Faith working by Love:</hi> If hereby we examin our ſelvs, the work will be neither tedios in the Performance, nor tormenting in the Iſſu.</p>
               <p>Not tedios in the Performance: for it cannot (ſure) require much skill, time, or labor, to ſearch whether I love or no? I look no further than mine own bowels for aſſurance, whether I love this or that neighbor or kinſman; and why may they not with the ſame eaſe and certainty ſecure me whether I love God or no?</p>
               <p>Nor tormenting in the Iſſu: for at worſt I ſhall be put to no wors penance or task, than to labor for a greater Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Love; and all Love's tasks are full of pleaſure. To ly down and afflict my ſelf with grief for want of Love, or (as is preſcribed in the ſecond place) for want of grief, or with fear for want of any kind of grief <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is more likely to quench Love than to inflame it. But to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:105166:24"/>
apply my affections to the original of all lovelineſs, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite beauties of God in his own perfections, the glories of his goodneſs towards his creatures, and to my ſelf in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is certainly of all exerciſes moſt proper for this end, and moſt pleaſant in the practiſe: This muſt needs be the fitteſt ground for the <hi>fruits of the Spirit, Love, Joy, Peace.</hi>

               <p>The Greeks gave it a name which expreſseth its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Latins gave it one that expreſseth its Operaetions, for <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> ſheweth it in its Cauſe; <hi>Superſtition,</hi> in its Effects: That, ſignifieth <hi>Fearfulneſs towards God;</hi> This, ſignifyeth <hi>Overdoing</hi> our duty toward him: yet Both agree in the ſame apprehenſions. For when the Greeks deſcribe its Operations, they paint them with the very ſame colours as do the Latins, witneſs <hi>Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi>'s Character: and again, when the Latins define its Nature, they do it by the very name which the Greeks have given it; witneſs <hi>Varro,</hi> who maketh this the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential difference between Religion and Superſtition; that <hi>the Superſtitios Fear the Gods, while the Religios reverence them as Parents, but do not fear them as Enemies:</hi> and what is this other than St <hi>Paul</hi>'s do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? <hi>You have not received the ſpirit of Fear, but you have received the ſpirit of Adoption.</hi> Seneca more <hi>Laconically</hi> giveth us account both of its Nature and Effects: <hi>Superſtitio error inſanus, amandos ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, quos colit, violat:</hi> 
                  <q>Superſtition is a mad error;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:105166:24"/>
whom it ſhould love, it feareth; whom it worſhippeth, it ſlandereth.</q> And more largely in another place: <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui intueri vacet, quae patiuntur ſuperſtitioſi, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies tam indecora honeſtis, tam indigna liberis, tam diſſimilia ſanis, ut nemo fuerit dubitaturus furere eos, ſi cum paucioribus furerent.</hi> 
                  <q>If any one be at leiſure to view what the ſuperſtitious ſuffer, you ſhall find things ſo diſgraceful for gentlemen, ſo unworthy of free men, ſo unſuitabl to ſound men, that no man would doubt but they were mad, were they mad with fewer companions.</q> Give us who can, a better explication of thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which call it, <hi>the ſpirit of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> and oppoſe it to the <hi>ſpirit of Power, of Love, and of a Sound mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And all this St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke of the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which had been nothing elſe but Superſtition, had not God authoriſed it: For as throughout the Old Teſtament Fear is Godlineſs; ſo in all the ceremonies of the Law, Obedience hallowed the exerciſes.</p>
               <p>For as I ſaid but now, Superstition, however exploded by the Wiſeſt, ever poſſeſsed the Weakeſt, that is, the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of mankind: And at That time, the world was not capabl to have it Cured, but only Fomented.</p>
               <p>And that upon That very account the Law impoſed ſuch exerciſes as the Gospel forbids, we have a clear diſcours <hi>of</hi> St, <hi>Paul,</hi> in the beginning of the fourth chapter to the <hi>Galatians Now I ſay, that the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a ſervant, thogh he be Lord of all, but is under tutors and governors, until the time appointed of the father; even ſo we, when we were children, were in bondage under the Elements</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>a, b, c,) of the world. But when the fulneſs of time was com, God ſent forth his Son made of a woman made under the law, to redeem
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:105166:25"/>
them that were under the law, that we might receiv the adoption of ſons. And bicauſe ye are ſons, God hath ſent forth the ſpirit of his ſon into your hearts, crying Abba, father. Wherefor thou art no more a ſervant, but a ſon; and if a ſon, then an heir of God throgh Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this diſcours you have a full diſcovery of Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, its Nature, its Operations, and its Abolition. <hi>1.</hi> Its Nature, childiſhneſs, requiring the diſcipline of Fear to govern it: <hi>2.</hi> Its Exerciſes, childiſh, weak, and beggar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Elements, the firſt letters that children learn. <hi>3.</hi> Its Cure, the ſpirit of Adoption, ſent forth into the hearts of Gods children now grown up to manhood.</p>
               <p>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this diſcours how juſtly doth he ground his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulation, ver. <hi>9. Now after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the weak and beggarly elements, wherein you deſire again to be in bondage? When I was a child, I ſpake as a child, I underſtood as a child, I thoght as a child, but when I became a man, I put away childiſh things.</hi> When mankind was unripe in Age, it was ſo in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, and no wonder its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes ſhould be ſuitabl. It was governed by the rod, and buſied about ceremonies; but now it is com to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, you are called to have <hi>fellowſhip with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and with his Son Jeſus Chriſt, 1</hi> Jo. <hi>1.3. to be partakers of the Divine Nature, 2</hi> Pet. <hi>1.4.</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of his Wiſdom and Holines, his Loves, and his Hates: and therefore to <hi>approve things that are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</hi> Phil. <hi>1.10.</hi> How is it then, that you ſtill ſpend your time, your ſtrength, and your labour in whipping of topps, bandying of balls, and playing with nuts, no leſs childiſh in your imaginations, than the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> could either Find, or Make you?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:105166:25"/>Thus did the Apostl rebuke the <hi>Galatians,</hi> and what would he have ſaid to this and ſom preceding generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which have outgo'n both Jews and Gentiles in this childiſhneſs? and that eſpecially in two great respects.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1.</hi> We find not that either Jews or Gentiles diſquieted themſelvs about maters of mere Belief, thogh they did about maters of Action.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Nor that they diſturbed the peace of their Nations, thogh they did that of their own Minds.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>1. They diſquieted not themſelvs with maters of mere belief, conceiving that the true worſhip of God conſiſted not in Diſputing, but Imitating his Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</hi> But we, in mere honor to the glorious promiſes which are made to Believing, have multiplied Articls of Faith, and Queſtions upon every Articl, and Doubts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every Queſtion; and every one of theſe we call maters of Faith, and mater of Faith we take to be mater of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and if we miſtake in the One, we believ we ſhall miſs of the Other. Hence is it that <hi>Catholik</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik</hi> among the Romaniſts, <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Heterodox</hi> among the Beformed, ſound ſo terribly as to fray many a good man, if not quite out of his Wits, yet (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as bad) out of his Corage to uſe them.</p>
               <p>Reaſon, we are told, muſt not preſume to medl in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Faith, but we muſt deny our ſelvs, no leſs in our Rational faculties, than in our Senſual appetites; for it is no leſs impious to Disbeliev God's word, than to Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey his command: And in This, they speak, not only Truth, but Reaſon, which therefor they juſtify by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing.</p>
               <p>But, as it is in Moral vertues, ſo is it in Faith; it lieth between two extremes, Defect on One hand, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs on the Other. It is no leſs frequent in maters of Faith than in Manners, <hi>to teach for Doctrines of God
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:105166:26"/>
the Commandments of Men;</hi> in the One tormenting the Mind with needleſs <hi>Myſteries,</hi> as in the Other, the Body with needleſs Penances.</p>
               <p>But to Faith what could have be'n more incongruos? <hi>Repentance,</hi> indeed, in its very name carrieth a ſower countenance, importing a mortification of our Natural appetites, and conſequently a pain to our hearts: But <hi>Faith,</hi> who's proper object <hi>is Glad-tidings,</hi> might justly claim, not only freedom from Pain, but ſuch fulneſs of joy, as ſhould caſt out the grief even of Repentance; whereas now it is made the harder taskmaſter of the two. For however painful it be, it is not impoſſibl, to <hi>cut off hands,</hi> or <hi>feet,</hi> or <hi>pull out eys;</hi> but our Reaſon is not only the Ey, but the Heart of our Soul, not to be cutt or pluckt off: Tormented indeed it may be, and moſt in thoſe who have most improved it, as the clearest ey is always tenderest: and ſtupified it may be, yet not to ſuch a privation, but that it will ever and anon feel anxios fits of melancholy, doubting of the truth of ſom things which are received as matters of Faith, and conſequently of our title to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for want of Faith.</p>
               <p>Few can at all times boſt with the Phyſician, <hi>there are not impoſſibilities enogh in Religion,</hi> and fewer with the Father, <hi>credo quia impoſſibile eſt.</hi> It is hard to apprehend, how any thing can be at once True and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſib'l; but to make the very Impoſſibility, a reaſon why I ſhould believ it, let St. <hi>Paul</hi> judg, whether this be not <hi>cum ratione inſanire.</hi> For when he would perſwade a belief of the Reſurrection, he did not urge the impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but the contrary: <hi>Why ſhould it be thoght a thing incredib'l that God ſhould raiſe the dead</hi>? and when hereupon <hi>Feſtus</hi> charged him with madneſs, he replied, <hi>I am not mad, but ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs.</hi> What Soberneſs can there be in a quite
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:105166:26"/>
contrary argument, yea, what plainer madneſs, than to talk ſuch extravagant inconſiſtences, as infer credibility from impoſſibility?</p>
               <p>What other ſpirit but that of Fear could thus confound mens underſtandings? Fear, of all paſſions the moſt infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating; Fear, which most frequently blindeth the moſt piercing judgments; Fear, which maketh every ſhadow a man, and every buſh a thief, and every thief a murtherer; Fear, and only fear, can ſo diſorder our minds, that we think it equally neceſsary to ſalvation, to believ the nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Schoolmen, and the Doctrines of the Goſpel; and diſtruſt our intereſt in Chriſt, if we can neither ſatisfie, nor deſtroy our reaſon, when it cannot comply with contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, which he never enjoyned us to believ.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <hi>2. Much leſs did they embroil the publik peace with controverſies in Religion:</hi> Whereas among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, there is not any question ſo nice in point of Belief, or ſo ſlight in point of Worſhip; but hath be'n able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage whole Families in the fiercest contentions, and whole Nations in moſt bloody wars; yea, for two or three ages there hath hardly b'en a rebellion, whereof Religion hath not be'n either the Real or Pretended cauſe.</p>
               <p>And This, as it is more notorioſly ſcandalous than the now mentioned diſquiets of private perſons, ſo is it (if poſſibl) more directly oppoſit to the moſt earneſt endeavours of the Goſpel: which doth indeed very frequently exhort us to joy and comfort in our own ſpirits; but much more earneſtly and ſolenly provoke us to love and peace toward others: Yea, Love maketh ſo great a figure in almoſt every page of the New Teſtament, that it ſeemeth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Supreme, but almoſt the Only grace: It looks like unlawful to fight upon Any occaſion whatſoever; but to fight for Religion, ſeemeth no leſs contradictious, than to fight for Love: And that the Only Religion which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:105166:27"/>
to <hi>beat ſwords into plow-ſhares,</hi> ſhould be the only religion that forgeth plow-ſhares to ſwords; is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticiſm ſo irrational, as nothing but Fear could have produced.</p>
               <p>The ſumm therefor is This: The light of Nature a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with that of the Gospel, to declare, that we are not to ſerv God for Fear, but Love: What our Apoſt'l oppoſeth to a <hi>Sound mind,</hi> that our Philoſopher caleth a <hi>mad error</hi>; but the madneſs is incomparably greater in a Chriſtian, than ever it was, or indeed could poſſibly be, in a Heathen: For as it is the utmost extravagance of frenſy, to beat our ſelvs, or our friends; ſo in this we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Heathen, that many among <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, but none among Them, diſturb their own ſouls with anxios doubts concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Faith, or imbroil their Nation with bloody wars upon difference of opinions in Doctrine or Worſhip; ſo is it more monſtroſly mad in a Chriſtian, by how much more clearly and ſolenly the Gospel hath labored to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the one and the other, by declaring that <hi>we have not receved</hi> the ſlaviſh and mad <hi>ſpirit of Fear,</hi> but <hi>of Power and Love, and of a ſound mind.</hi> And again, that <hi>The Kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteoſneſs, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt, for he that in theſe things ſerveth Chriſt, is accepted of God, and approved of men:</hi> This upright and erect walking, this frank and chearful, this manly yea divine freedom of ſpirit, as it maketh men more Like God, ſo doth it make them more Acceptabl to him; it will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vindicate religion from the obloquies of its enemies, who either deſpiſe or fear it, as a curb to generoſity and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but recommend it to them as moſt noble and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant: nor will it only ſilence our quarrels, but endear us in mutual affection.</p>
