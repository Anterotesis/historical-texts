            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF you be wise and good, you are above my Epithets, and more above my Platteries: But yet you may expect a Preface to excuse this unexpected Address. The habit is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what strange, and my self so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquainted with it, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb facs="tcp:49639:3"/>
much wonder if others should gaze upon it: but account me a Stranger, and you will forgive me.</p>
            <p>It is no matter who, but what, is here presented to your view: I cannot excuse it, either for matter or manner. It hath much folly to my sight; and more, I believe, than yet I see. It may be also somewhat false, although I know it not. This should not prejudice all: for there are Spots above the Clouds; and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven it self was like a Field of Wheat with many Tares: How much more, how much worse, must it be with a frail man!</p>
            <p>But why then do I venture to
<pb facs="tcp:49639:3"/>
come abroad? The Objection was strong enough to keep me silent hitherto; and it may be, nothing but Duty should have perswaded or prevailed on me to be publick now: and yet I do not plead an extraordinary Call; which is a close Writ, and not a Patent. Those who receive and act by such a Warrant, should be sure they know the Hand, or Seal, or Dialect of Heaven.</p>
            <p>But I am an English-man; and therefore am obliged to this Country, and to these Laws that made me free. And this may be some Call; that I say nothing of particular Obligations to the State, in any Courts of Justice, or relation to the highest Court of
<pb facs="tcp:49639:4"/>
Parliament. And why may not I believe my self as free to <hi>think,</hi> or <hi>speak,</hi> or <hi>write,</hi> as others are to <hi>do?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Night of silence, and an evil Day; when every <hi>prudent man shall hold his peace;</hi> but also there is a time to speak, and a word in season, fitly placed, like <hi>an Apple of gold in a Picture of silver.</hi> But who knoweth his season? for our time is hidden: and because man knoweth it not therefore is his labour increased under the Sun. This also is vanity, and a fore vexation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>I said, there are older, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, and better than I; they shall speak and teach me Wifdom: I will hear in silence. Nor do I now say, <hi>They convinced him not, lest it should
<pb facs="tcp:49639:4"/>
be said, We have found out Wisdom; God thrasteth him down, and not man.</hi> Nay, they have spoken much; and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle may be left for me, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat somewhat already said.</p>
            <p>Be it so then; by this I shall be free: for if I speak their words, I may be pardoned, as those that spake before: And if I adde a new word, shall I be made <hi>an Offender for a word?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, my hope is, that the Great Day of Judgment (of which we have long heard, and now seen so much before us) will have such influence upon our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Affections, that we shall all be ready to judge our selves, rather than others; or if others, not with prejudice. And with
<pb facs="tcp:49639:5"/>
this assurance, or with this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, I now presume upon your goodness; knowing well, that if you find but one, so much as one Cluster, you will spare it, and be pitiful; there may be a Blessing in it.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O see the Kingdoms <hi>Rights,</hi> the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> of our <hi>Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors,</hi> concerning <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; that we may know their <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Priviledge,</hi> their <hi>Duty</hi> and their <hi>Limits,</hi> &amp;c. and how our Fathers did commit the power of making Laws, and judging by those Laws; and how they made us swear
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49639:6"/>
Allegiance to our King; what power they gave him over us; and what they did not give him over any of his Subjects; how we should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our selves <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that accounteth these unworthy of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, may be thought (as the <hi>Gretians</hi> said to the <hi>Persians</hi>) not to have heard of Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: <hi>Which else would be valued above an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</hi> But alas, who is able! who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to trace our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs</hi> thorough the Heights and Depths, and dark Abysses and Meanders of the <hi>British, Saxon,</hi> and the <hi>Norman</hi> Nations that have ruled here? Yet there are thousands that may do it much better than I; and therefore I might justly sit in silence, and expect my Antients and my Betters should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that I might learn from them. Nor should I now presume to speak, but that I might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my self from others, that by this occasion may reform my Errours, and may clea<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> our Laws and Customs, much more fully than <unclear>I do</unclear>, or can be able; who pretend to nothing but desire of Truth and Peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49639:6"/>And first, to speak of the mutual obligations of Oaths between Prince and People, the School-men would be thought most curious, or most tender, in the point of Oaths: They mince them out so fine, that a whole million of Oaths may stand (as they speak of Angels) on the point of a sharp Needle.</p>
            <p>They tell us of the <hi>Object,</hi> and the <hi>Subject,</hi> or the <hi>Matter,</hi> which, they say, may cease or fail so much, that any man may find or make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self absolved <hi>from his Oaths.</hi> But in things of such concernment to ones Soul, I love to speak or think in <hi>English,</hi> that I may understand my self: and I thought it madness in the man that said his Prayers in two or three Languages, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this in the close: <hi>Now take thy choice; for all are alike to me: I know not my meaning in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In plain English, I do not see I may absolve my self from an Oath, by saying, He was not the man I took him to be, in some material points, at the time of my Oath; yet this is much, and that which seemeth near to that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49639:7"/>
which the Schools speak of, want of Subject, or sufficient Matter to be ground of such an Oath.</p>
            <p>I should have looked to that before; it may be rash, and so must be repented: but a River of Tears may never wash me from this Oath of God, as the case may stand. And so it was, I suppose, in that of the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> they were not such as they made themselves, nor such as <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> took them for: the Oath was rash, unjust; they ought not to have sworn; they should have stayed and sought direction: for they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Leagues with such, commanded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and ruine such as those men were, and might have been suspected. But when it was done, we see how strict and solemn God was still, in pressing them to keep that Oath.</p>
            <p>Nor may it suffice to say, <hi>I swear against my will; they had advantage of me; and I could not but comply, either with some Mental Reservation, or at least</hi> (for that is much condem'd by most) <hi>I am now grown wiser, and do now see I may ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve my self from that which I would not have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but by force or fraud.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:49639:7"/>But can the World, (this vain and frail and foolish World,) command, controll, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe my Soul, to take an Oath, <hi>the Oath of God,</hi> to what I think unjust? It may be so, for I am Man and frail, with those that are the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; for <hi>He knoweth my foolishness</hi>: but it should not be, and when it is, I must be very tender, lest I adde more Sin to Sin; as bad, or worse, to that which is too Bad already; For, by break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such an Oath, I may do worse, much worse, than first I did in making it; except I Swore to sin, and then I may not keep my Oath.</p>
            <p>And I believe the <hi>Iews</hi> might not have plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Force, or over-awing Arguments, in Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Homage to the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>; and yet 'tis known how God did charge and chasten that said Perjury; nor is it altogether inconsiderable that good <hi>Lot</hi>'s, or at least the men of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s freeing themselves from <hi>Chedorlaomer,</hi> is stiled by God himself, plain downright <hi>Rebellion</hi>; Yet there was another King of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and <hi>Chederlao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> seemeth but a kind of Tyrant, that had but little Right but Conquest and his Might.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Catholicks</hi> may seem too free in dispensing with <hi>Oaths</hi> to <hi>Protestant Kings</hi>; but some there are with them, <hi>Sacred</hi> Persons: And because I
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49639:8"/>
now dispute <hi>ad Hominem,</hi> I shall touch on that in which we know them most Religious, Their solemn Obligation to the <hi>Pope</hi>; which yet is such, they will not deny, as doth not secure or free him from being <hi>Iudged,</hi> or <hi>Coerced</hi> in cases of <hi>Distraction, Natural</hi> in Raving, or <hi>Moral</hi> in Raging, so that danger be apparent to those about him, or in some Spiritual Frenzie of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious <hi>Heresie</hi> Convict (the Chair in Conclave, not the Person is exempt,) or much suspected; while himself refuseth Legal Tryal by a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or the like. The Case is argued in <hi>Occhams Dialogues</hi> with others.</p>
            <p>Our Oath of <hi>Fealty</hi> comes next upon the <hi>Test,</hi> although I might interpose (as a Parallel to the Pope) the <hi>Iewish</hi> High <hi>Priest,</hi> a very Sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the Lords Anointed also; but yet such as must still submit to the Sentence of the Great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> nay, and that for his <hi>Life</hi> also if they so adjudged him; For which of the <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> Power over the Jewish <hi>King,</hi> in Criminals and in <hi>War,</hi> (except only what God had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against <hi>Amaleck</hi> or the seven Nations,) I might cite several clear passages from the <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> and those that expound it long before <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius</hi> or <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> or <hi>Schickards Ius Regium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:49639:8"/>Our Land seemeth to Mourn because of Oaths (but I must only touch the civil Part, or what is Legal,) and our Law seemeth Deficient in this of Oaths, for there is scarcely any Law (since the Star Chamber) to punish <hi>Perjury</hi>; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where it is before a Court of Justice; and there also the Punishment of <hi>Witnesses</hi> is very light, and exceeding short of <hi>Attaint,</hi> on Jurors, by the Common Law.</p>
            <p>Our Customs seem to overgoe our Laws, in much of <hi>Oaths,</hi> They were but <hi>Attestations,</hi> though most Solemn, in the Name and Presence of God, <hi>As the Lord doth Live.</hi>

            <p>But they are now brought to <hi>Imprecations,</hi> or a kind of Curse, <hi>So help me God, and the Contents of this good Book.</hi> Yet so it was of old at <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat</hi>; on Appeal; the <hi>Appellè</hi> did first devote him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>Again, some force a <hi>Kissing of a Book</hi>: the Law requireth but a <hi>Sight</hi> and <hi>Touch.</hi> For ought I find, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Jurors were <hi>Sacra Tenentes.</hi> In the first <hi>Norman</hi> times, it was <hi>Sacris Tactis</hi>; and in later writs, <hi>Evangelijs Tactis</hi>; Nay, the <hi>Priests</hi> hand was upon his <hi>Breast,</hi> (in <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>) not upon the <hi>Book,</hi> and the <hi>Villain</hi> seemeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to touch the <hi>Book.</hi> The Statute saith,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49639:9"/>
he shall hold his Hands over it, but the <hi>Freeman</hi> upon it; and from this <hi>Touch</hi> with the <hi>Body,</hi> such an Oath was called <hi>Corporal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> and eldest Christians, (in their Swearing, Blessing, Praying,) lifted up the <hi>Hand,</hi> and sometimes Bowed the <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Knee</hi>; for, <hi>In his Name shall all Knees bow,</hi> seemeth but Parallel to that of the Psalmist, <hi>In thy Name will I lift up my Hand</hi>; and the <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Trojan</hi> Princes, lifted up their Scepters in Swearing, but others held Earth and Water, in Allusion perhaps to the sacred <hi>Styx.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Most, if not all publick Officers were tyed to their Dutyes, by some Oaths, but they were made by <hi>Parliament,</hi> in all Ages; This being a Pillar in our Laws, that none can make, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or impose an Oath, without an Act of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> or Custom by the Common Law.</p>
            <p>'Tis strange, how much in all we degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from our good Ancestors; So that with us to break ones Oath, (even in the greatest Office) is but a kind of Petty <hi>Aggravation</hi> (as they call it) rather than a Crime; because such Oaths be now accounted but meer Forms, or Ceremonious Shaddows.</p>
            <p>But it was not so, <hi>ab initio</hi>; and among other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:49639:9"/>
Precedents, I find the old <hi>Mirrour,</hi> speaking of a <hi>Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England</hi> charged with Perjury, for taking a small Summe of Money (half a Mark,) for Sealing of a Writ, which was against his Oath; being neither to <hi>Deny, Delay,</hi> or <hi>Sell</hi> Justice or Remedial Writs. (Yet Six Pence was allowed to the King for Sealing of a Writ) How great a Crime they did account such <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury,</hi> I need not say to Lawyers, or to any that have read the <hi>Saxon Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of all our Oaths, those seemed to be most content to be counted Formal; That they were imposed on meer <hi>Children</hi> of a dozen Years old; how many such we have or had in great Schools or Universities, may be known and felt too much I fear.</p>
            <p>And the Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> was twelve Years old, and so pressed at the <hi>Leets</hi> or <hi>Turns</hi>; but did they mean we should<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Observe it but as <hi>Children,</hi> not as Men or Christians? It is true, the <hi>Saxons</hi> also had a twelve-Year-old Oath, but against <hi>Theft</hi>; and how the Laws of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the first did Annul the <hi>Oaths of Children</hi> was observed, and the fifty ninth Chapter of those Laws forbiddeth any to Plead, or to be Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>in Iudicio,</hi> till the Age of fifteen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:49639:10"/>It was also a Maxim in our Law Books, that <hi>Minors</hi> could not Essoyn, because they could not Swear; and that <hi>Homage</hi> might be done in <hi>Nonage,</hi> but not <hi>Fealty</hi>: For although <hi>Homage</hi> was the more <hi>Honourable,</hi> done upon the Knee; yet <hi>Fealty</hi> was the more <hi>Sacred,</hi> being ever done by <hi>Oath</hi>; and from hence is the usual Phrase in all Lawyers and Historians, to Do <hi>Homage,</hi> but to Swear <hi>Fealty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Must our <hi>Allegiance</hi> only, run before our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son or Discretion? which yet was our <hi>great Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty</hi>: for it differed little from <hi>Homage,</hi> with the Oath of <hi>Fealty</hi> to <hi>Mean</hi> Lords, but in the <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo</hi>; which I touched before, and must again, being one good help to explain our <hi>Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall acknowledge that <hi>Allegiance</hi> ought to have been kept by all Subjects, although they never took that Oath; which it may be, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny did not, especially, since the late Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> and Supremacy; which have seemed to abate the use, (I say not the Force) of the old Leet Oath of Grand <hi>Fealty</hi>; Which was perhaps never taken, or much understood by some of those that appear most zealous in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up <hi>Allegiance</hi>; For it is natural to us all, to be most confident in that which we least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49639:10"/>They seem to have done much wrong to the King and Crown, (and to have made so many averse from the very Name of a King,) who by too much Zeal did strain our English Legiance out beyond all bounds of English Laws, and then they would fly out to Forreign Laws; as if the Moulds and Sphears of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Power or Subjects Duty, were by nature equal in all Climates, and in every Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Yet I know not that we need be much afraid to appeal to the Laws of any Civil State, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to those of <hi>Iudah,</hi> which if some had known more, they would have pressed less for our Pattern: But all English Kings had English Bounds by Law; and so we Swore <hi>Allegiance,</hi> and no otherwise by Law.</p>
            <p>It was a Pang of Zeal or strange Affection, more than Reason or Religion, which did make so many once (at <hi>Cambridge</hi>) Swear to <hi>Edward</hi> the Senior, <hi>To Will what he Willed,</hi> &amp;c, Of which the <hi>Saxon Chronology</hi>; But I hope it is not fatal to that Place, or to any others in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>For I cannot learn that e're our Law did force or wish us to oblige our selves by Oath, to Think, Speak or Doe as any King would
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49639:11"/>
doe, or have us for to doe, if contrary to Law and right Reason.</p>
            <p>Our Law dispenseth much with Womens <hi>Homage,</hi> and of old they were not pressed to it; for a <hi>Woman</hi> might not say, I am your <hi>Man,</hi> nor to a man, (but to her own Husband) <hi>Sir, I am your Woman,</hi> yet she was to Swear <hi>Fealty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So were the Bishops also to Swear <hi>Fealty,</hi> (except in <hi>Frank almoigne,</hi>) but the Law dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed with a Bishops (or Church-mans) <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,</hi> so that he needed not to say, <hi>My Lord, or Liege, I am your Man.</hi> The Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was (or should be) <hi>the Man of God,</hi> and might not give himself so much away to others, as any other whatsoever.</p>
            <p>And the reason of this may reach to all our <hi>Fealty,</hi> so far as to perswade us to consider what it is we cannot, nor we may not give away to any Man or Angel.</p>
            <p>Was it not an hard Covenant tendred by <hi>Nahash,</hi> that he would protect all those, or own them for his Subjects, that would put out their right Eyes? and yet this had been more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and Just, than to have required abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>Allegiance,</hi> without any Limitation or <hi>Salvo</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:49639:11"/>
at all: For this had been to have bid them pluck out their <hi>Souls,</hi> or at least to uncase them from that which nature hath made the <hi>Cabinet of Souls</hi> (that curious Orient <hi>Mother of Pearl,</hi>) <hi>Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> which doth make us <hi>Men</hi>; that I say nothing of that which makes us Christians or Religious Men.</p>
            <p>We sinned if we wholly gave our selves unto a King, without any Limitation or Restriction whatsoever: For by so doing we unman our selves, and give away to a Man what we owe not, what we may not give to any mortal Creature whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Let us discuss it then by Law and Reason, what is our Legal <hi>Fealty,</hi> how Made, how Limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how Kept, or how Dissolved. Let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what Duty, what <hi>Allegiance</hi> is commanded by the Laws, and what they did not mean they would not have us give to mortal Man.</p>
            <p>Shall we behold the Sun Reflected or Refract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a Stream of Water? shall we consider the King as Cloathed in the Dress or habit of some other Lord? For every Lord (the meanest and the lowest) is, or may be to his Vassals, as a little King to his Subjects: Such was the Plea of <hi>Lanfranc</hi> (as before,) at <hi>Pinenden</hi>; and so it was adjudged and confirmed by that Parliament, that he should be in his <hi>Demesn,</hi> as was the <hi>King in his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:49639:12"/>And the old Laws of <hi>Alfred, Ethelstane, Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canute,</hi> with the good Laws of <hi>Hen.</hi> the first, do as much forbid and punish Treason against In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Lords, as against the King himself; for to them also is <hi>Homage</hi> done, and <hi>Fealty</hi> Sworn by their Vassals, saying, <hi>My Liege, I am your Man, and bear you Faith of Life, Member and Terrene honour, saving the Faith I owe to other Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or thus, <hi>My Lord, I will bear you true Faith, and do you true Service, as my Duty to you is,</hi> (so the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> the Second) that is, <hi>according to my Fee.</hi> And the <hi>Mirrour</hi> will tell us, that it was an Abuse for the King himself to require it any otherwise; for it did not consist in a Point, but had much Latitude, and several Degrees, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the several Fees.</p>
            <p>And if any such Tenant were pressed on more Service or other than his Fee required, or were injured; he might Implead his Liege in Law: For what his Duty was, neither himself, nor his Liege Lord might determine, but the Law.</p>
            <p>For a <hi>Villain,</hi> who of all Vassals, was most Fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, (most forbidden to molest his Lord,) yet might be <hi>Demandant</hi> in some <hi>Real,</hi> or <hi>Plaintiff</hi> in some <hi>Personal</hi> Actions, where the Lord might not make plain defence (as they speak.) Nay, and <hi>Villains</hi> also did often bring Actions of <hi>Trespass.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in Cases of others, as of <hi>Orphans,</hi> where
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49639:12"/>
the <hi>Villain</hi> is Executor in Trust, he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead his Lord, who can not deny to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swear, though he do it with a <hi>Salvo,</hi> lest such a Suit might make his Villain free, as much as if he had made him an <hi>Obligation,</hi> or a Deed of some Annuity, or a Lease for Term, or Infeofment with Seisin, or had sued him in Law for what he might have had without a Suit.</p>
            <p>For these did <hi>Enfranchise</hi> the <hi>Villain</hi> as much as being in a City, or Castle, without claim or Challenge for a Year and a Day, or his Lords giving him (by the Right Hand) to the <hi>Sheriff</hi> in full <hi>County</hi> Court, shewing him the open Doors and free wayes, and delivering to him a Sword and a Lance, or other Free Arms, which are the wayes of <hi>Manumission,</hi> in the Laws of King <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Hen.</hi> the first, where we also find the Text so much Commented by <hi>Glanvil, Bracton, Britton, Fleta,</hi> with the <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>They all agree in this, that the Bond and Obligation is <hi>Mutual,</hi> and that the Lords Kiss whispereth as much Respect and Defence, as the Vassals Kneeling doth his Reverence; Nay, there is in Law so great an Obligation on the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49639:13"/>
Lord, and so great a Charge often, in <hi>Guarranty,</hi> (which of old was much larger than now, in <hi>Homage Ancestrell</hi>;) That the Lord would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten refuse and delay to take his Tenants Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; So that there was a Writ made, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to take it, and by it, to Oblige himself to his Tenant, whom he was to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend; and his Trespass on him in Law, had a very great Aggravation; because the Vassal was to be <hi>sub defensione Ligea,</hi> as we found the <hi>Iews,</hi> in the Laws of the <hi>Confessor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some Kingdoms are in Fee to others, and must do <hi>Homage,</hi> Swearing <hi>Fealty</hi>; So <hi>Scotland</hi> unto <hi>England</hi>; so was also our <hi>English</hi> King, but not the Crown or State, (which hath oft in Parliament been adjudged and declared Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial, Independent;) when himself did <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> unto <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet I do not find our English King did ever much Scruple at his waging War with all <hi>France,</hi> and the French King also; but did often fight in Person against his Person; and he might do so by Law, if the King of <hi>France</hi> did Injure and Oppress him against Law: That I say nothing of the Personal Challenges by <hi>Rich.</hi> the first, <hi>Edw.</hi> the third and <hi>Rich.</hi> the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49639:13"/>
second; Or of King <hi>Iohns</hi> being cited or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by <hi>France,</hi> for <hi>Murther</hi> in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>This might yet be enlarged, and further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the good Laws of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the first, which are so strict for Allegiance and due Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to every Lord, that they seem almost to forget our old English Clemency; and yet they speak enough of a Vassals impleading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Lord, for which divers Chapters, from the 40<hi rend="sup">th</hi> to the end, are very considerable.</p>
            <p>And the 55<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter limiteth all Homage and Fealty, <hi>per honestum &amp; utile,</hi> that which is honest and profitable; and as <hi>Honestum</hi> there respecteth God and the common Faith, (<hi>Deum &amp; fidem Catholicam,</hi>) so must <hi>Utile</hi> respect the Kingdom, and the <hi>Common good</hi>; it being usual for those times to express the <hi>Common Good</hi> by such a Phrase of <hi>Utile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the Laws of St. <hi>Edward</hi> (for <hi>Foromotes &amp; Heretokes,</hi>) <hi>ad Honorem Coronae, &amp; ad Utilitatem Regni</hi>; So King <hi>Williams Additions</hi> were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Confirmed, <hi>ad utilitatem Anglorum</hi>; So the Parliament at <hi>Merton</hi> was to treat, <hi>de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni utilitate Regni</hi>; (which may be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Writs of those times,) and the great
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49639:14"/>
Charters granted, <hi>à tout la commune Dengleterre</hi>; (as <hi>Articuli super Chartas</hi>) And the first of <hi>Westminster, pur le common profit de st esglise &amp; de Realm</hi>; and the <hi>Confirmations of the Charters</hi> in <hi>Edw.</hi> the first, forbidding all Impositions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but by <hi>Common assent</hi> of all the Realm, <hi>&amp; pur le common Profit de ceo</hi>; which must be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Commune Assent,</hi> and no otherwise; So <hi>Ethelreds</hi> Law, <hi>Efferatur Concilium quod Populo Uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lissimum</hi>; And <hi>Canutes, quae ad Reipublicae Utilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem &amp; Commune commodum,</hi> which there may Paraphrase <hi>Regalitas,</hi> of which before.</p>
            <p>And (however the late Oaths of Allegiance are,) if we consider the old Oaths, both in the <hi>Saxon</hi> and first <hi>Norman</hi> times, we shall find them to respect the Kingdom and its common Good and Profit, as well as the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative or private Profit to the Crown.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Bracton</hi> with others, we are led to the Laws of the <hi>Confessor</hi> for our great <hi>Allegiance</hi>; But in those Laws, the Oath is to <hi>defend the Kingdom</hi> with the <hi>King</hi>; and that by such an Oath we should all be, <hi>sicut conjurati Fratres, ad defendendum Regnum, contra Alienigenas, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Inimicos, unâ cum Domino Rege,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That it was so also in the <hi>Brittish</hi> times
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49639:14"/>
of K. <hi>Arthur,</hi> (whose Parliaments we may as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert by more, than that in <hi>Caius</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi>) we find in these very Laws, and that by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this Oath, King <hi>Arthur</hi> raised his Subjects, and expelled the <hi>Saracens</hi> and Enemies <hi>a Regno,</hi> from the <hi>Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the same Laws tell us, that the same Oath was renewed and Confirmed by K. <hi>Edgar,</hi> whose Laws are severe enough for <hi>Treason,</hi> but against <hi>all Lords</hi> as well as the <hi>King</hi>; and it is Punished, as <hi>Theof.</hi> And the Laws of <hi>Canute</hi> (confirming those of <hi>Edgar</hi>) require <hi>Fealty</hi> conjoyned with <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Virtue</hi>; and again with Common Justice, <hi>Iusjurandum datamque fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Religiosissimè servato, injustitiam pro sua quisque virili Parte, ditionis nostrae finibus omnem arceto,</hi> as <hi>Lambard</hi> translateth the <hi>Saxon</hi> of those Laws; and in another place of them, <hi>The Leet Oath of Fealty, Iure Iurando fidem det, omni se in poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum aetate, tum furti, tum furti Societate &amp; Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia temperaturum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this doth King <hi>Edwards</hi> Oath of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance (in <hi>Britton</hi>) seem to allude, <hi>que ilz nous serrount Feaul &amp; Leaux, &amp; que ilz ne serrount Felons, ne a felons assentaunts</hi>; yet I do not deny, but <hi>Theof,</hi> in this Oath might include <hi>Treason</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:49639:15"/>
with other Felony, (as vvas touched before) but however, it is as well for the <hi>Kingdom</hi> or the Common good, as for the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, or private Honour o<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So also the first <hi>Norman</hi> Laws (called the <hi>Conquerors</hi>) require an Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi>; but for the Publick Peace and common Justice, to the Kingdoms good as much as to the Crown; for so the words run, <hi>fint Fratres conjurati ad Regnum N. contra inimicos defendendum, &amp; Pacem, &amp; dignitatem.

               <hi>vel per Carceris Inclusio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, vel per Plegios idoneos</hi>; so it was in <hi>Glanvils</hi> time, (for all but <hi>Homicide,</hi>) but in <hi>Fleta</hi>'s, <hi>Diffamatus vel Accusatus, attachiabitur per Corpus, &amp; Captus Remanebit, donec se indè Legitimè acquietaverit.</hi> That is, (in him,) till he have Legally cleared himself from all Seducement of the King, Kingdom, or Kingdoms Army; <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemque seductionem Regis, Regni vel sui exercitus, &amp; quicquid sit contra Pacem suam</hi>; which <hi>Glanvil</hi> expresseth thus, <hi>Machinatum fuisse, vel aliquid fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisse in mortem Regis, vel seditionem Regni, vel Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercitus, vel Consensisse, vel Consilium dedisse, vel Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritatem praestitisse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In such Cases also they debate who should be <hi>Iudge,</hi> and for this they all agree in that fundamental Principle of right Reason and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that <hi>Parties</hi> may never be <hi>Iudges</hi> in their own Causes; for which, besides all others, the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49639:16"/>
               <hi>Mirror</hi> is large and clear among all <hi>Exceptions</hi> to the <hi>Iudges</hi> Person, (if he have no Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or refuse to shew it as he ought, or be Party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) of which also <hi>Britton</hi> in <hi>Appeals, cap.</hi> 22. <hi>fol.</hi> 41.</p>
            <p>And for this reason <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> with others, agree that in such Causes, neither the <hi>King</hi> (who might, so they say, be <hi>Iudex &amp; Actor,</hi>) nor the Kings Commissioners should Judge or determine: But <hi>Curia &amp; Pares,</hi> except on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Case is not of Life, but finable; for in such the Kings Commissioners may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine <hi>sine Paribus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But who are these Peers, and what is this Court? One of <hi>Bractons</hi> first Maxims (in his second <hi>Chap.</hi>) is, that all obscure, difficult and new Judgments, ought to be suspended, <hi>Usque ad magnam Curiam, &amp; ibi per Consilium Curiae ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minentur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fleta</hi> is somewhat clearer, (in his second Book and second <hi>Chap.</hi>) <hi>Habet enim Rex curiam su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in Concilio suo, in Parliamentis suis presentibus Prelatis. Com. Baron. Proceribus, &amp; aliis viris Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, ubi terminatae sunt Dubitationes Iudiciorum, &amp; Novis injuriis emersis, Nova constituuntur Remedia, &amp; unicuique Iustitia, prout meruit, Retribuetur. Ibidem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49639:17"/>
               <hi>Unicuique!</hi> What, to every Man in all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? or how far, and how high may this extend or reach? Shall we propound this Doubt to the Antient Parliaments, who were most like to know their Power and Priviledge?</p>
            <p>The Law was clear enough before, but some were pleased not to think it so; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Statutes of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> (as old as <hi>Henry</hi> the third) in the first place of all it was agreed and enacted, That <hi>all men Living of this Kingdom,</hi> as vvell high as lovv (<hi>tam Majores quam Minores</hi>) must and ought submit to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Iustitiam habeant &amp; Recipiant in Curia Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Regis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this Expression may go lovver than the Court of Parliament, I can not deny; nor vvill others, I suppose, deny but that it may and must be yielded to the highest Court of all.</p>
            <p>One of the Clauses of the Kings duty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Lavvs, is to do all things rightly by the Judgment of his great Court, <hi>per Iudicium Procerum Regni</hi>; and again, by that great Council to maintain or do Justice and Judgment, <hi>Iudicium Rectum Facere &amp; Iustitiam te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere per Concilium Procerum Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All vvhich, and much more in those Lavvs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49639:17"/>
must be solemnly Svvorn by the King, before the Kingdom and the Clergy, <hi>in propria persona inspectis &amp; tactis Sacrosanctis Evangeliis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>coram Regno &amp; Sacerdote &amp; Clero,</hi> (This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) <hi>antequam ab Archiepiscopis &amp; Episcopis Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Coronetur</hi>; Even <hi>before he may he Crowned,</hi> or should require his Subjects <hi>Homage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Insomuch that vvhen the Subjects have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>Homage,</hi> (as some Lords did to King <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth) before the King had done his <hi>Homage,</hi> and Sworn his <hi>Fealty</hi> to the State and Laws; It hath been observed by Historians, as some kind of <hi>Comet,</hi> that I say not a <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> in State Politicks.</p>
            <p>And besides all the forms of Coronation found in <hi>Hoveden, Walsingham,</hi> and other Historians, (<hi>secundum antiqua Statuta,</hi> as <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,) it is clear enough in the Records and Rolls of <hi>Richard</hi> the second (before others,) how the King first did take that Solemn <hi>Oath,</hi> and then the Archbishop went to every side of the Scaffold, relating to the Kingdom how the King was Svvorn; and then he asked them, <hi>si ipsi consentire vellent,</hi> if they would now <hi>give consent</hi> to take him for their <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Liege</hi> Lord; and if so, they came and did him <hi>Homage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:49639:18"/>If they would consent! What, was it at their <hi>Choyce?</hi> and were our English Kings <hi>Elective,</hi> plain Elective? sure it would be duely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and I confess some things have made me very much suspect they were <hi>Elective.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the rather also by considering the great Care and Importunity of some Kings, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Crown to be setled by <hi>Parliament</hi> upon their <hi>Heirs</hi>; Which might intimate that indeed it was not their <hi>Inheritance</hi> at Common Law; for it was seldom seen, I suppose, that English Men have taken much Pains to obtain an Act of Parliament to settle their <hi>Inheritance</hi> on their own <hi>Heirs,</hi> except they were <hi>Illegitimate</hi> or <hi>Aliens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And upon search, I cannot find the old Oaths of Allegiance did relate to the Kings <hi>Heirs</hi> or <hi>Successors,</hi> either in the <hi>Saxon</hi> or first <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> times, although we find the Oath in old Laws, long before <hi>Edw.</hi> the second, and in old Lawyers, <hi>Bracton, Britton, Fleta,</hi> with the <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> punctual in the Oath of <hi>Allegiance,</hi> but not a Syllable of <hi>Heirs</hi> or <hi>Successors</hi> that I can find.</p>
            <p>Yet in the times of <hi>Henry</hi> the first and <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the second there was some special Acts of Parliament for setling the Crown on <hi>Maud</hi> the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:49639:18"/>
Emperess or her Issue, and King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Son was Crowned in his Fathers Reign, and of that time the <hi>Salvo</hi> in <hi>Glanvil, Regi &amp; Haeredibus,</hi> which I find not in any other old Lawyer; and I believe it not usual till the great Quarrels of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> it may be much Later.</p>
            <p>But all such Acts (for tying the Crown to such or such a Family) do not evince a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Right of <hi>Succession,</hi> any more than the House of <hi>Austria</hi> doth prove the <hi>Empire</hi> not to be <hi>Elective,</hi> though it now seem as entailed on that Family.</p>
            <p>I say not how often it hath been adjudged that <hi>Affirmative</hi> Statutes do not annul the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi>; and that one may <hi>Prescribe</hi> against a Statute <hi>Negative,</hi> but in <hi>Affirmance</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,</hi> (for which the Comments on <hi>Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons Burgage</hi>;) So that if an English King was <hi>Elective</hi> by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> the Kingdom might prescribe against late Statutes which might erre much more than they could oblige all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Parliaments, but they might still be free, and most of all in what was due before by Common Law.</p>
            <p>Let us discuss it then, and see what Antient Lawyers and Historians do record about our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:49639:19"/>
Kings, their limitations by our Laws, their Title by Succession or Election at the Common Law.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Bracton</hi> or if <hi>Fleta</hi> may be Judges of this Question they will tell us, that in their times our King was <hi>Elective; Non a Regnando dicitur sed a Bene Regendo, &amp; ad hoc</hi> Electus <hi>est</hi>; And again, <hi>ad haec autem Creatus Rex, &amp;</hi> Electus, <hi>ut Iustitiam faciat Universis; Not only Created,</hi> but <hi>Elected,</hi> it is where they treat of <hi>Iudges</hi> and of <hi>Iurisdiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors, the <hi>Mirror</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plain that they did <hi>Elect</hi> or chuse their King from among themselves, <hi>Eslierent de eux un Roy à reigner sir eux</hi>; and being <hi>Elected,</hi> they did so and so Limit him by <hi>Oath</hi> and <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this we might appeal to <hi>Tacitus</hi> of our Ancestors, For theirs, who did both <hi>Elect</hi> and <hi>Bound</hi> their <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Generals, Reges ex Nobilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, Duces ex Virtute sumunt</hi>; and of their King he saith, the Power was so bounded, that he could not call it <hi>Free, Nec infinita, aut libera Potestas,</hi> and that <hi>in Conciliis,</hi> Their <hi>Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> was <hi>in perswasion</hi> rather than <hi>Command, Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi potius quam jubendi potestate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caesar</hi> seemeth to conceive they had no <hi>King</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:49639:19"/>
or fixed Common Governour in time of Peace: but for <hi>War,</hi> saith he, they <hi>Choose</hi> out <hi>Generals, qui Bello praesint ut vitae necisque habeant Potestatem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our Brittish Ancestors he found a King, but by <hi>Election</hi> of a great <hi>Common-Council,</hi> by whose consent he observeth that <hi>Cassivelane</hi> was <hi>chosen King</hi> and <hi>General</hi> against his Landing; <hi>Summa Imperii Bellique administrandi, communi Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio permissa est Cassivellauno</hi>; and again, <hi>Nostro adventu permoti Britanni, hunc toti bello imperioque praefecerant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Brittans</hi> agreed much with the <hi>Gauls</hi> in their Customs, I do not deny; but I know not why this should make the <hi>Gauls</hi> to be the <hi>Elder</hi> Brothers, as some teach us, because our <hi>Britain</hi> is an <hi>Island</hi>: Yet it may be much disputed, if not proved, that it once was joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Gaul,</hi> (or <hi>France</hi>) in one Continent, for which we might produce some of the old <hi>Poets,</hi> and others before <hi>Twine</hi> and <hi>Verstegan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it is clear enough from <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> that the <hi>Gauls</hi> were much moulded by the <hi>Brittish Druids,</hi> although they seemed more Polite in <hi>Iuvenal</hi>'s time; and afterwards being more <hi>Frank,</hi> they afforded a <hi>Christian</hi> Queen to <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> and the Model of a great School to
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49639:20"/>
               <hi>Sigesbert</hi>; which yet must not wrong <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> who from hence moulded the University of <hi>Paris,</hi> if we may Believe all that write of <hi>Charlemaign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we add <hi>Strabo</hi> to those cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we shall find they <hi>Chose</hi> both <hi>Generals</hi> and all great Magistrates.</p>
            <p>When they had a King, the Crown passed by Election, and was so limited, that <hi>Ambiotrix</hi> (one of their Kings) acknowledged, <hi>Ut non minus in se Iuris Multitudo, quàm ipse in Multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem</hi>; So in <hi>Caesar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>Common-Council</hi> much consisted of <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> (and such perhaps our <hi>Knights</hi> of Shires; <hi>Electi de plebe,</hi>) and <hi>Druydes,</hi> their <hi>Clergy</hi> who did over-rule them all, by their <hi>Banns,</hi> and Sacred <hi>Oak Misleto,</hi> as if it had grown in <hi>Dodona</hi>'s Grove.</p>
            <p>Their grand Corporation was dissolved by <hi>Roman</hi> Edicts, in <hi>Gaul</hi> by <hi>Claudius,</hi> (as <hi>Seneca, Suetonius</hi>;) but in <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (if not <hi>Augustus</hi>) in <hi>Pliny</hi>; but <hi>Vopiscus</hi> keepeth a <hi>Druydess</hi> to presage the Empire to <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> when he had killed the Boar; and <hi>Ammianus</hi> may afford them in <hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Iulian</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:49639:20"/>But in <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ireland</hi> they remained long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if we may believe their Annals of <hi>Columba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and of <hi>William</hi> the Irish Abbot: But in <hi>Dioclesian</hi>'s time, <hi>Amphibalus</hi> the famous Brittan, fled from <hi>Rome</hi> to his Friend St. <hi>Alban,</hi> (who dyed for him in his Cloaths, it is said; but we find him Condemned by Law, and styled Lord of <hi>Verulam, Prince of Knights,</hi> and <hi>Steward of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> in his Shrine, and <hi>Iacob de Voragine.</hi>) 'Ere long we find him made a Bishop in the <hi>Holy Isle,</hi> and there he did Succeed the Brittish <hi>Druyds,</hi> and his Scholars were enow with their Blood and Carkasses to make the name of <hi>Litchfield.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the turning of <hi>Druyds</hi> into our Bishops, (in <hi>Lucius</hi>'s time,) is no more certain, I think, than that those were the <hi>Flamins</hi> or <hi>Arch Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins,</hi> of whom we hear so much of late; but of old few or none relate it, but only <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Name of <hi>Flamin</hi> came to <hi>Brittain</hi> from the <hi>Grecians</hi> or the <hi>Romans,</hi> (who had <hi>Druyds</hi> from the <hi>Brittans,</hi>) where they were most Sacred <hi>Priests</hi>; at first but three, but when every God and Godded Man or <hi>Daemon</hi> had his <hi>Flamin,</hi> they became extreamly innumerable.</p>
            <p>Yet the first three still kept their Distance,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49639:21"/>
Place and Seniority, from whence the Phrase of <hi>Arch-Flamin,</hi> which yet I dare not assert to have been in <hi>Brittain,</hi> or to be so much as known in the time of <hi>Lucius</hi>; or the name of <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop.</hi> But of this Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> of <hi>Lucius</hi>'s Epistles in <hi>Gratian,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Patrick Young</hi> on <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> Epistle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Fenestella</hi> with his Names of <hi>Bishop, Arch-Bishop, Cardinal, Patriarch, Metropolitan,</hi> &amp;c. is now come out with another Title of a later Age, than he that lived in <hi>Tiberius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>Brittish Druyds</hi> mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State, and yet they would not speak of State but in or by a <hi>Common-Council,</hi> (as was touched before in the <hi>Militia,</hi>) and among these the same <hi>Caesar</hi> will tell us, that there was a chief or <hi>President,</hi> but chosen by Deserts, and not by a blind way of <hi>Succession; Si sint Pares plures suffragio adlegitur; nonnunquam etiam armis de prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipatu contendunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it probable the <hi>Brittans</hi> should be great Patrons of <hi>Monarchical Succession,</hi> which could hardly well consist with their <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> which is not only in <hi>Kent,</hi> but in divers other Places of <hi>England</hi> and in <hi>Wales</hi>; from the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> as we may learn from Parliament, in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49639:21"/>
27 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and in K. <hi>Edwards</hi> Statute of <hi>Wales,</hi> with <hi>Littletons</hi> Parceners: And his Commentator makes it one mark of the ancient <hi>Brittans,</hi> and from them also to <hi>Ireland</hi>: and from the Brittish <hi>Gavelkind,</hi> do all the Children yet among us part their Fathers <hi>Arms,</hi> of which also the great Judge on <hi>Littletons Villenage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the <hi>Parceners,</hi> he deriveth the <hi>Crowns</hi> descent to the <hi>Eldest,</hi> from the <hi>Trojans</hi> to the <hi>Brittans,</hi> so indeed do many others with <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and <hi>Basingstock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet our Best <hi>Herald</hi> the Learned <hi>Cambden,</hi> will deride the Story of the <hi>Trojans</hi> coming hither, but his many Arguments to prove the first Inhabitants to be a Kin to the <hi>Gauls,</hi> do no more convince me that the <hi>Trojans</hi> might not come hither afterwards, than that the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> did not come, because the <hi>Saxons</hi> were before them.</p>
            <p>I repeat nothing from <hi>Gyraldus Cambrensis, Matthew Paris, Hoveden, Huntingdon,</hi> or others, who derided <hi>Monmouth,</hi> till they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by some <hi>Brittish</hi> Writers which themselves found; besides all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors cited by <hi>Virunnius, Leland,</hi> Sir <hi>John Price,</hi> and divers others, that I say nothing of the <hi>Scottish
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:49639:22"/>
Chronicles,</hi> or of the Learned man that shewed King <hi>Henry</hi> the first the Descent of divers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Europe</hi> from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> in <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and <hi>Hoveden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be considered what this State and Parliament hath oft owned of <hi>Brute,</hi> and the <hi>Trojan</hi> Story, not only in the grand Moot of the Dependance of <hi>Scotland</hi> on <hi>England,</hi> ever since King <hi>Brute</hi>; which, beside all Records in the Exchequer, is at large in <hi>Walsinghams Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the first, and the <hi>Survey</hi> of <hi>Normandy,</hi> as also in the Laws of the <hi>Confessor,</hi> cap. 35.</p>
            <p>To which I might add the <hi>Trojan</hi> Reliques, Statues, Tablets and Pictures, in all the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, Danish, Saxon, English Wars, found here in <hi>Cornwall, Wales,</hi> and other Parts, besides our <hi>Troy Novant,</hi> or <hi>new Troy,</hi> the old <hi>Trojan Roman</hi> name of this Famous City of the <hi>Troinovantes,</hi> (in the Roman Writers <hi>Trinobantes</hi>) now <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> since the time of <hi>Lud</hi>'s building a Gate, and changing this Cities Name.</p>
            <p>But for leaving out the Name of <hi>Troy,</hi> some were so much offended, that it came to a great Contest and Quarrel, couched in Verse (from others) by the old <hi>Gildas,</hi> and translated by the Famous <hi>Nennius</hi> of <hi>Bangor,</hi> escaping that bloody Massacre.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:49639:22"/>Who hath also left us an old History, (yet to be seen in MS.) collected, as himself saith, from the <hi>Brittish</hi> and <hi>Scottish</hi> Records, and from the old <hi>Roman</hi> Annals, (which were then found) relating the Pedigree of <hi>Brute</hi> or <hi>Britto,</hi> (some will have him <hi>Brotos,</hi> and some <hi>Brutus,</hi>) from <hi>Aeneas</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and his bringing some <hi>Trojan</hi> Reliques hither by the way of <hi>Gaul,</hi> where (he also saith) he built the City of <hi>Turons</hi> or <hi>Tours,</hi> much as <hi>Monmouth</hi> and others have the Story, though I could never find it in <hi>Homer</hi> or any of the Ancients, by them cited for <hi>Turons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet I find the same <hi>Nennius</hi> confessing that the <hi>Brittish</hi> Annals had another descent of their <hi>Brute</hi> or <hi>Britto,</hi> from <hi>Japhet</hi> (obtaining <hi>Europe</hi> for his Portion with the Brittish Isles, of which <hi>Noahs</hi> Will in <hi>Eusebius,</hi> or other old Fragments;) came <hi>alone,</hi> from whence the <hi>Almans</hi> and <hi>Francks,</hi> besides our <hi>Britto,</hi> (Father to the <hi>Brittains,</hi>) whose Genealogy through twenty Descents to <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> he saith he had from the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of those who lived here <hi>in Primis Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae Temporibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if we may not believe <hi>Taliessin,</hi> (the British Bard) of <hi>Trojans</hi> coming hither with their <hi>Brute,</hi> yet we may peruse his Scholar, or the <hi>Merlin</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:49639:23"/>
that foretold the Name of <hi>Brute</hi> should come again upon this <hi>Island</hi>; whether in the <hi>Scottish</hi> Union, or in the <hi>Welsh</hi> returning to their Lost Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, I dispute not; nor how this Island came so like to <hi>Somothrace,</hi> (so near a Kin to <hi>Troy</hi>) in Rites of Worship, or in other Customs, as of old some did observe, especially in those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Ceres</hi> or <hi>Proserpina,</hi> so famous here, that in the old <hi>Argonauts</hi> the <hi>Brittish</hi> Isles are stiled the <hi>Court</hi> or <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>Ceres</hi>; and yet this might be for other Reasons.</p>
            <p>But although I cannot deny some <hi>Trojan</hi> customs among us, yet I know not why I should grant that <hi>Trojan Succession</hi> to the Crown, which so many do assert, when as themselves do yield the same <hi>Trojans</hi> to be <hi>Brittans,</hi> and those <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> of whom we spake before.</p>
            <p>And besides the Brittish <hi>Gavelkinde,</hi> and all before, themselves do also relate their own <hi>Brute,</hi> parting his Kingdom among his three Sons, and again the Crown parted between the two Sons of <hi>Madan,</hi> two of <hi>Gorbodio,</hi> two of <hi>Molmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> two of <hi>Lud,</hi> so near a Kin to him that <hi>Caesar</hi> found <hi>Elected</hi> King by <hi>Common-Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I must believe those who assert the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> Crown to go by <hi>Succession</hi>: yet I know not
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49639:23"/>
why I may not also believe so many good or better Writers of the <hi>Trojan Common-Council</hi> or <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and their Power in Peace and War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with all things else that might concern the King or Kingdom; which great Council did consist of <hi>Princes</hi> or <hi>Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> of the People.</p>
            <p>Of which <hi>Trojan Parliament</hi> we read in <hi>Apu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leius, Socrates, Daemon,</hi> and in <hi>Homer, Virgil, Dictys,</hi> and most ancient <hi>Dares,</hi> who lived also in our <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> (if good <hi>Bale</hi> deceive us not,) which yet is not so certain as that he was Translated or Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrased in Latin Verse, by <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Exon,</hi> or <hi>Iscan</hi> our Countrey-Man, as many of his Verses speak; although that Elegant Poem be ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to <hi>Cornelius Nepos,</hi> as by him Dedicated to <hi>Salust,</hi> in the times of the great Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Britain,</hi> which produced so many famous <hi>Brittish Romans,</hi> beside <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, Helen,</hi> and the modest <hi>Claudia,</hi> of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh, and <hi>Martial</hi> (in several pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) maketh her a <hi>British</hi> Woman.</p>
            <p>I will not insist upon their <hi>Election</hi> of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors or <hi>Generals</hi> by a kind of Lot in <hi>Dictys,</hi> nor will I deny but the <hi>Trojans</hi> were severe enough to all <hi>Traitors,</hi> whose dead Bodies also were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed <hi>Burial,</hi> if we may believe all from the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49639:24"/>
               <hi>Illiads</hi>; but the <hi>Odysses</hi> may also afford us the very same Punishment for <hi>Tyrants,</hi> whom they hated as much as the <hi>Grecians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor will the Patrons of <hi>Succession</hi> or <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> find more encouragement among the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi> than among the <hi>Trojans</hi>; though I cannot deny but they do rightly observe many <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Customs among the <hi>Britains</hi>; nor will I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to our Ancestors, both <hi>Greek Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Greek Schools,</hi> besides <hi>Bladud</hi>'s at <hi>Stamford</hi> and other Places.</p>
            <p>I could easily believe these Islands to be known to the <hi>Grecians</hi> long before the <hi>Romans,</hi> of whom <hi>Lucretius</hi> is the first (that I yet know) speaking of <hi>Britain</hi>; but it was described by <hi>Polibius,</hi> (though our great Herald seem to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get it,) who might learn it from the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> trading hither, and by <hi>Eratosthenes, Dicae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arcus, Pithaeas,</hi> and <hi>Artemidorus,</hi> if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>Strabo,</hi> that I say nothing of the old <hi>Argonauts</hi> (ascribed to <hi>Orpheus,</hi>) naming <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and describing <hi>Britain,</hi> or of the Book of the <hi>World,</hi> (in <hi>Aristotles</hi> Works) where <hi>Albion</hi> and <hi>Ferne</hi> are <hi>Brittish</hi> Isles, mentioned also in <hi>Dyonisius</hi>; and very famous for their <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>Tin</hi> or <hi>Lead,</hi> whence the name of <hi>Cassiterides,</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:49639:24"/>
of which <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and others of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</p>
            <p>What was the <hi>Grecian Genius</hi> towards their Kings, doth not only appear in their Superci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious <hi>Ephori,</hi> Eye-brows, or the <hi>Left</hi> eye of <hi>Greece,</hi> but in the <hi>Right</hi> Eye, or <hi>Athens,</hi> of which much might be spoken from all the Greek Historians, besides their Laws or Politicks of <hi>Plato</hi> and his Schollars, long before the <hi>Attick Laws</hi> Collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Petitus,</hi> that I say nothing of <hi>Aristophanes</hi> or any of their Poets.</p>
            <p>But how much our Ancestors owed to the <hi>Grecians,</hi> I do not find expressed by any; most of our <hi>Plays,</hi> much of our <hi>Works,</hi> and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of our <hi>Laws</hi> seemeth to be <hi>Grecian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Genius</hi> of a State is seen in <hi>Plays,</hi> some think, rather than in <hi>Work</hi>; they are <hi>Passions</hi> and as Lovers <hi>Pulses,</hi> which do shew the <hi>Soul</hi> much quicker than do <hi>Words</hi> or <hi>Actions</hi>; and the Greek <hi>Scenes</hi> were <hi>Passions</hi> (or Sufferings) of <hi>Princes</hi> rather than their <hi>Actions</hi>; and a Tyrants blood was thought the Richest and fattest <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to please the People and appease their Gods; but <hi>Interludes</hi> must be Corrected much, and then they may both Moralize and Methodize the best Historians, and may be Divertisements
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49639:25"/>
of Use as much as Pleasure to a <hi>State,</hi> which else was apt to grow <hi>Morose</hi> or <hi>Melancholick,</hi> if it were too <hi>Sedentary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Grecian Cards</hi> or <hi>Chess</hi> (at the Siege of <hi>Troy,</hi>) may shew their Shuffling, <hi>Cutting</hi> and <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing</hi> over <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Checking</hi> them by small <hi>Perins,</hi> and in the East <hi>Scheck-maet</hi> doth signifie the <hi>King is Dead,</hi> or the <hi>Kings Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when shall we come again to the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical</hi> (or <hi>Philosophers</hi>) <hi>Game,</hi> which was also used here, though now we have lost old <hi>Plato's Analyticks,</hi> of which his <hi>Theon</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Vieta?</hi> when shall our <hi>Kittel</hi>-Pins return again into the <hi>Grecian Skyttals</hi> of the <hi>Muses,</hi> whence they might degenerate?</p>
            <p>When shall our <hi>Cards</hi> return again to <hi>Charts,</hi> and teach our Children <hi>Prospects</hi> and <hi>Geography,</hi> with the true <hi>Site</hi> of Countreys, Cities, Persons, and the famous men of old, who conquered (in their <hi>Plays,</hi>) by Laws of <hi>History</hi> and exact <hi>Chronology,</hi> and not by Fancy only as of late.</p>
            <p>When shall our <hi>Grecian</hi> Dice be taught to teach our Children <hi>Squares</hi> and <hi>Cubes,</hi> with all the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, as they might much better and easier than our Papers and our Tedions Figures; for I need not say how much the six sides of a <hi>Dye</hi> would
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:49639:25"/>
help for the Root of all perfect <hi>Cubes,</hi> and half six for all <hi>Surds</hi> in that and higher <hi>Powers</hi>; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side so many other uses of the <hi>Dye</hi> in all <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks</hi> and <hi>Architecture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which also we owe to the <hi>Grecians</hi> for our <hi>Attick</hi> and <hi>Ionick,</hi> and our other <hi>Moods</hi>; and so in <hi>Musick</hi> also, that I speak not of <hi>Perspective</hi> and almost all the <hi>Mechanicks</hi> of <hi>Wheels, Beams</hi> and <hi>Leavers,</hi> with perpetua or continual Screws; or of the <hi>Physick</hi> and <hi>Apothecary</hi> Terms, more <hi>Grecian</hi> than <hi>Italian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beside, divers of our <hi>Law-Terms, Endite, Ideot, Chyrographer, Protonotar,</hi> &amp;c. I could almost believe the <hi>Grecians</hi> were the Patrons of our <hi>Tryal</hi> by Twelve, which was not first brought in by the <hi>Normans</hi> or by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> although we found it with them in <hi>Ethelred,</hi> or <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Senior,</hi> and before them in <hi>Alfred,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Causes why he hanged so many Judges in the <hi>Mirror.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the twelve signs of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> it might come to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> thence (or from the <hi>Iews</hi>) to the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; for in <hi>Egypt</hi> was the old <hi>Iury</hi> of Twelve Gods, so often in <hi>Homer, Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotus, Diodorus</hi>; and from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Greece,</hi> with the Twelve Labours of <hi>Hercules, Egyptian</hi> or Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:49639:26"/>
               <hi>Hircol, Hirtot, Hirsut,</hi> and thence the Fable of his <hi>Lyons Skin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in <hi>Greece</hi> this Number was both Famous and <hi>Sacred,</hi> as in our <hi>Iuries</hi>: and of this, <hi>Plato</hi> in <hi>Timaeus,</hi> and in <hi>Phaedrus,</hi> in his <hi>Laws,</hi> and in <hi>Phaedo</hi> and <hi>Critias,</hi> which would almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade me that he had seen <hi>Moses</hi> or the <hi>Flood,</hi> or the Twelve old <hi>Heroes,</hi> or had read in <hi>Moses Song</hi> of the Earth being parted, according to the <hi>Number of the Sons of Israel,</hi> or (as some would have it) of the <hi>Angels</hi> or the <hi>Sons of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Grecian</hi> Trials by Twelve, I need cite no more than the known Histories of <hi>Orestes,</hi> and of <hi>Mars,</hi> tryed for <hi>Murther</hi> by a <hi>Iury</hi> of Twelve, (and quitted only by the equality of Votes,) in that Famous Place which from him was called <hi>Areopagus</hi> or <hi>Mars Hill,</hi> of which St. <hi>Paul</hi> (and <hi>Dyonisius</hi>) and the <hi>Altar to the strange God</hi> is described in <hi>Pausanias,</hi> to be compared with <hi>Laertius Epimenides</hi>; (and divers others) that I say nothing of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which from <hi>Areopagus</hi> might come hither with the Tryal by Twelve, and be Mothers to the Name ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Person of the famous Brittish <hi>Samothes,</hi> as <hi>Areopagus</hi> seemeth to have been to much if not to most of our Law Pleadings and Customs in Criminals.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:49639:26"/>Yet it may be possible that this Number might be as Sacred among the <hi>Trojans,</hi> although I remember little of it till <hi>Aeneas</hi>'s coming into <hi>Italy</hi>; and then we hear of twelve <hi>Procers,</hi> twelve <hi>Vulturs,</hi> twelve <hi>Lictors,</hi> twelve <hi>Hours,</hi> and at length twelve <hi>Months,</hi> and other things, for which <hi>Dionysius,</hi> the <hi>Saturnals,</hi> the <hi>Genials,</hi> and <hi>Tiraquel,</hi> may be considered, with that of old <hi>Ethelward,</hi> in <hi>Edgar, Argivae Hebdomadas gentis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suere Magistri, septimanas quas voce Latini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Romans</hi> allso had many, if not all their <hi>Dozens</hi> from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> which were known here long before <hi>Ethelbert</hi> did settle his <hi>Dooms Romano more</hi>; and we often find the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Twelve in the old Histories of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Gaul,</hi> for their Twelve <hi>Peers</hi> are much older than some may think, that will have them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor would it be impossible, I do think, to shew some other of our Law Customs bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from the <hi>Grecians</hi>; yet I do not know that our old <hi>Greek Lade,</hi> was so called from Greek Law, (as divers would perswade us) or from <hi>Greek Leod,</hi> or from <hi>Greek Language,</hi> which yet appeareth in the <hi>Welsh</hi>; but I know not that it was spoken <hi>here</hi> or in <hi>Gaul,</hi> but
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:49639:27"/>
near <hi>Marseils,</hi> a <hi>Greek Colony,</hi> not much younger than the elder <hi>Cyrus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it may be that the <hi>Druyds</hi> had their Learning and their Letters (though in <hi>Sacris</hi> they did write but little) from the <hi>Grecians,</hi> or <hi>Phenicians</hi> rather, who in this did teach the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> as both <hi>Dictys</hi> and the Crowd of <hi>Cadmus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could also believe their <hi>Characters</hi> to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry like those of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> on <hi>Eusebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and others,) but I cannot yield them to be <hi>Hebrew,</hi> though so many Learned men affirm it: but for this see <hi>Fullers Miscellanies,</hi> and <hi>Bux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torfs Dissertations,</hi> with the <hi>Punick</hi> Columns of <hi>Ioshuah</hi> and <hi>Adorams</hi> Tomb in <hi>Spain, Villalpand, Crinessius,</hi> old Hebrew in <hi>Larius,</hi> Mr. <hi>Selden de Dis Syris,</hi> and <hi>de Iure Gentium,</hi> that I say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Tuscans Antiquities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, if any thing, I could wish the <hi>Samaritan Pentateuch,</hi> where the true Ancient <hi>Hebrew,</hi> (as so many, before <hi>Marinus,</hi>) it should be in <hi>Terahs</hi> Age, at his Death, which would more settle <hi>Chronology,</hi> than else I find it possible, he being there sixty Years younger when he Dyed than our Bibles make him; so that <hi>Abraham</hi> might be born at his Seventy, in which the <hi>Iesuit</hi> also agreeth unto <hi>Scaliger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:49639:27"/>I cannot believe the Story of <hi>Ulysses</hi> Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hither, or that <hi>Hannibal</hi> did Conquer <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> although it be recorded in a <hi>Iewish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of as much note as <hi>Gorionides</hi>; but the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake is of <hi>Bretany,</hi> for the <hi>Brettian, Brutian</hi> or <hi>Brescian</hi> Tract in <hi>Italy</hi>; and such a slip is also found in some Copies of <hi>Polibius Atheneus,</hi> and the Fragments of <hi>Olympiodorus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of <hi>Phenician</hi> Traffick hereabout, there are many Proofs and Reliques, beside the Famous Story of the <hi>Punick</hi> Pilot, who was commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Rewarded by the State of <hi>Carthage,</hi> for sinking his Ship and Fraught rather than he would be forced by the <hi>Romans</hi> to discover the <hi>Punick</hi> Traffick for <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Tin,</hi> found about the <hi>British</hi> Islands, therefore called <hi>Cassieterides.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which so many Greek Authors before <hi>Strabo</hi> or <hi>Pliny,</hi> who relate the <hi>Carthaginian</hi> and <hi>Marsilian</hi> Traffick for those Oars. And <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> telleth us, that 1241. there was no <hi>Tin</hi> (that he had heard) in all the World, but in <hi>Cornwall</hi> only: And then it came to be found in some parts of <hi>Almain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned Author of the late <hi>Peleg</hi> (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong divers other Brittish words) hath found a new Etymology for the Name of <hi>Britain</hi>;

which (notwithstanding <hi>Brith,</hi> for Colour or Painting, and <hi>Bretas,</hi> in some Greek Poets, for a <hi>Picture</hi> or a <hi>Painted Brat</hi>) he would have to be called by the <hi>Phaenicians, Berat Anac,</hi> or the <hi>Field of Tin and Lead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I may add the Northern Sea, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of old the <hi>Phronean</hi> Ocean, or the Sea of <hi>Saturn,</hi> whom they feigned to lye asleep in the Bottom of that Sea, bound by <hi>Iupiter</hi> in a <hi>Golden Pumice,</hi> of which <hi>Plutarch, Eusebius, Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> and divers others; and of this, the Author of the <hi>Veyl,</hi> or <hi>Mask of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which I must speak but little, only this for a <hi>Clavis</hi>: The <hi>Scene</hi> is the little World, or Isle of <hi>Brittain; Thule,</hi> some appendant to that Crown, or <hi>Scotland,</hi> whose troubles of 1639. are shadowed in the night work, called <hi>Scotos,</hi> (or Darkness) <hi>Saturn,</hi> the <hi>Scottish</hi> Genius, and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> the Clergy, but in special the late <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury; Iupiter</hi> (the Son of <hi>Saturn</hi>) or a great <hi>Scottish</hi> Lord, lately on the <hi>Scene,</hi> that was first sent to reconcile <hi>Saturn,</hi> but he turned <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trograde.

Phoebus</hi> and <hi>Phoebe,</hi> need no gloss. <hi>Imperii fata,</hi> plain enough to those that know that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Phoebe</hi> might have there seen (before this Parliament,) that <hi>Peace</hi> had been her <hi>Work,</hi> and should have been her <hi>Happiness</hi>: nor is it yet too late, or wholly past. <hi>Habent etiam sua fata Reginae</hi>; and there is a silent Patience which may Conquer more than all the World can get by <hi>Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who will unmask the <hi>Chymical Part?</hi> which the Poets also Veiled in their Fables of <hi>Saturn,</hi> bound by <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Golden Pumice;</hi> and it may be possible that future Ages may be brought to see or know the Treasures in our <hi>Chronian</hi> Ocean, and the meaning of that Riddle.

            <p>And upon him the Patrons of <hi>Succession</hi> build a fixed <hi>Monarchy,</hi> which was not such it seems before; nor since, if we may believe those we can hardly disprove, that from this time begin the petty Princes, <hi>&amp; plurimis Regulis supremam Mandandi &amp; Iudicandi Authoritatem.</hi>

            <p>And themselves divide the Crown between his two Sons, <hi>Brennus</hi> the <hi>British Thunderbolt</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> (and some do carry him as <hi>Lightning</hi> to <hi>Delphos,</hi>) while his Brother <hi>Belin</hi> did return and dye in peace; and first of <hi>British</hi> Kings was burnt to <hi>Ashes,</hi> yet he lived here in <hi>Bilings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> and <hi>Key,</hi> besides his famous <hi>Ways</hi> or <hi>Streets,</hi> his own and Fathers <hi>Laws,</hi> (which with the <hi>Mertian</hi> came to us through <hi>Alfred.</hi>) But we need not go to his Daughter <hi>Cambra</hi> for the first Affinity between the <hi>Brittans</hi> and <hi>Sicambrian Francks,</hi> or <hi>Gaulish Germans.</hi>

               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:49639:29"/>Come we now to <hi>Cesar</hi>'s time, <hi>Lud</hi> is alive in <hi>Ludgate, London,</hi> (as before,) he did amend the Laws, but by a <hi>Common-Council:</hi> And such Council did reject his Sons, and Chose <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velane</hi> (as <hi>Caesar</hi> doth agree with <hi>British</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.) He did summon one (that slew his Kinsman) to appear and submit himself to Judgment, <hi>Sententiam quam proceres Dictarent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the famous <hi>Androgeus</hi> protected him in <hi>London</hi> (being then the Governour,) pleading the Custom and priviledge of that City, which had also then a Court to hear and determine, all the Pleas of Citizens, or <hi>Quicquid aliquis in Homine suos clamaret,</hi> and that also by Ancient Prescription, <hi>ex Veterum traditione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which from <hi>Monmouth, Virrunnius Ponticus,</hi> and others may be compared with the Laws of the <hi>Confessor,</hi> for <hi>Troinovant</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> and its weekly <hi>Hustings,</hi> and <hi>Ardua Compota,</hi> and <hi>Ambigua placita Coronae,</hi> and for the <hi>Courts of the whole Kingdom</hi> there, whence it is called <hi>Caput Regni &amp; Legum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which may also be compared with that of the <hi>Mirror,</hi> for Parliaments to be in <hi>London</hi> by ancient Laws, which is here expressed, <hi>Iuxta
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:49639:30"/>
veteres Consuetudines bonorum Patrum &amp; Predecesso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, &amp; omnium Principum &amp; Procerum, &amp; Sapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entum seniorum Regni,</hi> very full and clear, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments of all Estates.</p>
            <p>That which is added of those <hi>Courts,</hi> to sit and hold wherever the King was, is <hi>British</hi> also as well as <hi>Saxon.</hi> So the Laws of <hi>Howel, Dha,</hi> the <hi>Good,</hi> (in the Chronicles of <hi>Wales,</hi> but larger in Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi>) <hi>Ubicunque Sacerdos, &amp; Destein, &amp; Iudex, ibi Dignitas Curiae &amp; Aula Regia, licet Rex absens sit</hi>: and this is one Reason why the King was never <hi>Nonsuit</hi>; because he was supposed <hi>present</hi> in all <hi>Courts</hi>: and yet his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys <hi>Ulterius non vult,</hi> had the effect of a <hi>Nonsuit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for <hi>London</hi> and its Antiquity before <hi>Rome, Stephanides</hi> (a Monk as old as K. <hi>Henry</hi> the first, now in Print,) may be compared with <hi>Tacitus, Ammianus Marcelinus,</hi> nay, with <hi>Caesar</hi> also for the <hi>Trinobantes,</hi> although some think he never saw this City. But the Charters of K. <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Hen.</hi> the first are in Print; so also of <hi>Richard</hi> the first, and K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> in <hi>Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and others, which yet must not perswade us that <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were then first Created here.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Counts</hi> or <hi>Viscounts</hi> are as old as <hi>Counties</hi>:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:49639:30"/>
and the <hi>Brittish</hi> Authors speak of Dukes of <hi>Troynovant,</hi> (such was <hi>Androgeus,</hi>) and <hi>pro Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulibus vice-comites, in Fitz-Stephen,</hi> and <hi>Willielm. de Einford vice-comes de London, &amp; Ioannes Subviceco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Ramsey, Wallbrook Case</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi> the first; that I may say nothing of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the <hi>Chamberlain de Londonia,</hi> of whom before in <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. which may be premised to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Quo Warranto,</hi> brought in <hi>Edward</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>British</hi> Kings, I cannot deny but some Authors do Record the Crown (as by Act of Parliament,) settled on the Heirs of <hi>Cassivelane</hi>; but themselves also can shew us the very next King brought in by <hi>Election,</hi> (not from <hi>Cassivelane,</hi>) and that both of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> too, if we may believe <hi>Chaucer,</hi> or the old <hi>Fructus Temporum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Theomantius</hi> (many of their names are Greek,) was Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> when he was <hi>Elected</hi> King; He doth yet live in a Famous Son, great <hi>Arviragus,</hi> (whom the Roman Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and so many others praise,) he did amend the Laws, but by consent of Parliament; for all agree that a <hi>Senate</hi> was <hi>Elected</hi> (or <hi>Dilected</hi> as they speak,) in his time; not then first
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:49639:31"/>
Created, but it might be renewed after the <hi>Romans</hi> had so much interrupted it, of which before from <hi>Tacitus;</hi> so far am I still from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving our first Parliament did come from the <hi>Roman Senate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a known History, how that King Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing himself from his <hi>Scottish</hi> Queen, and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a Daughter of <hi>Claudius Caesar,</hi> (at <hi>Claudio Cestre,</hi>) was censured by his Parliament or <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres,</hi> so that he was fain to exhibit his Answer in Writing, which is still left us in Fragments in divers places.</p>
            <p>Amongst other passages, he said, he knew not but it might be lawful for him to have more Wives than one; <hi>Eo quod Leges Britanno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, illuc usque id nunquam prohibuissent,</hi> because the <hi>Brittish Laws</hi> had not yet forbidden it.</p>
            <p>I must not here dispute what moved <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to desire and send for the <hi>Roman Laws,</hi> nay, and that for the <hi>State</hi> also. Nor can I yet Subscribe to them that think the <hi>Britains</hi> to be wholly Governed by <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, from <hi>Claudius</hi> to <hi>Attila</hi>'s time.</p>
            <p>But could the <hi>British</hi> King send out for <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> Laws, or call them in without consent of Parliament? it might not be, and <hi>Eleutherius</hi>'s
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:49639:31"/>
Answer is in Print, (among the <hi>Confessors</hi> Laws and every where,) <hi>ad Petitionem Regis &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerum Regni Britanniae.

            <p>They which begin our <hi>British Christianity</hi> from <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> seem not to consider his Epistle, granting that the <hi>Britans</hi> were already Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and had both the Old and New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Susceptis nuper Mis.

            <p>But again to the <hi>Brittish</hi> Parliaments, for so we read in the Laws of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> (out of <hi>British, Trojan, Grecian,</hi> &amp;c.) that in the very first times of Christian Religion in this Island, Laws were made by a Common-Council of Bishops and other Wise Men; with that of <hi>Bede, Servabant Reges sacerdotes privati, &amp; Optima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes suum quique Ordinem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Lucius,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi> could not soon agree about the Choice of another King; ('tis every where,) 'ere long they chose <hi>Asclepiodat</hi> the Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> by consent of <hi>Commons</hi> also; <hi>Communi assensu &amp; annuente Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo</hi>: Troublesome he was to all the <hi>Romans,</hi> but especially to <hi>Gallus,</hi> who hath left his Name

in <hi>Walbrook,</hi> as the <hi>Gauls</hi> (some think) in <hi>Wales</hi>; but for this <hi>Polydor Virgil,</hi> and the <hi>Confessors</hi> Acts, with the Laws of King <hi>Ina,</hi> may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Monmouth, Virunnius, Basingstoke, Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legus, Gyraldus,</hi> and some passages of <hi>Bede.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Coel</hi> e're long appeareth on the Scene, but yet against <hi>Succession</hi>; and he cannot dye so long as <hi>Helen</hi> liveth, Mother to the Christian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, but Daughter to our <hi>Brittish Coel,</hi> who was also Father unto <hi>Colchester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are come to times of more certainty, when that deadly wound (of one of the <hi>Heads</hi>) had made the <hi>Roman Empire</hi> gasp, as if it would Expire and breathe no more; it had little list or leisure to command or Counsel any of the <hi>Toes,</hi> or other Members at a Distance.</p>
            <p>In this point of time the <hi>Britains</hi> Rose (with other Nations) and did soon recover most of that the <hi>Romans</hi> held by force; their Laws and Customs now were free, 'tis yielded us by all: but they could hardly turn and view their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, before they came to be new Slaves to the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> ancient Appendants to the <hi>Brittish</hi> Crown in Fee.</p>
            <p>The Roman <hi>Consul</hi> then in <hi>Gaul,</hi> could not regard the Brittish Sighs and Tears, which himself
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:49639:33"/>
knew to be as just as pitiful; for had the <hi>Romans</hi> not so gleaned <hi>Britain</hi> of its Glory, (for their Conquest of other Nations,) they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver asked help it seems against the <hi>Scots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the <hi>Romans</hi> they had first recourse to their Neighbour <hi>Gauls,</hi> or to their Countrey-men in <hi>Gaul,</hi> for such they were in that which to this day is called <hi>Brittany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon what terms they had help from them I dispute not; their King had as great a Name as the great <hi>Constantine,</hi> but how himself or his Sons like the <hi>Brittish</hi> Reins, we may guess in part from what we read in <hi>Gildas Tears</hi> for his poor Countrey; where he complaineth that Kings were Elected and Anointed for nothing of God or of Good in them, but only for their Force, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is also found in another Author (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Gildas</hi>) as old as King <hi>Stephen</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, which may the more perswade us that <hi>Monmouth</hi> had good Authority for what he Writes of those times, for he also hath <hi>Gildas</hi>'s words, with very little variation.</p>
            <p>By which we see the Law, or at least the Custom of those times, both for <hi>Electing, Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Kings among our <hi>British</hi> Ancestors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:49639:33"/>Two of those Kings may be <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Constans,</hi> who are said to be Slain by some of their Guard or Attendants, yet so as divers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate it came from a farther and an higher Hand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constans</hi> also came up to the Crown by a Faction rather than a free Choice, as all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; who ascribe it to the Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> not without great Contests of divers Lords, and with little consent of Commons, <hi>vix Annuente Populo,</hi> as we may read in divers Authors, who are also plain enough to make us know, that he was pulled down by the same Hands that set him up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vortiger</hi> came next, but on <hi>Election,</hi> it is agreed by all; and that there were two Royal Princes (Sons to the late, and Brothers to the last King,) who must wait for the Crown with much Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.</p>
            <p>How he called in the <hi>Saxons</hi> by consent of <hi>Parliament,</hi> I shewed before in the <hi>Militia,</hi> and I might confirm it from divers others; who do also Record, that the King told the <hi>Saxons</hi> that he durst not without the Consent of his <hi>Proceres,</hi> assign them any Land, or City, or Castle; for that it was <hi>against the Laws of his Kingdom, &amp;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:49639:34"/>
prohibitus sum, quod Proceres Regni dissuaderent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet it may seem the Lords agreed to their setling in <hi>Thanet</hi> afterwards, but the Commons Dissented so, that they resolved to drive them out again, and that in Common-Council or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: <hi>Concilium fecerunt cum Majoribus suis, ut pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem disrumperent; &amp; dixerunt, Recedite à nobis,</hi> &amp;c. My Author is old <hi>Nennius</hi> of <hi>Bangor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He hath clear passages for Parliaments in that time, and for their Power also: As for <hi>Incest</hi> with his own Daughter, <hi>Vortiger</hi> was first Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, (perhaps with the <hi>Iewish</hi> Discipline, which was here also till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second) and St. <hi>Germane</hi> the Arch-Prelate, came with the whole Convocation-House <hi>(Cum omni Clero Britanniae) Corripere Eum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nennius</hi> saith, that in a great Moot of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Laity, he was so roughly handled, that he rose up in a great Rage and Fled, or at least sought how to Flye, but he was Banned; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledictus est, &amp; damnatus a beato Germano.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Afterwards <hi>Vortimer</hi> was chosen King, ('tis every where) but after divers Victories he Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Poysoned (as some thought) by <hi>Vortiger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He now Combineth with the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and by their Power entreth the Scene again, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:49639:34"/>
with little Consent of the <hi>Britains</hi>; and although he Acted a while, yet he was Hissed off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing odious to all, till at length his Heart brake. <hi>Nennius</hi> addeth, that some said the Earth open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him; and St. <hi>Germane</hi> Writeth, that his whole Family was Burnt from Heaven, which was much ascribed to the Clergies Curse or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which was in use among the <hi>Britains,</hi> and that also upon their Princes, of which we have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny examples; as of <hi>Teuder,</hi> and <hi>Clotri,</hi> for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide and Perjury, and <hi>Hovel, Glevissicg,</hi> and <hi>Brochwell</hi> did hardly escape by a great Fine <hi>&amp; Iudicium Suffere non potuit,</hi> of which Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi> in his <hi>Synods</hi> of <hi>Landaf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was then by much more heavy than of late: <hi>Caesar</hi> observeth it among the <hi>Druids,</hi> and in him it is <hi>Poena Gravissima;</hi> adding also, that such Persons were Abhorred by all as some Loathsome Disease, and that they might have no Honour or Right of Law, <hi>Neque iis petenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Ius redditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And among St. <hi>Patricks</hi> Canons we find the <hi>Excommunicate</hi> excluded, <hi>à Communione, &amp; Mensa, &amp; Missa, &amp; Pace</hi>; their Ceremonies in this seem a-kin to the <hi>Iewish Cherem,</hi> nay, to their <hi>Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matha,</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:49639:35"/>
(or St. <hi>Pauls Maranatha,</hi>) and it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued among the <hi>Saxons</hi> also, as we may see in the Laws of <hi>Canute,</hi> making it Capital to protect or harbour any such: But in the <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors</hi> Acts, when an <hi>Excommunicate</hi> fled to the Bishop for Absolution, <hi>Eundo &amp; redeundo Pacem habeat</hi>; else it seems they were as <hi>Out-Laws,</hi> who might then be Killed by any that met them, as the same Laws of <hi>Woolfshead</hi> in another Chapter.</p>
            <p>Which may help us to Interpret those that speak of the <hi>Iews</hi> being <hi>Excommunicate</hi>; nay, and that also by <hi>Seculars</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> of which in <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> and his <hi>Additaments</hi>; but his <hi>Glossar</hi> rightly expresseth it by the University Phrase of <hi>Discommoning Townsmen,</hi> which of old was much worse it seems than now.</p>

            <p>At his Death a <hi>Comet</hi> like a <hi>Dragon,</hi> and the <hi>Bards</hi> apply it to his Brother, thence called <hi>Uther-Pendragon; Florilegus</hi> addeth, that he made two <hi>Dragons</hi> of Gold, Offering one, and carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

the other still before him, whence the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon</hi> in our English <hi>Standard,</hi> although some have asserted much of him they call St. <hi>George.</hi>

            <p>For <hi>Arthurs</hi> Parliaments, it would be much Superfluous to produce more proof than what already is in Sir <hi>Iohn Price, Cajus, Leland,</hi> or others that assert his History; this I shall only add, that in this of all we may Credit <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who is so punctual in nothing as in vouching each <hi>County</hi> and <hi>City</hi> that made up his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Ex Diversis Provinciis, proceres Brittonum Duces;</hi> and among others, <hi>Dux Doroberine Consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> both of <hi>Counties</hi> and <hi>Cityes, Boso Ridocensis,</hi> id est, <hi>Oxonefordiae,</hi> Lot <hi>Consul Londonesiae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>In the <hi>Danish</hi> Storm he fled to <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Parliament sent him this Message, (in <hi>VVigornensis, Hoveden, Huntingdon, Florilegus</hi> and All,) That they would receive it again on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he would govern more Justly, or more Mildly; <hi>si ipse vel Rectius gubernare, vel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi>

Wigornensis</hi> telleth us, that before his Coronation he did solemnly <hi>Swear, Coram Clero &amp; populo, se velle Sanctas Dei Ecclesias &amp; Rectores illarum defendere, nec non cunctum populum juste regere, rectam Legem
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:49639:42"/>
statuere &amp; Tenere,</hi> &amp;c. So also doth <hi>Hoveden. Matthew Paris,</hi> in the Life of <hi>Frethrerick</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> sheweth how free the <hi>Norman</hi> found our Ancestors: <hi>Iugum servitutis à tempore Bruti nescientes, &amp; more Normanorum Barbas radere,</hi> (which they note in <hi>Caesar</hi> also of the <hi>Britains</hi>;) and concludeth, that <hi>pro bono pacis,</hi> he did solemnly swear to observe their Old Laws; <hi>Bonas &amp; Approbatas, antiquas Leges, quas Sancti &amp; Pii Angliae Reges, ejus Antecessores, &amp; Maxime Rex Edwardus statuit, inviolabiliter observare</hi>; (the like Phrase we find in <hi>Ingulph</hi> of the same Laws) which was some Repetition of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation Oath.</p>
            <p>Some affirm that he refused to be Crowned by <hi>Canterbury</hi>; but <hi>Neubrigensis</hi> telleth us, that he sought it of him, <hi>Tyranni nomen exhorrescens, &amp; legitimi Principis personam induere gestiens</hi>; but <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi> denied to lay on his hands, <hi>Viro Cruento &amp; alieni Iuris insavori.</hi> Then he complyed with <hi>York,</hi> and bound himself <hi>Sacris Sacramentis, pro Conservanda Republica, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It might also be added, that if K. <hi>Edward</hi> might dispose the <hi>Crown</hi> as his own <hi>Fee,</hi> yet by the <hi>Common-Law,</hi> or <hi>Statute</hi> of <hi>Calcuth,</hi> he could not dispose it to a <hi>Bastard</hi>; as K. <hi>William</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:49639:43"/>
is expresly called in the Letters sent to the Pope, from the Parliament of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in <hi>Eward</hi> the first, besides his own Charters, and of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to Legitimate him, (that so he might succeed by Common-law:) See the Comments on <hi>Merton</hi> in the second Part of <hi>Institutes,</hi> and of the Laws of <hi>Norway</hi> before.</p>
            <p>But in the Old Book of <hi>Caen,</hi> we may find K. <hi>William</hi> on his death Bed, wishing that his Son might be King of <hi>England,</hi> which he professed he neither found or left as <hi>Inheritance: Neminem Anglici Regni Constituo Haeredem, non enim Tantum Decus, Haereditario Iure possedi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That K. <hi>William</hi> the second, K. <hi>Henry</hi> the first, and K. <hi>Stephen</hi> came to the Crown by <hi>Election,</hi> without Right of Succession, is so much agreed by all, that it were vain to prove it. Their <hi>Elections</hi> and their <hi>Oaths,</hi> are every where among the Monks and good Historians: So also of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, and <hi>Rich.</hi> the first.</p>
            <p>But in K. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Coronation we are brought beyond dispute, in full Parliament, of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Earls, Barons and all others, which were to be present; the Arch-bishop stood in the midst and said, <hi>Audite universi, noverit Discretio vestra,</hi> &amp;c. It is well known to you All, that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:49639:43"/>
               <hi>no Man hath Right of Succession to this Crown, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that by unanimous consent of the Kingdom, with Invocation on the Holy Ghost, he be Elected from his own Deserts: Lectus &amp; secundum Morum Eminantiam praeelectus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if any of the last Kings Race be more worthy and better than others, his Election is more proper or more Reasonable: Pronius &amp; promptius in Electionem ejus est consentiendum: As it now is in Earl</hi> John, <hi>here present.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor was any one found that could dissent, or oppose what was so spoken; for they all knew it was not without much Reason and good Warrant from their Laws and Customs; <hi>Scïentes quod sine Causa hoc non sic definiverat</hi>: For which <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> or <hi>Wendover,</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Hoveden, Westminster,</hi> and others of those Times.</p>
            <p>Which seemeth most rightly to state the nature of <hi>Succession,</hi> as it was in this Kingdom. So that all did amount but to this, That if a King had such Children, so qualified, and so Educated, that they were above others in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Wisdom, and true worth, (or at least, <hi>Caeteres Pares,</hi>) they were the most likely <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates</hi> for the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as we found before among the <hi>Iews,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:49639:44"/>
in the strictest <hi>Succession,</hi> where the <hi>Crown</hi> was especially tied to the House of <hi>David</hi>; yet their great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> had alwayes the Power and Right to determine of the Claims, Interests, Deserts and Vertues of Heirs, or all Pretenders: So if here we allow not such a Legal power of Judging of Claims or Titles, to be placed somewhere or other; our Ancestors did leave the Crown at a more blind uncertainty than in all other things they were accustomed, from the Law of Nature and Right Reason.</p>
            <p>I might add the <hi>Formal</hi> of <hi>Coronation,</hi> joyned to the <hi>Irish Modus</hi> of Parliament, under the Great Seal of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, where we read: <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio à Plebe ad Regem, ut consecretur; Postquam ad Idem iterum Consenserit</hi>; and again, <hi>Electum interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Metropolitanus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>How our Allegiance was of Old, tied to the Kings Person, not to his Heirs nor to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son but together with the Kingdom and the Laws and Rights thereof, hath been observed already. Much I might add of latter times, Nay, that very Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, which of late was pressed for the King and his <hi>Militia,</hi> or taking Arms with him as Allegiance required; doth expresly declare our <hi>Allegiance</hi> to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:49639:44"/>
be to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> with the King; and that by such <hi>Allegiance,</hi> men are tied to serve the King <hi>for defence of him and the Land.</hi> And for the Kings <hi>Heirs,</hi> I find them not in our <hi>Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> Yet the Statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. are punctual in expressing the Kings <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or Rights of the <hi>Crown</hi>; but where is provision for his <hi>Heirs</hi>?</p>
            <p>In <hi>Eward</hi> the Third, the <hi>Iudges Oaths</hi> were made, and stand among the Statutes as enacted by <hi>Parliament,</hi> (although I do not find it so upon the <hi>Rolls</hi>;) And there is a Clause against Consent to the Kings Damage or <hi>Disherison</hi>: So also it is in the Oaths of divers in the Courts of Justice, as of Masters of <hi>Chnacery,</hi> with the Kings Serjeants, or Councel at Law, and others; but not so by Parliament. See the third Part of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutes, Cap.</hi> 101. Yet our Old <hi>Allegiance</hi> did forbid <hi>Disherison</hi> or <hi>Damage,</hi> but with <hi>Limitation,</hi> as we shewed before.</p>
            <p>The late Oaths of <hi>Allegiance</hi> in King <hi>Iames,</hi> and of <hi>Supremacy</hi> in <hi>Q. Elizabeth</hi> (taken by Parliament-men and divers others,) are to the Kings Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and his Heirs and <hi>Successors,</hi> with particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to defence of the <hi>Crown</hi> and <hi>Dignities</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: Which is Remarkable, and that which may seem to excuse some, in not assent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:49639:45"/>
to others which are not so obliged; and yet it is thought by some, that the main or one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meaning of those Oaths, was against <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>forreign Enemies</hi>: For which also a Declaration in the Queens <hi>Injunctions</hi> may be considered. But in all Cases of real Scruple, I cannot cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure any that (in a quiet humble manner, seeking Peace and Truth,) followeth his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science till it is rightly informed.</p>
            <p>In the Quarrels of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaster,</hi> there was an Act (in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth) to <hi>entail</hi> the <hi>Crown</hi> upon the Kings <hi>Issue,</hi> of which four are there named: But in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, the Parliament declared the <hi>Succession</hi> to the <hi>Crown</hi> not yet settled or cleared enough; and then it was <hi>entailed</hi> again, and for lack <hi>Heirs</hi> Male, upon <hi>Elizabeth</hi>: But this again repealed in <hi>Mary</hi>; and again in <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and <hi>Iames.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much or how little these annulled the <hi>Common-law,</hi> I must submit to others: lest upon debate, I should be forced to yield it might be possible for future Parliaments to reduce <hi>Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> to <hi>Election,</hi> as justly as some late Parliaments did turn the <hi>Common-law</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> into such or such a <hi>Succession</hi>; which can only stand by <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi>; if it be true (as all tell us) that there was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:49639:45"/>
no <hi>entailed</hi> Inheritance but by <hi>Statute-law,</hi> since the Second of <hi>Westminster,</hi> of which before.</p>
            <p>How little Power Kings had over their Crown or Kingdom without consent of Parliament; (besides all that is said already,) might be further cleared from the acknowledgments of Kings Themselves, below the time of the Conquest.</p>
            <p>In the Conquest, about <hi>Investitures,</hi> K. <hi>Henry</hi> the first wrote to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he could not dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the usual Rights and Dignities of the Crown or Kingdom; and that if he should be so Abject as to attempt it, his Parliament would not permit it. <hi>Optimates mei &amp; totius Angliae Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulus id nullo modo pateretur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the great Moot of <hi>Scotlands</hi> dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>England, Edward</hi> the First confessed as much to another <hi>Pope</hi>; to whom also the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament (both <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>) wrote, that they they were all obliged by Oath to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Just Rights, Liberties, Laws and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of the Kingdom; (where we may see their Oath of <hi>Allegiance</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom,</hi>) that nothing should be acted against Them, <hi>In exheraeditionem Iuris Coronae, &amp; Regie Dignitatis, ac subversionem status ejusdem Regni, nec non praejudicium Libertatum, Consuetudinum &amp; Legum Paternarum.</hi> These are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:49639:46"/>
on the Rolls, and printed on the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> and in <hi>Walsinghams Edward</hi> 1. and the <hi>Surveigh</hi> of <hi>Normandy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And from other Records of the same King, we learn that when the Pope demanded the Grants of K. <hi>Iohn,</hi> he answered, That he could not do it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of his Parliament: <hi>Sine Praelatis &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceribus Regni</hi>; being tyed by his <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> to keep all the Laws and Rights of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Illibati</hi>; and to do nothing that might touch the Crown without their Consent. Which may be added to that before in St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws, of the Kings Oath, to <hi>do all things</hi> Ritè, <hi>per Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium Procerum Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the King of <hi>France</hi> demanded Homage of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the Third, he desired Respite, till he had the Advice of his Great Council, (as we may read in <hi>Froizard</hi>;) because he could not act without them in such great Affairs.</p>
            <p>And when the <hi>Pope</hi> demanded Homage of the same King; he referred it to Parliament, who adjudged and declared, that K. <hi>Iohns</hi> Grants to the <hi>Pope,</hi> were unjust, illegal, and against his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> being done without his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Assent or Counsel: And yet K. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (to the Pope) in <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> doth pretend it done <hi>Communi Concilio Baronum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:49639:46"/>And about <hi>Stephen Langton,</hi> the same K. <hi>Iohn</hi> did write to the <hi>Pope,</hi> that he could not depart from the Liberties of his Crown, but would, or should defend them to his Death: And hence began the Great Excommunication, which begot a Confiscation of the Church Revenues; <hi>&amp; hinc ille Lachrymae,</hi> which could not be stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, till the Crown did stoop to <hi>Pandulph</hi>; which might have excused the poor Hermit, <hi>Peter,</hi> from being so cruelly dragged from <hi>Corf<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Castle to <hi>Warham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when the same King felt his Arms loose, he laid about him so, that all believed he meant to strike. In that <hi>Meen</hi> the Arch-bishop told him, It was against <hi>his Oath,</hi> to raise or make War without the Consent of his Great Court: <hi>Si absque Iudicio Curiae suae, Contra quempiam Bellum moveret,</hi> to be added to the <hi>Militia</hi>: But the fire was already kindled, and the Smoak or Flame brake out at <hi>Nottingham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must not touch the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> except I had leisure to discourse and discuss them freely: Only, as we found our <hi>Great Charters,</hi> made up of old Laws and Customs; so I might now also clear it more, that it was not a new Fetter on the King to have some <hi>Supervisors</hi> set about
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:49639:47"/>
him, for to order all his Actions; who, by his <hi>Coronation Oath,</hi> was tied to do nothing touching the Kingdom, but with Advice and Consent of the <hi>Great</hi> Council; <hi>per Concilium, &amp; per Iudicium Procerum Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That it was so also among the <hi>Britains,</hi> to all observed before, I might add, the Old <hi>Scottish</hi> Custom of choosing Twelve <hi>Peers</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> to be the <hi>Kings Tutors,</hi> as we may call them; for by them the King must be wholly governed; <hi>Quorum Concilio Rex Regnum guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare debebat,</hi> as we may read it in <hi>Walsinghams Edward</hi> 1. besides their own Chronicles; that I say nothing of the Twelve Brittish <hi>Peers,</hi> of which <hi>Cambden</hi> in <hi>Siluribus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need not much wonder at the Writs in K. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Time, requiring all Men of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to oblige themselves by Oath, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Great Charter, and to compel the King thereunto: <hi>Et quod ipsum Regem pro posse suo, per Captionem Castrorum suorum, distringerent &amp; grava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, ad praefata Omnia Exequenda;</hi> when as this very Clause was in his Charter; <hi>Et illi Barones, cum Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na totius Terrae, distringent &amp; gravabat nos, modis Omnibus quibus poterunt, scilicet per Captionem Castro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, terrarum possessionum, &amp; aliis modis quibus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerint;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:49639:47"/>
donec fuit emendatum secundum Arbitrium eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Which may be added to that before of our <hi>Allegiance,</hi> or Oath of Fealty to the King with the Kingdom, and of the <hi>Kings</hi> Oath to be guided by the Judgment of his Great Court.</p>
            <p>Nay, as if K. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>Salva persona,</hi> N. <hi>&amp; Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginae</hi> N. <hi>&amp; Liberorum</hi> N. had been too loose; in K. <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter it was expressed thus, <hi>Licet Omnibus de Regno</hi> N. <hi>contra Nos insurgere</hi>; Nay, and to <hi>do all things, quae gravamen nostrum respiciant, ac si nobis in Nullo tenerentur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These times seem not to attend our Grand Maxim of State, <hi>The King can do no wrong</hi>; or at least they understood it not, as some late Courtiers would perswade us: Yet it is true, he can do nothing but by Law; and what he may by <hi>Law,</hi> can do no <hi>wrong</hi>: And if he do against the <hi>Law,</hi> his Personal Acts, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, or Writing, do oblige no more than if they were a <hi>Childs</hi>: And the Books call him an <hi>Infant</hi> in Law (though his Politick Capacity be not in <hi>Nonage</hi>; as the Parliament declared in <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth;) which is not to exempt him from <hi>Errors,</hi> or to excuse his <hi>Crimes</hi>; but to shew that he must be guided by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:49639:48"/>
and that his own Personal Grants or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands cannot hurt any more than an <hi>Infants</hi>; which may be reclaimed and recalled by the Council of the Kingdom. So the <hi>Mirror</hi> saith, The King cannot grant a Franchise to prejudice his Crown or others; because he holds his Right and Dignities but as an <hi>Infant, Cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Sect.</hi> 22.</p>
            <p>If I should say, The <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament are and were the <hi>Kingdoms Peers</hi>; as well as the Lords, I might vouch an Old Authority, as good as the Ancient <hi>Modus</hi> of Parliament, which doth often call the <hi>Commons, Peers</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, as well as the <hi>Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, <hi>debent Auxilia Peti pleno Parliamento, &amp; in scripto cuilibet graduum Parium Parliamenti; &amp; opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tet quod omnes Pares Parliamenti consentiant; &amp; duo milites pro Comitatu majorem vocem habent in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedendo, &amp; contradicendo, quam Major Comes An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>So in doubtful Cases of Peace and War, <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputetur per Pares Parliamenti</hi>: and if need be, Twenty five shall be chosen <hi>de omnibus paribus Regni</hi>; which are so specified, Two <hi>Bishops,</hi> Three <hi>Proctors,</hi> Two <hi>Earls,</hi> Three <hi>Barons,</hi> Five <hi>Knights,</hi> Five <hi>Citizens,</hi> and Five Burgesses. And
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:49639:48"/>
again, <hi>Omnes Pares Parliamenti sedebunt, &amp; nullus stabit, sed quando loquitur, ut omnes audiantur à Paribus.</hi> And again, <hi>Nullus solus potest nec debet recedere à Parliamento sine Licentia Regis, &amp; omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um Parium Parliamenti, &amp; hoc in pleno Parliamento; Ità quod inde fiat mentio in Rotulis Parliamenti.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may be possible, That <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> with others, may use the Phrase <hi>Pares,</hi> in such a sence; when they say, That the <hi>King</hi> or his <hi>Commissioners</hi> should not judge and determine of <hi>Treason,</hi> but <hi>Pares.</hi> Which may be added to the 25<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. reserving <hi>Treason</hi> to Parliament, where of Old, it seemeth only determinable; so that <hi>The Mirror</hi> would not have it <hi>Endicted,</hi> but by Accusation and in full Parliament, as in King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Time, <hi>&amp;c. Cap.</hi> 2. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11. and in <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3<hi>d</hi> it was enacted, That Offences of Peers, and great Officers, and those who sued against the Laws, should be tryed in <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although now the Phrase be given to all the <hi>Lords</hi> of Parliament, yet it was most or only proper to the <hi>Earls,</hi> whom by Law and custom the <hi>King</hi> styleth <hi>Consanguineos,</hi> and he might style them his <hi>Peers</hi> or <hi>Companions,</hi> as in Latine <hi>Comites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Bracton, Comites dicuntur quasi Socii Regis,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:49639:49"/>
&amp; qui habet Socium, habet Magistrum</hi>; and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place, <hi>A Societate Reges, enim tales sibi Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciant ad consulendum &amp; regendum Populum Dei</hi>; and the like is in <hi>Fleta, Comites à Comitiva dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, qui cum viderint Regem sine Freno, Frenum sibi apponere tenentur,</hi> &amp;c. which is also in <hi>Bracton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Mirror</hi> is yet clearer, although the King had no Equals, yet because himself or his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missars might not be Judge, it was provided by Law that he should have <hi>Companions</hi> to hear and determine all his Torts, <hi>&amp;c, Aux Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and those <hi>Companions</hi> were called <hi>Countees,</hi> (Earls) from the Latine <hi>Comites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So also <hi>Sarisberiensis</hi> (cited before) in <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. <hi>Comites à Societatis participatione dici quisquis ignorat ignarus est literarum,</hi> &amp;c. some will have them, <hi>Comites &amp; Socii in Fisca,</hi> because of old, some <hi>Earls</hi> had a third part of profits accrewing by Pleas and Forfeitures in their <hi>Counties,</hi> as the Laws of the <hi>Confessor,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his <hi>Comes</hi>; but he will also grant their name <hi>à Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiva potestate,</hi> rather than from such <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of profits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the old <hi>Sheriffs</hi> also, who were <hi>Vice-Comites,</hi> did come to <hi>Parliament,</hi> appeareth in the Ancient Writs and Histories; and yet the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:49639:49"/>
               <hi>Barons</hi> seem to be the Kingdoms <hi>Iudges,</hi> and the present <hi>Earls</hi> may seem to sit in Parliament but onely as <hi>Barons,</hi> who are now all Peers and Lords and Parliament.</p>
            <p>But although the Lords were the great <hi>Iudges</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and of all Members thereof, yet it is well known, that in full Parliament, as old as <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. they did not only acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but protest that they were not to <hi>Iudge the Commons</hi> in Cases of <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Felony,</hi> being not their <hi>Peers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How it was in <hi>Rich.</hi> the Second, may be seen at large in the Rolls and Records now printed: in <hi>Edward</hi> the Second the <hi>Commons</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the Judgment of the <hi>Lords,</hi> for which also the <hi>Fructus temporum</hi> cited before, may be added to all in the Road.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Appeals</hi> and Writs of <hi>Error</hi> were from the <hi>King</hi> to the <hi>Lords,</hi> in Ecclesiasticals that touched the King, they were to the Spiritual Prelates, Abbots and <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors</hi> of the <hi>Upper House,</hi> by Act of Parliament in 24 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. till which it may be <hi>Temporal Lords</hi> had also Cognizance of <hi>such</hi> as well as <hi>Temporals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>Writs of Error</hi> in the Parliament were Judged by the <hi>Lords,</hi> for they came from the <hi>Kings</hi> Court, his <hi>Bench</hi> or his <hi>Exchequer</hi>; and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:49639:50"/>
if <hi>Errors</hi> had been in the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> or below it, they should not be brought into <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> but to the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and from the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> as from the <hi>King</hi> (not otherwise) they came to the <hi>Lords</hi>; and although there was a formal Petition for removing the Record from the <hi>King</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was but of Course, and the King could not deny it.</p>
            <p>Which we found granted by all the old Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers and Historians, (as I shewed before) and by the grand Master and Patron of Law, King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. in <hi>Britton,</hi> because none may Judge in his own Cause, <hi>Therefore in Causes where our self shall be Party, we do consent, que N. Court soit judg Sicome Counts &amp; Barons in Temps de Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Laws of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. one of the Chapters beginneth thus, <hi>Iudices sunt Barones Comitatus, qui liberas in eis terras habent</hi>; for in those times <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> were by <hi>Tenure</hi> only, not by <hi>Patent,</hi> (that I know) till <hi>Beauchamp</hi> of <hi>Holt</hi> in <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. nor by <hi>Writ</hi> (that I can find) till the <hi>Barons</hi> Wars, but K. <hi>Johns</hi> Charter, is to Summon <hi>Comites &amp; Barones Regni majores sigillatim per literas N.</hi> But all <hi>that hold in Capitae, by general Summons</hi> forty days before the Parliament, and that <hi>Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium procedat ad diem assignatum, secundum consilium
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:49639:50"/>
eorum qui presentes fuerint, quamvis non omnes sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniti venerint</hi>; and the Summons of Delinquents or Suitors in Parliament, was to appear and abide the <hi>Judgment of the Court,</hi> not of the <hi>King,</hi> but of his Court, for the <hi>King is Father</hi> and not <hi>Judge</hi> of his People, in his proper Person, as was shewed before; and all the Books agree that he must <hi>Commit his Jurisdiction</hi> unto Judges in the Courts of Justice, and when he might as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume great Offices into his own Hands, by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, all <hi>Judges</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly excepted, and the <hi>Judges</hi> Oaths, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Acts of Parliament require them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to the Law, notwithstanding the <hi>Kings</hi> Command or <hi>Seal</hi> against it, and the <hi>Register</hi> affordeth a <hi>Writ</hi> to Supersede or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke any such Seal from the <hi>King</hi> himself to any of the Judges.</p>
            <p>And the Lord Chief Justices, as the Lord Chancellor and Treasurer were Chosen by the Kingdom, as we found before in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. how much more then should the <hi>Lords</hi> of Parliament be made by Parliament? for else they be the Kings Commissioners.</p>
            <p>So the <hi>Roman</hi> saith, our <hi>German</hi> Fathers chose their <hi>Lords</hi> in Common Council, to be Judges,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:49639:51"/>
               <hi>in iisdem Conciliis Eliguntur &amp; Principes qui Jura red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt. De Minoribus consultant Principes, de Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Omnes.</hi> And <hi>Caesar</hi> also observeth, that their <hi>Princes</hi> (or <hi>Lords</hi>) were their great <hi>Judges; sed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipes Regionem atque Pagorum inter suos jus dicunt, Controversiasque minuunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Tacitus</hi> will also tell us, that with those Princes they did joyn <hi>Commons; Centeni ex Plebe Comites</hi>; which were (perhaps) the Fathers of our County <hi>Hundreds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in K. <hi>Williams</hi> Edition of the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Laws, when he inclined so much to them of <hi>Norwey; Universi Compatriotae Regni, qui Leges Edixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> came and besought him not to change their Old Laws and Customs of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, because they could not <hi>judge</hi> from Laws they understood not; <hi>quia durum valde foret sibi suscipere Leges ignotas; &amp; Judicare de eis quas Nescie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How it was in Parliament, while there were only <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Tenure,</hi> would be more enquired. But of later times, <hi>Commons</hi> have adjudged <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and have joyned with the <hi>Lords</hi> in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging <hi>Lords</hi>; of which there are divers Cases cited, in the Fourth Part of Institutes, <hi>Cap.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:49639:51"/>It may be considered, that many Kingdoms, and Common-wealths (that were not Kingdoms) in all Ages did consist of <hi>Three Estates</hi>; (as of <hi>Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> in Nature, or Bodies Natural;) which might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion the Phrase of <hi>Tribe,</hi> in many other besides the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi>: who in <hi>Three Estates,</hi> were not so Ancient as the <hi>Grecians</hi> or <hi>Aegyptians</hi>; that I speak not of the <hi>Gauls, Britans,</hi> or the <hi>Eastern</hi> Nations.</p>
            <p>And if any would observe, it might be possible to find the Prophets hinting a <hi>Trinity</hi> in divers King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms or Estates; and that not only for moulding, but for overthrowing them: Besides the Three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities, or Three overturnings of the <hi>Iewish</hi> State; and the Three blows of the Goat on the <hi>Ram</hi> in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>; as alluding to the Three great Battles which did break the <hi>Persian</hi> Empire.</p>
            <p>And why may not the Sacred <hi>Trinity</hi> be shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out in Bodies <hi>Politick,</hi> as well as in <hi>Natural</hi>? And if so, our Three <hi>Estates</hi> may be branched as our <hi>Writs,</hi> into <hi>Original, Iudicial</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi>; as shadows of the <hi>Being, Wisdom,</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> Divine.</p>
            <p>If I may not grant, yet I cannot deny <hi>Original</hi> Power to the Commons; <hi>Iudicial</hi> to the Lords, <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> to the King; as the <hi>Spirit</hi> to the Body, or if you will, the <hi>Head</hi> (or Fountain of Sense and Motion;) But he must <hi>see</hi> by two <hi>Eyes,</hi> and <hi>hear</hi> by two <hi>Ears</hi>; as I touched before, yet his very <hi>pardoning</hi> although it be by Law much limited,) doth seem to speak his
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:49639:52"/>
Power <hi>Executive</hi>: And so his <hi>Writs</hi> do speak aright; <hi>Because my Courts have so, and so judged: Therefore I do so, and so, command the Judgment shall be executed.</hi> And if any will assert the <hi>Militia,</hi> to this Power <hi>Executive,</hi> I shall also grant it to the <hi>King</hi>; So that it may be alwayes under the Power <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Judicial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This might belong to the <hi>Lords,</hi> and that to the <hi>Commons.</hi> And the plain truth is, I do not find more Arguments to prove the <hi>Judicial</hi> Power to belong to the <hi>Lords,</hi> than I do for rhe <hi>Legislative</hi> in the <hi>Commons</hi>: And (as it seemeth to be above, so <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> also) it may be much disputed, That the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative, Judicial</hi> and <hi>Executive</hi> power, should be in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Subjects by the Law of <hi>Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if <hi>Law-makers</hi> be <hi>Judges</hi> of those that break their Laws, they seem to Judge in their own Causes: which our Law, and Nature it self so much avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and abhorreth. So it seemeth also to forbid both the <hi>Law-maker</hi> and <hi>Iudge</hi> to <hi>execute</hi>: And by express Act of Parliament, it is provided, That <hi>Sheriffs</hi> be not <hi>Justices,</hi> where they be <hi>Sheriffs.</hi> But if <hi>Execution</hi> be alwayes consonant to <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>This</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi>; there is still most sweet Harmony, and as I may say, a <hi>Sacred Unity</hi> in <hi>Trinity</hi> represented.</p>
            <p>That the Commons should have most Right to the Power <hi>Original,</hi> or <hi>Legislative</hi> in <hi>Nature</hi>; I shall leave to be disputed by others. I shall only touch some few Particulars, which have made me some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:49639:52"/>
to suspect that by our Laws, and Model of this Kingdom, it both was and should be so.</p>
            <p>How the <hi>Roman</hi> Historian found the <hi>Judicial</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given to the <hi>Lords,</hi> by our Old Ancestors, I did observe before; he is as plain for the <hi>Legislative</hi> in the <hi>Commons</hi>: Nay, to the <hi>Lords</hi> themselves, he saith in <hi>Judging</hi> was adjoyned a Committee of Commons, both for <hi>Counsel</hi> and <hi>Authority: Ex plebe Comites, consilium simul &amp; Authoritas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again he sheweth, how the <hi>Lords</hi> did sit in <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi> about the <hi>less</hi> Affairs; but of <hi>greater,</hi> all both <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>: So also that those things which the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> did determine, <hi>Quorum Arbitrium penes Plebem, apud Principes pertractentur</hi>; they should be debated with the <hi>Lords,</hi> for their <hi>Advice,</hi> but not their <hi>Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> Votes.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Mirror</hi> (a good Comment on <hi>Tacitus,</hi> in this) sheweth how our <hi>Lords</hi> were raised out of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>; and giveth them a power <hi>Judicial,</hi> but where is their <hi>Ligislative</hi>? Nay, the <hi>Modus</hi> of Parliament will not only tell us, that the <hi>Commons</hi> have better and stronger Votes than the <hi>Lords</hi>; but that there may be a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> without the Lords, (as well as <hi>Prelates</hi>:) For, there was a time in which there was neither Bishop nor <hi>Earl, nec Baro,</hi> (so the <hi>Irish Modus</hi>;) and yet there were <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> without them; but never without the <hi>Commons.</hi> So that if the <hi>Commons</hi> be not summoned, or for Cause Reasonable, cannot, or will not come, for Specialties
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:49639:53"/>
in which they blame the <hi>King; Parliamentum tenebitur pro Nullo, quamvis omnes Alii status plenarie ibidem interfuerint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Kings <hi>Oath</hi> is to confirm the Just Laws which the <hi>Commons</hi> (not the <hi>Lords,</hi> but <hi>Commons</hi>) shall Elect or Choose; <hi>quas Vulgus Elegerit</hi>; So in <hi>Latine,</hi> and in <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>Les quiels la Communante aur' eslu</hi>: And in <hi>English,</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and other Times, <hi>which the Commons of the Realm shall choose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we look into the Old <hi>Writs</hi> of <hi>Summons,</hi> we shall find the <hi>Commons</hi> called, <hi>ad consentiendum &amp; faciendum</hi>; and the Old Writ addeth, <hi>quod quilibet &amp; omnes de Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatu, facerent vel faceret, Ii personaliter interessent</hi>: (As it is in the <hi>Modus</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi>) with sufficient inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that without the <hi>Commons</hi> nothing could be done, which the late Writs express thus: <hi>Ita quod dicta Negotia Infecta non remaneant, pro defectu potestatis,</hi> &amp;c. But the <hi>Lords</hi> are called, <hi>de quibusdam arduis tractaturi, &amp; consilium Impensuri</hi>; only as <hi>Counsellors,</hi> not as <hi>Law-makers</hi>: For the very same words are in the <hi>Writs,</hi> for the <hi>Judges</hi> and others coming to Parliament, although they do not <hi>Vote</hi> in making <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may also shew us, how the <hi>Lords</hi> themselves did Elect the <hi>Knights</hi> of <hi>Shires,</hi> (and by Statute of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. are to contribute to the charges of the County <hi>Knights</hi>) who were to sit and Vote in Parliament as <hi>Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> for the whole <hi>County</hi>: whereas the <hi>Lords</hi> were there but as <hi>Judges,</hi> and the <hi>Kings Counsellors.</hi> And is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:49639:53"/>
it probable they should retain to their own Persons that for which they <hi>delegated others?</hi> who were there to do, <hi>quod qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libet &amp; omnes facerent personaliter,</hi> even all that all the Lords themselves should do as <hi>Freeholders,</hi> not as <hi>Lords</hi> or the Kings <hi>Patentees,</hi> who might so be his <hi>Councellors</hi> or <hi>Iudges</hi> rather than <hi>Law-makers</hi>; this was more left (it seems) to the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> who for this and other Reasons should not be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Iudges</hi> (as I think) in private Causes or of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but of <hi>Iudges,</hi> or of such as the <hi>Mirror</hi> speaketh, of whom elsewhere there was no Common Justice to be had.</p>
            <p>But if the <hi>Lords</hi> had not a <hi>Legislative</hi> Right, why did the <hi>Commons</hi> send up the <hi>Bills</hi> to them? how came the <hi>Lords</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Commons</hi> in Passing of Acts?</p>
            <p>It cannot be expected that I should shew the Original of all Changes or Distempers in this Kingdom; It is work enough to shew our first Mould or Constitution: yet for this also it cannot be doubted, but the <hi>Barons Wars</hi> and Power might gain upon the <hi>Commons</hi> more than on the <hi>King</hi>; he had such Bounds before that he could hardly be obliged more, or capable of granting much, but what was due before to all his People: But it might be easie for the Potent <hi>Lords</hi> to grow upon the <hi>Commons</hi> in the Name of <hi>Barons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that Name I say, for I cannot determine but the old Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons (being the great Freeholders and the Lords of all the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> that have left their Names in our <hi>Courts Baron,</hi>) had by Law and Reason much more Power than had the Kings <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentees,</hi> Created <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Patent</hi> or <hi>Writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this new Creation did but multiply the <hi>Iudges</hi> or the <hi>Kings Councellors,</hi> for by so taking their Commission from the King, they were only as other Judges in Inferiour Courts, and so did really lose their great Power of <hi>Iudging,</hi> which was proper only to those who were the Kingdoms <hi>Peers</hi> and <hi>Iudges.</hi> So that these Lords did justly admit the <hi>Commons</hi> (or rather were admitted by the <hi>Commons</hi>) into the grand <hi>Iudicature</hi>; and it may be that as the <hi>Barons</hi> did communicate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:49639:54"/>
their Power <hi>Iudicial,</hi> so the <hi>Commons</hi> might communicate their <hi>Legislative</hi> unto those who had the Name, but little of the Nature of the old <hi>Barons by Tenure</hi>; yet by so doing they might bring Confusion or an harsh Discord into <hi>Natures</hi> Harmony.</p>
            <p>But the main occasion seemed thus, the King was tyed by his <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> to hold, keep and defend the just Laws and Customs chosen by the <hi>Commons; Iustas Leges &amp; consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudines quas vulgus elegerit</hi>; and this Limitation <hi>(of Iust)</hi> seemed to admit of reason or debate, so much as might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Laws required to be <hi>Just,</hi> for else I know not that the King was ever tyed to them.</p>
            <p>And because he was or might be an <hi>Infant,</hi> he had still a great <hi>Council</hi> about him to discuss the Laws proposed by the <hi>Commons</hi>; and for this Cause he did, and by reason might Summon the <hi>Lords,</hi> (or any other Wise and good Man he knew,) to come and give him Counsel, as the <hi>Writ</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>De quibusdam arduis nobiscum tractaturi &amp; Concilium impensuri</hi>; So we find the old <hi>Acts</hi> passed <hi>per Consilium Baronum,</hi> as we might shew in all Ages.</p>
            <p>And because he used to demurr at Bills, till he had the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his great Council; hence it may be (for more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium,) the <hi>Bill</hi> was sent up first to the <hi>Lords,</hi> as the Kings <hi>Counsellors,</hi> and if they Counselled him against it, then he answered, <hi>Le Roy s'avisera, The King will yet be farther Advised</hi>; for he did not, and I think he could not give a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyal, nor of old (perhaps) Demurred, till the <hi>Lords</hi> advised him against it.</p>
            <p>I dispute not how much the <hi>Commons</hi> might oblige the <hi>Commons</hi> without assent of <hi>Lords</hi> or <hi>King</hi>; Nor have I yet said, that in the <hi>Coronation Oath</hi> the <hi>Commons Just Acts</hi> are called <hi>Laws,</hi> and to <hi>Mould</hi> them may be works distinct enough; and the plain truth is, his Oath is to hold, and to keep, and to defend the Commons Laws, <hi>(à Tenir &amp; Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dir &amp; Les Defenderer, per se tenendas &amp; protegendas,)</hi> as well as to Grant or to Confirm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49639:54"/>However, I do not see, either by Reason or Law, That the King was so obliged to the Judgment of his own crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Lords (and there be few or none others left in <hi>England</hi>) that he might not be convinced by the <hi>Reason of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> either without or against the Lords.</p>
            <p>And (beside divers <hi>Ordinances</hi> without any of the <hi>Lords,</hi>) it cannot be denyed, but in Divers ages, there were <hi>Acts of Parliament</hi> made without or against all the <hi>Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi>; which yet, often, were the Major part of the <hi>Lords House,</hi> and had as good, it may be better, Votes (as Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons by Tenure) than had all the other Lords, by <hi>Writ</hi> and <hi>Patent</hi> only: which might make them Judges or Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, much rather than <hi>Law-makers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should still be far from desiring to obtrude my own Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Opinions upon any, least of all to the wrong of others: Therefore, if any can produce a better Title, my Petition is, they may be heard, and may receive their Just Rights and Priviledges. But if this be true, (which I now only propose, and submit to better Thoughts and Judgments,) then had the Lords of late but a Right <hi>Consultative</hi> of making <hi>Laws.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And besides all that was said before, this seemeth one Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why our Ancestors did so willingly follow the Vice of <hi>Nature,</hi> in placing the Power <hi>Legislative, Iudicial</hi> and <hi>Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> in three distinct Estates, (as in <hi>Animals, Aerials, Etherials</hi> or <hi>Celestials,</hi> three Regions, and three Principles in <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi>) that so they might be forced to consult often and much in all they did.</p>
            <p>And if this frequent Consultation were retained, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served still, it might not only occasion good Reviews, but also prevent That, which to the Common-wealth I fear (and not Alone to private Persons) may be sometimes prejudicial, in a sudden Vote or Act of one House, or one Body; and yet one may be better much than Many, if they be not good.</p>
            <p>It must be granted, that in Bodies of the Best Complexion and Composure here below, there may be such Distemper,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:49639:55"/>
and such Gangrene in some Members, that it may be more than fit to cut it off. Nay, what was best, may come to be the worst in Putrefaction; That it may be meer Necessity to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it, although it were as Dear as <hi>Sarah</hi> was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> or set on high by him that raised up the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> which see e're long lye buryed with this Epitaph, <hi>Nehushtan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to all that is truly Just, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will not need to plead a bare <hi>Necessity</hi>; for by Law and Reason too it may be said, and proved (I believe,) That both the King himself who chooseth by his Writ, and All the Lords, by several Votes, have left the <hi>Legislative</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er so to the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> that they had a Legal Right to do what all the Kingdom and Common-wealth of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Justly could.</p>
            <p>But They are Men, and therefore may be much <hi>unjust</hi>; Nay, where the Thing they do is <hi>Iust,</hi> They may be much or most <hi>unjust.</hi> I have neither Calling nor Ability to Judge them: Nor may I act with force against them, for whate're I think Unjust: No, not if I should think they did Usurp the Crown.</p>
            <p>For, if the Law Reports and Books deceive me not, it hath been Judged Treason, and so is; for Private Men to rise, conspire, or Levy War against one that Usurps the Crown and Rights thereof; except it rightly were decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Usurpation, or that others should or might oppose him that did so Usurp: Of which the Reasons may be Great and obvious.</p>
            <p>Let me then suppose any one Man of all the Commons in Parliament, (for I will not suppose it possible for All the <hi>House</hi>) to Usurp the Royal Crown, with all its Dues; what should I, what may I doe, but mind my Calling, and attend the Judgment of the Highest Court, I know? That may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand my Body, and my Judgment much (for ought I see) in things I know so little, as I do or can, the Due disposal of the Crown, or that Mighty Burthen, or that <hi>Royal Venom,</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor did call it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:49639:55"/>I did, and still do, believe there may, and shall, be such a <hi>Monarchy</hi> ere long, t<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

            <p>I hope and believe, or know that God will come, and appear, ere long, to dwell in the World: For, the <hi>Earth</hi> shall be <hi>full</hi> of his <hi>Glory,</hi> and his <hi>Kingdom</hi> shall <hi>come,</hi> and his <hi>Will</hi> be done, on <hi>Earth,</hi> as now in <hi>Heaven,</hi> So, we were taught to ask; and it therefore shall be fully answered.</p>
            <p>I could desire him rather (if he <unclear>pleased</unclear>) in the <hi>still quiet Voice,</hi> then in the rushing <hi>Wind,</hi> or <hi>Fire,</hi> or <hi>Thunder</hi>-claps: Yet so, he came before, and shook the Earth: And so, it seems again; yet once again to shake both <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth. Overturning, overturning, overturning,</hi> (for there also were <hi>three,</hi>) <hi>till he comes, whose Right it is</hi>; To whom, both Kings, and Lords, and all must bow, (or be bowed,) to submit, and cast down their Crowns, their Coronets, and all their Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Earth shall reel and fall,</hi> and <hi>rise no more.</hi> For, he will <hi>visit the Host of high ones, <unclear>that</unclear>

are on high; and the Kings, of the Earth, upon the Earth, they shall be taken, and cast into Prison, shut up in the Pit, and shall be visited, or wanting.</hi> Nay, he will <hi>darken the Sun,</hi> and confound <hi>the Moon,</hi> and make the <hi>Stars to Blush</hi>; before he reigneth in Glory, <hi>among his Antients, in</hi> Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.

            <p>We may deceive our selves, in chayning <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> to any <hi>Town,</hi> or <hi>City,</hi> whatsoever: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one it may be, more especially. But <hi>Babel</hi> was the <hi>head of</hi> Nimrod<hi>'s Kingdom</hi>; whence <hi>Tyranny</hi> did stream through all the World.</p>
            <p>For, although the <hi>out-lets</hi> of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> be (long since) stopped, in the <hi>Fenns of Caldea</hi>: Yet, there is another rapid Torrent, <hi>Tygris,</hi> which from <hi>Babylon</hi> disperseth much <hi>Confusion,</hi> (troubled Waters,) into all the Seas about.</p>
            <p>Nor may it wholly be unworthy of our Thoughts, how <hi>Babylon</hi> was alwaies the <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> or the <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>Tyranny, through all this World.</hi> But <hi>fatal</hi> still, to most that did but touch it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:49639:56"/>So to <hi>Nimrod,</hi> the great <hi>Bell of Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Assyrians. Sardanapalus</hi> might effect an end, so like to <hi>Belus</hi>; who was burnt (some think) with Fire from Heaven. So, that a Statue, was made of him, who left no Relique: And from hence, began Idolatry. So to <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezer,</hi> and the <hi>Babylonian Monarhcy</hi>: when the Watchers saw him, strut and say, <hi>Is not this my</hi> Babylon?</p>
            <p>The Story of this, and of its loss to <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> is so clear, in Sacred Writ; That I need not enlarge it from <hi>Iosephus,</hi> the true <hi>Berosus, Megasthenes, Herodotus, Xenophon,</hi> or any later. Though it be also very considerable among those Heathens. And so, is that famous Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> whom <hi>Esay</hi> maketh a <hi>Type</hi> of all the Churches Carnal and Spiritual Foes: Insomuch, that from him, rather than <hi>Egypt,</hi> St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s <hi>binding of Satan,</hi> the old <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>crossing</hi> Serpent, seemeth borrowed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Persian</hi> Empire, did begin from <hi>Cyrus,</hi> taking <hi>Babylon.</hi> It's Pride and Tyranny, did much encrease; then, when <hi>Darius</hi> won this <hi>Babylon</hi> again. But neither <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor <hi>Camby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Darius,</hi> nor <hi>Xerxes</hi>; (or any other
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:49639:57"/>
               <hi>Persian</hi> Monarch,) could much prosper, in ought of Consequence; in <hi>Scythia, Greece,</hi> or other Places; after they were stained, or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, with <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Macedonian,</hi> was succesful very much; but not accounted, any of those Monarchies, till <hi>Alexander</hi> lost himself, by gaining <hi>Babylon.</hi> 'Tis strange, how great a Change it made in him; that then became, a Cruel, Lustful, and Licentious Tyrant; stay but a while, and you shall see him lose both Life, and Monarchy, at once, in fatal <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Philip</hi> was very young, but old enough to be the Father to a famous <hi>Grecian Epocha</hi> (which used in the <hi>Machabees,</hi> and many others,) first began in <hi>Babylon</hi>; (as <hi>Nabonassors</hi>'s also, long before.) The Character was <hi>Red,</hi> and dyed, with the <hi>Blood</hi> of all <hi>that Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seleucus,</hi> durst not call himself a <hi>King,</hi> till well possessed of <hi>Babylon</hi>: From whence began the Kingdom of the <hi>North</hi> which was, (in <hi>Daniel</hi>) to wrestle, with the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>Aegypt</hi>; till the Ships of <hi>Chittim,</hi> made him afraid; and proud <hi>Antiochus</hi> was glad to bow, and speak the <hi>Romans</hi> fair, before he could be freed
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:49639:57"/>
from his <hi>Circle</hi>; though it were, but made in <hi>Sand,</hi> by a riding Rod.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Babylon</hi> was fatal to the <hi>Romans</hi> also: for, so far they prospered still, but never over, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Streams of <hi>Babylon. Charan</hi> was Tomb to <hi>Crassus</hi>'s Army, as before to <hi>Terah</hi>: nearer much to <hi>Ura,</hi> (found in divers,) then to <hi>Urchoa,</hi> with <hi>Ptolomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much I might speak of <hi>Parthians, Persians, Saracens, Turks.</hi> These seem as <hi>Angels, bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Euphrates</hi>; but being <hi>loosed,</hi> and possess'd of <hi>Babylon,</hi> their Tyranny was divilish. Now it is, (or rather is not, but poor <hi>Bagdad</hi>) in <hi>Turkish</hi> Hands, most times; except an Army of <hi>Locusts,</hi> ('tis remarkable,) appear as <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bengers</hi> before the <hi>Persian.</hi> But his <hi>Sun</hi> must be eclipsed, with the <hi>Turkish Moon,</hi> before the Glory of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Babylon,</hi> while <hi>Romans</hi> kept the Scene, they acted well; but 'twas a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,</hi> for some have thought they brought more Shame and Sin, and Tyranny, from all the Coasts of <hi>Babylon,</hi> then <hi>Brass</hi> from <hi>Corinth,</hi> or Antiquities from <hi>Greece.</hi> Thus <hi>Babylon</hi> was <hi>buried</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>ruined by</hi> Babylon.</p>

               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:49639:58"/>
               <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> run Parallel, in Judgment (through the Prophets,) and the <hi>Iews</hi> were plain enough, in saying, or in proving, who is <hi>Edom,</hi> in this western World.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Edom,</hi> did give name, all say (since learned <hi>Fuller</hi> wrote his <hi>Miscellanies</hi>) to the <hi>Red,</hi> or rather, the <hi>Reed Sea,</hi> but this may be doubted; and the rather, (with other great Objections; for it is scarce a drop, to that the Antients call the <hi>Erythrean</hi> Sea, or <hi>Mare Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brum</hi>; never belonging unto <hi>Esau</hi>:) in that <hi>Edom</hi> will hardly be found, to denote <hi>Red.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A great Master of the <hi>Arabick,</hi> and other kinds of Learning, in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Mr. <hi>Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> did almost perswade me once that <hi>Edom</hi>'s Name, is better sought and found, in <hi>Arabick,</hi> where it may sound as much as <hi>Eator,</hi> or a <hi>Glutton</hi>: who did sell his Birthright, for a mess of Broth; as <hi>Adam</hi> (the first Glutton,) sold his <hi>Paradice,</hi> and all, for a little Apple, or the like.</p>
            <p>This Etymology, of <hi>Edom,</hi> I could the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther believe; because in <hi>Tuscan, Latin,</hi> and so many other Tongues, <hi>Edo, Eso, Esor,</hi> (and the like Words,) do all signifie <hi>Eating</hi>: and
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:49639:58"/>
in other Nations, the <hi>D,</hi> is only changed into <hi>T,</hi> its Cousen Germane.</p>
            <p>How <hi>Edom</hi> came to be a Type of <hi>Rome,</hi> (as the <hi>Iews</hi> so constantly affirm,) may appear in due Place. This is very considerable, that among all other Judgments threatned on <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> and <hi>Edom,</hi> (for they are equals in most;) this is one, and the chief of all, that they shall be <hi>perpetual Desolations,</hi> and shall never return, or rise again, when they be fallen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon,</hi> might return again; <hi>Aegypt</hi> and <hi>Aethiopia</hi>: for <hi>Chush</hi> may reach to <hi>that</hi> also, from <hi>Chusiana,</hi> on the Banks of <hi>Euphrates</hi> and <hi>Tygris</hi>; whence they passed through <hi>Arabia,</hi> (and there left their Name also,) cross the <hi>red Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> shall escape, from the last Northern King in <hi>Daniel</hi>; and they shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn in the latter days (a noted Phrase.) Nay <hi>Sodom</hi> it self, shall return and rejoice with her Sisters, <hi>Samaria,</hi> (for <hi>Ephraim</hi> in this also, seemeth to be the <hi>first born</hi>;) and with <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem</hi> the younger Sister. So, spake the Type also, when <hi>Lot,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Tennants of <hi>Sodom</hi> were, (in the fourteenth great Year) delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:49639:59"/>
from the Oppression and Tyranny of all the <hi>four grand Monarchies,</hi> of <hi>Shinaar,</hi> or <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>; of <hi>Elam,</hi> or <hi>Persia; Ellassar,</hi> (the Prince of <hi>Ellas</hi>) or <hi>Greece:</hi> which three also, may lie in the <hi>Heifer, Ram,</hi> and <hi>Goat,</hi> (God's own Emblems, of the three first Monarchies;) which were <hi>divided,</hi> and <hi>broken</hi> about the <hi>Dove,</hi> and <hi>Turtle of</hi> Abraham; <hi>and the King of the</hi> Gentiles, may typifie the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I could yet believe, there may be more in it. <hi>Antichrist,</hi> may seem to have two Horns, one in the <hi>West,</hi> and Christian Temple: the other in the <hi>East,</hi> and Jewish Temple. (<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>) <hi>Mahomet</hi> did rise, about as bad a time, at Rome, as <hi>Hildebrand.</hi> But it may be, his Horn must end in <hi>Gog,</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> (whence the King of <hi>Gogim,</hi> in <hi>Genesis</hi>;) which is very probable to be <hi>Alleppo,</hi> the Turks great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Residence in <hi>Asia,</hi> directly <hi>North</hi> to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>: and of old, not only <hi>Hierapolis,</hi> but <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gog</hi> also, in some antient Heathen Authors. But <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> shall mourn and lament, in that <hi>Eternal Desolation</hi>; while the whole Earth, besides, (so speak the Prophets,) shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:49639:60"/>The World must be renewed, the Promise and the Blessing to <hi>Adam</hi> must not fail one tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor could the Flood (or its worst Causes) disanul the Grace of God, established so long before. Nay, it was continued, confirmed, and inlarged, in the new Charter to <hi>Noah.</hi> The Scripture is very observable; although I dare not be too confident in ought of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Blessing, or Will or Commands, found in the Cave among the <hi>Tuscan</hi> (Rarities much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then) <hi>Antiquities.</hi> Yet With much of those also there is more to be compared, then I have yet seen in <hi>Lazius</hi> or <hi>Berosus</hi> (for <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> may be excused, who found it with that Title,) but the Book was written by a <hi>Iew,</hi> if <hi>Tsemack David</hi> do not deceive me.</p>
            <p>And the Jews with much consent, expect this glorious Change. Both touching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (who never yet ('tis thought) pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed half their promised Land, from <hi>Euphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> to the Sea, from <hi>Lebanon</hi> to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> nay, where ever their Feet did tread) and others also of the Pious Gentiles.</p>
            <p>To this day they shake their Palms in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph every way (in their great Hosanna;)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:49639:61"/>
in allusion to the Psalms and Prophets; who say, that <hi>every Tree of the Wood</hi> shall shout, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, clap Hands, and sing for Joy.</p>
            <p>Nor do they think the time far off, and that from better Grounds perhaps, than is the old Prediction in their <hi>Zohar,</hi> which foretels their Redemption should be upon, or about, the Year last past; to which they add somewhat they see, or have heard from their Brethren of <hi>Iuda</hi> in <hi>Brasile:</hi> or of <hi>Israel</hi> in other parts of <hi>America,</hi> which they cannot much believe (till it be better confirmed;) although it be with many Arguments asserted by a grave so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Man of their own Nation, that is lately come from the Western World.</p>
            <p>It is strange, if it should prove true, and that which might regain some of <hi>Esdra</hi>'s Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, (besides all of Christ, and the <hi>Iews</hi> long <hi>Captivity,</hi> with their return about the Ruine of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> whose <hi>twelve first</hi> Caesars, with divers others, he describeth clearly;) in that also of the <hi>ten</hi> Tribes passing through a River or Strait, (may it be the <hi>Strait</hi> of <hi>Anian</hi>) in a long Journey of many Months or Years, <hi>to a Countrey not inhabited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:49639:61"/>It is also remarkable, that such good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors should relate the Traditions of the <hi>Mex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icans,</hi> or others in those parts; coming a great Journey, with an Ark carried before them on Mens Shoulders, with their God therein, and what others have observed of <hi>Circumcision</hi> found in some of those parts: with other Rites of <hi>Tribes, Heads of Tribes</hi> and <hi>Families,</hi> with some pretty Ceremonies of <hi>Marriage, Funerals,</hi> and <hi>Washings;</hi> not altogether unlike the <hi>Iews,</hi> or <hi>Israelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it seems they left many of their Brethren behind them in <hi>Asia,</hi> though it must not be in <hi>Tartary.</hi> The World will not admit of it of late, although it was very current a while, in <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Naphtalim,</hi> Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> or I know not what, in <hi>Ortelius</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>But Millions of them, are still found in <hi>Persia,</hi> and other parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> though I give no Credit to their <hi>Kingdom</hi> in <hi>Caramania,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where described or feigned by <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the Jew in <hi>Eyre.</hi> Yet with him must be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (if he lies in all) some of our own, that have travelled in those parts.</p>
            <p>Not only Master <hi>Herbert,</hi> who hath many
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:49639:62"/>
considerable Passages; besides that of a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty high Peak of <hi>Taurus,</hi> for <hi>Ararat,</hi> not very far from the <hi>Caspian Sea</hi>; which he saith the Inhabitants do still, to that day, call the <hi>Descent from the Ark,</hi> which would much have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sr. <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and other learned Men, that would not have <hi>Noah</hi> come out of <hi>Armenia</hi>; though so many <hi>Heathens</hi> also do record it thereabout.</p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and their Return<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is so clear, and so full in the Scriptures (both Old and New) that I need not seek it in the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> where yet are many Predictions of it clear enough, especially in <hi>Tobit.</hi> I mean the old <hi>Hebrew Tobit,</hi> brought from the <hi>East</hi>; for that we have is broken and imperfect much, being only taken from a <hi>Iew</hi>'s Mouth, that Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to <hi>Ierome</hi>; as himself confesseth, if I forget not. All the <hi>Prophets</hi> speak clearly of it; but <hi>Ionas,</hi> that of him we have, was but a second Prophecy, which, besides all the <hi>Iews,</hi> somewhat in his own Words doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate: And we need no more; for, in the Kings we find <hi>Ionas</hi>'s Prophecy for <hi>Israel</hi>'s, (even <hi>Israel</hi>'s) Restoration, which is there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49639:62"/>
also carried up to <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Song</hi> (cited also in <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> besides other Prophets) as that which is clear enough for what we speak.</p>
            <p>So is <hi>Moses</hi> also clear, that <hi>great Troubles shall befal them in the latter Days</hi>: that is, in the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> as they all confess; for so they still interpret the Phrase. And to this <hi>Place,</hi> with others, they refer their Afflictions, under <hi>Messiah Ben Ioseph.</hi> Whom (I hope) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to think already come: although <hi>Ben Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> do not yet appear to them, but <hi>Moses</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should also rejoyce with his People <hi>Israel.</hi> For he would <hi>again be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his People, and his Land,</hi> and so that Song endeth; which was to be kept and considered, in the latter Days, or time of the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> was first told his Seed must be as <hi>Dust,</hi> and afterwards as <hi>Stars</hi>: Not Stars for <hi>Multitude</hi> I think, but <hi>Glory,</hi> Except there be more <hi>Stars</hi> then the Jesuite thought, who hath lately wrote a Book in Praise of the <hi>Virgin</hi>; being nothing else but one Verse (<hi>Tot tibi sunt Dotes Virgo, quot fulera Coelo;</hi>) which he hath changed above a thousand times, (and might have done it much oftner,)
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49639:63"/>
keeping the very same entire Words in a true Verse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> the <hi>High Father,</hi> had two Sons in special. <hi>Ishmael</hi> a Type of the <hi>carnal Iew</hi> (who had also twelve Princes, twelve Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arcks) from <hi>Hagar,</hi> the Earthly <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: coming first from <hi>Egypt,</hi> and growing proud, she is driven out (into <hi>Captivity</hi>) but soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns again upon an Angels Call.</p>
            <p>Yet she must only stay till <hi>Isaac</hi> (a real Type of <hi>Christ</hi>) is born, and weaned a while; and then, her self and Son (for mocking <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac</hi>) must be turned out of doors, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>'s House, or Church. It was very bitter to good <hi>Abraham,</hi> but she must out. <hi>And she is yet in Bondage</hi> (in the Wilderness, a long Captivity,) <hi>together with her Son poor Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this Wilderness, when she is near Despair, sitting alone, wringing her Hands, for Grief and Woe; and her poor Son, at a distance crying, or rather gasping for Life, <hi>God will hear, God will hear,</hi> (<hi>Return O God to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousands of</hi> Israel,) and he will call, and <hi>speak kindly to her, in the Wilderness</hi>: He will
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:49639:63"/>
then open her Eyes to see a Well, <hi>a Fountain of living Water.</hi> The <hi>Well of him that hath lived long,</hi> and <hi>looked on her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, when the Poor and Needy shall thirst sore, and their Tongue cleave to their Mouth, (when they sit in Darkness, he will see and execute Peace,) <hi>he will open a Fountain in the Wilderness</hi>: So do the <hi>Psalmists</hi> and <hi>Prophets</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten alude to this of <hi>Hagar in the Wilderness,</hi> an History of all the Bible, much, I may say, more remarkable.</p>
            <p>After this shall <hi>Isaac</hi> come and seek his poor Brother <hi>Ishmael,</hi> he also shall come and dwell with his Brother at his Well <hi>Labairos</hi>: and thereabout he met <hi>Rebecca,</hi> though I dare not draw the Paralels. But it may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of inquiring, that about forty Years old, he should meet his Wife at <hi>Hagar</hi>'s Well.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iews</hi> do tell us pretty Stories of old <hi>Abraham</hi>'s coming oft, and knocking at the Door to call and see his Son, though <hi>Hagar</hi> was much abroad and yet they say, she did return again at last into his House. And some will also have her to be <hi>Keturah,</hi> on whom <hi>Abraham</hi> had many Sons, that peopled
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:49639:64"/>
the East. These seem to be the <hi>Abrahamides,</hi> or <hi>Brachmonides,</hi> of whom we hear so much, yet see so little, but their Names.</p>
            <p>Certain it is, what ere became of <hi>Hagar,</hi> that <hi>Ishmael</hi> returned to <hi>Isaac,</hi> or rather <hi>Isaac</hi> to <hi>Ishmael.</hi> For, besides that of <hi>Isaac</hi>'s li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving so much at <hi>Ishmael</hi>'s <hi>Well,</hi> the Text is clear, for their being together at <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Death, or Funeral. And <hi>Ishmael</hi> (a better Man then some may think) dyed in Honour, or as the Phrase is, <hi>in the midst of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> if I mistake it not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Isaac</hi> (a Type of <hi>Christ</hi>) <hi>had two Sons,</hi> that Wrestled and Fought so soon as they had being. <hi>Edom</hi> the eldest (which the Jews will have to be the <hi>Roman Christian Church,</hi> the first <hi>born to Christ,</hi> or <hi>Isaac</hi>;) yet must come to serve the <hi>younger,</hi> when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iacob</hi> (the Father of all <hi>Israel</hi>) had two Wives. <hi>Leah</hi> the visible Church of carnal Jews, or Gentiles, bleer eyed; not so lovely to her Husband as was <hi>Rachel.</hi> Who was long barren, but at length beareth <hi>Ioseph</hi>; And she is then to leave her Father's House:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:49639:64"/>
For he will give them up (for smiting <hi>Ioseph,</hi>) until she that travailed bring forth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her Son with Joy.</p>
            <p>In this flying Posture, <hi>Iacob</hi> meets the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels at <hi>Mahamin</hi> (it was the way with the <hi>Canticles.</hi>) He wrestleth and prevaileth with God, and with <hi>Edom.</hi> 'Tis a great Mystery: But I am tedious.</p>
            <p>Poor <hi>Rachel</hi> is loath to leave her Idols. These stick and stain her (but they must be buried in <hi>Bethel,</hi>) till at length she come to <hi>Bethelem-Ephrata</hi>; and there she travaileth with <hi>Benjamin</hi>; to her, <hi>Benoni</hi>; for she must expire as soon almost as he is born. Nor did she regard the Words of those, that told her, that she had a Son: but she shall receive him again with Joy.</p>
            <p>I dare not say that blear-Eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> was typified by old <hi>Lilith,</hi> of whom the <hi>Iews</hi> speak so much, and so Ill; because she did so much displease our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> till God in pity cut him asunder, (as they speak, and so doth <hi>Plato</hi> also,) and of one of his <hi>Sides</hi> made <hi>Eve.</hi> Otherwise his Body had been more round; Male before, and Female be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind: To which they say the Psalmist doth allude; besides that of <hi>Moses: Male and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:49639:65"/>
Female created he them, or him</hi>; at the first.</p>
            <p>They have also an antient Tradition, of which, the <hi>Talmud,</hi> and many of their best Writers; that there should come two <hi>Messiahs,</hi> and the first should attempt, but not perform the full <hi>Deliverance</hi>: But that he should dye, and leave them in a doleful Plight, so long, till a second came, and relieved them all, and Reigned over them, as <hi>David</hi>: For, they call him <hi>Ben-David,</hi> as the former <hi>Ben-Ioseph,</hi> or <hi>Ben-Ephraim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not only for his Relation to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> but they use to call any Noble Gallant Man an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraimite.</hi> And in that of their <hi>First Messiah,</hi> they seem to allude to a common Story among them, of <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s hardy Attempt to carry them forth from <hi>Egypt</hi>: But his Rashness cost him many thousand armed Men, drawing the Bow, <hi>but turning back in the Day of Battle</hi>; as the Scripture seemeth to allude in several Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>Those <hi>two</hi> distinct Men, (with the <hi>Iews</hi>) seem but <hi>two</hi> distinct Estates in <hi>One,</hi> and the same <hi>Messiah.</hi> Which two Estates seem also to be Tipyfyed by <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> good <hi>Iacob</hi>'s <hi>Darlings,</hi> and the Sons of his beloved <hi>Rachel,</hi> the good Jewish Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:49639:65"/>Somewhat it is the Scripture meaneth, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in bringing <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Bethlehem-Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>: by which we are also led, and bid by St. <hi>Matthew</hi> to look on <hi>Rachel,</hi> falling in Travail there, and weeping for her Children, <hi>who were not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And often did she Weep, if she could see how often <hi>they were not,</hi> or seemed not to be. So <hi>Ioseph</hi> in the Pit, in the <hi>Dungeon</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s first Attempt from <hi>Egypt.</hi> So <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> in that famous History, when all <hi>Israel</hi> wept as well as <hi>Rachel,</hi> because <hi>Benjamin</hi> was not.</p>
            <p>Yet again, how oft did she, must she Weep? poor <hi>Rachel</hi> weepeth till she see them all again: and so she shall in the <hi>latter Days,</hi> as saith the Prophet <hi>Ieremiah.</hi> And then also the Children of Barren <hi>Rachel</hi> may be more, than of Fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Leah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And another Prophet saith, <hi>they shall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up</hi> (as deserted by the Father) <hi>till she that Travailled shall bring forth</hi>: Nay, till she have leisure to attend with Joy, that a Man-child is born to her. Some have thought the Travai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to be <hi>Gentile Church,</hi> but it is Interwoven with <hi>Bethlem Ephrata.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not spend much time to Parallel the
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:49639:66"/>
               <hi>two Estates of our Messiah</hi> with this <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and <hi>this Benjamin; The Lord will dwell between his Shoulders,</hi> more then when the Holy Place was in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin</hi>: he also was cut off, (as <hi>Ioseph</hi> was) but did prolong his Days and prosper. Yet a little while, I hope, and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> shall come down from his good <hi>Father</hi>; and then shall <hi>Ioseph (Ben Ioseph)</hi> make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self known to his <hi>Brethren,</hi> who did hate him, shout at him, cast him into the Pit, deliver him to the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But he was brought from Prison and from Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>: At thirty Years he stood before the King, and was made Governour of all. His Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren must come and bow down to him, tho they rememb'red not his Affliction; yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth them in <hi>Aegypt</hi>: and tho Dead, yet goeth before them to <hi>Canaan</hi> in his Coffin; of which the Jews have many Stories, in the Life of <hi>Moses</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They shall see him who they have pierced,</hi> and shall weep over him: For he shall melt them by saying, <hi>I am</hi> Joseph <hi>your Brother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he must stay till <hi>Aegypt</hi> be destroyed by Famine: and be glad to yield it self to <hi>Ioseph</hi>; he must sit till his Enemies be put under him. And then shall come the Restitution; when <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:49639:66"/>
is pulled down. It filleth all the Scene as yet: And whil'st <hi>Satan</hi> acteth as if he were <hi>God,</hi> it is no Wonder that we see so little done of Good. I must not trouble the World with the time of this great Change: But it may be sought (and perhaps found) not only by Types, but plain Expressions in <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi>; besides our Saviour's Words, and the Revelation.</p>
            <p>This I may observe, that as <hi>Aegypt</hi> was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was first raised, and <hi>Edom</hi> before the first <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Second</hi>; So both <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Third,</hi> in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> and St. <hi>Iohn</hi>: for I now seek not the three Temples in <hi>Ezekiel, Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> and <hi>Rohoboth</hi> (digged by <hi>Isaac</hi>) as do many <hi>Iews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the Crimes of <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi> this hath a heavy Charge: that the afflicted <hi>Heber,</hi> the People of his Love. But those that Curse them must be Cursed. How great a share in that this Kingdom had, I cannot say, there are Mistakes on either side.</p>
            <p>We say they <hi>Crucifyed a Child,</hi> or more: They do deny it, and we prove it not. They say we drove them out from hence: it is not clear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:49639:67"/>They were in Favour once at Court; they did deserve Respect, who brought the Crown two hundred thousand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> (lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle less, as mony now,) for divers Years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And King <hi>Iohn</hi> did give or sell them a Charter of <hi>Priesthood,</hi> or rather <hi>Presbytery</hi>; for I know not that by this they ever <hi>Sacrificed.</hi> And the Charter yet remaineth, for old Jacob <hi>the Presbyter of all the</hi> Jews <hi>in</hi> England, during Life.</p>
            <p>Their Use and Brocage was so burthensom, that in King <hi>Edward</hi> the First, one Parliament did quite deny them Leave of <hi>Usury</hi>; and that did <hi>draw</hi> them, but not drive them <hi>hence.</hi> It was <hi>their Motion</hi> that obtained a <hi>Writ</hi> for sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Passage, which yet secured them not, but that the best of them were drowned in the Thames, by Fraud of those that undertook to Waft them over: But they hanged for abusing those poor Jews.</p>
            <p>The next Parliament did grant a whole Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth <hi>pro expulsione Iudaeorum,</hi> yet they had but a <hi>Writ for a Pasport</hi>; and they were but 15000 and odd, if I may believe a great learned Judg, who has so Reported and Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>How they are now, I need not say: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:49639:67"/>
I might also bear them Witness, that they are yet Zealous in their Way: nor do they wholly want Ingenious Able Men, of whom I cannot but with Honour mention him that has so much obliged the World, by his learned Writings, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ab Menasseh Ben Israel</hi>: a very Learned Civil Man, and a Lover of our <hi>Nation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The more I think upon the great Change now coming on them, and all the World; the more I would be Just and Merciful to them, to all: nay Universal Sweetness if I could; a Christian overcoming all with Love.</p>
            <p>And such one should be more I believe, if one had conquered all the World. For then there would be nothing left, but <hi>Self</hi> to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. Then one would return in Love, and say, <hi>come forth my Enemies and Live, enjoy your Rights, your Peace and Liberties, with all your Ioyes. There shall not an Hair fall off your Heads. By this it shall be known, that God alone must Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know that <hi>Antichrist</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> must fall, and rise no more. But these are more in Hearts, then any Walls, or any City. Not only in the <hi>Heart,</hi> much less the <hi>Name</hi> of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Lord</hi>: I Judg my self, or so I should much
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:49639:68"/>
rather, and much heavier than I Judg another. For I see much cause to fear my self, lest I may keep a little Pretty, rather Ugly Antichrist within my Breast; whil'st I am busie to destroy some others, more then it in others, or my self.</p>
            <p>There is a <hi>sweeping Rain,</hi> oppressing more then any <hi>Thunder.</hi> There is a <hi>Pride</hi> most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a <hi>Leathern Coat.</hi> And one there was that trod on <hi>Pato</hi>'s Pride, with <hi>Prouder</hi> (it was said) and fouler Heels.</p>
            <p>I find it in the Scriptures: thence I know that <hi>Babylon</hi> must down, and be thrown down with <hi>Violence.</hi> More <hi>Force</hi> it may seem, than <hi>Form of Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet, even in such things, God seldom doth that which is not just in Man's Eye also. Nor did he ruine <hi>Babylon,</hi> or spoyl <hi>Aegypt,</hi> till they oppressed <hi>Israel.</hi> Nor did he bring the <hi>Iews</hi> by pure Force to possess <hi>Canaan,</hi> before they had purchased <hi>Sechem</hi> or <hi>Machpela</hi>; with such a Legal Seisin as might warrant Force, or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Disseisors, that so held Possession against the true Owners.</p>
            <p>And what ever Force may appear in pulling down of <hi>Babylon,</hi> I do not Read or Know that the new Temple, or the <hi>new Ierusalem</hi> shall be
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:49639:68"/>
built with <hi>Violence</hi> or by <hi>Violent Men,</hi> that may ruffle much in forcing <hi>Babylon</hi>; But they may perish by the Sword that use it most. <hi>Moses</hi> was the meekest Man alive, yet he had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Commission, (that was a <hi>Patent sealed with the Arms and Impress of Heaven</hi>) to ruine or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverish <hi>Aegypt.</hi> He pulled down indeed, but he raised little but a <hi>Tabernacle</hi>: Only a <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of good things to come.</hi> And it must be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by him that was typified by <hi>Ioshua</hi>: For <hi>Moses</hi> could not bring them into <hi>Rest,</hi> altho by Force and a mighty Hand he brought them out of <hi>Aegypt. David</hi> was a Warriour and a mighty puller down: He cut off the Head of <hi>Goliah,</hi> and weakened all the <hi>Philistins</hi>; he threshed <hi>Ammon, Moab was his Washpot, and over</hi> Edom <hi>he casts his Shoe.</hi> He shall be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the strong City, and shall harrow <hi>Edom</hi> and sow it with <hi>Salt,</hi> or cut off all the Males but one or two that can escape by Stratagem.</p>
            <p>But yet, <hi>he must not build the Temple</hi>: for he was a <hi>Man of Blood</hi>; and when he would but remove the Ark, <hi>Uzza</hi> is smitten, and <hi>David ashamed</hi> as well as afraid <hi>at that great Breach,</hi> which remaineth to his Day; I had almost said prophetical of our Times.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Perez Uzzah</hi> the Ark is brought but
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:49639:69"/>
a few Paces; for it must rest a long time with <hi>Obed-Edom,</hi> a mysterious Name, and when it comes from thence to the City of <hi>David,</hi> it must be content with a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> with many Forms and Ceremonies: and among others <hi>Obed-Edom</hi> is the <hi>Porter</hi> to that Tabernacle.</p>
            <p>Shall some of <hi>Edom</hi> also be brought in; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his <hi>Desolation be eternal,</hi> or for an Age of Ages? May they come to be <hi>Porters,</hi> as <hi>the</hi> Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beonites <hi>were Hewers of Wood for the House of God? His Iudgments are in all the World</hi>; and so they must be long. But Judgment <hi>is his strange Work,</hi> and <hi>he delighteth in Mercy; he will turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and be Merciful unto us. Nay, all the World shall Sing and Rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sea shall roar a while, and all that in it dwells</hi>: but there shall be no more Sea, no more Death, or Hell, but what shall be sealed up in the great Pit. But <hi>the Earth shall Rejoyce, and his Goodness shall be over all his Works: they shall all bless him, they shall all praise him. Nay, all the Trees in the Forest shall Rejoyce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is also the more considerable, in that it was so clearly expressed in that joyful Psalm, which was made and Sung at <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>bringing the Ark from</hi> Obed-Edom: But it is divers times repeated and inlarged in the Psalms and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:49639:69"/>
For it is a great Mystery. <hi>Solomon</hi> the <hi>King of Peace</hi> must build the <hi>Temple</hi> up: there must not be a Hammer heard, or a Stone Squared, but before it cometh thither.</p>
            <p>He is married to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in League with <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sydon</hi>: the Letters are yet to be found and read in old Authors: then <hi>Pineda,</hi> he is reconciled to <hi>Moab</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi>: and the <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> bring him Gifts, as did the <hi>Magi</hi> from the <hi>East.</hi> He spake peace to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> afar off: not only to the <hi>Queen of Sheba.</hi> I do not reject or believe all the Titles or History of <hi>Precious Iohn</hi>: But I could with a Sight of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Works; and others in his famous Library at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, to the <hi>Isles</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles</hi>: We need not travel to <hi>Peru</hi> as some have done, to seek <hi>Ophir</hi>: it is nearer much, and better found in <hi>Zealand,</hi> one of the best Islands I suppose in all the World: and the learned Author of the late <hi>Peleg</hi>: maketh demonstrative Paralels of this with <hi>Ophir,</hi> or the <hi>Taprobane</hi> of Ancients.</p>
            <p>Yet even <hi>Solomon,</hi> this peaceful King, had two great Enemies; one was an <hi>Edomite</hi> (<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> left but very few,) and the other was a <hi>Syrian</hi>; I do not say an <hi>Assyrian</hi> or <hi>Babylonian,</hi> altho these often come into the Name of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:49639:70"/>
(a vast Latitude.) But the Text saith, the <hi>Syrian</hi> reigned about <hi>Damascus,</hi> which seemeth near the Borders of the old <hi>Magog</hi>; and it may be compared with the Close of the 16<hi>th.</hi> or rather with the middle of the 20<hi>th.</hi> of the Revelation; or with much in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> about the time of <hi>his Temple</hi>; or it may be, long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was built.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second Temple</hi> was built in a time of Trouble, and great Fear: For they held their Swords together with their Trewels. But yet it was not built by <hi>Power</hi> or Might, (much less by <hi>Force,</hi>) <hi>but by his Spirit and Goodness,</hi> that did overaw his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> did hardly live to see his Temple; or at least the City finished. This was but a gentle Visitation, as the Jews used to call it: not a Restoration of the two Tribes, much less of all, as the Prophets promise: Nay, some of them promised after this Return from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Temple was imperfect much, it wanted divers Glories of the former: <hi>Five</hi> in special, as the Jews affirm (at the want of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in the Word foretelling its Glories) which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were recovered: tho great <hi>Herod</hi> did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the outward Glory. And there was a
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:49639:70"/>
greater than <hi>Solomon</hi> to give Peace in that place: and so he did to all the World. 'Tis known how oft the <hi>Romans</hi> shut the Temple of their <hi>Ianus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why could not this Peace endure? was it because this Temple was not <hi>founded in Peace</hi>? for <hi>Ephraim</hi> envyed <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> vexed <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim.</hi> Nay among themselves they could not agree: for some wept, as others laughed.</p>
            <p>But <hi>when the People did with one Voice, and one Consent, Sing out to Bless and Praise the Lord</hi> (so saith the Type in <hi>Solomon,</hi>) then, and not till then, <hi>the Glory of God came down and fill'd the House; so that the Priests could not enter</hi>; nor it may be, needed in that Glory. This was but a Type of somewhat yet to be fulfilled, more, much more in building of the new Temple.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> did also then pray that <hi>all the Earth might come to know the Lord, and serve him, as his People Israel did.</hi> And this was heard and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered by God; and almost all the Prophets, who with much Consent assure us, that <hi>the Earth shall be full of the Knowledg and Glory of God.</hi> And <hi>that he shall be served with one Consent,</hi> and <hi>with one Shoulder: even from the rising of the Sun, to the going down thereof.</hi> (For it is worth observing how Learning and Religion, came
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:49639:71"/>
along with the Sun from East to West.) <hi>In e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Place shall Incense be offered with pure Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And then <hi>Ephraim shall no longer envy</hi> Judah, <hi>nor</hi> Judah <hi>vex</hi> Ephraim.</p>
            <p>If I durst assert <hi>Esdras</hi> to be Scripture in any thing; it should be in those most considerable Prophecies of the Ruine of the <hi>Roman Eagle,</hi> to which it may be, our Saviour also alludeth; as he seemeth to do in divers other Passages, found no where that I know, but in <hi>Esdras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And about the Fall of that <hi>Roman Eagle,</hi> he seeth a great Multitude of <hi>Fighters,</hi> (as in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mageddon.) But at length arose a <hi>Man,</hi> who was the Son of Man, that called to him a <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People,</hi> that should leave off War, for it should cease in all the World; <hi>their Swords and Spears must be beaten into Plow Shares and pruning Hooks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Multitude (in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) stand and Sing the new Song, the Song of <hi>Moses</hi> (of the Sabbath, or the Red Sea,) and the Song of the Lamb (not yet known abroad:) Then, and not till then, is the Vail of the <hi>Tabernacle in Heaven Opened.</hi> But there was yet a Smoke to cloud that Glory.</p>
            <p>But when the seventh Angle shall sound, and all the Kingdoms of this World become
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:49639:71"/>
the Kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ: <hi>and those be destroyed, that destroyed the Earth.</hi> Then <hi>shall the Temple of God be fully opened in Heaven, and the Ark of his Testament</hi> (the Model shewed to <hi>Moses</hi> on the Mount,) <hi>shall be seen</hi> and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that Temple: not in a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> but a <hi>Temple</hi>: then also shall the four Beasts (which in <hi>Ezechiel</hi>'s <hi>Mircavah,</hi> the Jews will have to be the Emblems of the four great Monarchies in <hi>Daniel</hi>:) <hi>even these four Beasts</hi>; and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Presbyters; <hi>with all the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and all the Creatures of Heaven and Earth, and of the Sea, and under the Earth</hi>; (how long, or how far this may reach, I know not) all shall fall down about the Throne, giving <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Blessing,</hi> and <hi>Praise to him that sitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb, for ever and ever. And the four Beasts again in special say Amen.</hi> There is much spoken of a <hi>Personal Reign of Christ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth</hi>: I do not affirm it, yet I believe there is more, much more for it, then I have yet seen in any of the many Writers on <hi>Daniel,</hi> or the <hi>Revelation.</hi> And beside the Judgment of so many, if not <hi>all the Orthodox</hi> in <hi>Iustin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi>'s time: there be some very antient, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Apostles) that relate how our Saviour himself discoursed of this Kingdom, which the <hi>Acts</hi> do but Intimate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:49639:72"/>But for my part, I do acknowledg my self to be so ambitious, as to expect somewhat much higher and better then his <hi>bodily Presence,</hi> which yet I long for: <hi>as the Captive hasteth to be loosed.</hi> But this would please or profit lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without <hi>Life and Power,</hi> and Real <hi>Light</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove our <hi>Doubts, Disputes,</hi> or <hi>Demonstrations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor would this much profit man, or please God, I think, without <hi>true Love,</hi> proportionate to such a Light.</p>
            <p>The first Paradice had one River parted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to four Streams, and one <hi>Tree of Knowledg</hi>: but of <hi>Evil</hi> rather than <hi>Good.</hi> The new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice shall have many Rivers of Knowledg, to cover the Earth, and many Trees of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg also; whose very <hi>Leaves</hi> shall <hi>heal the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>; what then shall their <hi>Fruit be,</hi> but <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the Dead</hi>?</p>
            <p>I see so much of this vain World, that I cannot but earnestly desire and long for a <hi>new Earth,</hi> and for <hi>new Heavens</hi>: but yet I should not value or desire them much, were it not that in these I hope to see <hi>more Iustice,</hi> and <hi>more Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not that the <hi>World to come,</hi> of which the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and our Saviour speak, as <hi>pardoning all</hi> but <hi>one Sin</hi>? The Phrase is common with the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:49639:72"/>
Jews, who do expect it on Earth; and the Prophets make it a <hi>pardoning World to come,</hi> so <hi>that the Inhabitants shall not say they are Sick,</hi> for <hi>their Iniquities shall be forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must confess my Hope is, that he that bid us still forgive so much, that we might be like our Father: meaneth himself to forgive very much; being himself the Founder and great Patron of that great Order of Christians, whose Badg is this, <hi>Conquer thy self, and others Evil by doing Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Elijah</hi> must <hi>level</hi> his Way, and many (if not all the Antients,) thought <hi>Elijah</hi> yet to come; which our Saviour also seemeth to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with that at his <hi>Transfiguration.</hi> And the Jews repeat the Verse of the Prophet <hi>Malachi,</hi> which seemeth also to speak of two <hi>Days</hi>; and all <hi>Elijah</hi>'s Work was hardly fulfilled at Christ's first Coming.</p>
            <p>However when that <hi>Levelling</hi> is over and past, the <hi>Lamb</hi> shall come of <hi>another Spirit. For the Son of Man came not to destroy, but save</hi>: He is the <hi>Prince of Peace.</hi> And when he shall come <hi>to Conquer</hi>; He will come on a <hi>White Horse,</hi> and shall ride on <hi>Prospering, because of Meekness, with Truth and Righteousness. He will have Mercy and not Sacrifice,</hi> and that will please
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:49639:73"/>
him more than <hi>all burnt Offerings.</hi> He will make <hi>our Officers Peace,</hi> and <hi>our Exactors Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>: For <hi>Violence shall be no more</hi>: But a King shall Rule in Judgment, and a Man shall be an hiding Place from Storm and Tempest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will hear what the Lord God will speak; For he will speak Peace</hi> (as well as Truth) <hi>to his People, and to his Saints; that they may no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Folly,</hi> or have Cause to Blush. <hi>Mercy and Truth shall meet together, Righteousness and Peace shall kiss each other. Truth shall spring out of the Earth, but Mercy</hi> (this the Jews called <hi>Righteousness</hi>) <hi>shall come down from Heaven</hi>; for the Kingdom of God confisteth in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Ioy,</hi> as well as <hi>Righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>the Fruit of Righteousness is Peace, and Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for ever; being sown in Peace, of them that make Peace.</hi> Such is the <hi>Wisdom from above,</hi> and such are the <hi>Fruits of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What shall we say then to <hi>the Messenger of the Nation</hi>? or to the <hi>Angel, spoyling</hi> Edom <hi>and</hi> Babylon? What? <hi>That the Lord hath founded</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>and the Poor of his People shall trust in it: He will leave an afflicted poor People, and they shall trust in the Name of the Lord; and then will he give them a pure Language, that they may all call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him with one Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:49639:73"/>
               <hi>Thou hast indeed smitten</hi> Edom <hi>and</hi> Babylon. <hi>Let not thine Heart lift thee up, for why wilt thou meddle to thine own Ruine? that thou shouldest also fall, thou and all</hi> Juda <hi>with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall the Sword devour for ever? Knowest thou not that it will be Bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then, ere thou bid the People return from persuing their Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, and yet again, I bow my Soul and Pray, and humbly Beg; That all may be both <hi>Iust,</hi> and <hi>Iustly done.</hi> Not with Justice only, but with <hi>Pitty</hi> and great <hi>Compassion,</hi> and much <hi>Mercy, for in many things we fail all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I say that the <hi>Commons</hi> also failed to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth. But to speak freely, altho I will not Judg the <hi>Commons,</hi> yet I cannot Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that House; but I must also Condemn what was lately done to them also, (even to the House of <hi>Commons</hi>) by that Army which hath often been acknowledged, to have both served and saved them from Ruine or Slavery.</p>
            <p>I desire not to dispute matter of Fact, nor can I Judg it. It is true that by express Law (besides all of Reason and Nature) there should be no Force of Arms near, or so much as in appearance of overawing the Parliament: and I looked on it as an heavy Charge on some
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:49639:74"/>
that perswaded the <hi>Scots,</hi> or the <hi>Northern Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> to look as if they would have moved to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the City and Parliament against its Will. Nor can we forget, it was so late, that the House voted it Treason to act by Command of Parliament, under a visible <hi>Force.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how shall wee know or discern this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <hi>Force</hi>? They may be <hi>Free</hi> under that which I may think a <hi>Force,</hi> and therefore I must believe them to be <hi>Free,</hi> unless they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> themselves to be <hi>Forced.</hi> For by Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is the Priviledg of Parliament, I may certainly break their Priviledg; while I inveigh against others for so doing, and by this incur the Danger of those that Judg before the time, or out of Place; for I suppose I see 100 of the <hi>Commons</hi> seized and secured; I cannot Judg it a <hi>Breach of Priviledg,</hi> because I know not but it might be done by the Command, Order, or Consent of <hi>Parliament</hi>; till it <hi>declare</hi> the contrary: Or if not by Order of <hi>Parliament,</hi> yet it may be by some Officer, <hi>Virtute Officii</hi>; or if by private Man, yet upon some emergent <hi>Necessity,</hi> or such Reason, that I or others may not Judg, much less Condemn but in Parliament. For it may be possible perhaps (but I hope not probable) that some Parliament-men may design or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:49639:74"/>
to such a dangerous <hi>Treason</hi> or <hi>Felony,</hi> that it may be the Duty of Officers or others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or secure them, till the Cause be heard in Parliament: and Resistance of any that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain upon <hi>suspicion</hi> of <hi>Treason,</hi> hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Ground enough to Justifie Detention and Securing, till there be a legal acquitting. And that <hi>species</hi> of <hi>Treason,</hi> which is against the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> or the <hi>Kingdoms Army,</hi> may so much concern a <hi>General,</hi> that it cannot be wondered if he should be the Accuser or Attacher: who is the Kingdoms <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and intrusted with the <hi>Posse Regni</hi>; which he ought to manage for the best Advantage of the Kingdom: <hi>prout &amp; melius visum est, in Honorem Coronae, &amp; Utilitatem Regni</hi>: as the <hi>Confessor</hi>'s Laws <hi>de Heretochiis</hi>; and yet he is no Judg of this, but must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to the Courts of Justice; and in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to the Parliament, when ever it concerneth any of that Body Representative.</p>
            <p>I say not, that the House should not, or need not demand their Members; and the Cause of any such Detention (which still ought to be submitted to the Judgment of Parliament,) but I think it may be possible to suppose such a Case as cannot soon be heard and adjudged; and in such Case, I do not know it is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:49639:75"/>
Necessary for the House to sit still, and to refuse to act at all, till all their Members be restored. For by this it might be possible for a few mischievous Persons, still to keep the Parliament in such a perpetual Imployment, or rather Idleness; that they should do nothing but Dispute their own <hi>Priviledg,</hi> and breach thereof. Whereas it may be such a Case, that should make them that be Free, to be more active in the publick Service, <hi>Ne quid Detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti capiat Resp.</hi> while some cannot, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers will not come to do their Duties.</p>
            <p>Yet if any be Zealous to spend their Time, or rather the <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> in Disputing an airie empty Species of <hi>Priviledg</hi> (which themselves may reflect or refract at Pleasure, every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) I may not Condemn or Judg them: But when the Sea breaks in, I should fear it a Madness in my self, to sit and frown with a Spanish Gravity, chafing at those that broke down the Banks, till the Waves come in, and drown me with my Friends and Country.</p>
            <p>I do not deny but that by the Law and Custom of Parliament, 40 may be an House of Commons as well as 400. Yet to speak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I could believe it to be the Duty of such 40 to call in their fellow Members, especially
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:49639:75"/>
when the Work is great and weighty. And I must confess I should somewhat wonder to see 40 sit alone, about the greatest Matters possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without so much as calling the rest, or sending Writs for new Elections.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Modus of Parliament</hi> telleth us, that as the King might not absent himself (but in the Case of Sickness, and then he must lie in the same City or Mannor,) without Consent of Parliament; so also there was great Caution against the Members absenting themselves; so that it was expressed in the old <hi>Writ</hi> of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that they should not depart from Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament without Consent of Parliament. But I know not whether the Crime may be so great in those that desert their Trust; as it may be in those who permit them so to do.</p>
            <p>But I will suppose the House of <hi>Commons</hi> is both <hi>Full</hi> and <hi>Free</hi>; which we may, and should (for ought I know,) till they declare it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Yet when they are freest, they have Limits; for they be not Infinite. Nay when they are most Free, they are most bound to good Orders and to right Reason.</p>
            <p>They which bring them to this at any time (though by any Army of Arguments, or any thing else that is Reasonable,) are so far from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:49639:76"/>
enslaving them, that indeed they make them Free, compleatly Free; and when they are set Free, they are the more Inexcusable, if they be not Rational; for when Men are Slaves, they may be the more excused, for acting without or against <hi>Right Reason</hi>; which to Man is the Natural Law of <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is not a Power to act <hi>quicquid Libet, what we list,</hi> (for this may be <hi>Licentious,</hi> and a Lust or Passion may enslave a Man as much as any Chain or Fetter,) but <hi>quod Licet,</hi> what is <hi>Iust</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi>; or as some of the <hi>Schools</hi> express it, by the <hi>Wills</hi> following the Dictates of the <hi>Understanding,</hi> or <hi>Right Reason,</hi> rather than by a blind irrational <hi>Indifference,</hi> or Power to <hi>Contradict</hi> its own Acts, or to <hi>suspend</hi> its own Acting; which is not found in all, no not in the best Agents, in their best Acts about the chiefest Good, most <hi>Free</hi> and yet most <hi>Necessary</hi>: and wherever such <hi>Indifference,</hi> or such <hi>Suspension</hi> is, it is a Stain or Spot, and may be Slavery rather than an Ornament or Badg of <hi>Liberty</hi>: For it ariseth from some Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, in not discerning what is best; or from some Inconstancy, or Inability to follow it; which without <hi>Suspence</hi> should be always Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and followed by <hi>Right Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:49639:76"/>But what is this <hi>Reason</hi>? is it only <hi>Discourse,</hi> as the <hi>Schools</hi> use to express it? who yet find somewhat higher in Man, even a kind of <hi>Intu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition,</hi> which the old Philosopher did make the highest Sphear of all in Man's Soul, <hi>Concentri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal to Good,</hi> when both <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Fancy</hi> were <hi>Excentrical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to me the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (which we trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <hi>Reason</hi>) seemeth to be the first used of <hi>Proportion</hi> in the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> (Mother of all <hi>Analogy,</hi> and of most Learning to the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:) so that those were called <hi>Rational</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents which acted in <hi>Proportion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So the same old Philosopher (that saith, God ever acteth in <hi>Geometrical Proportion,</hi>) pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth Reason in a <hi>Mean,</hi> between two Ends or Objects: and the Master maketh <hi>Reason</hi> to be Mistress, both to <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Prudence,</hi> (this is <hi>Proportion</hi> in the <hi>Moral,</hi> that in the <hi>Natural</hi> Part of Actions;) and describeth <hi>Virtue</hi> by a <hi>mean Proportion,</hi> which he calleth <hi>Reason; as a Wise Man would define it.</hi> As the Sacred Writer of the <hi>Number of a Man</hi>; that is perhaps <hi>Rational,</hi> a <hi>Logarithm,</hi> or a piece of true <hi>Algebra,</hi> which we may Translate <hi>Mans Numbring</hi>: For of all Visible Creatures, <hi>Man</hi> only was found to use <hi>Numbers</hi> and Proportion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:49639:77"/>But what is this <hi>Proportion,</hi> which Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates an Agent to be <hi>Rational?</hi> Is it between the <hi>Actor</hi> and the <hi>Object</hi>? and do <hi>Rationals</hi> only observe a <hi>Difference</hi> of <hi>Objects</hi>; whereas <hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Agents go on alike to all, <hi>Eodem modo ad Extremum posse?</hi> But <hi>Rationals</hi> still do, or still should act in <hi>Proportion</hi> suitable to themselves, and to their <hi>Objects</hi> also: which is two or three times observed by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> in descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing <hi>Reason,</hi> in that of <hi>Ploughing</hi> and <hi>Threshing,</hi> and of <hi>Punishing,</hi> with that of the <hi>rough East-Wind: Chap.</hi> 27, 28.</p>
            <p>But there is a more inward <hi>Proportion</hi> yet to be found in <hi>rational</hi> Agents, when their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity is <hi>proportional</hi> to their <hi>Being,</hi> and to their <hi>Knowing</hi>: and when ever these three are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>Equal</hi> or <hi>Proportional,</hi> there is <hi>true Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> So it seemeth to be in <hi>God,</hi> (may be so darkly shadow out the Blessed Trinity;) His <hi>Being, Knowing,</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> are Infinite (and therfore <hi>Proportional</hi> to each other) and absolutely <hi>Free,</hi> altho <hi>Necessary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By his <hi>Knowing,</hi> he freely comprehendeth; and by his <hi>Acting,</hi> freely diffuseth his own <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> So that all the <hi>Creatures</hi> seem as several Rayes, or <hi>Ideas</hi> (rightly called <hi>Species,</hi>) <hi>acted,</hi> that is, diffused through infinite <hi>Knowledg</hi>; from,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:49639:77"/>
or rather within Infinite <hi>Being</hi>; which the <hi>Iews</hi> call the <hi>Place, in which we Live, and Move, and have our Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Creation</hi> was of somewhat <hi>not appearing</hi> before; so both Reason and the Scripture teach: But how it was, or could be, from meer <hi>Nothing,</hi> would be more considered: and it may be the Hebrew Word may signify to <hi>Cleer, Manifest,</hi> or <hi>Reveal,</hi> somewhat hidden before; rather than to make of <hi>Nothing Something</hi> (<hi>De novo,</hi>) which may seem impossible, if there ever was <hi>Being Infinite,</hi> (as much real <hi>Entity,</hi> as there could be,) altho not so visible in all its <hi>Moods,</hi> as it was since the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which we call Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Creatures</hi> have some Image of the Creator's <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi>; it may be also some kind of <hi>Knowing</hi> suitable to both: for which there is much to be said, and perhaps more then is yet written by any <hi>de sensu Rerum</hi>: where we might also find Causes of <hi>Antipathies,</hi> and such as are now called <hi>occult Qualities.</hi> And wherever <hi>Activity,</hi> (for this is most to Sence, and by this we used to measure <hi>Freedom,</hi> tho it should it be in <hi>Knowing</hi> as much as in <hi>Doing,</hi>) is preserved <hi>equal,</hi> or <hi>proportional</hi> to <hi>Being,</hi> there and there only, seemeth to be true <hi>Liberty:</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Tenant by Copy,</hi> with <hi>Fine uncertain</hi>; is not wholly at his Lord's Pleasure: for by Common Law, he must only make a <hi>Fine reasonable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Housboot, Hedgboot, Ploughboot,</hi> all <hi>Estovers</hi> (both for Tenants and Prisoners) must be <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,</hi> and so must all Partitions between <hi>Parceners,</hi> and upon <hi>Elegit, &amp;c.</hi> Which are therefore not left to the Sole Pleasure of a She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, or of any other, but in a sworn Enquest, as we may find in the Writ <hi>de Rationabili Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In divers <hi>Mannors,</hi> there be many petty. Customs which can hardly be brought into publick View: but for those, and for all, the Law hath a short Text, <hi>Que nest pas Encountre reason, poit bion estre admitte &amp; allowe</hi>: And the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:49639:79"/>
great Commentator addeth, <hi>Lex est summa Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you ask him who must determin of <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> or what is <hi>reasonable</hi>; his Answer would be, that if any man find himself aggrieved by his Lord, or his Fellow Tenants, the Law supposeth the <hi>Iudges Breast</hi> to be a sufficient <hi>Closet</hi>; or, if you will, a <hi>Castle for right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I remember one Case, (and there may be divers,) in which the <hi>Law</hi> leaveth private Men, (even in their own Causes,) to be <hi>Iudges of Reason,</hi> or what is <hi>reasonable</hi>: It is a case of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Charter dispenseth with <hi>personal Service,</hi> (in some Cases,) where it is not <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable</hi> a Man should serve in Person: and the <hi>Reason</hi> of this runneth so through all <hi>Escuage</hi>; that if any Man will send another in his Room, the Law dispenseth with it, supposing he se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>th <hi>reason</hi> not to attend in Person: Nor may he by Law be compelled in such Case against his own Reason.</p>
            <p>Most, if not all other Cases in that <hi>Tenure,</hi> are by Common Law left to the immediate <hi>Reason</hi> of the Parliament, which may be worth a little Pause; as that which may somewhat
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:49639:79"/>
clear the grand Question of the <hi>MILITIA.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is true that by the Common Law, and by the <hi>Laws</hi> of the Confessor, cited by some, to assert the <hi>Commission of Array</hi>; Men ought indeed to have <hi>Arms,</hi> and them to keep in Readiness for Defence of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>But it is also true that this, besides other Passages, is strangely cited and applyed for De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that <hi>Commission of Array.</hi> For altho the Close of the Sentence be as they say, <hi>Iuxta praeceptum Domini Regis, &amp;c.</hi> Yet the same Sentence (had they cited it whole,) seemeth to be much more against the <hi>Array,</hi> than for it.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Arms</hi> required there, must be <hi>Asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Common Consent:</hi> and that also limited in that very Sentence, to the Proportion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Man's <hi>Estate,</hi> and <hi>Fee for the Defence of the King and Kingdom; and for the Service due to the Lords, Iuxta praeceptum Domini Regis</hi>; and these Words in this place do refer to the immediate precedent Words, <hi>Servitium Dominorum</hi>; which by the Custom of the Kingdom was so Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in all <hi>Homage</hi> or <hi>Fealty,</hi> there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be added this <hi>Salvo; Salve lay foy que jeo Doi, à Seignior le Roy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="tcp:49639:80"/>And lest King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws should not be plain enough <hi>secundùm quod eis statutum est, &amp; adjudicatum, &amp; quod debent</hi>: King <hi>William</hi> the first, by Advice of his great Council ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained them thus; that <hi>nothing should be exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or taken, but Liberum Servitium</hi>; free Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. <hi>Prout statutum est, per commune concilium totius regni; as it was established by the Common Council of the whole Kingdom</hi>: which is also a clear Proof, for such a <hi>Common Council</hi> in his time, and before.</p>
            <p>In the same Laws, this <hi>William</hi> (whom some call the <hi>Conquerour</hi>) granteth that <hi>Cities, Burroughs, Castles, Hundreds,</hi> and <hi>Wapentakes, should be so kept and watched, as the Sheriffs,</hi> Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>&amp;c. should best order for the good of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, per Commune concilium</hi>; by such <hi>Common Council</hi>: and a little after giveth this Reason, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were founded for publick defence of the Kingdom and People thereof, idcirco observari de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent, cum omni libertate, integritate, &amp; ratione</hi>; a very happy Trinity.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Service,</hi> with such <hi>Arms</hi> as were by <hi>Common Council</hi> assessed: The same King (cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Conqueror</hi>) hath indeed such a Law, <hi>That all Earls, Barons, Knights &amp;c. should have and keep themselves in Arms and Horses, as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:49639:80"/>
and behoved them</hi>: So much of this Law, the <hi>King's</hi> Declaration cited for the <hi>Commission</hi> of <hi>Array.</hi> But the following Words of that Law quite dash such <hi>Array</hi>; for the Close of all is, <hi>according to what they ought to us, by their Fees and Tenure,</hi> to do by Law; <hi>&amp; sicut eis statuimus per commune Concilium Totius Regni</hi>: Even by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the Common Council of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Laws of King William,</hi> with the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> and <hi>Emendations of the Confessor</hi>'s, were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards confirmed by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 1<hi>st.</hi> as appeareth by his <hi>Charter</hi>; not only in the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer,</hi> but in other Places also; besides that we have in <hi>Matthew Paris</hi>; a Copy of which was kept in every County. And the same <hi>Charter</hi> was again confirmed by King <hi>Iohn,</hi> (they know it may be proved;) and again by King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> and so it came into the great <hi>Charter,</hi> and by Consequence Confirmed, in more <hi>than</hi> thirty <hi>Parliaments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which also there hath often been, most especial Care of this touching the Militia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the main Causes of those Statutes, entituled <hi>Confirmationes Chartarum,</hi> and of those <hi>De Tallagio non concedendo; except by common Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Parliament</hi>: besides many later Statutes,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:49639:81"/>
in King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> with other Times.</p>
            <p>I deny not that in <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> there did issue out a <hi>Commission of Array.</hi> But it is as true, that in the last Parliament of the same King <hi>Henry</hi> the 4<hi>th.</hi> it was again declared as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right of this Kingdom , not to be charged with ought, for Defence of the Realm, or Safeguard of the Seas, but by their own Will and Consent in Parliament.</p>
            <p>By which we may learn how to interpret all the Precedents acted by the King, for his <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray</hi>: and by how much the more is it true, that some Commissioners of <hi>Array</hi> have been <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Parliament</hi>? which is always needful to Confirm <hi>any such Array</hi>: Which yet is not proved ever to be Paralelld in any Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ought I can find.</p>
            <p>For in all yet seen, there is no such bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Authority, given to two or three Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, (or others,) to compel all Men but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to provide and bear Arms, <hi>how,</hi> and <hi>when,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> it shall seem good to such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners: Which at once seemeth <hi>to Dissolve all Laws of Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which by the <hi>Mirrour</hi> with other old Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, is chiefly placed in this; <hi>not to be tyed to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:49639:81"/>
any Man, but by ones own Consent.</hi> In explaining of which they are Large, in shewing how the <hi>Tenures</hi> of the Crown were appointed for <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Kingdom</hi>: and none <hi>tyed to Service,</hi> but according to this <hi>Tenure</hi>; which was asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Common Consent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if such <hi>Commissions of Array,</hi> might be Legal from the King; <hi>Escuage</hi> is so far from the worst or hardest <hi>Tenure,</hi> (as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought,) that it would prove the <hi>best,</hi> and easiest in all the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For if the <hi>Escuage be uncertain</hi> by <hi>Tenure</hi>: None that hath read so much as <hi>Littleton,</hi> can be Ignorant, that by the Commom Law and Custom of the Kingdom; it is not to be asses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>King,</hi> or any other, but by <hi>Common assent in Parliament</hi>: which hath now done much to settle this also.</p>
            <p>And <hi>if Certain,</hi> then is the King as really limited as the <hi>Tenant.</hi> So that the King cannot command or require his Tenant, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Tenure expressed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not <hi>when he will:</hi> For it must only be in <hi>time of War,</hi> and this is not to be determined by the King, but by the <hi>Courts of Iustice.</hi> When they <hi>are open,</hi> as appeareth by all the Law-Books, in the Case of <hi>Roger Mortimer, Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:49639:82"/>
Earl of Lancaster,</hi> and divers others.</p>
            <p>Nor in <hi>all times of War,</hi> but only in a <hi>Voyage Royal</hi>; to which <hi>Escuage</hi> is most properly ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and this must not be determined by the King (who may be a Child, Sick, Incompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,) nor by <hi>his Marshal,</hi> or <hi>Constable,</hi> but by the Courts of Justice.</p>
            <p>Nor in a <hi>Voyage Royal, as long as the King may please</hi>: But according to the <hi>Tenure</hi>; usually forty Days for each Knights Fee; and it hath been demurred in Law, when those forty Days should begin.</p>
            <p>They are <hi>Littleton</hi>'s <hi>own Words,</hi> and very Pregnant; as if he thought that by Law, <hi>the King could have no Host, or Muster, but by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Commons</hi>: and he was as like to know our Laws, as most Men living now.</p>
            <p>Nor is the Tenant to serve, but according to his <hi>Tenure</hi> in <hi>Gascoyn, Wales, Ireland, Scotland,</hi> to which <hi>Escuage</hi> proper, (but rather from the <hi>Scute</hi> or <hi>Shield</hi>;) and the Books have divers Cases, where the King hath required Service, denyed by Limits in <hi>Tenures</hi>; which the <hi>Courts of Iustice,</hi> especially Parliament, in all Ages did determine.</p>
            <p>Nor is the King to determine <hi>how the Knights shall serve him</hi>; whether in <hi>Person</hi> or not. For
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:49639:82"/>
this is by Law, at the Tenants Choice. And if the <hi>Knight</hi> or his Proxy, will not attend, or stay out his Time: yet cannot the King pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against him, but in a <hi>Court of Iustice,</hi> and not by <hi>Marshal Law</hi>: Yet the <hi>Marshal's Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> is a Legal Evidence, that the Tenants did not appear in Service; but his Reasons must be heard with all just Pleas.</p>
            <p>Nor <hi>with what Arms or Horses, the Tenants may serve</hi>: all is expresly limited; <hi>if the Tenure be certain</hi>: and if not <hi>Certain,</hi> it must (as all Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers know,) be assessed by Parliament; which did also at first establish that, which now is <hi>Certain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor would it be difficult for a mean Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to shew how in all Ages, the <hi>Militia</hi> was as well <hi>disposed</hi> and <hi>managed,</hi> as it was <hi>Moulded</hi> by <hi>Common Consent,</hi> which is very considerable; and the rather, because all that wrot for the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray,</hi> did most, or only run out in this; That <hi>the King had the sole disposal of the Militia</hi>: not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, that if <hi>this had been proved,</hi> (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was that I know) yet <hi>this</hi> was only but <hi>half,</hi> and it may be <hi>the least half of the Question.</hi> For by that strange <hi>Commission of Array,</hi> the King did not only challenge the Right of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal,</hi> of the <hi>Legal Militia,</hi> already setled; but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:49639:83"/>
also of <hi>Moulding</hi> and Making <hi>a new Militia,</hi> not yet made or ever thought of, that I could learn by any of our Ancestors.</p>
            <p>If I were forced to enter the Lists, which I would avoid, as a Purgatory; (being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, I say not better imployed, than in such unprofitable Wranglings,) I should believe it not very difficult, much less impossible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; That both the <hi>Moulding</hi> and <hi>Manage,</hi> (the <hi>Make</hi> and the <hi>Use</hi>) of the Kingdoms <hi>Militia,</hi> was ever immediately subject to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the <hi>Courts of Iustice</hi> (especially the Parliaments,) which may in a large Sense of Law, be called <hi>the Crown,</hi> or <hi>King's Politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity</hi>; but never I think to the King's Person a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, which in Law is still an Infant, as the <hi>Mirrour</hi> expresly calls him, though his <hi>common Capacity</hi> be <hi>ever of age.</hi> Be the Person a Child, an Infant, Lunatick, <hi>Incompos Mentis,</hi> or a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, which sure our Ancestors could not but deem a most unlikely Person for a wise and <hi>valiant General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I were compelled to argue this, it should not be only from <hi>right Reason,</hi> or the Law of Nature, which yet to me, seemeth much to encline this way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Feet</hi> are to bear, and the <hi>Hands</hi> to help,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:49639:83"/>
to hold, to bind, and rub the <hi>Head,</hi> (in any Distemper or Weakness,) but if I should hear of any Man born with his <hi>Heels</hi> in his <hi>Neck,</hi> or his <hi>Hands</hi> tyed to his <hi>Head,</hi> or immediately <hi>under his Chin,</hi> I should think it a Monster.</p>
            <p>And wherever both <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> are at their due Distance from the <hi>Head,</hi> with divers Nerves and other Vessels, Bones and other parts between them: yet I never heard or knew that they did <hi>obey</hi> the <hi>Head,</hi> till it did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>itself,</hi> and them also by <hi>Reason</hi>; or till it also doth <hi>Obey,</hi> not only its own <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears,</hi> but the <hi>Common Sense</hi> and <hi>Reason</hi> of the Soul.</p>
            <p>I must confess I have heard that <hi>Ticho-Brah,</hi> did sometimes imagine that he found <hi>Mars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, or under the Sun.</hi> But if it were really so, it seems as great a Prodigy in Nature as the new Star, and that of <hi>Mars,</hi> rather than a <hi>new Star</hi> in <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> might presage those sad Commotions which have since followed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places of <hi>Europe,</hi> while <hi>Mars</hi> hath been so much <hi>below or under the Sun.</hi> For by Nature <hi>Mars</hi> was said, and ever thought to be placed immediately <hi>under Iupiter,</hi> the great Judg, <hi>or Court of Iustice</hi>; which should command the <hi>Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so it doth by <hi>Law.</hi> For in <hi>England</hi> the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:49639:84"/>
               <hi>Iudgments</hi> given in any <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Record</hi> do so command the <hi>Militia</hi> for <hi>Execution</hi>; for a <hi>Writ</hi> runs of Course, which was made by <hi>Common</hi> Consent, and cannot be denyed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Release to all Actions,</hi> will not hold against <hi>Execution,</hi> except all <hi>Suits</hi> were also released: But this is such a <hi>Suit</hi> as the Law calls a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> which may not be denyed.</p>
            <p>And for other Cases of Routs, Riots, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Assemblies, Invasions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Posse Comitatus,</hi> and by Consequence the <hi>Posse Regni,</hi> was Disposed and Commanded by known, sworn Officers; that acted <hi>Virtute Officii,</hi> by the Law and Custom of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>For it may be known that the old <hi>Iustices,</hi> or <hi>Conservators of the Peace,</hi> were chosen by the Counties; as appeareth by Writs, yet to be read from the Rolls of <hi>Edward the First.</hi> And now their Commission and their Power de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor could the <hi>Chancery</hi> have given such a Power, had it not been so Established by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which hath also strictly provided for their Legal Nomination and Election. For which the Statutes of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the Fifth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth; and before them all, <hi>Edward</hi> the third thought it were not prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:49639:84"/>And it is very well known, how by the Common-Law and Custom of the Kingdom, all the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> do command the <hi>Posse Regni</hi> in their several Counties: and that not onely <hi>Execution of Writs,</hi> which may be thought to be Matters of <hi>Peace</hi>; But the Lawyers know, that Sheriff is <hi>Custos Legis</hi> and <hi>Reipublicae,</hi> as well as of <hi>Peace</hi>; of which he is the Principal <hi>Conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator</hi> in his Shire and County. Nor may it be Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption to say, That all these <hi>Sheriffs</hi> also ought to be, and so were, <hi>chosen by the People,</hi> as is sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and in the Laws of the <hi>Confessor.</hi> And in full Parliament of <hi>Edward</hi> the first, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Law and Custom of the Kingdom; and therefore so setled in the Choice of the People.</p>
            <p>There was in latter times some <hi>Alteration</hi> made in Choice of <hi>Sheriffs</hi>; but it was by <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, we all know, that <hi>Headboroughs, Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,</hi> (greater men than themselves know) <hi>Coroners,</hi> and divers others, are yet still chosen in the Counties; and do act by Custom and Common-Law. And the <hi>Sheriff</hi> also, however he be chosen, yet he stands not by Commission; nor ought to fall with Kings death: But is a standing Officer, by Common-Law. Who may command all Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in his County, by his <hi>Writ of Assistance.</hi> Which issueth of course to every <hi>Sheriff.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not say, how little the Kings Personal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Warrant, can by Law interrupt or hinder the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:49639:85"/>
Process of <hi>Sheriffs, Iustices, Constables,</hi> or others, in their legal course for the Publick Peace. Yea, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that if I should have beaten a Drum, or raised Forces to rescue King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter,</hi> for abusing a <hi>Petty Watch</hi> in a Night-walk; I might have been arraigned for it.</p>
            <p>And so I might have been, for refusing to fire the <hi>Beacons,</hi> or to have raised the <hi>Counties,</hi> if I had seen a Navie of <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Turks</hi> landing in King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time: Although the King had come to me and bid me quiet, because they were <hi>Friends,</hi> or such as he invited in for the good of his Kingdom. Which from his own Mouth, or under his hand, would have been no legal <hi>Supersedeas</hi> to a private man, in case of such Danger; much less to a <hi>Sheriff,</hi> or other sworn Officer.</p>
            <p>For in such cases of Apparent Danger, any man that is next, may esteem himself an Officer; as, in quenching great Fires, or damming out the Sea. And in such, though the King himself should forbid me, or get me indicted; I may demur, and put my self on the Judges of Law; especially Parliament, the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Judges in such Causes. And to Lawyers I need not cite Records or Precedents.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I need to adde, That in case of <hi>Foreign Invasion,</hi> or Intestine Motions, and Breaches of Publick Peace, the Common known Laws of the Land will warrant a <hi>Sheriff, Officer,</hi> or private man, to go over a Pale, an Hedge, a Ditch, or other Bound of a Shire or
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:49639:85"/>
County. In which our Ancestors were not so cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious or superstitious, in case of hot Pursuit, or the like: Although they were punctual enough in keeping of <hi>Land-marks:</hi> And in Peace, in cases of real Actions, and personal Trials. They were very tender of those Marks, in special, that bounded out <hi>Shires</hi> or <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Original of Shires and Sheriffs, is generally fixed upon King <hi>Alfred.</hi> But the old Abbot of <hi>Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (whence this arose) seemeth to speak of new <hi>Names,</hi> rather than Things: for himself hath <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias, Comites, Vice Domini</hi> (though not <hi>Vice Comites</hi>) of Ages before King <hi>Alfred.</hi> And the Monk of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> durst not follow <hi>Ingulph</hi> in this of Shires, as he doth in <hi>Hundreds</hi>; which yet (as <hi>Wapentakes</hi>) were elder much, if we may credit <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Old <hi>Ethelward,</hi> and the Author of both the <hi>Offa's</hi>; with <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> among Historians; and the Lawyers old <hi>Horn-book,</hi> the <hi>Mirrour</hi>; do find or make <hi>Counties</hi> and <hi>Counts,</hi> before King <hi>Alfred.</hi> And we may go high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er much, if we may trust to <hi>Alfreds Saxon Bede,</hi> now printed, with an old <hi>Saxon Chronologie,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock.</hi> In both which we read so much of <hi>Eorl, Eolder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Shire-Alderman,</hi> and <hi>Bishops-shire</hi> (besides <hi>Shire-born</hi>) that is, his <hi>Parish:</hi> For this was the old Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, before the Novel Division of <hi>Parishes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And before <hi>Alfred,</hi> as high as King <hi>Ina.</hi> His Laws, now extant, tell us of <hi>Shire-men</hi> that were <hi>Iudges</hi> also,

(as the old <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

            </p>
            <p>I might adde the old <hi>Writs of Assize</hi> in St. <hi>Edmund</hi>'s time; on which the great Judge buildeth (in two or three Books of <hi>Reports</hi>) for <hi>Sheriffs, Tryal</hi> by Twelve, and other things; which might have other clearer Proofs.</p>
            <p>If any would also assert such Division among the old <hi>Britains,</hi> he might have much from <hi>Nature,</hi> in Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers or such Partitions, to most of our <hi>Shires</hi>; besides the names in <hi>Cesar, Tacitus, Strabo, Ptolomy</hi>; and besides that, which <hi>Virgil</hi> himself will admit of, <hi>Molmutius</hi> Laws; assigning the <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Plows</hi> for every <hi>County,</hi> which is in others; besides <hi>Monmouth</hi> or <hi>Virunnius:</hi> For <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lydore</hi> addeth in this: which is to be marked; besides St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws.</p>
            <p>This Disgression may be the more tolerable, as that which maketh way to such Elections; as we might assert in the Parliaments of those times also, were this the proper place.</p>
            <p>But to return to the <hi>Militia.</hi> We have found it moulded by <hi>Common Consent</hi>; and by it also commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>Shireeves</hi> and other Officers, known, sworn, and <hi>chosen by the People.</hi> We shall now step a little higher, that we may see how in elder times the great work of <hi>War,</hi> as well as <hi>Peace,</hi> was managed. And this also we shall find entrusted to a <hi>Common Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:49639:86"/>I do not deny, but the King himself hath sometimes been General of a great Army; and that legally also: for it was by Consent of the People or Parliament.</p>
            <p>So it was when the <hi>Romans</hi> came into this Island, <hi>Cassibelan</hi> was King and chief Commander in War: But it was by Consent of a great <hi>Common Council</hi>; as <hi>Caesar</hi> himself observeth and reporteth: <hi>Summa belli Communi <unclear>Coneilio</unclear>, Cassibelano traditur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can it be wondered at, when their <hi>Druyds</hi> grand Maxime of State was this: <hi>Ne loqui de Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica, nisi per Coneilium.</hi> Not so much as to speak of a matter of State, but in or by a Council.</p>
            <p>These were they that sent <hi>Caesar</hi> word, they had as good Bloud as lie; and from the same Fountain: ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been so long acquainted with <hi>Liberty,</hi> that they knew not the meaning of <hi>Tribute</hi> or <hi>Slavery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>British Druyds</hi> moulded the <hi>Gauls: Cesar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth it, with the Brag of one of them, saying, <hi>That he could call or appeal to such a great Common Council, that all the World could not resist it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there were others also, besides <hi>Kings,</hi> chosen by the <hi>Britains</hi> to be <hi>Generals</hi>; such as old Authors call <hi>Principes Militiae:</hi> a Phrase given to divers; two I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, <hi>Bolinus</hi> and <hi>Levisham</hi> (as now he might be called) in the time of <hi>Kimbolinus:</hi> acting by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Council, as all may find that read those Histories. Which we may now assert, by better Authors than old <hi>Monmouth,</hi> though he be better also; much better than <hi>Polydore</hi> or others would perswade us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:49639:87"/>It was this <hi>great Council,</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi> that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with and against the <hi>Romans</hi> in all times; and that sought their aid at length against the <hi>Picts</hi> and <hi>Scots.</hi> And when the <hi>Romans</hi> could not attend the <hi>Britains Tears,</hi> it was this <hi>Council</hi> that called in their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours first, and Friends the <hi>Britains</hi> from <hi>Armorica</hi>; (the <hi>Gaulish Britain</hi>) and that before King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s time: Of which so many Authors write, that <hi>Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato Clero,</hi> and <hi>Primatibus Communi tandem assensu mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur in Armoricam Nuncii, &amp;c.</hi> A Parliament clear enough; yet not so clear; as any man acquainted with those times, might prove beyond dispute. But I now must attend the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Parliament it was that called in the <hi>Saxons</hi>; not the King alone, but Parliament, of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> also; if (besides the Crowd of all in the Road) I be not deceived by the <hi>Saxon Chronologie</hi>; and <hi>Gildas</hi> himself, (whose very words almost are used by <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi> and others;) and by the famous <hi>Nennius</hi> of <hi>Bangor,</hi> who yet liveth in <hi>Manuscript.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is clear enough for divers things we doubt in <hi>British Stories:</hi> And for Parliaments also, before the <hi>Saxons</hi> setling here; which was by <hi>Act of Parliament. Dum Conventa magna Synodus Clericorum &amp; Laicorum, in uno consilio &amp; cum majoribus natu Consilium fecerunt, &amp; scrutati sunt quid facerent; tandem Concilium omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus fuit, ut pacem facerent: postea verò Conventum adduxerunt,</hi> (here was a <hi>Covenant</hi> also by <hi>Parliament</hi>)
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:49639:87"/>
               <hi>&amp; Statutum est, ut amicitia firma adjuvicemesset, &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Nennius,</hi> after his escape from the <hi>Massacre</hi> at <hi>Bangor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come we now to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> setled here by <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> In this they may seem more considerable, that by most they are made the Patrons of <hi>Chivalry,</hi> or <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures by Knights-service:</hi> for it is now believ'd by no Lawyer or Historian, (that I know) that this came in with the <hi>Normans</hi>; although it was so thought by some.</p>
            <p>I have somewhat to say in due place, why it might look higher than the <hi>Saxons</hi>; yet I must yield, it had been but little room among the <hi>Britains</hi> of <hi>Gavel-kind.</hi> Of which, the Parliament in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth; and more hereafter: besides all the Comments upon the Statute (or rather the <hi>Writ</hi>) <hi>de Militibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None doubt but <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaketh of our <hi>Saxon</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors (or rather <hi>theirs</hi>) in that, in <hi>their chosing Kings</hi> and <hi>Generals, (Reges ex nobilitate, Duces ex vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) by Common Council, in iisdem conciliis, Eliguntur &amp; Principes, de Minoribus Principes, de Majoribus, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes consultant.</hi> And that such Council did both mould and manage the <hi>Militia,</hi> is plain enough in the same Author: Who besides all matters of History, telleth us their general Custom was; <hi>Not to entrust any man with bearing Arms, antequam Civitas suffecturum proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verit, till some Common Council, more or less, had appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him.</hi> For so, I may translate it to all that know, how much <hi>Vrbs</hi> and <hi>Civitas</hi> do differ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:49639:88"/>The Tract of <hi>Parliaments</hi> is visible enough in all the <hi>Saxon Writings here.</hi> I should be tedious in citing but one quarter of that which their Laws (yet to be found, and very good Authors) do afford in this.</p>
            <p>Some have much wondred at a Passage now found in the <hi>Confessors Laws.</hi> It is about <hi>Titles</hi>; which he saith, were preached by <hi>Austin, and granted by the King</hi> (then reigning) <hi>and the Barons, and common People: Concessa sunt à Rege, Baronibus, &amp; Populo.</hi> A very full and clear Parliament.</p>
            <p>We need not suspect or doubt it: for in those very times there were such Parliaments, and such degrees. Nay, <hi>Caesar</hi> himself found such <hi>degrees</hi> among the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>; a <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Druyds,</hi> (which were as <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Archbishops,</hi> as we may clear anon) <hi>Dukes</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> besides the <hi>Commons:</hi> So civil was our <hi>British Ancestors.</hi> Of whom, much more ere long.</p>
            <p>And for the very first times of Christian Religion (which was much higher than <hi>Austin</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> who might have been great Grandfather to <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk) King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s own Laws acknowledge, that in this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sland the Laws were then made by a <hi>Common Council of Bishops and other Wise men, or elder men of the Wytan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Old <hi>Bede</hi> seemeth plain enough for this, in several places; <hi>Servabant Reges, Sacerdotes, Privati</hi> (Were the Commons before the Lords?) <hi>&amp; Optimates, suum quique Ordinem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:49639:88"/>And of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> called in by Common Council, <hi>Initum est Concilium, quid agendum, &amp;c. placuitque om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus, cum suo Rege Vortigorno, ut Saxonum gentem in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xilium vocarent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of <hi>Ethelbert</hi> (King of all the South to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Humber</hi>;) <hi>Among other good works</hi> (saith he) <hi>quae consulendo conferebat, etiam decreta Iudiciorum juxta exempla Romanorum, Concilio Sapientiunt constituit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And among other Laws of his (in the same <hi>Bede</hi>) that is one, in special, for Priviledge, <hi>Ecclesiae, Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi, &amp; Reliquorum ordinum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this might also extend to the great <hi>Priviledge of Parliaments,</hi> I could the rather believe, from the Laws of the said King <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> yet to be found in the old book of <hi>Rochester (Textus Roffensis)</hi> of which, Sir <hi>Henry Spelman</hi>; unto whom we owe so much for all Antiquities. Where, after provision for the things of <hi>God</hi> and the <hi>Church,</hi> (to which St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws allude) the next Act is for <hi>Priviledge of Parliament,</hi> it seems; being for the punishing and sore fining of those that should do any damage, <hi>Gif Kyning his Leode to him gehateth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And in the old Chronicle of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> we read of this King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> being at <hi>Canterbury</hi> with his Queen and Son, and the Archbishop <hi>Austin; Caeterisque Opti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matibus, convocato ibidem Communi Concilio tam Cleri, quàm Populi:</hi> With divers other proofs for Parliaments in Charters to that Church, in print. And <hi>Spot</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves as much.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:49639:89"/>One thing I must not omit, that <hi>Bede</hi> (observing how Religion was preached both to the King and to the <hi>Counts, omnibus Comitibus</hi>) saith, there was a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense</hi> granted for publick <hi>Preaching</hi>; but when the King and divers great men were converted and bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, yet there was no force used to compel others to be of that Religion: because (he saith) they were taught, that <hi>Christs service must be voluntary, and not forced.</hi> But the <hi>Mirrour</hi> telleth us, the King was bound <hi>to compel men to Salvation.</hi> O happy men! or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy King!</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Britains</hi> would not be forced from their Rites by <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, <hi>Absque suae gentis, &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primis Senatorum suffragio:</hi> as a learned man translates King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s <hi>Saxon Bede.</hi> Which is also very clear in several places, for setling of Christian Religion, (when it was freely chosen) with destruction of Pagan Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: with <hi>Lent,</hi> and other things, confirmed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Acts of Parliament in time of <hi>Ercombert</hi> and King <hi>Edwin; Mid his Witum, &amp; mid his Ealdormanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So is the old Book of <hi>Peterburgh,</hi> for a Parliament or <hi>Heatfield.</hi> With which we may compare somewhat in <hi>Ingulph,</hi> and more in <hi>Bede, Ethelward,</hi> and <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> about the Parliaments which received and consirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>General Councils</hi>; and that which established the Division of <hi>Parishes,</hi> and <hi>Patronage</hi> of <hi>Churches.</hi> Of which, <hi>Stow,</hi> and the Antiquities of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; but especially a Manuscript in <hi>Camdridge,</hi> cited by Mr. <hi>Wheelock</hi> on the fourth or fifth of <hi>Bede.</hi>

            <p>And for the <hi>Saxon Militia,</hi> (a Phrase used by <hi>Bede</hi> himself; <hi>Nam egressi contra Gevissorum gentem, omnes pariter cum suà Militia corruerunt:</hi>) King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Laws afford us divers Acts of Parliament, providing against Thieves, Riots, Routs, and all unlawful Assemblies, in several degrees and branches: As also for Officers of the <hi>Militia</hi> (to be ready on a great Fine) to march upon all just occasions.

            <p>I might pass over King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Parliaments: so the famous in all Historians and Lawyers. But in none I know clearer, than in the old <hi>Mirrour.</hi> Of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for <hi>Alfred</hi> and his Parliaments, twice every year in <hi>London.</hi> With which we may compare one passage in the <hi>Confessors Laws,</hi> touching this great and <hi>old City.</hi> But of this, hereafter.</p>
            <p>This was the learned King, who perused all the old <hi>Trojan, Grecian, British, Molmutian, Mercian, Danish,</hi> and <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; especially those of <hi>Ina, Offa,</hi> and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:49639:92"/>
King <hi>Ethelbert: Cum consulto Sapientum, partim inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanda curavit,</hi> as himself speaketh. And his Laws were established by Parliaments, by his Witan, or <hi>Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena: Atque eis omnibus placuit, edici eorum Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi>; As learned <hi>Lambert</hi> translateth the Saxon.</p>
            <p>But I may not omit King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s <hi>Doomsday-book,</hi> made by such <hi>Common Council,</hi> the <hi>great Roll of Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>; which was again renewed by the <hi>Confessor,</hi> and then again by King <hi>William the First</hi>; and then also called the Roll of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Doomsday,</hi> as before. Of which, old <hi>Ingulph,</hi> with <hi>Natura Brevium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet it seemeth, that before King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time, there was such a <hi>Doom-book</hi> made by <hi>Ethelwoolf</hi> (at the time of the <hi>Church-Glebe</hi>;) of which Book, the Saxon Chronology, at the year 854. But this might rather be a Land-book (whence the Phrase of <hi>Booeland.</hi>) See King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s <hi>Will,</hi> annexed to <hi>Asser.</hi> But we also find an ancient <hi>Doom-book</hi> for their Laws and matters <hi>Iudicial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of which <hi>Doom-book</hi> we read in several places of the Laws of <hi>Edward the Senior</hi>; strictly charging all the Judges and Magistrates to be just and equitable: <hi>Nec quicquam formident, quin jus Communae audacter, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereque dicant:</hi> according to the <hi>Doom-book.</hi> And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Laws, we find the <hi>Doom-book</hi> for Tythes, and the famous <hi>Kyricseat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These succeeded King <hi>Alfred.</hi> But long before his time, among the <hi>Dooms</hi> of <hi>Withred,</hi> made about the

            </p>
            <p>I could believe King <hi>Ethelbert</hi>'s Parliaments were Authors to this <hi>Doom-book.</hi> Of which, the <hi>Roll of Rochester, tha Doomas dhe Athelbirth Cyning</hi>; with <hi>Rihtra Dooma</hi> (in the fore-cited place of <hi>Ethelbert</hi>) in the Saxon <hi>Bede</hi> of King <hi>Alfred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How severe <hi>his Dooms</hi> were to the <hi>Counts,</hi> old <hi>Shireeves</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> we find in <hi>Asser:</hi> more in <hi>Horn,</hi> and his <hi>Kirk-dooms</hi> in his Laws; which do also speak of <hi>Kiric-Ealdor,</hi> a <hi>Church-Elder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But again to the Saxon <hi>Militia.</hi> In <hi>Alfred</hi>'s time there was a League made with the <hi>Danes:</hi> Then the Title was, <hi>Foedus quod Aluredus &amp; Guthrunus Regis ferierunt, ex Sapientum Anglorum consulto</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confirmed by Act of Parliament. And the Saxon Chronologer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, That the <hi>Dane</hi> swore to the Peace, and promised to be baptized; as he also was, and King <hi>Alfred</hi> was his Godfather, naming him <hi>Ethelstane.</hi> Some adde, a Daughter of King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s for his Wife: which may be worth enquiring, more than now may seem.</p>
            <p>The Articles of this League were again renewed and enlarged by Parliament, in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Elder: A Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pientibus recitata sapius, atque ad Communem Regni Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litatem, Aucta atque Amplificata.</hi> In the Preface to those Statutes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:49639:93"/>In this <hi>Edward</hi>'s Reign, there was an Insurrection; and <hi>Ethelwald</hi> seized on <hi>Winborn,</hi> &amp;c. whose Charge and Crimes was this: That he did such an Act, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out permission of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament; but an tdes Kynings, leafe ac his Witena.</hi> So the <hi>Saxon.</hi> And <hi>Malmsbury</hi> addeth, That <hi>à Proceribus in Exilium trusus, Piratus adduxerat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the King summons a Parliament at <hi>Exon</hi>; and there, <hi>Mid his Witan,</hi> consulted how the Kingdoms Peace might be restored and preserved: <hi>Orabat vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter, &amp; obtestabatur,</hi> (such was his Mean to the Parliament) <hi>hoc unum Curent, ne quem injurià afficiant:</hi> Beseeching them mainly to mind this, That they wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged none. A most pious Christian Motion! And our Monthly <hi>County-Courts</hi> are as old as this Parliament at <hi>Exon.</hi> The Acts are printed. But I must not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress to their <hi>Ordeals,</hi> appointed there for <hi>Perjury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Kings Reign the Pope sent his Bull to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the King and all his Subjects: For that, <hi>Per</hi> 7 <hi>annos destituta fuerat Episcopis, omnis Regio Gavisorum, id est, West-Saxonum.</hi> Whereupon the King summon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Parliament; <hi>Convocavit Synodum Senatorum Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis Anglorum:</hi> As saith the Monk of <hi>Malmsbury. Et Eligerunt &amp; constituerunt Singulos Episcopos, Singulis Provinciis Gavisorum:</hi> (For the <hi>Bishops Shire</hi> used to be equal to the <hi>Earls,</hi> or the <hi>Ealdormens Shire,</hi> with whom he sate in <hi>Folkmoote.</hi>) <hi>Et quod Olim duo habue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, in quinque diviserunt.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:49639:93"/>King <hi>Ethelstane</hi> came next. He was the first of all the English Kings that ruled over all the Island, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering <hi>Wales,</hi> and regaining <hi>Scotland:</hi> Which being subject to <hi>England,</hi> as a <hi>Dukedom</hi> thereof, was advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a Politick and <hi>Royal Kingdom</hi>: As the learned <hi>Fortescue</hi> doth plainly affirm. And for this, against all that <hi>Buchanan</hi> writeth, I need onely refer to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and Records cited by the great Master of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, with other Learning, Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> in his short but pithy Notes on it, with <hi>Hengham:</hi> To which we may adde somewhat in <hi>Polydore,</hi> and the Saxon Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology, from the year 934; but especially from <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wald</hi>'s <hi>Laws,</hi> and others of the famous <hi>Edgar,</hi> vouching <hi>Ethelstane</hi> for <hi>Scotland.</hi> Of which we read in many places, beside the fourth Part of the great <hi>Reports.</hi> But that victorious Monarch suffered the <hi>Scot</hi> to reign under him, saying, That it was more <hi>glorious to make a King, than to be a King.</hi> A pious Prince, to whom we owe for translating the <hi>Bible</hi> from <hi>Hebrew</hi>; which some think he did by some Converted Jews.</p>
            <p>Among his Laws, now extant, we find divers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in <hi>Celebri Gratanleano Concilio</hi>; where there were <hi>Archiep. Optimates, &amp; Sapientes, ab Ethelstano vocati frequentissimi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And again at <hi>Exon,</hi> we find him <hi>Mid his Wytan</hi>; and their <hi>Wergylds</hi> for the King, Archbishop, Eorles, Bishops, Ealdermen, and other Degrees, may suffice to prove them to be Acts of Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:49639:94"/>With those several Degrees there mentioned, we may compare the Laws of King <hi>Edgar</hi> and <hi>Canute</hi> in divers places, one of the Ranks of their Nobility, as a <hi>General</hi> or great Commander in <hi>Wars</hi>; which may be observed for the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edmund</hi> succeeded; and at <hi>London</hi> holds a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Clergy and Laity; <hi>(ge Godcundra, ge Worul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundra:)</hi> And again, <hi>Mid Witena getheahte gegodra hada gelewedra.</hi> And to the Parliament he giveth so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>Thanks</hi> for <hi>their Aid in setling the Kingdoms Peace.</hi> His Laws are printed.

            </p>
            <p>But I must not omit that Parliament of his, recorded in the <hi>Mirrour</hi>; where we find a kind of <hi>Appeal,</hi> or a legal Accusation of Treason brought by <hi>Roceline</hi> against <hi>Walligrat, in full Parliament,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In King <hi>Edred</hi>'s Reign there was a Parliament so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly <hi>summoned by Writ,</hi> as we read at large in the Abbot of <hi>Crowland.</hi> To which there was then a great Charter confirmed, being drawn or dictated by <hi>Turke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulus,</hi> then Abbot, but he had been <hi>Lord Chancellor.</hi> And the date is, in <hi>Festo Nat' B. Mariae, cum Vniversi Magnates Regni, per Regis Edictum summoniti; tam Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiscopi, &amp; Episcopi, ac Abbates, quam Caeteri totius Regni Proceres, &amp; Optimates, Londoniis Convenissent;
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:49639:94"/>
ad tractandum de Negotiis Publicis totius Regni, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni Concilio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar</hi> was a great Monarch, and as great a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror by Sea, as <hi>Ethelstane</hi> by Land: It might be easier to shew his four Seas, of which so many speak, than to set their exact bounds. Yet it may not be unworthy of our thoughts, to consider, how our Ancestors did often divide the Office of their <hi>Admirals,</hi> usually as Nature hath parted our Seas; as thinking it indeed too great an honour and a burthen, for a Subject to be Admiral of all the Seas of such an Island. But the late <hi>Cardinal of France</hi> did wisely (it was thought) dispose, or rather retain, that Office, as the best Jewel of that Kingdom; which yet by Sea might yield to this.</p>
            <p>But I must not digress, nor can I determine the bounds of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Conquest, to the <hi>North</hi> (they say, to <hi>Norway</hi>) or the <hi>West.</hi> Of which, some speak, as if they would but give us hints for farther search and Queries.</p>
            <p>I dare not affirm, that in those days our <hi>Saxon</hi> or <hi>British</hi> Ancestors did know <hi>America.</hi> But if we may credit any Records besides the Scriptures, I believe or know it might be said and proved well, that this new World was known, and partly inhabited by <hi>Britains</hi> or by <hi>Saxons</hi> from this Island, three or four hundred years before the <hi>Spaniards coming thither.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, the more I consider the Discourses which did
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:49639:95"/>
pass between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>Mexicans,</hi> the more I could believe the <hi>King</hi> himself of <hi>Mexico</hi> might pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly descend from those that went from hence to <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida,</hi> or rather <hi>Mexico:</hi> So that we need not wonder at the <hi>British</hi> Words, or Beads, the <hi>Crucifix,</hi> or other Reliques, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> found at their Arrival. And for this, besides so many other Authors, we have much among the <hi>British</hi> Annals.</p>
            <p>Those in special left by <hi>Caradoc</hi> of <hi>Lancarvan,</hi> or from him, continued by the <hi>Beirdhs</hi> of <hi>Conwey</hi> and <hi>Stratford</hi>; gathered and translated by the learned <hi>Llhoyd.</hi> To which we may adde what Doctor <hi>Powell</hi> hath of this out of Records, and best approved <hi>British</hi> Authors, in the Life of <hi>Owen Gwyned,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Madoe,</hi> his Sons, about the Reign of King <hi>Stephen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which, at least for that which concerneth <hi>Hanno,</hi> or the old Navigations (with <hi>Plato</hi>'s <hi>Atlantis,</hi> or what else appeareth in <hi>Aristotle, Theophrastus, Virgil, Seneca,</hi> with others) it may not be amiss to compare two late and very learned French Authors of <hi>Peleg,</hi> and <hi>orbis maritimus</hi>; very worthy (I think) of good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usal.</p>
            <p>But to return to <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Parliaments: How that great Council did often dispose the King himself, we must discourse in a fitter place. We shall now but observe, that good Historians tell us, that King <hi>Edgar,</hi> by the Council of the Kingdom, did repeal the Acts of <hi>Edwin,</hi> both his brother and predecessor, <hi>Convocato
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:49639:95"/>
ad Brandanfordeam Regni Concilio, fratris Edwini Acta &amp; decreta rescindit.</hi> And the famous <hi>Oswald</hi>'s <hi>Law</hi> was signed by this King, <hi>Cum consensu, Concilio, &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stipulatione, Archiepiscoporum, Principium, &amp; Magnatum.</hi> It is printed, and found in ancient Authors.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Charter to <hi>Glastonbury</hi> (reciting the Acts of so many Kings before him) was confirmed, <hi>Generali assensu Pontificum, Abbatum, &amp; Optimatum:</hi> If we may believe the old Monk. And the Charter is to be read at large: <hi>Archiepiscopis adhortantibus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiente etiam &amp; annuente Brithelmo Fontanensi Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po, caeterisque Episcopis, Abbatibus, &amp; Primatibus.</hi> And the Close is, <hi>Acta haec, &amp; confirmata, apud Londonium, Communi Concilio, omnium Primatum meorum, &amp;c.</hi> I should be unjust to our Laws, if I should omit the Process and Plea of <hi>Morgan Hen,</hi> against <hi>Howell Dha,</hi> the good Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> Upon complaint, they were both summoned by King <hi>Edgar, Ad curiam suam</hi>; and their Pleas were pacately heard, <hi>In Pleno Concilio, &amp; repertum est, justo Iudicio curiae Regis, quod Howell Dha nequiter egisset extra Morgan Hen, &amp; filium sui Huwen, &amp; depulsus est Howell Dha ab his duabus <unclear>Terris</unclear>
               </hi> (the Lands then in question) <hi>sine recuperatione; &amp; Postea Rex Edgarus dedit &amp; concessit, Hueno Morgan Hen, illas duas Terras, (Istradum &amp; Euwias) in Episcopatu Landas constituas, sicuti suam Propriam Hereditatem, &amp; illas easdem duas Terras sibi &amp; Heredibus suis; Per chartam suam sine Calumpnia alicujus Terreni hominis
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:49639:96"/>

            </p>
            <p>This Record of King <hi>Edgar,</hi> is in <hi>Codicae Landavensi, fol.</hi> 103. I find it cited by the great Antiquary Sir <hi>Henry Spelman:</hi> and it may be compared with the Monk of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must not relate the Visions or Predictions of the <hi>Fates</hi> of this Kingdom, which Historians record about the Reign of King <hi>Edgar</hi>; they are in print, and may be read of all: Besides the Prophecies of both the <hi>Merlins</hi>; for the <hi>Scottish Merlin</hi> was fuller and plainer than the <hi>British</hi> in <hi>Vortigers</hi> time: That I say nothing of <hi>Cadwalladers</hi> Vision, or <hi>Alans</hi> Council (which was long before the other <hi>Alane</hi> wrote on <hi>Merlin</hi>) or of the famous <hi>Eagle</hi> of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that agreed with others in the <hi>Britains</hi> recovering their Kingdom again, after their grand Visit at <hi>Rome,</hi> whence they must bring <hi>Cadwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laders</hi> bones.</p>
            <p>This leadeth me also to the <hi>Sybils</hi> Prophecy of three British Princes that should conquer <hi>Rome. Brennus</hi> was one; King <hi>Arthur</hi> some make the second; <hi>Et quis fuit alter?</hi> And of these <hi>Sybils,</hi> or one of them, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a book to King <hi>Bladud,</hi> (so famous for the <hi>Bath,</hi> and Greek-Schools, or University at <hi>Stamford</hi>) the <hi>Scotish Merlin</hi> seemeth to have written, if among others I mistake not <hi>Baleus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:49639:96"/>But of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Parliaments, one was at <hi>Salisbury</hi>; so we read in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> or the old <hi>Fructus Temporum,</hi> by <hi>Iulian Notary</hi> at St. <hi>Albans.</hi> And of another of his Parliaments at <hi>Bath</hi>; the Saxon Chronology, at the year 973.</p>
            <p>His Laws are now printed; and their Title is, <hi>The Acts of King</hi> Edgar <hi>and his Parliament: Mid his Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tena, Getheate gerred,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here we find much considerable of <hi>Thanes</hi>; which all will have to be <hi>Noble-men:</hi> but it must be with them a <hi>Saxon</hi> word. And <hi>Dhenian</hi> is to serve: whence the Princes Motto, <hi>Ic Dhaen.</hi> (For so it should rather be, than in Dutch, <hi>Ich Dien.</hi>) But why should Noble-men, or those that were the freest, have their name from <hi>serving?</hi> Here they flie to Knights-service, King-service, or I know not what; most proper, as they say, to free and Noble-men.</p>
            <p>But from a Judge, or <hi>Fleta,</hi> we may be taught, that the Saxon <hi>Dhaen</hi> or <hi>Thaen,</hi> is a Servant; but <hi>Thayn,</hi> a <hi>Free-man.</hi> And in this sence it seemeth to be used here. As also in <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Nor did the <hi>Britains</hi> differ much; whose <hi>Haene</hi> or <hi>Hane,</hi> is an <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar:</hi> (although <hi>Hyne</hi> be sometimes used for a Servant.) And so the Irish <hi>Tane</hi> is <hi>Elder</hi>; whence their <hi>Tanistry</hi> or <hi>Eldership:</hi> (the cause or sad occasion of such bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.) These British <hi>Hanes,</hi> the Saxons in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, called <hi>Ealdermen:</hi> (St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws afford so much) and it may be <hi>Thanes</hi>; although with them
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:49639:97"/>
they had the name of <hi>Greeues</hi> or <hi>Graves,</hi> suiting well with <hi>Elders, Hanes,</hi> or <hi>Senators.</hi> With which we may compare the Phrase of <hi>Seniores,</hi> which we read so oft in <hi>Gildas, Nennius, Monmouth,</hi> and others of the British and first Saxons times in <hi>Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should be tedious in but glancing over the Acts of Parliament in <hi>Edgar</hi>'s time. That of the <hi>Standard</hi> at <hi>Winchester</hi> is considerable; and that of one Coyn through all the Kingdom. The <hi>Mirrour</hi> is plain in making it an Act of Parliament, in Saxon times, That no King of this Realm, should <hi>change his Money, or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base, or enhanse it, or make other but of silver, Sans l' assent de tout ses Counties.</hi> Which the Translator is bold to turn, <hi>Without the Assent of the Lords and all the Commons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may not omit the Act against unjust Judges, or Complaints to the King, except Justice could not be had at home. For which also, the <hi>Hundred-Courts</hi> were again confirmed, and the <hi>Grand Folkmootes,</hi> or <hi>Sheriffs Turnes,</hi> established by Act of Parliament. Of which and of their relation to Peace and War, more in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s Laws; which may afford a Comment for the Saxon <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>I must not stay long on the Acts of Parliament which <hi>Angles Kynnes Witena</hi> made and established, <hi>Cum Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae Consiliariis de Monticolis:</hi> Where, among other things, we find it enacted, That <hi>Viri duo denijure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulti, Angli sex, Wallique totidem, Anglis ac Wallis jus dicunto.</hi> With which we might compare our Laws, <hi>de Medietate Linguae,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Proofs of Parliaments in <hi>Canutes</hi> time, are so many, and so full, that they tire us altogether. How he confirmed the Laws of <hi>Ethelred</hi> and other Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, we read in the Monk of <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth also his remarkable Letter from <hi>Rome,</hi> directed to the <hi>Archbishops, Bishops,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Primatibus, &amp; Toti Genti Anglorum, tam Nobilibus quam Plebeis.</hi> As also his Charter to <hi>Glastonbury: Cum Concilio &amp; Decreto Archipresulis Edelnothi, simulque Cunctorum Dei Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotum, &amp; Consensu Optimatum.

            <p>And the very name of Parliament, is found of his time, in the old book of <hi>Edmunds-bury: Rex Canutus anno Regni quinto,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Cunctos Regni sui Praelatos, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceresque, ac Magnates, ad suum convocans Parliamentum.</hi> And again, <hi>In suo Publico Parliamento.</hi> And that it was indeed a <hi>full Parliament,</hi> we may believe from the persons we find there at the Charter of that Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, confirmed by <hi>Hardi-Canute</hi>; but granted by <hi>Canute, in suo Publico Parliamento, praesistentibus perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naliter in eodem Archiepiscop.

            </p>
            <p>It would be tedious and superfluous, to cite the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors that assert, he did confirm King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Laws in full <hi>Parliament.</hi> For which we might produce some better, or at least much older, than good <hi>Bale,</hi> or <hi>Grafton.</hi>

            <p>Again, in those Statutes, <hi>The King must live upon his own Feormians</hi> (or <hi>Farms</hi>; which in Saxon, <hi>afford all needful for man:</hi>) <hi>and none may be compelled to give him any Maintenance: That the Folk be not burthened.</hi> It is the 67th Chapter.</p>
            <p>Loss of Dower or Joynture to Widows marrying within twelve months, might seem hard; but so long she need not pay any <hi>Heriot.</hi> And the same Laws free the Wife from her Husbands <hi>Theft,</hi> although found with her; except it be lockt in her <hi>Hord, Chest</hi> or <hi>Tyge, (Dispensae, arctae, &amp; Serinii)</hi> Of which that Law giveth her leave to keep the <hi>Keys.</hi> But <hi>Ina's</hi> Laws are hard, concerning Children.</p>

            <p>One thing more I may observe; through all these and other old Laws, there is still so much <hi>Religion</hi> and plain-hearted Simplicity, with Piety, expressed, that it shews our Ancestors had not yet learned to be ashamed of <hi>their God,</hi> or of looking towards <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have been the longer in these, that so I may be
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:49639:102"/>
the more brief in those that follow: for by this time I am come to the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> as he is called; and I should mispend my own time, and abuse others, in vouching all the Demonstrations of Parliaments in his time.</p>
            <p>His Charters to <hi>Westminster</hi> are near enough, and may be known of all: wherein he confesseth his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions for going to <hi>Rome.</hi> But, <hi>Optimates, Communi habito Concilio, rogabant me, ut ab intentione desisterem,</hi> his Vows made him more pressing, than else he should have been. But these also his Parliament undertook to satisfie; <hi>Et tandem, utrisque placuit</hi> (so he speaks) <hi>ut mitterentur Legati,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>While these stayed at <hi>Rome,</hi> procuring his Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, a Vision to a Monk commandeth repairing (or refounding) of St. <hi>Peters Westminster,</hi> as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk. (I cannot omit a passage in one of the Popes Letters of that time, telling the King, <hi>That he must expect great Motions and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for the World was near its great Change; and the Kingdom</hi> (which he calls, <hi>Sanctorum Regnum</hi>) <hi>fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Scripture, was coming to begin, and never should have an end.</hi>)</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> refers it to the Parliament; and at length, <hi>Cum totius Regni Electione,</hi> (they are his own words) he sets upon the decayed Minster: Which he rebuilt, (with the <hi>Tenth</hi> of his whole Estate) and

            <p>That of <hi>Out-Laws</hi> should be explained.

               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:49639:103"/>Of the Kings Duty and <hi>Oath,</hi> we must speak more in due time. Of his <hi>Pardon,</hi> before, as it might stand with the <hi>Oath of his Crown.</hi> Here also we find, that when his Pardoning Power was largest, yet it could not reach to <hi>Murder</hi> or <hi>Treason,</hi> or other Crimes, but so as they must <hi>abjure:</hi> and if they stay and be found, any might do <hi>Iustice</hi> on them, without <hi>Iudgment.</hi> It is the 19th Chapter.</p>
            <p>Somewhat we said of <hi>Degrees,</hi> or <hi>Counts, Earls, Thanes,</hi> or <hi>Barons.</hi> The Phrase doth here occur; but of elder times by much, nay, long before King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelbert</hi>'s Barons: if we may believe Historians.

This Law may fill up <hi>Lipsius</hi> on his <hi>Tacitus:</hi> nor is it useless for the <hi>Militia. Hac de causâ, totius ille conventus dicitur Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentac, eo quod per Armorum (i. e. Weapun) tactum, ad vincem confoederati sunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an old Comment on that, <hi>de moribus Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manorum</hi>; that may help and please in all, of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, Wapentakes, Cities, Counties,</hi> with <hi>Counts</hi> or <hi>Eol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> of which before, in State and Church. But to these of the Church, I did not then adde their Power and Custom of <hi>healing the Sick,</hi> by anoynting them. For which, the Saxon Canons of <hi>Aelfrick,</hi> may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter of <hi>Greeves,</hi> with the Appendix <hi>de Heretochiis,</hi> we may see the whole Model of the <hi>old Militia</hi>; with the Power of Headboroughs, Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Bayliffs, Aldermen, Sheriffs, Lieutenants, or Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, all the Greeves both in the <hi>Gree</hi> and <hi>Vae, Peace</hi> and <hi>War:</hi> for so the Law is pleased to criticize; and for <hi>Peace</hi> we do <hi>agree.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law is in print, and may be read of all; in which it is so clearly stated and asserted by these Laws. I should do wrong to take them in pieces.</p>
            <p>Not onely in matters of common Justice, or serving of <hi>Writs,</hi> or petty Cases of Peace, as some have pleased to express it; but <hi>when any unexpected doubtful mischief ariseth against the Kingdoms (or against the Crown)</hi>
               <pb n="193" facs="tcp:49639:104"/>
Nay, when it proceedeth so far as to War, Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, or pitched Fields, the <hi>Heretoches</hi> must or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the War; <hi>Ordinabant acies, &amp; alas constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ebans, Prout decuit, &amp; prout eis melius visum est, ad honorem Coronae, &amp; ad Vtilitatem Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And lest yet there might be any mistake, the same Law telleth us, That those <hi>Heretoches, (ductores exercitus, capitales Constabularii, vel Mareshalli exercitus)</hi> were and still ought to be, chosen <hi>Per Commune Concilium</hi> (by Common Council;) <hi>and for the common good and profit of the Kingdom, even as the Sheriffs</hi> (saith that Law) <hi>ought to be chosen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, the former Laws are renewed for those that <hi>flie,</hi> and those that <hi>die</hi> in the War, and of their <hi>Heriots</hi>; which here are again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, with all <hi>Relief.</hi> Of which, before.</p>
            <p>I am the longer in this, because it was this very Chapter which has been so strangely cited; and that also from a place as much suspected, as any of all these Laws: which I do <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot speak as if I thought they might not be strongly asserted; even there where the oldest Copies are defective. And for one instance, of many, I might produce that piece about the <hi>Kings Oath</hi>; which is clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not onely by the <hi>Mirrour,</hi> and divers others, but by another passage in the oldest of these ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:49639:105"/>
Laws themselves; by comparing it with what is there said of <hi>King</hi> Edward<hi>'s own Oath</hi> to his Kingdom. Of which, much more hereafter, on occasion.</p>
            <p>To that of King <hi>Arthur</hi>'s, King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s, and King <hi>Ethelstane</hi>'s Conquests, much might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; in special, touching <hi>Scotland:</hi> Of which, before. And now I adde, That what is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to <hi>Eleutherius,</hi> may be much asserted and enlarged from those that have clearly stated the bounds, extent, and jurisdiction of the <hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Diocess</hi> of <hi>York:</hi> for to it belonged (as I find in a very good Author) all the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> long before it was divided into modern Bishopricks.</p>
            <p>That of <hi>Norway,</hi> and their Affinities with <hi>England,</hi> and Oath of Fealty, may now be little worth; but in this that is added at the close of that Law, <hi>So did King</hi> Edward <hi>establish: Per Commune Concilium totius Regni: By the Common Council of the whole Kingdom,</hi> or by Parliament: which may well be added to each and every of those Statutes.</p>
            <p>How the <hi>Militia</hi> was (on particular persons or places) assessed by <hi>Common Assent,</hi> hath been observed and cleared already. I shall now only adde this, That when such Assessments were made
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:49639:105"/>
by <hi>Common Council,</hi> it was then no more in the Kings power to <hi>release</hi> them, than it was to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> them before, or without such <hi>Common As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this, might be cited in more than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Charters, to religious houses, and places of greatest Franchise; in which there is such an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual exception to the <hi>Trined-necessity,</hi> of <hi>Military Expedition; Castle</hi> (or <hi>Burgbote</hi>) and <hi>Bricqbote:</hi> for here also, as with the <hi>Romans,</hi> they were espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially <hi>Pontifices.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And where-ever these are found released, as to <hi>Peterburg, Canterbury, Westminster,</hi> but especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to <hi>Glassenbury,</hi> the first and oldest Church in <hi>Britain: Fons &amp; origo, totius religionis.</hi> It may be a clear Demonstration of the Parliaments as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to such a Charter.</p>
            <p>For otherwise they could not be dispensed with by the King, as we may find expressed in divers Charters; as in those of <hi>Crowland:</hi> which yet had great immunities. And of that Restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> may afford us the true rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, because <hi>those three were setled for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Propter Publicam Regni Vtilitatem, ut per ea resisterent hostium in cursibus.</hi> And K. <hi>William</hi>'s Laws, <hi>Castel. &amp; Burg. &amp; Civit. fundatae &amp; aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatae ad tuit. Gent. &amp; Popul. Regni, &amp; ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fens.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:49639:106"/>
Regni &amp; idcirco observari debent <unclear>cum omni</unclear> libertate, integritate &amp; Ratione.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Private Castles for habitation, may be given in <hi>Dower,</hi> and divided by <hi>Pacerners</hi>; but so may none for <hi>publick defence.</hi> Yet of such also, may a man be Tenant by the <hi>Curtesie,</hi> being able to guard them for Publick service of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
            <p>One grand Objection must be removed; but we need not fear it: for it will flie or run away of it self. 'Tis that of the <hi>Conquest,</hi> as many are pleased to call it; not attending how little in this they be the Kings Friends: for if this were his onely or his main and best <hi>Title,</hi> there might be found in future ages, some that may come to think it as lawful to conquer him, as it was or could be, to conquer them.</p>
            <p>It must be considered: for if the foundation be not sure and low, the higher the building is, the nearer its fall. And it hath been observed, that the higher <hi>Skale</hi> (got up by accident) is more ready to pop down again, than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore while it hung in due poize.</p>
            <p>It seemeth a great weakness, to be apt or prone to <hi>Suspition:</hi> and therefore I shall not say I do suspect some that are most zealous for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, or the Title of Conquest, to be least
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:49639:106"/>
acquainted with the Laws or Histories of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But I cannot be wholly free from won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that any Lawyer or Historian that was friend to the King, should be passionate in these, which were so clearly quitted by that King whom they call the Conquerour.</p>
            <p>He stood on Stilts or Patents, or Pantofles; but on plain English ground, with two feet, as other men. The <hi>left</hi> and the weakest was <hi>Succession</hi> to <hi>Edward,</hi> whose Kinsman he was, and Heir by Will; as appeareth by divers Passages in these very Laws of Saint <hi>Edward,</hi> and <hi>William</hi>; which may be seen and read of all.</p>
            <p>But the right Leg, with the strongest and best Foot he had to stand upon, was the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Assent,</hi> Consent, Acceptance, and <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>; which we shall yet more fully clear, when we discuss the Right of <hi>Succession</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection</hi> to this Crown and Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But for the present, it may suffice to observe, That all these Laws we now have of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>'s, come to us through the Hands, and Grant, and Confirmation of King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman</hi>; and no otherwise.</p>
            <p>Which I need not prove to any that have either read or seen the Laws themselves, of which we speak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:49639:107"/>For in the very Title and Preface thereof (besides divers other passages in them) all this, and much more, is fully related and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
            <p>For it is there also further added, That all those Laws were so presented to the said King <hi>William,</hi> by a sworn <hi>Iury</hi> out of every Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: Who did also assert, That these which they did present as the Laws of St. <hi>Edward,</hi> were the undoubted Laws and Customs of the Kingdom, that had also been collected into a Body by King <hi>Edgar,</hi> and continued (though <hi>sopite</hi>) through the Troubles of succeeding Kings, till <hi>Edward</hi> had the leisure to renew or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what was the Law before.</p>
            <p>Nay, when among all those Laws King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> did most encline to those which came from <hi>Norway</hi> (whence his Ancestors and Lords had issued forth, and where a Bastard might inherit) all the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> of <hi>England, Compatriotae Regni, qui Leges edixerant,</hi> did so move and press him (with such Arguments as may again be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) that at length in Parliament, <hi>Concilio habito, precatis Baronum</hi>; the King himself con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented as they did desire. This is expressed in his own Laws.</p>
            <p>And by his own desire, the Archbishop of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:49639:107"/>
               <hi>Canterbury</hi> was one of those entrusted with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolling or recording of those Laws: Which to that very King, and to his Successors to this very day, became one special Clause of the <hi>Coronation-Oath:</hi> Which was, <hi>To confirm all the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom; but especially the Laws of St.</hi> Edward, <hi>called the Confessor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one of King <hi>William</hi>'s own Laws is, That all men observe and keep the Laws of King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in all things: <hi>Adauctis his quas constitui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, ad Vtilitatem Anglorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this be not yet clear enough for the Laws themselves (which are now extant, and may be read and known of all) we might confirm it much by <hi>Ingulph,</hi> living at the same time, and bringing those Laws with his own hands from <hi>London</hi> to his <hi>Crowland,</hi> with such an Endorsement or Title of his own making: <hi>Leges aequissimi Regis Edwardi, quas Dominus meus inclitus Rex Willielmus Autenticas esse, &amp; perpetuas, per totum Regnum Angliae, inviolabiliterque tenendas, sub poenis gravissimis Proclamarat: &amp; suis Iustitiis commendarat, &amp;c.</hi> He was like enough to know it.</p>
            <p>And the old <hi>Book of Litchfield,</hi> cited in the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:49639:108"/>
great Reports (besides that of the <hi>Iury</hi> from every <hi>County</hi>) addeth also, That the same King <hi>William</hi> did by the Counsel of his Barons, call by Writ of Summons <hi>(Summoniri fecit) all the Nobles, Wise-men, (Elders of the Witan) and learned Lawyers in each County.</hi> And in that great Parliament, <hi>Ad Preces Communitatis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum, Rex acquievit, &amp;c.</hi> confirming all by Common Council. This of <hi>Litchsield</hi> is now printed in several places; and <hi>Roger Hoveden</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth in <hi>Henry the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did he onely confirm, but in some things <hi>mitigate</hi>; and in divers, explain and clear what might seem obscure or heavy to the People: <hi>(Ad Vtilitatem Anglorum.)</hi> His Laws are now printed, both with Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Eadmerus,</hi> and with Mr. <hi>Wheelock</hi>'s Impression of the Saxon Laws and History; with a very good Preface of Sir <hi>Roger Twisden.</hi> They do oblige us much, that love and clear our Laws, so far as just and good.</p>
            <p>What Emendations and Additions King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> made to St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws in this also of the <hi>Militia,</hi> we have observed before, at our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected enterance on this Question. Which
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:49639:108"/>
was not at all intended, to be once, so much as touched, but in one Parenthesis: Which was past Recovery, before this Discourse was so much as designed.</p>
            <p>But now having wandred so much, and so far, (beyond my own purpose, as well as my Subject,) I could almost, be perswaded, to step a little further; and to touch (I must no more,) upon some few passages; between the Conquest, as they call it; and the <hi>Barons of Wars</hi>: Or the time of the <hi>great Charter.</hi> For, since that time, the Rolls and Printed Acts, are every where; much larger, and much better, than my little reading or my leasure, can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them.</p>
            <p>Two words have sound of horror, to the People; who are taught, to think them both, oppressions, and the sins of him they call the <hi>Conqueror. Dane-geld</hi>; and the Book of <hi>Dooms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</hi> (Some have added <hi>Curfeu,</hi> with I know not what, to make poor Children <hi>quake.</hi>)</p>
            <p>These, have been proved, to be long before, the <hi>Normans</hi> coming in. To that of <hi>Dane-geld</hi>; I may add, that good King <hi>Edward,</hi> did also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, to his Coffers; (when the <hi>Danish</hi> Storm was over;) till he saw, the Devil dance upon it: As the <hi>Crouland</hi> Abbot doth Record. But
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:49639:109"/>
it did rise, from one, to three, to four, to six shillings on the Hide; but so, by Parliament: as may be much collected from the 11th Chap. of King <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws; compared with <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester, Hoveden, Huntingdon, Math. Paris,</hi> and <hi>Math.</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> besides some others, which we must produce e're long.</p>
            <p>And (to say nothing of <hi>eleemosyne pro Aratris</hi>; of which <hi>Canute</hi> and <hi>Ethelred</hi>:) it is clear, in King <hi>Ethelstanes</hi> Laws; that single <hi>Hides</hi> (or <hi>Ploughlands</hi>) in <hi>England,</hi> were to maintain two <hi>Horsemen,</hi> with <hi>Arms</hi>; by Act of Parliament. (And this was more it seems, than ever was King <hi>Williams Hydage</hi>; or <hi>Dane-geld.</hi>) Which may be added to King <hi>Ethelstanes Militia,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, his Doom book; (for all Judgments in one <hi>Form</hi>; of which his Laws speak,) to what is said, of <hi>Booca Doom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to King <hi>Williams Doomsday,</hi> I shall now, add, (to what before,) that besides the <hi>Mirror,</hi> and <hi>Fitz-Herberts, N. B.</hi> with the old Abbot of <hi>Crouland.</hi> There is enough, in every seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Roll, to make one know, it was a <hi>Review</hi>; and little but a Review of what was done before. They do abuse us else, that bid us read, the <hi>T. E. R.</hi> in all that Roll, <hi>Tempore Edwardi Regis</hi>; plain enough, sometimes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Divination.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:49639:109"/>That it was, also confirmed by Parliament; may be clear enough from the many exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>a servitio Regis,</hi> and a <hi>Vice-comit.</hi> Nay to some inferiour places; as <hi>Ely</hi> and <hi>Worcester</hi>: Besides old <hi>Crowland</hi>: which was not exempted from such service, till the latter <hi>Saxon,</hi> or first <hi>Normans</hi> time; though <hi>Ingulph</hi> spake of divers <hi>Ethelreds.</hi> But the same Abbot, will tell us, that this <hi>Doom Book,</hi> was now, also made; <hi>jux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Taxatorum fidem, qui Electi de qualibet Patria,</hi> &amp;c. And that his <hi>Taxors</hi> were both <hi>kind and merciful; non ad verum pretium, nec ad verum spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So preventing future Burthens and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions.

            <p>Nor was <hi>Ingulph</hi>'s favour at the Court, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether useless; for, by that, we come to know, that our <hi>Norman</hi> King, even in little things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a <hi>Great Councel.</hi> So, that our Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots Charters, must be viewed by Parliment. <hi>Coram Domino meo Rege, ac universo Concilio,</hi> &amp;c.

               <hi>Tilburiensis</hi> telleth us, that <hi>Mony</hi> was paid, to the Crown, by Cities, and Castles, that used no Tillage: But from the Land (or Farms,) only <hi>Victuals,</hi> till <hi>Henry</hi> the first. And when the Kings foreign Wars, did make him press for ready Mony, the people murmured; offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Plowshares. <hi>Horum igitur Querelis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinatus Rex,</hi> by advice of his Great council, (<hi>definito magnatum Concilio</hi>; he sent out discreet, prudent men; that upon view of all the Lands, should assesse the sums, which the Sheriffs were to pay into the Exchequer. This <hi>Gervase</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a while after King <hi>William.</hi>

               <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester,</hi> near his Reign, he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, of a Great Councel, at <hi>Winchester.</hi> And again, of another, at a place called <hi>Pedred</hi>; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the King, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Earls, but also, <hi>primatibus totius Angliae,</hi> a full Parliament; for which, <hi>Florilegius,</hi> and <hi>Walsingham, Newstria,</hi> may be considered, with <hi>Hoveden,</hi> following <hi>Wigornens.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:49639:110"/>That in his Reign there was an <hi>High Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of England,</hi> (ceasing in <hi>Henry the Eight</hi>; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Parliament Rolls of <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth: (but <hi>Alfigar</hi> in the Book of <hi>Ely,</hi> was such; in St. <hi>Edwards</hi> time,) and to Him, some ascribe, the Constable of <hi>Dover</hi>: with the <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and Priviledge of the <hi>Cinque Ports</hi> (with their <hi>Hamlets,</hi> or Circuit; including <hi>Rye,</hi> and <hi>Winchelsey.</hi>) But all this speaketh Parliament, as doth also, his <hi>New Church Priviledge: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muni Concilio Archiep. Episcop. Abbat. &amp; omnium Principum Regni mei.</hi> Yet to be seen, not only at Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> Jewel House, but among the Rolls with King <hi>Richards</hi> Charters, for the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This exemption of the <hi>Church</hi> from <hi>Seculars,</hi> &amp;c. is the more considerable, because it came up with the <hi>Norman</hi> King; at the time of <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debrand,</hi> whose Letters missive came hither, <hi>ad Willielmi Regis Concilium.</hi> And that this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, was a full Parliament; appeareth, by the Charters (as I may call them;) of the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York, ex praecepto Papae Gregorii</hi> 7. and <hi>Confirmatione Domini Willielmi Regis, sub Testimonio Universalis Anglorum Concilii,</hi> &amp;c. Of which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Hoveden</hi> is clear, telling us also, that this King summoned, the Arch Bishops, Bishops,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:49639:111"/>
Abbots, Counts, Barons, Vice Comit. <hi>cum suis Militibus,</hi> were these <hi>Knights of Shires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I may add (from the Continuer, of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronology;) that <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> came hither from <hi>Caen,</hi> (on the Kings call, and the Popes Command,) <hi>&amp; primatum Regni Anglorum in Ecclesia Cant. suscepit; eligentibus eum Senioribus, cum Episcopis, &amp; principibus, clero, &amp; Populo Angliae, in curia Regis,</hi> a very clear and full Parliament. Nor may I so wrong our Common Law, as to detain that antient Record, which the great Judg in his Reports citeth; of a <hi>Writ of Right,</hi> brought by this <hi>Lanfranc</hi> (against <hi>Odo Bishop of Bajeux</hi>;) and removed by a <hi>Toll,</hi> into the <hi>County Court,</hi> where the King commanded all the good Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, to attend the County; <hi>&amp; a toto Comitatu, Recordatum atque judicatum est; That as the King held his Lands, in His Demesn; (in Dominio suo;) so was the Arch Bishop, to hold his, omnino liberas &amp; quietas in Dominiquo suo</hi>;) which Judgment was afterward confirmed by the King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>cum consensu omnium principum suo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With which Record, I may compare the old Manuscrips in <hi>Bennets Coll. Cambridge</hi>; telling us, <hi>of a great Moot (magnum placitum) in loco qui dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Pinenden; in quo Lanfrancus diratiocinatur,</hi> and
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:49639:111"/>
the conclusion, that he was to hold his Lands, and Customs, by <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi>; as free, as the King held his: ezcept in <hi>three things; si regalis via fuerit effossa; arbor incisa juxta, super eam ceci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derit, si homicidium factum &amp; sanguis in ea fusus fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; Regi dabit, alioquin liber a Regis exacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the same Author, were read, of a <hi>Great Counsel</hi> at <hi>London</hi>; in that <hi>Normans</hi> Reign, and of another at <hi>Glocester</hi>; where the Arch Bishop of <hi>York, (jubente Rege, et Lanfranco consentiente,) did consecrate William Bishop of Durham</hi>; having no help (<hi>adjunctorium,</hi>) from the <hi>Scottish Bishops, subject to him:</hi> which may be added to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of <hi>Scotland,</hi> belonging to the Province or <hi>Diocesse of York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can I abstain from the next paragraph, in the same Author, how <hi>Lanfranc</hi> did conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate <hi>Donate</hi> (a Monk of <hi>Canterbury</hi>;) <hi>ad Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Dubliniae,</hi> at the Request of the <hi>King, Clergy,</hi> and <hi>people of Ireland. Petente Rege, clero &amp; popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo Hiberniae,</hi> which with divers others, might be one Argument, for the Antiquity of <hi>Irish Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and their dependance on <hi>England,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore King <hi>Henry the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:49639:112"/>For which I might also cite King <hi>Edgars</hi> Charters, <hi>Oswalds</hi> Law; and divers Historians of his times. But the Charters mention <hi>Dublin</hi> it self; and yet our Lawyers, are so Courteous as to free <hi>Ireland</hi> from our Laws and Customs, till towards the end of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and some of them conjecture, <hi>that the Brehon</hi> Law, came in again, and that our Parliament, obliged them not till <hi>Poynings Law in Henry the seventh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to our <hi>Norman</hi> King. I need not beg proofs of Parliaments, in his time; at least not to those, who know the Priviledge of antient <hi>Demesne,</hi> which therefore is free, from sending to Parliaments, and from Knights Charges, and Taxes of Parliament, because it was in the Crowns, not only in King <hi>William,</hi> but before him, in King <hi>Edward</hi>; and the <hi>Rolls of Winchester,</hi> for which, the old Books are very clear, with divers Records, of <hi>Edward the third, and Henry the fourth: besides natura brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> That I say nothing of the old <hi>Tractat. de anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo Dominico,</hi> which is stiled a Statute among our English Statutes.</p>
            <p>And besides all the late Reports, or Records; I find it in the Year Books of <hi>Edward the Third,</hi> that he sued a Writ of Contempt, against the Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> for encroaching on <hi>Edmonds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
               <pb n="217" facs="tcp:49639:112"/>
against express Act of Parliament: By King <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> and by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and all the other Bishops, Counts and Barons of <hi>England.</hi> It is 21 of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Mich.</hi> fol. 60. <hi>Title</hi> 7. <hi>Contempt,</hi> against an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>This might well be one of the reasons, why the great Judge, giveth so much credit, to the old <hi>Modus of Parliament, as it was held in the time of King</hi> Edward the Confessor, which as the antient copy saith, was <hi>by the discreet men of the Kingdom, recited before King</hi> William <hi>the</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, <hi>and by him approved; and in his time used.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have cited it before, and compared it, with <hi>Irish Modus</hi>: which my much honoured friend Mr. <hi>Hackewil,</hi> one of the <hi>Masters of Chancery,</hi> hath under his hand attested; from the <hi>Great Seal and Charter of Henry the fourth,</hi> (which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self hath seen:) reciting a former Charter of King <hi>Henry R. Angliae &amp; Hiberniae conquestor, &amp; Dominus</hi> who sent, the same <hi>Modus</hi> into <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where himself or his Son (<hi>Iohn sans terre</hi>;) had no great work to reduce them, to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of Parliaments: To which they had been long before accustomed, and the Roll
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49639:113"/>
saith, <hi>communi omnium de Hibernia consensu, teneri statuit,</hi> &amp;c. nor doth the division of the <hi>Irish-Shires</hi> seem so lately setled, as some have thought; although I may not dissent from the great Patron of Civill, and Ecclesiastical Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the late <hi>Primate of Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Touching that <hi>Irish Modus,</hi> I have very little to add, to the <hi>fourth part of the great Institutes</hi>: in several places. I shall now, only observe, that both these, old <hi>Modi of Parliaments</hi> do agree; in this Custom of the Kingdom; <hi>that the King should require no Ayd, but in full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and in Writing to be delivered to each in degree Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And both they agree, that <hi>every new, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult case of Peace; and any war emergent, within, or without the Kingdom, (vel Guerre emergat, in Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no vel extra,) ought to be written down, in full Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; and therein to be debated,</hi> which may be considered, by all that will argue the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which also we may add, one clause of the Jewish Laws; of their great <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> to whom, they retain the power of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War</hi>; especially where it is Arbitrary, and not meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>defensive,</hi> in which the Law of nature mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth many Magistrates; and this might with
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:49639:113"/>
ease be confirmed, from the Laws and Customs, of all Civil Kingdoms in all ages. But I must not wander, from our English Laws.</p>
            <p>I had almost forgotten that, which should be well remembred. Although many would perswade us to seek our Laws in the <hi>Custumier,</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi>; it is not only affirmed in the Great <hi>Reports</hi>; but also asserted by <hi>Guil de Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell Alenconien</hi>; (and proved by divers Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;) in his Commentaries, on that <hi>Grand Custumier</hi>; that the <hi>Normans,</hi> had their chief Laws from <hi>Hence.</hi> As had also the <hi>Danes</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the time of <hi>Canute,</hi> for which, we might have more proof, and witness, than the Abbot of <hi>Crowland.</hi> So much even strangers did Love and Honour old English Laws.</p>
            <p>Of King <hi>William the Second,</hi> (Sirnamed <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus</hi>?) I shall speak but little; for I must dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuss his Election, and Coronation Oath; in a fitter place.</p>
            <p>Some footsteps we find of his Parliaments; in divers: <hi>Wigornensis</hi> and <hi>Hoveden</hi> tell us, that when he would have constrained the <hi>Scottish</hi> King; <hi>ut secundum judicium Baronum suorum, in curia sua, Rectitudinem ei faceret; Malcolm</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do it, but in the Confines, or Marches, Where (he could not deny;) but the Kings of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49639:114"/>
               <hi>Scotland, were accustomed, rectitudinem facere regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus Angliae.</hi> But he then said, <hi>it ought to be, by the Iudgement</hi> of the Parliaments of <hi>both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; secundum judicium utriusque Regni prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>;</p>
            <p>And I find the like Record, cited on <hi>Forte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue,</hi> from <hi>Godfrey of Malmsbury.</hi> But <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> also relate, that the same King <hi>Malcolm,</hi> did submit, both to <hi>do Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi>; and to <hi>swear Fealty</hi> to our English King, and <hi>Paris</hi> addetth, a pretty Story of King <hi>Malcolms</hi> overlooking Treason. But again to King <hi>William.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of his Errors in Government, I shall only say, that if <hi>Edom,</hi> did really signified <hi>Red,</hi> as hath been thought; I could believe, that all Historians, speaking of <hi>Adamites,</hi> then oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the People; might allude to the near <hi>affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> between <hi>Edom</hi> and <hi>Rufus,</hi> for <hi>Red.</hi> For, this was his Sirname, of King <hi>William the Second.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the First, is yet alive in his Laws and Charters. Not only in <hi>Wendover,</hi> with other Historians; but among the Rolls, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, yet to be seen, in the Exchequer. They are now in Print, with the Statutes of King <hi>William</hi>; after the <hi>Saxon Laws.</hi> I must but run, and glance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:49639:114"/>His Charter acknowledgeth his Crown, to the Mercy of God, and the Common Councel. <hi>Communi Concilio, &amp; assensu, Baronum Regni Angliae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It confirmeth King <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws, with all those <hi>Emendations</hi> which King <hi>William</hi> added; for the profit of the Kingdom. It forbiddeth all Levies, nay, the <hi>Monetagium Commune</hi>; but what was agreed, and setled in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Reign.</p>
            <p>And the <hi>Test</hi> of that Charter; is, by <hi>Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Barons, Comitatibus, Vice-Comita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, &amp; optimatibus, totius Regni Angliae, apud West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monasterienses, quando Coronatus fui.</hi> This was copied out into every County, and kept in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Abby.</hi> So much also, we find in <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of his Charter to <hi>London,</hi> I may touch, in another place. This I must not omit in his Laws. <hi>Sive agenda proecipiat, levia permittat, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur maxima, vitanda prohibeat,</hi> yet still the Laws must be, <hi>Manifesta, Iusta, Honesta,</hi> &amp; <hi>Possibilis</hi>; a kind of sacred <hi>Tetragram.</hi> It is the 4th.

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:49639:116"/>
punished, that disarmeth any unjustly; and must answer, all the mischief that ensueth such disarming.</p>
            <p>To this Kings time, belongeth the case of <hi>William</hi> the Kings Chamberlain, <hi>de Londonia</hi>: who refused to find a man, for the Army, as his <hi>Tenour</hi> required: But the <hi>Abbot of Abbingdon</hi> (of whom he held;) <hi>in presentia sapientum</hi> (in a <hi>Witen Moot</hi>) <hi>rem ventilari fecit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Unde cum Lege Patriae, decretum processisset, ipsum exortem Terrae, merito deberi fieri,</hi> &amp;c. by Friends, it was compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; and the Tenant enjoyed his Land.</p>
            <p>I find it, from Sir <hi>Robert Cottons</hi> inestimable Treasury, cited by Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> on <hi>Hengham.</hi> Nor can I deny, but this (with divers other cases,) might forfeit the Land. But, as in case of <hi>Alienation of such Tenures</hi>; a Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. provided that the King shall not retain the <hi>Forfeits,</hi> but shall only, take a <hi>Fine Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>; (which the Chancery, must also assess; by due Process:) So, is our Law very tender in all cases of Forfeit. And among the old <hi>Wytes, Wardwyte</hi> was for the <hi>Militia</hi>: being an acquittance of Mercy to him that had not found a man, for the <hi>Servise</hi>; according to his Tenure. Of which old <hi>Fleta,</hi> with others.</p>
            <p>The Laws of this King do evince, the Tryal
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:49639:117"/>
               <hi>per PARES</hi> to be long before, the great Charter. Nor would it be hard, to shew it, before King <hi>Henry,</hi> and besides all other hints, through Elder times; the case is well known, of <hi>Roger Fitz Osborn,</hi> apprehended by <hi>Tiptoft</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Worcestershire</hi>; and condemned for Treason in King <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman; per judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um parium suorum</hi>; Of which antient Historians, before the Commentator on <hi>Magna Charta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I should not omit King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Charter, to the Abbot of <hi>Bee,</hi> confirming his antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms, and Priviledges, prescribed for St. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> time, for <hi>Grand Assizes,</hi> &amp;c. yet to be found in the Book of <hi>Assizes; lib.</hi> 26. <hi>Pl.</hi> 24. and in the 3d. or 8th. part of the great Reports: and in the Comment on <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 11. but here it is from <hi>Ethelred</hi> and <hi>Edward the Confessor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of his Priviledges, was to be free from the Justies of <hi>either Bench,</hi> and of <hi>Assize.</hi> Which is one of the first Records, for the antient <hi>Benches.</hi> But it may not be impossible to trace them, thorow some Elder times.</p>
            <p>For the Saxon Law, (so often repeated, and confirmed) that none should <hi>complain to the King but want of Right</hi>; or against <hi>summum jus,</hi> at <hi>Home,</hi> might in modern Language be translated Thus. The <hi>Writ of Right,</hi> must abide the <hi>Baron</hi> or Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe:
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:49639:117"/>
(For it cannot fall to a Copyhold Steward:) except the Lords default, or consent, or the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants suit, procure a <hi>Tolt,</hi> to lift it up to the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Court.</hi> Or a <hi>Pone,</hi> place it in the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That such a course was antient, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the <hi>Mirror, Asser,</hi> and others of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred, Edgar, Canute, Ethelred</hi>: and of the <hi>Tolt</hi> before, in King <hi>William.</hi> To which I may add the Writ of <hi>Right</hi> (in the third Book of <hi>Reports</hi>;) brought by <hi>I. de Beverlace,</hi> against <hi>Walter</hi> of <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dastern</hi>; and by a <hi>Tolt</hi> removed from the <hi>Court Baron,</hi> to the <hi>County</hi>; and for default of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> (how it must be falsified, we may touch; (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non) it was concluded, before <hi>Ranulph de Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil,</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Yorkshire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glanvil</hi> is clear enough; for the course of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving to higher Courts; and of the <hi>Writ de Pace,</hi> stepping between the Combat (on the <hi>Writ of Right</hi>) and <hi>Assize, Coram justitiis in Banco sedentibus,</hi> and although this Book (intituled <hi>Glanvil</hi>) was not written, till about <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. yet it is plain enough, that he speaketh of <hi>Antient Custom.</hi> His words are very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>The <hi>grand Assize</hi> (saith he;) <hi>is a Royal benefit, granted by the Parliament; (Clementia principis, de Concilio procerum, populis indultum;)</hi> as being that
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:49639:118"/>
which saved blood, and did oft prevent the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat (on the <hi>Writ of Right</hi>;) and of this he speaketh (in the third of the same Book;) as of a very old and antient Custom. <hi>Secundum jus &amp; consuetudinem Regni antiquam.</hi> A weighty expression, from so antient an Author: which may possibly lead us higher than the <hi>Saxon</hi> times. For, we may find the Duel, or Combat, among the <hi>Gaules</hi> (from <hi>British Druides</hi>:) as among the <hi>Germans</hi> also; whence our Fathers came.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nonnunquam etiam armis de principatu contendunt.</hi> So of the <hi>Gauls</hi> or <hi>British Druids</hi>; He that was like to know it, and of those, and <hi>Germans, Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus,</hi> and <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> before <hi>Aventinus.</hi> Some observe it, in the <hi>Salique Law</hi>; and among the Laws of <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> and that the <hi>Longobards</hi> did bring it into <hi>Italy</hi>; where it was also setled by Law. But of our Ancestors combats, in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place.</p>
            <p>I know not any <hi>Fines</hi> upon Record, till <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> the First. But <hi>Stowels</hi> Case in <hi>Plowden,</hi> may inform us, that they were before the <hi>Norman.</hi> And we need not doubt, the Books of <hi>Edward</hi> the third; speaking of Benches, settled in <hi>Henry</hi> the first, but I do not remember, the phrase of <hi>Capitalis Iusticiarius noster,</hi> till <hi>great Charter</hi>; which repeateth elder Customs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:49639:118"/>
               <hi>Goodwin,</hi> the famous Earl of <hi>Kent,</hi> among the <hi>Saxons,</hi> had two Sons, that (in as good an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor as <hi>Huntington</hi>) are stiled, <hi>Regni Iusticiariis</hi>; (the phrase is common, in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and others, of the times of <hi>Clarendon</hi> Assizes.) And K. <hi>Edgar</hi> had a Cosin <hi>Ailwin</hi>; who was <hi>totius Angliae Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannus</hi>; which is supposed, <hi>Lord Chief Iustice</hi>; by a Learned man; besides the best (though yet imperfect) Glossary. But it might denote the <hi>Lord High Constable</hi>: Of which before, in <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> the first.</p>
            <p>And <hi>William</hi> the 2d. found great <hi>Odo</hi> of <hi>Baieux,</hi> setled L. Ch. Justice of <hi>England. Iusticiarius toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Angliae.</hi> So, <hi>Matth.</hi> of <hi>Westminster.</hi> and <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> calleth him, <hi>Iusticiarius,</hi> and <hi>Princeps</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derator totius Angliae,</hi> in <hi>Wigornensis,</hi> He is <hi>Custos Angliae.</hi> And the phrase of <hi>Iusticiarius,</hi> is also in <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> of <hi>William</hi> the first: <hi>Iusticiarii in Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co Regio,</hi> of after times, as also, <hi>placita de Nova disseissena</hi>; before Justices in <hi>Eyre.</hi> But he speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of <hi>placita lethifera</hi>; the Pleas of Life and Death; (yea, even in Bishops Courts;) about the <hi>Normans</hi> coming in.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Polydore,</hi> we find out 4 <hi>Terms,</hi> (with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other elder Customes) ascribed to the first <hi>Norman.</hi> But that which he addeth, of the place, for these Courts, to be, at the Kings appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:49639:119"/>
might be true: till the Law fixed the <hi>Pleas,</hi> which may be, long before our Charter, of <hi>Henry</hi> 3d. where it is confirmed, not created. But, for the Kings <hi>Bench,</hi> the <hi>Return</hi> was, <hi>coram Nobis ubicunque,</hi> &amp;c. and for the <hi>Pleas, coram Iusticiariis nostris apud Westmon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which <hi>Virgil</hi> addeth of the <hi>Iudges in West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster; and of those higher beyond appeal</hi>; and <hi>of Iustices of Peace,</hi> setled by the <hi>Conqueror</hi>; (as he saith <hi>Sheriffs</hi> were,) in every <hi>County</hi>: may be more considered. For it may be, as much too late, as, some have thought it, too early.</p>
            <p>They which presume to make K. <hi>Henries</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the first <hi>Standard</hi> of <hi>Winchester;</hi> must refute the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; (of which before:) For, those may seem to deserve, as much credit as <hi>Malmsbury,</hi> other marks.</p>
            <p>That he did confirm the <hi>Curtesie d' Angletterre</hi> I may yeild to the <hi>Mirror,</hi> and other Authors: but not that he first began it. For the Statute of <hi>Kentish</hi> Customs; and those that treat of Gavel-kind, may shew us an Older <hi>Tenure by Curtesie</hi>; there also, where the Tenant had no Issue.</p>
            <p>And this may teach us, whence the like Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom came into <hi>Ireland</hi>; as also to be, <hi>Curialitas Scotiae</hi>; which our master seemeth to forget, when he saith <hi>Que ne'st use en auter Realm, forsque
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:49639:119"/>
tant solement en Engleterre.</hi> But his Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he lyeth in this; and in divers other things.</p>
            <p>In case <hi>Entails,</hi> this English <hi>Curtesie</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: in which the Book of Cases have great diversity. But those that perswade us, there was no Land in <hi>Tayles</hi> before the 2d. of <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> the first; (which are all, that subscribe to <hi>Littleton</hi>;) must interpret the Laws of King <hi>Alfred,</hi> much otherwise than I can do. For the 37th. Chap. of his Laws, is to me, much clearer, for Lands Entail'd; then is all the Statute, <hi>de Donis Conditionalibus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One Case of the <hi>Courtesie</hi>; may be considered, for the <hi>Militia.</hi> If Land <hi>in Capite</hi> descend to a Woman; who upon Office found, intrudeth (on the King;) and taketh an Husband; and by him, hath Issue; and then dieth: yet cannot the King eject or detain the man; but he shall be <hi>Tenant by the Kingdoms Curtesie</hi>; although he came in, upon <hi>Intrusion.</hi> Which seemeth to hint, that Our Law, did chiefly intend, the Kingdoms good defence, and service, (which might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by such an intruder:) rather than the Kings pleasure; or his bare Prerogative, in this, which is thought, so great a Prerogative, <hi>of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure in Capite.</hi> For which the Comments on <hi>Magna Charta.</hi> and the Statute of <hi>Prerogative</hi>;
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:49639:120"/>
with <hi>Littletons Dower,</hi> and <hi>Curtesie</hi>; are clear enough.</p>
            <p>To <hi>Henry</hi> the first, they also ascribe the <hi>Curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie</hi>; of saving the <hi>wreck,</hi> from his <hi>Exchequer</hi>; if there were, so much as a <hi>Cat,</hi> or a breathing Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture let in the Ship. I do not deny him, to be so courteous as to confirm, some such Sea-Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom; (for which, he had a very sad Occasion; when his Sons and Daughter, with so many Friends were drown'd in one Shipwrack.) But, as <hi>Richard,</hi> soon after him, seemeth more courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in this also, (if we may believe <hi>Hoveden</hi>:) So I doubt not, to assert it, to higher and elder Times. And yet the Law <hi>Maritime,</hi> is dark enough: with all the jurisdiction of the Court <hi>Admiral.</hi> Whose office, may be harder, than the Name: A strange mixture of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Arabick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The old <hi>MS. del' Office del' Admiral</hi>; hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Records of <hi>H.</hi> 1. <hi>R.</hi> 1. and K. <hi>Iohn</hi>: Speaking of <hi>Tryals</hi> by 12. (as at Common Law;) but now the practise is much otherwise. In the Rolls of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. the Name of <hi>Admiral</hi>: but not in our Printed Laws, that I know, till <hi>Edw.</hi> 2d. And in <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. the Rolls are full of that Office, parted among divers: for the North and South Seas, &amp;c. As was touched before, in <hi>Edgar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. it was brought to a weldy
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:49639:120"/>
model: being <hi>uncertain</hi> rather than <hi>infinite</hi> before. For the bounds were ever straiter much, than some may imagine. They were again disputed in <hi>Henry the</hi> 4<hi>th. Eliz.</hi> and <hi>Iames.</hi> It lies more open to the Common Law, than to the Wind and to a Premunire, (some are apt to think;) much more, then all are aware. I may touch it again in a fitter place.</p>
            <p>Here I shall only add, that besides the Laws of <hi>Arthur</hi> the <hi>Brittain,</hi> and <hi>Edgar</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi>; we have some Records (for so I may call them,) of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms by Sea; as well as by Land. With Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to some, below the King; before the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; whom they make the Founder, (yet he was but Patron,) of the Ports; and <hi>Wardens</hi> for the Sea. Somewhat of this in <hi>Lanfranc's</hi> Case before: and more again ere long.</p>
            <p>Historians are clear and full of this King's Parliaments; and of his <hi>Summons</hi> to Parliament. <hi>Majores natu Angliae Londoniae Congregavit.</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>principes omnes &amp; totius Regni Nobilitatem san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione adnotavit</hi>: so the Monk of <hi>Worcester,</hi> and <hi>Hoveden</hi> (almost in the same words,) which <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> expresseth thus; <hi>magnatibus regni Edicto Convocatis.</hi> And in <hi>Walsinghams Neustria; Majoribus regni</hi>; and <hi>Principibus Convocatis, Virgil</hi> himself confesseth his full Parliaments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:49639:121"/>And of a <hi>Convocation House,</hi> distinct from the Parliament, sitting at the same time; they are plain enough. <hi>Et cum rege principes regni omnes, tam Eccles. quam Secular apud Westmon. ubi etiam An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selm. Cantuar. Archiep. magnum tenuit Consilium; de his quae ad Christianitatem pertinent.</hi> as <hi>Florence,</hi> and <hi>Hoveden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> is also clear in such a distinction; <hi>Rex tenuit Concilium apud Londoniam; &amp; Williel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Archiep. Cantuariensis, similiter in eodam villa, apud Westmon.</hi> and this Author useth to stile, the Parliament, <hi>magnum placitum,</hi> (of which before;) and the <hi>Convocation House, Concilium,</hi> or <hi>Synodus</hi>; which yet in him, in all, was confirmed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; or else invalid.</p>
            <p>In Parliament were also decided, the Great Contests between <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi>; not only concerning the Crown, or Act of Coronation: in which (to this King,) they both joyned; as we find in <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> and <hi>Walsingham.</hi> But the Parliament declared, that it did not at all belong to <hi>York</hi>: as besides <hi>Hoveden,</hi> we read in him, that continueth <hi>Florence</hi> of <hi>Worcester.</hi> But in <hi>Beckets</hi> absence, it did fall to <hi>York</hi>: and so it had been before. So also <hi>Canterburies</hi> contest with the King was debated in full Parliament, three days together, in the Arch Bishops absence: and at
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:49639:121"/>
length composed, with the consent rather than content of both parties.</p>
            <p>The King was resolute for investiture as he found it from his Father and Brother: the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy was pertinacious, for the Popes Decrees. But the Emperour (Son in Law, to our King;) did so muzzle Pope <hi>Paschal;</hi> that he Consents and Decrees, that none should be Consecrate, but whom the <hi>King Invested,</hi> as the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple chose him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seemeth considerable, how all Historians (of that time and dispute,) do Record, the choice of Bishops, to be in the <hi>People</hi>: in <hi>Phebe</hi> and in <hi>Populo,</hi> as well as in <hi>Clero.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They mention <hi>Radulph,</hi> ordained a Bishop for the <hi>Orcades</hi>: but rejected by all, because not Elected by Common assent of the People; <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, Clero, Principis,</hi> 'tis every where in the old Monks; and how the poor Bishop, wandred up and down, as an assistant, to other Prelates. Of him and of English Right in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; much might be added, from the Notes of <hi>Eadmerus</hi>; and somewhat of <hi>Lanfrancs</hi> Plea at <hi>Pinenden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at Prince <hi>Roberts</hi> Landing; <hi>commoti sunt principes erga Regem causa Roberti,</hi> &amp;c. But many of the Lords left the Parliament, <hi>(subtrahentes se

de Curia;) sed Episcopi, et milites Gregarii &amp; Angli,</hi> (the Commons) stuck to the King; who was <hi>Provincialibus gratus</hi>: and at length the <hi>Witan</hi> or Parliament, composed the quarrel. <hi>Sapientiores utriusque partis habito consilio, Pacem inter fratres com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posuere.</hi> 'Tis in <hi>Florence</hi> and <hi>Hoveden,</hi> with <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Wendover</hi> with <hi>Huntingdon</hi> Record, how the great Firebrand in that War, <hi>Ranulph</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> was committed by the Parliament: <hi>de Communi Consilio Gentis Anglorum.</hi> This was the great man. whom K. <hi>William,</hi> had made <hi>Pacitator,</hi> in <hi>Matth. Paris</hi>: but <hi>Placitator &amp; exactor totius Regni,</hi> in the Monk of <hi>Worcester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His continuer addeth also, that the Peace, or League with <hi>France,</hi> in this Kings time; was made by Parliament; <hi>Consilio optimatum</hi>: and that by advice of Common Council, the Custody and Constableship of the Castle of <hi>Ros</hi> or <hi>Roch</hi> (with its Ford, &amp;c.) were setled in the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, and Church of <hi>Canterbury</hi>: with leave to build a <hi>Tower,</hi> and divers other Priviledges, for the <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must not mention the Orders of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Parliaments, against Money <hi>Clippers</hi> and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupters: with such a change of Money, as made things very dear. So dear a time that an Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>load
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:49639:122"/>
of good Wheat, could scarcely be bought under six shillings: as <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Of King <hi>Stephens Election,</hi> more, when I shall discuss, the Right of <hi>Succession</hi> to the Crown. But I must not omit that which, of him, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by so many good Authors: That he did prohibit the Laws brought hither from <hi>Rome.</hi> And this also by Parliament: as <hi>Bale</hi> affirmeth. But of this, in much older writers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Frier Bacon</hi> is one, (in his Compendium of Theology, or his <hi>opus minus</hi>: and the great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter citeth it, from <hi>Bacons impedimentum sapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ae.</hi>) He was a very Learned man, and a most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine <hi>Son of Art</hi>; his <hi>Opticks</hi> and his <hi>Burning-glasses,</hi> would be more enquired after; for they may be little worse than those of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> who in this is newly found to go beyond himself.</p>
            <p>Such Glasses must be Conick Section: and in Concaves not exactly <hi>Circular,</hi> but <hi>parabolical,</hi> for which there is as real Demonstration, (by the Law of Reflections;) as for the best per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectives, (by refractions,) in <hi>Ellipses,</hi> and <hi>Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolies</hi>: to which I must not add, that <hi>Mirandum Naturae</hi> of two lines, that approach nearer and nearer, <hi>in infinitum</hi>; yet they still shall be Asymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tots, and never meet, (for such attend <hi>Hyperbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="238" facs="tcp:49639:123"/>Which yet, is more Demonstrable, by <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>; than is that of <hi>Mersennus,</hi> (or others) by <hi>sense</hi>; that Concave Glasses may be placed in such a continued proportion (may I say) of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection</hi>; that by such it may be possible to fire a Ship, (or other matter combustible;) at a far greater distance, than between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Calice.</hi> I say not (as some have said,) <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in this and all the <hi>Mathematicks</hi>; who can add, to him that did contract (and correct) <hi>Longomont,</hi> into a page? Our Country-man, he is: but at too great a distance, in <hi>Breda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I must not wander from K. <hi>Stephen.</hi> His Repeal of Roman Laws, is also in <hi>Sarisburiensis</hi> (living in the time of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d:) an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Credit, and polite enough. It is among his Court trifles (<hi>Polteraticus,</hi> or <hi>de nugis Curialium</hi>).</p>
            <p>Nor is he content to meddle only, with mean Courtiers; but even of the highest, he is plain enough. And one of his Thesis, is, that by Reason and Scripture, it is both Lawful, and a glorious Act, to kill a publick Tyrant. But of his exceptions to the Oath of <hi>Fealty</hi>; we must have more in its Time and Place.</p>
            <p>That of K. <hi>Stephen</hi> is in his 8th. Book, and 22 chap. (near enough to his discourse of Tyrany.) Where we have also an hint of him, that

brought those Laws into this Kingdom. <hi>Theobald</hi> the Arch Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> going to <hi>Rome</hi> for his Pall (some say;) and for this the Monk of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> would be considered; Who hath also Recorded, K. <hi>Stephens</hi> Oath; of which we must speak again. I must not dispute whether those <hi>Italian</hi> Laws, by him prohibited; were the <hi>Civil,</hi> or the <hi>Canon</hi> Laws: which I rather believe. Although I cannot deny, but the Civil also did come in, or intrude upon our English Laws. Nor may I forget a passage of Parliament in that famous Appeal, or charge of Treason, in King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Time.</p>
            <p>The Lawyers especially Civilians, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted, about the charge. They conceived it, not to be rightly moulded, according to the forms of Law. But the great Council resolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and declared, that they would proceed, by no other Law, but the course and <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi> To which they added, that <hi>England</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was, ought or should be Ruled or Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the <hi>Civil Law</hi>: which yet is enough: (some think too much;) in causes <hi>Maritime</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiastick,</hi> that I speak not of any other Courts.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fortescue</hi> (or rather the young Prince in him) telleth us, of some of our Kings, that have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to bring in, the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> and <hi>patrias
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:49639:124"/>
Leges abolere,</hi> but I cannot tell <hi>who,</hi> those were; no more, than the Learned Commentator. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept perhaps, he may reach up, to King <hi>Lucius</hi>; who did desire the <hi>Roman Laws,</hi> (even for the State:) but can we say, the <hi>Civil Laws,</hi> were then <hi>Born</hi>? or at least <hi>Christned,</hi> enough for a Christian King?</p>
            <p>But the reason, why, any King so much esteemed the <hi>Civil Law</hi>; may be rightly guessed; to be this, grand maxim of Tyranny; <hi>Quod prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipi placuit, Legis habet vigorem.</hi> A Sentence of the Civil, Royal or Imperial Laws; citeth indeed, by <hi>Glanvil, Bracton,</hi> and others of our Lawyers: who refuted, rather than allowed it. But in this who can add to Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> late Dissertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on <hi>Fleta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wigornensis,</hi> lived till K. <hi>Stephens</hi> time. In him, or his <hi>Continuer,</hi> we find what Laws these were, &amp; <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>who</hi> did bring them hither. For we are there told, that <hi>Theobald</hi> with other Prelates, had a Summons from the Pope to <hi>Rome</hi>: and there were admitted to a <hi>Council</hi>; such as many ages could not Parallel. For thence, (he saith) they brought those <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>Decrees; quae longe lateque per Angliam jam Conscriptae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He lived not perhaps to know they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited: but he doth intimate, enough, in what
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:49639:124"/>
a cold manner, the Parliament did entertain, the Legate, sent from <hi>Rome.</hi> He was a great <hi>Leveller,</hi> it seemeth: For, he came, to pull down, and to destroy; that so, he might plant, or build, we read it, in the Monks. Who bring, this Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, <hi>Coram Rege &amp; primoribus.</hi> And again, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Commons</hi> also; <hi>Episcopis, Abbatibus, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numera Cleri &amp; Populi multitudine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ere long, we find K. <hi>Stephen</hi> at another Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament; <hi>ad Boum vadum Oxes foord</hi>; or <hi>Oxford.</hi> Where some Lords, or Prelates, are committed, for suspicion of Treason. And by some it is ascribed to the King alone. But in the Monk of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi> we may find it done upon complaint of Those, he calleth <hi>potent Laicks</hi>: and by Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, or perswasion of <hi>Magnates,</hi> and <hi>Proceres Regni.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The thing doth speak it self. For one of the Lords, committed was the great <hi>Roger</hi> of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> (the grand Favorite;) of whom before. His Charge was this, in chief; that without leave of King and Parliament; he had built, and fortified a Castle. But in his <hi>own Devise</hi> (this was the Castles name;) he did ensnare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. The Name and Fate, hath since been found, observed more than once; and yet they write, it was the fairest Castle in all <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> followeth <hi>Huntingdon</hi> and <hi>Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>;
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:49639:125"/>
but in this, they both come short of <hi>Malms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>; well acquainted with that famous <hi>Roger,</hi> whose misgiving heart, was like, to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, what did follow, in that Parliament. But so we might have lost, or mist that Act, which here was made, for the <hi>Militia</hi>: setled clearly in the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>We find it also in the old Continuer of the Monk of <hi>Worcester.</hi> Who living at that time, doth tell us, that in full Parliament, <hi>(habito post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum Concilio, coram primoribus Angliae, statutum est,)</hi> it was Enacted for a Statute, that <hi>All Burghs, Castles, Forts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(in quibus secularia solent exerceri ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotia) should submit to the King &amp; Parliament. Regis</hi> &amp; <hi>Baronum suorum juri cedant.</hi> And by vertue of this Act of Parliament, was the Castle of the <hi>Devise</hi> presently demanded; and at length yeilded: while the great Prelates neck, (or his Sons who had been also Chancellor,) was in the Rope to have prevented his Quartain, of which he died.</p>
            <p>In the same Author we find much, of an <hi>High Constable</hi>; and several men, with that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. One is <hi>Milo:</hi> who did lead the King, in Royal State; <hi>cum honore, Regiam ad Aulam; ubi Cives fidelitatem Iuraverunt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Ere long, we find him charged with Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, (so as is worth considering, for the <hi>Militia</hi>;)
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:49639:125"/>
and his Office conferred, on <hi>Walter de Bello Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po; Wigornensi Vice-comite.</hi> But discontents (that rose before) did now increase. And when the Oath of Fealty, was pressed on some; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, and say, the King may take <hi>their words,</hi> if he please.</p>
            <p>But for a <hi>Bishoprick</hi> the Prelates perswaded a grave man, to swallow the <hi>Oath</hi>: and so he did; on much reluctance. <hi>Maurice,</hi> was his Name; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the people; a <hi>Clero &amp; Populo</hi>: being then presented to the King, by Bishops; Attes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his deserts and due Election.</p>
            <p>Another Bishoprick is conferred on <hi>Philip,</hi> the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi>; but <hi>Consilio Baronum.</hi> And a while before, the Abbot, was made a Bishop, at <hi>London; petente Milone Constabulario, &amp; favore Populi, utriusque Ordinis</hi>; that is, the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>; or rather the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Laity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> we read of <hi>Robert</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Leicester,</hi> about this Time, Elect Bishop of <hi>Lincoln; Rege, Clero, &amp; Populo, summo gaudio annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ente.</hi> And a while after, he shews us the King at <hi>London,</hi> in a full Parliament, disputing the grand question of <hi>Appeals</hi>; with the Romish Legate. For, such <hi>Appeales</hi> (saith he) had not been <hi>used in England,</hi> till <hi>That Henry</hi> of <hi>Winton</hi> the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> had cruelly intruded them. <hi>Malo suo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliter intrusit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:49639:126"/>The Monk of St. <hi>Albans</hi> borroweth from him; and sometimes repayeth, with interests. As in that Statute, for Priviledge of <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards</hi>; with all the <hi>Clergy</hi>; so, that none but the Pope could absolve, from violence done to such, (in which they all agree:) he added also, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Act of the Parliament, that <hi>Plowes</hi> in the Field with Husbandmen should enjoy the same Peace or priviledge; as if they were in a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Geffry de Mandevil,</hi> (<hi>Consul,</hi> or <hi>Comes</hi>;) was a very great man: <hi>de magna villa.</hi> For he speaks, of his <hi>Princeps Militiae</hi>; and of another, that was, his <hi>Magister peditum.</hi> But in <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> we find him, at length, clapt up in <hi>Prison</hi>: but scarcely, <hi>secundum jus Gentium: Rex cepit eum in curia sua; ex necessitate magis, quam ex honestate. Hoveden</hi>; hath of him, the like expressions; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding also, that from a <hi>Baron,</hi> he had been raised, to the degree of a <hi>Consul</hi>; that is an Earl. For in him the <hi>Earl of Flanders,</hi> is <hi>Consul Flandrensis,</hi> and the <hi>Earl of Anjou; Consul Andegavensis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was he that come to be <hi>Hen.</hi> the 2d. who at his Landing, (being <hi>Duke of Normandy</hi>) <hi>coyned money;</hi> which passed here, by the name of the <hi>Dukes coyn.</hi> Nor only he; but <hi>Omnes potentes, tam Episcopi, quam Comites &amp; Barones, suam faciebant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netam.</hi>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:49639:126"/>
(and of this, <hi>Nubrigensis.</hi>) Which may be compared, with the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, of King <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> and others. As K. <hi>Hen. monetag. common.</hi> In the same <hi>Huntingdon,</hi> we also read, that (by the Mediation, of <hi>Theobald</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Winton</hi>;) the King was so reconciled, to this Duke and Earl <hi>Henry</hi>; that they never more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, (also that the Duke, was made, <hi>Iustici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arius Angliae,</hi> next under the King; <hi>&amp; omnia Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni Negotia, per eum terminabantur.</hi>) But in <hi>Polydore,</hi> we find this <hi>Pacification,</hi> made by Parliament: <hi>Cujus Authoritate pactio facta est.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> is so full of <hi>Law Terms,</hi> that I could beleive him, in this, to allude to the Law <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Recoveries.</hi> For at this peace, he telleth, how the Kingdom was again <hi>Recovered.</hi> And (after a disgression to <hi>Merlins Prophesie,</hi> in which the phrase of <hi>Vice-comites,</hi> may be duly conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;) he concludeth, thus a War that had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged 17 years together, was now quieted by such a <hi>Time, hoc fine quievit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which he adds, that famous story of the Souldier, that in this <hi>Vacation</hi> made a Voyage to St. <hi>Patricks Purgatory.</hi> And by that occasion, he relates, the best description of Hell, or Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Torments, that I remember, in any Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian of credit. With which may be compared;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:49639:127"/>
divers others in the same Author. But that which is added, at the Souldier return to the King; may be added also to what is observed before, touching <hi>Irelands</hi> dependance on <hi>England.</hi> For, the same Souldier was again sent, by King <hi>Stephen</hi> into <hi>Ireland</hi>: to be Assistant, as an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to <hi>Gilbert</hi>; who had a grant from hence, to found an Abbey in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Whither he also carried this Souldier, speaking Irish, and with Tears, he would often relate, his Voyage to Hell. Which is so recorded and asserted by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Religious men.</p>
            <p>To K. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s <hi>Militia,</hi> we may also refer that, which so many Historians Record, of his damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Hidage</hi> or <hi>Danegeld</hi>: Which yet was not his Act, but the Parliaments; that did Elect, and create him King. We must discuss it more fully ere long; but now, for <hi>Danegeld,</hi> we may assert it to be expressed, in his very Coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Oath: on which, he was admitted.</p>
            <p>One of the clauses was, that he should, for ever desist from that, which had been paid to some of his Predecessors, <hi>singulis annis.</hi> And <hi>Wendover,</hi> or <hi>Paris</hi> express no more. But in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and <hi>Huntingdon Dane-geld</hi> is expresly specified, which both affirm to be then at 2 s. the Hyde. They agree also, with others; That
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:49639:127"/>
this was again, specified in Parliament, at <hi>Oxford</hi>: Where the King, did again confirm, his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation Oath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matthew of Westminster</hi> doth also Record that of these promises or Oaths, he made a <hi>Charter,</hi> which seemeth to be that Charter, which the great Reporter, in his 8th. part, affirmeth, to be yet found, in an old <hi>MS. de antiquis Legibus.</hi> And that, the said Charter, among divers other things, doth expressely confirm, the Laws of K. <hi>Edward</hi> and of K. <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay the Monk of St. <hi>Albans</hi> affirmeth, that in Parliament, <hi>Congregatis Regni magnatibus,</hi> he did there solemnly promise, to <hi>meliorate the Laws,</hi> or make them better as they should desire, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>juxta voluntatem &amp; Arbitrium singulorum</hi>; which we may consider again upon occasion.</p>
            <p>Nor must I omit, that much of this very Charter, is yet to be read in Print; in an old Monk that lived in King <hi>Stephen</hi> Time; and those particulars, for confirmation of all good Laws; and in special, those of King <hi>Henry</hi>: with divers other things, that are worth perusal. It is in the Monk of <hi>Malmsbury</hi>: but a little after the Letters written to the Pope, about King <hi>Henries</hi> death; confession, absolution and <hi>Anoynting</hi> by the <hi>Elders</hi>; according to what was let to the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:49639:128"/>
Church, by the Apostle St. <hi>Iames</hi>: as in those Letters, is more fully expressed. Which may be added to that, before, of the <hi>Church Elders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polydore</hi> telleth us that in full Parliament at <hi>Oxford</hi>; King <hi>Stephen</hi> did abolish that, which had been oft exacted, for <hi>Hydage per singula juge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi>: and that he <hi>intreated</hi> another Parliament, to carry on that War, which by their Advise and Councel had been undertaken, in the Name of <hi>Common Wealth. Reipublicae Nomine, vestro cum Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio tum Consensu, susceptum est</hi>: and his desire to them was, <hi>so to act in Person; that the People might not be burthened with Taxes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And at his end <hi>Virgil</hi> addeth that, <hi>for all his continual Wars; he did exact, little or no Tribute, from the People.</hi> So that the Parliament it seems, did wholly manage his <hi>Militia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From a long Storm at Sea; we are now come, into a quiet Port, and a calm Haven, such were the Thoughts, Expectations, and Hopes of All; in <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d. We have his Laws in Print; in several places: and his Lawyers, known e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. For who needeth to be told of <hi>Glanvil</hi> in his Reign; of whom before: and much I might add, from divers others besides <hi>Hoveden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who by occasion of that Judges Name; hath not only given us a Copy, of St. <hi>Edwards</hi> Laws;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:49639:128"/>
but hath also, asserted their confirmation by K. <hi>William,</hi> (as I should before;) upon the Oaths of chosen men, from every County, (sworn, as strictly as I remember any to have ever been;) with additions also of some emendations added by King <hi>William; ad Utilitatem Anglorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Laws he saith, were compiled (or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditae</hi>) by the said great <hi>Glanvil</hi>; who (in <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d.) he stileth; <hi>summum Iusticiarium totius An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae.</hi> And for this Kings confirmation of the good Laws of <hi>H.</hi> the first, we need no more than what we find in him (and all other Historians;) of the grand contest upon that occasion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King &amp; <hi>Becket,</hi> Son to a <hi>Saracen</hi> or <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Woman, yet a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> (and his Fathers Name was <hi>Gilbert.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Favourite at first he was to <hi>Theobald,</hi> (of whom before:) by him commended so, that he became Lord <hi>Chancellor.</hi> But at his Patrons Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chosen to succeed (in <hi>Canterbury</hi>;) he resign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth up the Seal at taking orders: and in this both <hi>Wendover</hi> and <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> add to <hi>Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who in <hi>Becket</hi> is the largest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Polydore</hi> agreeth, that his former perferment was, to be <hi>Arch-Deacon,</hi> to that Sea: to which he makes the Office of a <hi>Legate,</hi> to be then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed; ever since Lord <hi>Theobald</hi> did fetch his <hi>Pall</hi> from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:49639:129"/>But the great quarrel was about the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> Laws, (of which before.) They touched all the Clergy: So, that once reading of them, was enough to make the Pope condemn and Ban them all. In a great Councel or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament the King did ask, (they say petitioned the Church,) that all would agree to keep the Laws of his Grandfather, <hi>Henry</hi> the first.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Becket</hi> with some reluctance did consent, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>Salvo.</hi> But again repents in Parliament, at <hi>Clarendon</hi> 'tis clear as well for Commons as for others. <hi>Congregato Clero &amp; Populo Regni, apud Clarendun.</hi> And again, the Lords beseech the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that he would vouchsafe to come and say before the King and <hi>Commons, coram populo diceret,</hi> that he would receive and admit those Laws.</p>
            <p>He doth consent and comes into the House, and frames his lips into a <hi>Content</hi>: the King is glad and bids the Lords retire, and bring those Laws from the Records; that all might be pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rused and agreed. Somewhat more he meant: for when the Lords returned with those Rolls, the motion was that all should set their hands, or Seals in witness of agreement. But at this,</p>
            <p>The Prelate startles and recoyles again, and riseth high or foul in Language; So withdraws in greatest discontent. Ere long, we find him
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:49639:129"/>
out again; at least, he would be out; For now he sueth for a Pass to <hi>France</hi>: he meant the Pope. I must not here omit the course the King did take to stop him. One there was that did complain, he had been long in suit; in some inferior Court of <hi>Becket,</hi> yet he could not get his right: and therefore was at length enforced to some other course and Court. For which his way was first to falsifie the Prelates Court by Oath, according to the Custom of the Kingdom: and of that we spake before in <hi>Writs of Right</hi>; and <hi>Tolts</hi> or <hi>Pone's</hi>; to remove them to some higher Court.</p>
            <p>This seemed but a petty Case that happen'd every day, so that the usual Writ hath such a clause, that if the <hi>Baron</hi> did not, then the <hi>Sheriff</hi> should. And if the <hi>Sheriff</hi> failed (in the <hi>County Court,</hi>) then <hi>Bench</hi> must help.</p>
            <p>But this was now enough to give a pause and check to that great Prelate. He must stay and plead it out; at length he finds the formal Oath (to falsifie his Court) was made upon Paper (or a Service Book:) whereas the Law required, that the Oath should be upon the Holy <hi>Gospels.</hi> This would not suffice, but Parliament, (at least the Barons, and the Tenants <hi>en Chief</hi> were such;) did put the Prelate into <hi>Misericordia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He doth struggle and attempt a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:49639:130"/>
or the like; <hi>(Iudicium illud falsificare:)</hi> but he must submit and is amerced at 500 <hi>l.</hi> he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it: fulleth <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </hi>; and the Writ goes but to the <hi>Knights.</hi> But while one was coming to view him, he doth rise and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth towards the Court; so the Knights Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate is, <hi>The Abbot was not in Bed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On long debate, the judgement was, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:49639:130"/>
               <hi>default</hi> the <hi>Abbot</hi> (yet in Possession) must sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to yeild the <hi>seisin</hi> to the <hi>Prior,</hi> whom he su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: See the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> and the 2d. of <hi>Westminster</hi> cap. 17.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Becket</hi> had Law enough to make him Rise, and come to the Court; in fear and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, but his Right hand is so fastned to his Cross; that it could hardly be forced from him, who did struggle for it. But his sorest pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, is an heavy Action of <hi>Account,</hi> for all he had received as Lord Chancellor.</p>
            <p>He pleads Discharge. And that at his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Henry</hi> Son to him, that had such interest in the Kingdom, <hi>(cui Regnum adjuratum fuit;)</hi> and all the Barons of the <hi>Exchequer, and Richard de Lucy, Iusticiarius Angliae</hi>; did declare him free: <hi>quietum Deo &amp; Ecclesiae, &amp; ab omni exactione secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lari,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But his conclusion <hi>(Ideo amplius Nolo inde placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare;)</hi> cost him dear. For when the King had this, he knew his way and said to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, (or <hi>Baronibus suit,</hi>) do me speedy Justice on this man, <hi>Cito facite mihi Iudicium de illo, qui Homo meus ligeus est: &amp; stare Iuri in Curia mea recusat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So they did retire and being alone without the King; <hi>exeuntes Iudicaverunt.</hi> And they did adjudge him to Prison. But he escaped before
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:49639:131"/>
his Commitment: although some, (that saw him going,) cryed Traytor, stay, and take thy Doom, By stealth he got to <hi>Sandwich,</hi> thence to <hi>France</hi> (by <hi>Flanders</hi>:) where he found the Pope.</p>
            <p>I do not know that he talked much, of refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to make his account. But his grand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was, that he was pressed to consent to such injurious Laws, as those (which he brought to the Pope,) of King <hi>Henry</hi> the First. Which were soon damned, notwithstanding our Kings Embassadors.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Writs</hi> were sent abroad to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> and <hi>Iustices,</hi> for seizing all, belonging to the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi>: for attaching Arms that did appeal to <hi>Rome</hi>; or bring any Letters of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or attempt a Voyage beyond Sea without a Licence. And for sequestration of the Peter pence till further order.</p>
            <p>If that I have cited already, were not clear enough for Parliament in these; we may have more from <hi>Wendover</hi> or <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> where we are expresly told, that the great meeting at <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi> (of which before) was made up of a Lord <hi>President (de mandato ipsius Regis,)</hi> with <hi>Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, Abbots, Earls, Barons</hi>; and to these, also are added <hi>Proceres Regni</hi>: which may here speak the <hi>Commons,</hi> as in <hi>Hoveden, Populus</hi>; so often expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:49639:131"/>
of that Parliament. For it may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that <hi>Virgil</hi> himself doth acknowledge the <hi>Commons</hi> also to be very frequently called to <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>; from the time of King <hi>William,</hi> as we may read in his large description of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments; in <hi>Henry</hi> the first. To which also (for this Parliament at <hi>Clarendon</hi>) we might cite very many Historians, besides <hi>Gervase,</hi> and the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drilogus</hi> (or <hi>Becket</hi>'s <hi>Life</hi> by 4 cited on <hi>Eadmerus</hi>; and in <hi>Ianus,</hi>) from which there is much to be added to that in <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Where it is also asserted that these Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> were not only agreed, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly sworn by all the degrees of Parliament. <hi>Episcopi, Clerus cum Comitibus &amp; Baronibus ac Proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus cunctis Iuraverunt,</hi> &amp;c. as also that these were but a <hi>Recognition</hi> or <hi>Recordation,</hi> of some part of the Customs and Liberties, <hi>antecessorum suorum.</hi> Of which also <hi>Florilegus</hi> thus <hi>coram lege &amp; Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus, facta est Recordatio regiarum Libertatum &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinum; Cui Archiepiscopus assensum non praebuit,</hi> &amp;c. Nor would it be hard to shew very many if not all of them, agreed in Elder times. Of <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Appeals</hi> we spake before, and the Writ <hi>Ne Exeas Regnum,</hi> is as old as <hi>Rufus</hi>; if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive <hi>Polidore,</hi> or better Authors.</p>
            <p>To that of <hi>Appeals from Ecclesiastical Courts,</hi> (to
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:49639:132"/>
the King or Delegates;) I can add very little, to what is in <hi>Caudries</hi> Case; in the 5th. part of the great Reports, with the preface to the 6th.</p>
            <p>That against Excommunication of the <hi>Kings Tenants,</hi> (or as the Elder Law was of the Barons) is cleared enough in the Notes on <hi>Eadmerus</hi>; from the first <hi>Norman</hi> Records. To which may be added a Law of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, of the Wills or Legacies of his <hi>Barons, vel Hominum</hi>; with which the Learned <hi>Ianus</hi> compareth an Old Law of <hi>Canute</hi>; and toucheth the power of the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> in Case of <hi>Intestates</hi>; which is prescribed from most antient <hi>Parliaments,</hi> but the Original doth not appear.</p>
            <p>I must not spend time in heaping up the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proofs of Parliament, for the <hi>Assizes of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon</hi>: which were again, renued at <hi>Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Hoveden</hi> is large and clear for them all, and for the <hi>Circuits,</hi> and <hi>Iudges in Eyre,</hi> by full Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>Communi omnium Concilio.</hi> But the <hi>Mirror,</hi> and those that write of <hi>Alfred</hi> will afford us these in many older Parliaments.</p>
            <p>From that <hi>Assize of Arms</hi> for every Fee, we may learn to expound the <hi>Statute of Winchester,</hi> and others speaking of a former <hi>antient Assize</hi>: which is here found at large. To which I may add, that what is here spoken of the <hi>Iustices pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:49639:132"/>
to the King</hi>; may be expounded to the King of Parliament. As is fully expressed, not only in <hi>Fleta,</hi> but in the said <hi>Statute of Winchester, The Iustices assigned, shall present the dafaults at every Parliament.</hi> The defaults of <hi>Arms</hi> for the <hi>Militia.</hi> And by this time I shall not need to speak of <hi>Escuage</hi> in <hi>H.</hi> 2d. assessed by Parliament; for <hi>Tholouse, Wales</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi>; of which <hi>Gervase</hi> the red Book in the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and <hi>Matth. Paris,</hi> with the Notes of <hi>Hengham.</hi> To which I might add <hi>Matth. of Westmin. de unaquaque Carrucata terrae toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Angliae, quatuor denarii Concessi sunt &amp; collecti,</hi> for the Holy Land. But when he had the offer of the Kingdom of <hi>Ierusalem; Convocato Clero Regni, ac Populo,</hi> it was rejected <hi>Concilio universo</hi>? as the Monk of St. <hi>Albans</hi> speaketh,</p>
            <p>Of K. <hi>Rich.</hi> Coronation, and his Oath before the Nobles, <hi>&amp; Clero, &amp; Populo, Hoveden</hi> is very large. From him it may be found in others. And of the Jews in those times, to whom he was a Friend (as his Charters shew;) and very sorry for their sufferings; who did help him much for his Eastern Wars; as some relate with <hi>Polydore.</hi> See Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> on <hi>Arundeliana Marmora,</hi> his great Charter to the King of <hi>Scotland</hi>; of many Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, (for which he did recieve 10000 Marks;) but still retaining the antient Dues to this
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:49639:133"/>
Crown is every where. For which I must not forget what was before in <hi>H.</hi> the 2d. <hi>Malcolm</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came his man 'tis said, and did him <hi>Homage</hi>: but on some disgust he was not Knighted by our King; as was wont. (and <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> addeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, that the <hi>Scottish Kings Horse,</hi> was the <hi>English Marshals Fee,</hi> at such a Knighting,) But <hi>Hoveden</hi> telleth us that about two years after, the same King came again, and was then <hi>Knighted</hi> by King <hi>Henry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of his Parliaments and their Power, in War and Peace; I might cite very clear proofs. The League with <hi>France,</hi> was agreed by both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, <hi>&amp; Archiep. &amp; Episcop. in verbo veritatis,</hi> (that was the mode in those days for them, as for the Lords since, <hi>in verbo Honoris</hi>;) <hi>&amp; Comites, &amp; Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones Regnorum, praestito Sacramento, juraverunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And his <hi>Sea Statutes</hi> were made <hi>de Communi proborum virorum Consilio,</hi> as the Charter it self ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth it in <hi>Hoveden, Wendover</hi> or <hi>Matth. Paris.</hi> Who doth add, that <hi>per Consilium magnatum,</hi> there were made, <hi>Iusticiarii super totum Navigium Angliae</hi> &amp;c. Which with divers Records of <hi>H.</hi> 3d. may be added to the <hi>Admiral,</hi> or Saxon <hi>Aen mere eal</hi>; Over all the Sea.</p>
            <p>How the Lord <hi>Chancellor</hi> (being left the <hi>Custos Regni,</hi>) did on pretence of the Kings Warrants,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:49639:133"/>
pole the People; is at large in <hi>Hoveden</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But in the Monk of St. <hi>Albans</hi> we may read, that er'e long in Parliament of Commons also, <hi>(assensu Communium definitum est,)</hi> it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that <hi>none should so domineer in England</hi>; to disgrace the Church and oppress the People. And that all the Castles which the said L. <hi>Chanc.</hi> had committed to his Clients, (or disposed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Parliaments assent,) should be presently delivered up: and in particular <hi>the Tower of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>; where he then was, and was glad to yield, and make his peace, with much submission for to save his Life.</p>
            <p>For which also <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> is worth peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. And in him we also find the <hi>North</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>; (who of an <hi>old Bishop,</hi> was made a young Novice Earl, but he paid dear, for his honour;) and how the <hi>Chancellor</hi> excused himself by the <hi>Kings Command.</hi> As if (saith <hi>Polydore</hi>) <hi>the Kings Command, might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annul the Law: Quasi fas esset, jus omne principis jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su rescindere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of the Kings Voyage to the East, I shall not speak; nor of the famous Prophesies he found touching <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the <hi>Revelation.</hi> They are in <hi>Hoveden,</hi> besides all others.</p>
            <p>Where we also find him ransomed by <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:49639:134"/>
assent</hi>; in special of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> And for this <hi>Walsinghams Neustria,</hi> may be added to others in the Road, and at his return, he is again Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the <hi>People</hi> as well as the <hi>Lords; &amp; Consilio Procerum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet <hi>Polydore</hi> (with others) is bold to charge his Reign with great exactions on the <hi>Clergy,</hi> in special for his ransome: but himself yeilded, that the King did send, the Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> that by the consent of Parliament; <hi>Regii Senatus Authoritate</hi>; he might get his Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some.</p>
            <p>And himself yeilded that at his return there was a Parliament; wherein the King thanked his People for their Faith to him, and for that they had helped him in his Wars and Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And that <hi>Ejus Nutu, Archiep. Cantuar.</hi> was conferred on the said Bishop of <hi>Durham</hi>: and that the <hi>Chalices,</hi> &amp;c. were again restored to the <hi>Churches</hi>; and that the Laws, with weights and measures, were then also corrected or amended.</p>
            <p>K. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s Election must be discussed in another place. Of his <hi>Military Aids, Paris</hi> with <hi>Wendover</hi> is clear, that they were granted in, and by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Convenerunt ad Colloquium apud Oxoniam, Rex &amp; magnates Angliae; ubi concessa sunt Regi Auxilia Militaria, de quolibet scuto duae marcae &amp; dimidium.</hi> Nor
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:49639:134"/>
are the Records wholly lost of his Parliament, summoned about a War with the <hi>French,</hi> (or rather defence against them:) and his <hi>Writs</hi> are known enough. They speak consent of Parliament, <hi>provisum est de communi assensu Archiep. Comitum, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronum &amp; omnium Fidelium nostrorum Angliae, quod novem Milites per Angliam, inveniant decimum bene pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat: ad defensionem Regni.</hi> Besides the Rolls, this is found in the 9th. part of the great Reports, and in divers others. His Charter is now so well known in Print; that I need not cite any clause thereof. No not that so clear for the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, Nullum scutagium vel Auxilium ponam in regno nostro; nisi per commune Consilium Regni nostri.</hi> Yet I may add, that the Aides, there excepted and called <hi>Reasonable,</hi> (being such by Common Law) were afterwards assessed, and ascertained by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>For which the first of <hi>Westminster</hi> may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the 25<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3d. and in the 14<hi>th.</hi> of that King; his Aides were remitted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because (for his Wars) he had taketh other Assistance than was due by Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was much excused by himself, and divers other Kings.</p>
            <p>And for this I might cite the 48<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 3d. the 25<hi>th.</hi> and 31<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1st. the 10, 11, 12,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:49639:135"/>
and 13 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 2d. the 19<hi>th.</hi> and 20<hi>th. Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> who did <hi>buy</hi> Souldiers rather than <hi>Press</hi> them; as the <hi>Roman Historian,</hi> of the declining times, of that <hi>Empire.</hi> Of the <hi>Barons Wars,</hi> I must not speak, a syllable, they do deserve a discourse by themselves: and it may be possible er'e long to see it. Now I shall only observe, that, our <hi>great Charter</hi> was rather the <hi>Cause</hi> (or occasion) than the <hi>Effect</hi> of <hi>those Wars.</hi> For, had it been so kept as it was made; the Crown might have rested in peace enough.</p>
            <p>They which perswade others that this <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was first created by King <hi>Henry,</hi> and extorted from him, only by a prevailing <hi>Sword,</hi> seem not to consider so much as its <hi>Title</hi>; as it now is print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: where we find it granted, in his 9<hi>th.</hi> year. Although it was so ill performed, that it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed confirmation afterwards.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Matth. Paris</hi> is very clear and plain in this, that it was wholly the same or exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with that of K. <hi>Iohn, &amp; in nullo dissimilis.</hi> Nay he speaketh of K. <hi>Iohns Charter, quas sponte promisit Baronagio Angliae</hi>: and again in K. <hi>H.</hi> 3<hi>d. sponte liberaliter concessit.</hi> And the <hi>Popes Letters</hi> tell us, of K. <hi>Iohns Charter,</hi> granted most <hi>freely: Libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter ex mera &amp; spontanea Voluntate, de Communi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu Baronum suorum,</hi> &amp;c. Besides the very words,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:49639:135"/>
in one of those <hi>Charters, spontanea &amp; voluntate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra dedimus, concessimus, pro nobis, &amp; Heredibus nostris, Libertates has subscriptas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor were these new priviledges, then <hi>first</hi> Created by him. But the <hi>old Rights of the People</hi> by long and ancient Custom: as we may find at large also in <hi>Wendover,</hi> with <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> where they are not only, <hi>Antiquae Leges &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudines Regni</hi>; but we are also told, they did present, the <hi>great Charter of H. the first,</hi> with his Laws and St. <hi>Edward's.</hi> And to these the <hi>Barons</hi> sware: as the King had also done before. For so we read their Covenant was; that if the King would break his Oath, <hi>a juramento proprio resilire,</hi> (which they had some cause to believe or sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, <hi>propter suam duplicitatem;</hi>) yet, they would keep theirs; and would do their best, to reduce him to keep his.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> is also clear in this, who telleth us, K. <hi>Iohn's</hi> Troubles, and proceedure from his not restoring K. <hi>Edw. Laws, as he had promised.</hi> And that the Barons urged him, <hi>ut promissas tandem aliquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do Lege daret,</hi> and again they ask for their <hi>Antient Customes; vetera instituta, quibus olim Reges Pop. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl. bene rexissent:</hi> and the close is, <hi>quae ille prius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepisset se sanctissime observaturum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Henry the Third</hi>; the same Author
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:49639:136"/>
affirmeth, that (instead of his granting ought, that was new;) the People granted him that grand Prerogative of <hi>Wardships</hi>; (which that King accepted, with many thanks) adding also, that the People did not intend it for <hi>his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But of this I may speak in another place. I shall now only adde, that if there be not yet enough said, (from all the Saxon Laws, and Histories, with the first Norman Confirmations and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications;) to assert the Great Charter, to be more Antient (for its matter) than K. <hi>Henry</hi> or K. <hi>Iohn</hi>: I shall only desire those that are yet unsatisfied, they would please to peruse the 2<hi>d. part</hi> of the <hi>Great Institutes</hi>; or at least so much of it as speaketh of <hi>H.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>Edw.</hi> 1st. And it may be they will not wonder that at the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates motion, that Bastards might inherit: the Parliament at <hi>Merton,</hi> cryed out so loud, <hi>nolumus Lages Angliae mutate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which also (besides the late Declarations of this Parliament; and the Petition of Right,) may be added; the Learned arguments, of those Grave and Honourable Judges; to whom we shall ever owe so much, for standing up (in an evil day,) for Truth and Common Justice; in the Case of <hi>Ship-money</hi>: Sir <hi>Richard Hatton,</hi> Sir
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:49639:136"/>
               <hi>George Crook,</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Denham</hi>; with the truly Noble <hi>Oliver St. Iohn</hi> Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Their Arguments are now in Print by publick Command. Nor may I presume to add a word in that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I speak of the times following the great Charter; which was confirmed more than thirty times in full Parliament: with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny special Provisions for the <hi>Militia.</hi> It being most just and reasonable, that what did so much concern all, should be considered by all: <hi>Quod omnes tangit, ab omnibus approbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is one clause in the Writ of Summons to Parliament (about a War with <hi>France</hi>;) in <hi>Edward the First.</hi> Which seemeth to speak a necessity of Parliaments, for matters of War. Not only for Money, (as some have pleased to speak:) or at the Kings choice to call them, if he please. The Writ speaks an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: <hi>Lex justissima, &amp; provida circumspectione stabilita</hi>; not let at loose to the Kings pleasure: but as <hi>Fortescue,</hi> or long before him, the old <hi>Modus of Parliament,</hi> maketh it necessary for the King, and his Duty to Call a Parliament in all such Cases.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:49639:137"/>Nor shall I need to add what <hi>Paulus Iovius, Froisard, Comineus, de Serres,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> with many other strangers have observ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of our Parliaments, in this; which is the Law of Nature, rather than of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as in the Heavens or great World we did before observe <hi>Mars,</hi> (or the Genius of War,) to be there placed immediately under <hi>Iupiter,</hi> (the great Councel;) and not under the <hi>Sun.</hi> So in the Microcosm or little World of <hi>Man</hi>; we find both <hi>Spleen</hi> and <hi>Gall,</hi> within; <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> without; at a good distance from the <hi>Head</hi>: and never joyned to it; but in Monsters. Yet it is true that some Creatures have Horns on their Heads, but they are <hi>Beasts</hi> and not <hi>Men.</hi> Much less <hi>Kings,</hi> I hope.</p>
            <p>But did we Labour, Toyl, and Sweat so much to keep a little <hi>River</hi> in its bounds; that so we might be drowned, by the boundless <hi>Ocean</hi>? Or be swept away at once, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying and devouring <hi>Deluge</hi>? Did we scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple at a little <hi>Gravel</hi> or a Pebble, that we might be crushed by a <hi>Mountain</hi>?

            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:49639:138"/>I need not say how curious, or how scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and tender still our Laws have been; in pointing out the <hi>Way</hi> as well as <hi>End</hi>: the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> in the Courts of Justice; as the <hi>Final Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> So that indeed the very Form, and Life, and Power, or Substance of the justest Laws, doth much consist in Processe: which by some may be thought a shadow, or a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; left at pleasure for a blustring Wind, or any furious hand, to shake as much, as long as it shall please. And then to <hi>salve</hi> it up, by saying to the Root, <hi>We mean you Good; and do but lay you bare, that so you may the more behold, and more admire our Iustice in the End: when all the Boughs and Branches shall be gone, that do but hinder all your Prospect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I must but <hi>Touch</hi> and glance. There is a <hi>Trinity</hi> which all our Laws do seem to Worship here on Earth: <hi>Estate, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all Estate, the <hi>Dower</hi> of Widows hath the greatest priviledge. For which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon <hi>Littletons</hi> first and fifth, with the Statutes of <hi>Merton</hi>; and some clauses, of the great Charter it self, for <hi>Quarentine</hi> and Dower, are good glosses, on the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws; or those already touched: and I shall not add one sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:49639:138"/>
All Estates have priviledge in Law; and all Amercements must be such, as may consist with mens Estate; from <hi>Alfred, Edgar, Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Canute</hi> or <hi>Edward,</hi> it did come to <hi>Henry</hi> the first; and thence to the <hi>Great Charter.</hi> Where the Law is plain and clear. <hi>No Free man shall be Amerced, but according to his Default and Estate: Salvo sibi Contenemento suo.</hi> Which is so branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it reacheth to <hi>Villains</hi> also; though it speak at first but of <hi>Free-men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence the Name of <hi>Amercement</hi>; because it was and ought to be an <hi>Amerciament</hi>; or a <hi>merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fine.</hi> In which the <hi>Saxons</hi> went beyond us, in their <hi>Weregylds,</hi> and <hi>Divers Wytes</hi>: for which <hi>Fleta,</hi> may be a Comment to the Laws of <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stane,</hi> and others of the <hi>Saxons.</hi>

So that to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ones self, to the Kings Judgment, is to no effect; and so adjudged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:49639:139"/>For as the <hi>Father, judgeth no man</hi>; so the <hi>King,</hi> (who is or should be <hi>Father</hi> of the Country;) but he hath committed all judgment unto <hi>Men,</hi> that are our Fellows, (<hi>Pares,</hi>) in the Courts of Justice. VVhere indeed the <hi>King,</hi> did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time sit in <hi>Person</hi>; yet the <hi>Court</hi> did Judge; and not the King; as <hi>Fortescue</hi> doth plainly tell us.

            <p>And for <hi>Fines</hi> by Courts of Justice (not by the King,) and <hi>Amerciaments by Peers</hi>; besides the Comments on <hi>Magna Charta</hi>; there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Book Oases cited from <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, <hi>Richard</hi> the third; in the fourth part of Institutes, <hi>Kings Bench</hi>; To which may be added <hi>Greislies</hi> Case, in the eighth part of <hi>Reports.</hi> And the first of <hi>Westminster</hi> doth add
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:49639:139"/>
to the great Charter; or at least explain it, in this. But the <hi>Mirror</hi> will tell us, it was an abuse, not to expound it, so largely before. And although the VVrit <hi>de moderata misericordia,</hi> (in the Register, and <hi>N.

            <p>But how tender our Law hath always been, in matters that concern <hi>Estate</hi> or <hi>Liberty</hi> may well appear by all the <hi>Executions,</hi> grantable for Debt or Dammages.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Merchant and the Staple, Statutes</hi> are and were by <hi>Statute,</hi> not by <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They seem as sweeping Rain, and Storms, that drive away the <hi>Body, Goods,</hi> and <hi>Lands</hi> in <hi>Fee,</hi> (at time of Recognition; or accrewing since:) but none in <hi>Tail,</hi> but during life of him that was the <hi>Cognisor</hi>: Nor <hi>Copyhold,</hi> or Goods or Leases, for a Term of years; but only what was in possession, at the <hi>Execution</hi> done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:49639:140"/>They are fore-known, and therefore may be well avoided, by all such as do not choose their own destructions. And there is a tender care in Law, not only of exact, and punctual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitions; and recording of them, but in case of forfeit, upon a <hi>Certiorari,</hi> sued forth from the Chancery; and not before return thereof, a <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> shall be granted (on the <hi>Statute Merchant</hi>) for the <hi>Body</hi> only; if it be a <hi>Laic</hi>: and if <hi>Laic</hi> be not found, (and so returned into the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> or <hi>Common Pleas</hi>;) then on pauze of divers months, the <hi>exigent</hi> may be awarded. But in <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> on the first Return of <hi>Certiorari,</hi> may the <hi>Execution</hi> issue forth, returnable into the <hi>Petty Bag</hi>; of all it seems the worst, in this. But the <hi>Merchants</hi> Court, <hi>Aequitatem summam de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderat</hi>: although a kind of <hi>Peepoudres; as Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cton</hi> and the Notes on <hi>Fortescue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon a <hi>Recognizance</hi> a <hi>Capias</hi> doth not go; before a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> be Returned into the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery.</hi> Then a <hi>Capias</hi> or a <hi>Fieri Facias</hi> or an <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git</hi>; at the choyce of <hi>Cognisee</hi>; as in other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Judgements.</p>
            <p>And of these the <hi>fieri facias</hi> is the <hi>mildest,</hi> and the oldest, by the Common Law. It toucheth
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:49639:140"/>
Goods and Chattels only: such as are the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Own; not lent by, or Leased to another. For although the Sheriff find them, in the Parties Use and full Possession, as he thinks; yet may he be a Trespasser in taking such; and so may run the hazard of an Action; ere he be aware. Nor did the old <hi>Levari facias,</hi> seize the <hi>Land</hi>: but Corn, or that which grew thereon.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Elegit,</hi> hath its Name from his Election, or his Choice that sues it out: Who so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes himself from other Executions. This did come by <hi>Statute</hi>; not by <hi>Common Law</hi>: and toucheth <hi>Half the Fee, and all the Goods</hi>; but yet with <hi>Salvo</hi> to <hi>Contenement</hi>: he must not lose his <hi>Oxen,</hi> or his <hi>Cattle</hi> for his Plough; For then he cannot live and keep his Family. So Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is our Law, for all Estates and Liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>Nay this <hi>Extent</hi> must not be made by She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs; (who may not divide a right;) but by a <hi>Iury</hi> of <hi>Inquest.</hi> And so must be Returned, and preserved on Record; (as the first <hi>Capias,</hi> with all <hi>mean Processe</hi> must,) or else, it shall be
<pb facs="tcp:49639:141"/>
nothing worth: as may appear at large, in the fourth and fifth parts of the great Reports; <hi>Hoes</hi> and <hi>Fulwood</hi>; with divers other Cases. And the second of <hi>Westminster,</hi> that giveth this <hi>Elegit,</hi> doth require both <hi>Extent</hi> of <hi>Lands,</hi> and prize of Goods to be <hi>Reasonable</hi>; that is by <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest</hi> of Twelve and so returned of <hi>Record.</hi> As is cleared in the Commentator. See also <hi>Littletons Parceners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>Capias ad <unclear>Satisfaciendum</unclear>,</hi> taketh the Body; but it is by <hi>Statute</hi> only: for it did not lye, by Common Law, in Debt or Dammages; but only where the Original Action, was for Force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Trespass; <hi>Vi &amp; Armis.</hi> Which is <hi>Now,</hi> crept into every Trespass. But of this Sir <hi>William Herberts</hi> Case, in the third part of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
            <p>It may be forbidden again by Statute, as it was first granted: and that justly too for ought I know; if other course be taken, for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Just and Reasonable Debts. For the <hi>Capias</hi> (as now managed,) is a great mischief, and divers times, to the utter ruine of the Debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors whole Family. And yet but very little advantage to the <hi>Creditor</hi>: except the <hi>Debtor</hi>
               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:49639:141"/>
escape (and so the <hi>Sheriff</hi> come to pay the Debt;) or except he dye in Prison, and the Plaintiff get an <hi>Elegit,</hi> for the Debtors Goods at his death, or half his Fee-Simple, which he had at the time of Judgement or after it. For an Action for Debt or Dammages, doth but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the <hi>Person</hi>; and the Law attendeth not; what Lands were enjoyed at the <hi>Original,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment. But an Action, brought against an <hi>Heir,</hi> may aim at <hi>Land,</hi> and so may charge it; although he Aliene while the suit dependeth.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I need to add, that all these <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutions,</hi> must be sued out, (For this is required by Law, except in the Kings Case:) within one year and a day after Judgment. Yet they may be continued after; and by a <hi>scire facias,</hi> be renewd or repealed; till the Judgment have <hi>Full Execution.</hi> But this was also given by Statute: and to this may the Debter plead, although he cannot plead against an <hi>Execution.</hi> Yet, it may be suspended by a Writ of <hi>Errour</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance, according to the Statute of <hi>Iames,</hi> and 3 <hi>Caroli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:49639:142"/>And without a Writ of <hi>Error,</hi> after judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if the Defendant have matter to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge him of the <hi>Execution</hi>; still the Law is open for him. And he may relieve himself by a Writ of <hi>Audita Querela.</hi> And in case of <hi>Elegit,</hi> as soon as the Debt is satisfied; the <hi>Debtor</hi> may enter on his Lands again: and if he conceive the <hi>Creditor</hi> satisfied by casual profits he may bring a <hi>scire facias</hi>; upon which the Creditor may clear, how much he hath received of the Debtor's Estate.</p>
            <p>Unto this occasional discourse, I shall only add that grand maxime of our Law, that <hi>Executions</hi> ought to be more favourable, than any other <hi>Process of Law</hi> whatever: Of which the great Judge upon <hi>Littletons Releases,</hi> and the second of <hi>Westminster</hi> in <hi>Edward the First.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for Executions, for the <hi>Kings Debt's</hi>; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained by the great Charter; I have little to add, to the Comment on the eight chapter of that Charter. But the twelfth of <hi>Articuli super Chartas,</hi> hath afforded a Writ commanding the Sheriff to accept of <hi>Sureties</hi>: else an Attachment lieth against him; or the party may bring an Action against the Shetiff, that <hi>refuseth Sureties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="275" facs="tcp:49639:142"/>It is a maxime in Law, that a mans House, is his Castle: so that the Sheriff cannot break it open for an Execution. But upon a Writ of Seisin or Possession, the Sheriff, (and other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, upon suspicion of Treason or Felony,) may break open an House; and so also in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Executions, where the King is a party. But in all such Cases first the Sheriff must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the door to be opened. And the <hi>First</hi> of <hi>Westminster,</hi> doth also require solemn demand of Beasts driven away into a Castle or Fort; (which is a kind of <hi>vetitum nomium</hi> which may be regained. By <hi>Withernam.</hi>)</p>
            <p>Which Case I cite the rather, because of the <hi>Militia.</hi> For in such a Case the <hi>Sheriff</hi> or Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff shall not only force his Entry, by the <hi>Posse-Comitatus</hi> into such a <hi>Castle</hi>; on the suit of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>: but it may also, come so far, that the said Fort or Castle, may be beaten down without recovery.</p>
            <p>And although it be said, it shall be done by the Kings Command; yet it is well known and seen by experience, that it is, and always was by Order of the Courts of Justice: and for this <hi>Semain</hi>'s Case, in the fifth part of Reports, may
<pb facs="tcp:49639:143"/>
be very well added to the Comments on the <hi>First of Westminster.</hi> By which we see how much the very Forts and Castles or <hi>Militia,</hi> must be subject to the <hi>Courts of Iustice</hi>: Not the King only, but in and by his Courts; especially the <hi>Parliament,</hi> that may Command, Controul and Over-rule, all other Courts.</p>
            <p>How tender the Law is in Case of <hi>Estate, Forfeit</hi> by <hi>Alienation,</hi> I have touched before, much is to be added: Nay in the worst and lowest Estates by Tenure of <hi>Will,</hi> (of which somewhat also before, for a Fine <hi>Reasonable,</hi> &amp;c.) as by <hi>Copy</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where Alienation, and Wast against the Custom, with other Cases (in the fourth part of Reports,) may <hi>Forfeit</hi> to the Lord: but he cannot <hi>Out his Tenant</hi> at pleasure, (especially him that sweareth <hi>Fealty</hi>;) but the said <hi>Tenant</hi> may sue his Lord, or bring his Action of <hi>Trespasse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For Offices <hi>Forfeited,</hi> by Bargain and Sale or Brocage; the Statutes are clear and just. To which may be added the Comments of <hi>Littletons Estates Conditional</hi>: as also for Forfeitures of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>It is expresly provided, by Act of Parliament, that no Sheriff or any other Person, do take or
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:49639:143"/>
seize any mans Goods, (much less may he take his Lands;) for <hi>Treason</hi> or <hi>Felony</hi>; until he be duly convicted, or Attainted by Trial, Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or Outlawry upon pain to Forfeit double; to the party grieved, nor is this only in <hi>Richard</hi> the third, but in the first great Charter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it also, as was touched before.</p>
            <p>Among the <hi>Saxons</hi> none were <hi>Outlawed</hi> but for Capital crimes: we find it often, in the <hi>Mirror,</hi> and in such the Out-law might be killed, by any that met him; (as might any man, Attainted of <hi>Premunire,</hi> that vast Chaos of confusion; till Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Time.) I do not find any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawry below <hi>Felony</hi> till about the <hi>Barons Wars</hi>; and then it came not below an Action of Force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Trespass, <hi>Vi &amp; Armis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But (in the Common Pleas) it came to lie upon Account, Debt, Detinue, Covenant, and other petty Actions: which the Mirrour would pronounce a most great abuse. But in <hi>Edw</hi> the third, there was some amends, in providing that none should kill an Out-law, but a Sheriff on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with lawful Authority. Yet in inferiour Cases, Land Issues might be sequestred, in the Kings Hands till Appearance, or Reversal. Only in
<pb facs="tcp:49639:144"/>
               <hi>Treason</hi> and <hi>Felony,</hi> it forfeiteth as much; as At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder by Judgment.</p>
            <p>But it may be Pleades and Reversed divers ways. And a Petty <hi>Misnomer</hi> or a misdate, is ground enough to Reverse it; by a Writ of <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> And of this the Books are full. But <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min's</hi> case is a criticism in Chronology. One of the Sheriffs Returns was dated on the 8th. of <hi>Iuly</hi> in the second and third of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi>; but it was declared, there could be no such day, but in the 2d. and 4th. year, (which was only, between the 6th. and 25th. of <hi>Iuly</hi>:) yet this was enough, to Reverse an Attainder of <hi>Treason,</hi> by Writ of <hi>Errour.</hi> And in Favour of Life, our Law admitteth <hi>Pleas</hi> to Out-Lawries in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals; there where in other Cases must be brought a formal Writ of Error.</p>
            <p>I cannot deny but even by the common Law, upon <hi>Indictment</hi> for Treasom or Felony, the Goods and Chattels might be <hi>Inventored</hi>: but not seized as <hi>Forfeit</hi> till <hi>Conviction.</hi> Nor are Lands and Tenements Forfeit, till <hi>Attainder</hi> by Judge- And in case of <hi>Appeal,</hi> (which related no time;) that is only <hi>Forfeit,</hi> which is possessed at the <hi>Iudgment.</hi> But upon <hi>Indictment</hi> (dating the
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:49639:144"/>
crime,) the Forfeiture will reach to the crime committed: although there be Alienation before Judgement.</p>
            <p>But no <hi>Forfeiture</hi> before <hi>Conviction</hi>; no seizure before <hi>Indictment.</hi> And the Book of <hi>Assizes</hi> telleth us, the Judges took away, a Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, from one that, under the great Seal, had power to arrest and seize on Goods, before In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</p>
            <p>And how tender our Law was, in this for Estate, it may be seen at large in <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi>; with the old Writ, not only in them, but in the <hi>Register</hi> also; relating to the great <hi>Charter,</hi> forbidding all Disseisin till <hi>Conviction.</hi> Yet it requireth the <hi>Sheriff, per visum suum &amp; le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galium hominem,</hi> to Apprise and Inventory, all the Offenders Chattels, but with a double <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> both for safe keeping them; (and for this <hi>Security</hi> was to be given by the <hi>Bailiffs</hi> or the Township;) and for maintaining the person in Prison, with all his necessary Family. <hi>Salvo tamen eidem Capto, &amp; familiae suae necessariae, quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu fuerit in prisona, Rationabili Esto verio suo.</hi> Which was not only <hi>Meat</hi> but <hi>Cloathing,</hi> &amp;c. as hath often been adjudged in <hi>Edward</hi> the
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:49639:145"/>
third, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth and other Times. See the third part of Institutes, cap. 103.</p>
            <p>It will not be long I hope before God stirreth up our Governours to Reform the crying sins, of this Kingdom (and not only Gaolers) in our oppressing grinding Prisons. But the Heathen Moralist hath also told us, that <hi>Divine wheels,</hi> are also <hi>grinding,</hi> and will <hi>grind</hi> to <hi>powder</hi>; though they be slow in motion, as unwilling to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
            <p>It is true, that Prisons should be by Law, both safe and strait Custodies; nor should they admit such wandring abroad as some mens Mony doth procure. But although <hi>Recoveries</hi> on Record; (much lesse Discents) do not bind men in Prison, or conclude them for want of claim: yet upon motion Prisoners may and ought to be brought to the Court, in Suits or Actions against them, in case of Judgement; or where ever else, they ought to be in person present. And for this I may only referre to the Commentator on the <hi>continual claim</hi>; and the Cases by him cited.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:49639:145"/>How unwilling our Law was to empair our <hi>Liberty,</hi> was touched before in the <hi>Capias</hi> on Debt. And although some latter Statutes do out-go our Common Law for Imprisonments; yet it is still received, for a general maxim in Law, that Prisons should be <hi>Custodiae,</hi> not <hi>Poenae.</hi> And where ever any man is unjustly in Prison; the Law affordeth him, more ways of getting out than his Enemies had to get him in.</p>
            <p>He may have an <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> and he may have a Writ <hi>de Homine Replegiando.</hi> He may have an Action of <hi>False Imprisonment.</hi> And may found an Action on the Great Charter: Or on it, may cause his unjust friend to be <hi>Endicted.</hi> And the Writ <hi>de Odio &amp; Atia,</hi> was again revived though by Statute once it was forbidden.</p>
            <p>And for these with <hi>Bayl</hi> by Judges or Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>Replevins</hi> by Sheriffs, &amp;c. We have the Judgement of all the Judges on <hi>Articuli Cleri</hi>: and the Comments on the great <hi>Charter</hi>; with the Statute of <hi>Marlbridge,</hi> and the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>second</hi> of <hi>Westminster.</hi> To which we may add the old Records, cited by the great Judge (on <hi>Littletons Rents</hi> and <hi>Releases</hi>;) for <hi>Minors</hi> and <hi>Women with Child,</hi> being excused from Imprisonment; not
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:49639:146"/>
only in Judgment on <hi>Trespasses,</hi> but an <hi>Appeal</hi> of Robbery.</p>
            <p>More curious yet, and tender is our Law in all that toucheth <hi>Life.</hi> The <hi>Mirror</hi> is full of Complaints, that in his time, (and <hi>Horn</hi> did live about King <hi>Edward</hi> the first or rather the second for he nameth <hi>Edward</hi> the first:) some sins were made <hi>mortal,</hi> which were but <hi>Venial.</hi> At was <hi>Rape</hi> (with him) till <hi>Edward</hi> the first. But none (saith he) can make a Venial sin, <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,</hi> by any Statute without consent of the Pope and <hi>Emperour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And besides the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws cited before, it is considerable that one the first <hi>Normans</hi> (called <hi>Conquerours</hi>) Laws so often confirmed since, was this, that no man should be <hi>hanged</hi> or put to <hi>Death</hi> for Treason or other crime: but lose his Eyes (or be exect) or some way dismembred that so he might be a living Monument and spectacle <hi>Proditionis &amp; nequitiae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of such there are many precedents, and of some <hi>Banished</hi>; but of very few <hi>Hanged</hi> or put to <hi>Death</hi> till about the Time of <hi>Fitz-Osborn</hi> cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before. And <hi>Rape</hi> was punished with loss
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:49639:146"/>
of Eyes, and exection (in <hi>Bracton</hi>) before the Statute of <hi>Westminster.</hi> The second but in <hi>Glanvil,</hi> it seemeth to have been as mortal as Murder or <hi>Burning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the Monk of <hi>Malmsbury</hi> we find that the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the first, did punish this and <hi>Theft,</hi> with loss of Eyes and exection. But of this Mr. <hi>Seldens Ianus,</hi> and his Notes on <hi>Hengham,</hi> shew the like Customs, continued in <hi>Winchester,</hi> and <hi>Walingford. Hanging</hi> is a late punishment for <hi>Theft,</hi> but some kinds of <hi>Felony</hi> did lose the <hi>Head.</hi> And for <hi>Adultery</hi> the Woman of old did lose her Ears and Nose: but she was burnt to Death, for killing her Husband; which <hi>Caesar</hi> also observed of the British Gaulish <hi>Druids.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Ancestors allowed Bail, in Cases very high and hienous; (we must speak of <hi>Treason</hi> in another place,) that I say nothing of <hi>Sanctuary, Abjuration</hi> and <hi>Clergy</hi>; which was much larger than later Statutes have made it. But of this for rhe <hi>Peers</hi> in special (although they could not read) see the first of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6th. and a later Statute of King <hi>Iames,</hi> for burning and whipping of Women who could not be <hi>Clerks</hi> as men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="286" facs="tcp:49639:147"/>It may be considered how our English mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, may be continued some other way; if this be put down.</p>
            <p>Which is very disputable, and the plain truth is, it was much at the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> pleasure. For they were not fined, for refusing to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Justices; who yet might reprieve the Prisoner, in case of such Refusal. And in Case of <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> it hath been declared at the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries choice</hi> to give or deny Clergy, for which an old Record of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3d. is to be added to <hi>Poulters</hi> Case, with <hi>Cawdries and Biggens</hi> in the 5th. part of Reports.</p>
            <p>This Case of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> is very considerable, being of all the most <hi>forlorn</hi>; for being denyed the Priviledge of <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> it could not <hi>Abjure.</hi> For this was Appendant to <hi>Sanctuary</hi>: whither the Offended did first fly and then Abjure.</p>
            <p>By the old Law the person <hi>Abjured</hi> must ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish himself, into a Forreign (yet a Christian) Country. But in <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. he was remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to some other <hi>English Sanctuary.</hi> And in K. <hi>Iames</hi> if it is taken away; but what was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>
               <pb n="287" facs="tcp:49639:147"/>But to all Antiquities for <hi>Abjuration</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> in the <hi>Mirror</hi> St. <hi>Edward's</hi> and the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws may be added, those of <hi>Molmutius</hi> the old <hi>Britain</hi> so long before Christian Religion.

               <hi>Pain fort</hi> and <hi>Iure</hi> (the pressing punishment in case of standing <hi>Mute</hi> in petty Treason and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony;) with <hi>Martial Law</hi>; are not so old, as our Ancestors <hi>Mercy.</hi> Yet in this they are merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that they do not forfeit Estate; or Attaint, and corrupt blood as do other Capitals. But when shall we live, to have no need of that Novel <hi>Pressure,</hi> of Law <hi>Martial</hi>? When shall we again return to our Fore-fathers tenderness in all of Blood?</p>
            <p>And that not only in <hi>Pitty</hi> but <hi>Policy,</hi> both in this and other Nations. Who could else have made no great Title to many of their best slaves in <hi>Gallies</hi> and other employments. Which yet were not so good as our <hi>Mines</hi> might prove, if at least they were known how to be found, used and improved: As they may, and shall I hope ere many Ages more are lost, or worse than lost, in hating, spoiling, killing and devouring one another.</p>
            <p>But of all little Islands near us, the <hi>Isle of Map</hi> (a very Famous place of old, and a distinct
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49639:148"/>
Kingdom of it self; though Appendant to this Conquest,) seemeth to be worthy of Enquiry, for their Laws and Customs. Which are very much, more compendious, than Ours, in some Cases of Law, with all Pleadings and Process.</p>
            <p>In Criminals they have strange Customs it being with them more Capital to Steal a <hi>Pig</hi> or a <hi>Capon,</hi> than an <hi>Horse</hi> or an <hi>Oxe.</hi> One rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is because they love plain dealing, and be open-hearted, and they hate the man that Steals and <hi>Hides,</hi> much more than him, that doth it in on open way. I find it in a very good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and a great Lawyer; who reporteth them, to be industrious and religious, true and very free, from begging or stealing.</p>
            <p>All Controversies are determined in little time; with less Expence, Pleading or Writing. Yet in Cases of unusual Weight and Doubt; they have recourse to Twelve they make and call the Islands Keys: being above their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Deemsters; whom they choose from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves. Their Bargains are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated and comfirm'd, by the giving and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of as mean a matter as a <hi>Straw</hi>: as of old also <hi>per traditionem stipulae,</hi> from whence the phrase of stipulation came. But these were moulded also by our British <hi>Druids</hi>; or of later date, our <hi>Saxon Ancestors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:49639:148"/>I need not speak, how curious our Fathers were, in all their Process, touching Life: The <hi>Way</hi> was still as pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual, as clear, and plain, as was the <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They loved to be just; and to do justly.</p>
            <p>Doth our Law condemn or give power to condemn any man, without <hi>Hearing</hi>; or due Summons to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? I hope it never will.</p>
            <p>A Great man of a good Name, standeth upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, as by Parliament, condemned to Death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Hearing</hi>; or Legal Summons. But there is a Blush, or a Vail of Oblivion, drawn upon it, by good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as a stain and a shame, to the Parliament Rolls: yet as a just judgment on him, that had first moved, that another, might be so condemned. And he so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished, by that Law, which he would have made for others.</p>
            <p>This seemeth also, to be written in the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> And doubtless, the Sins of <hi>Sodome</hi> were as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to God, in Heaven, as any others, can be, to Men in Parliament. And yet, He would, and did, go down, to hear, and see, and proceed in a judicial way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Nor would he condemn or execute, before he had, not onely, cleared his justice in himself, or to his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; but also to <hi>Abraham, Lot,</hi> and other Lookers on; that he still might be justified, both when he judgeth, and is judged. For he still did, and will, put his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on Man's Judgment.</p>
            <p>This Process also towards <hi>Sodom,</hi> is by many of our
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:49639:149"/>
old Lawyers, brought for the Pattern of our Laws; in that especially, that none may be condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Legal Hearing. And in this, and divers other things, do <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> borrow much from the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> the First.</p>
            <p>And be the Matter of Fact never so notorious; yet may there be some Plea, that no man can foresee, or ought to forejudge before he heareth; for all men may plead necessity, or force upon themselves (as well as <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Law</hi>) for any thing they do amiss. And for this, and other Reasons, the Law doth suppose all men to be just, or excusable, till they be Legally heard and adjudged. This Difference, there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Judges and the Law-makers: For these (they say) do suppose all men to be evil; but the Judges should suppose all men to be good till they be proved to be evil.</p>
            <p>The Charge and Accusation, by the Law of Nature, ought to be clear, distinct, and particular, (with time and place, or other Circumstances) else the Party accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed cannot discharge himself. <hi>Universalia non premunt omnino, vel opprimunt</hi>; Generals do not press at all; or else, they are apt to oppress.</p>
            <p>The Witness, and the Evidence, must also be so clear, that these must condemn rather than the Judge, who sitteth as Counsel for the Party accused; that so, he be not oppressed by, or against Law.</p>
            <p>And besides the Judges, (in most Cases, and in
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:49639:149"/>
those also of Life, in <hi>Scotland</hi>) there is <hi>Counsel</hi> allowed by Law, which may, and ought to be heard in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of Law, or whatever may be justly disputable; as <hi>Treason</hi> is by Statute. So, that of all Crimes, by express Acts of Parliament, it ought to have no <hi>Tryal,</hi> but clear and plain, according to the course and custom of the <hi>Common Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In such Cases, therefore, should the <hi>Iudges</hi> (both in Law and Conscience) sit, and be, instead of <hi>Counsel</hi> to the Party. This they owe to every Subject, though they had a special Obligation to the King.</p>
            <p>Who, to his own <hi>Rights,</hi> (and therefore to his <hi>Wrongs</hi>) was an <hi>Infant</hi> in <hi>Law</hi>? and so expresly declared in the Old <hi>Mirror,</hi> besides other Books. His Politick Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city never, but his Person ever in <hi>Nonage,</hi> or supposed so in Law: for it may be a <hi>Child,</hi> or a <hi>Woman</hi> not able to know the Laws, and therefore always had, by Law, a Legal Mouth assigned, in <hi>Counsel</hi> of Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And so might any man else (of old) it seems, for matter of Demurrers, before Judgment; or for framing of Legal Appeal (by Writ of Error, or some other way) from any Judgment whatsoever.</p>
            <p>It is also the Law of this Kingdom, and of Nature, that though there be no Councel assigned; yet may any, in a good manner move the Court to keep the Party from <hi>Injustice,</hi> or the Court from <hi>Error</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as <hi>Stanford,</hi> and the 3d. part of <hi>Institutes, Cap.</hi> 2.63, and 101. And in such Cases it may be excused (and not censured for rash zeal)

if some do, or shall appear, where or when, it may be thought they be not called.</p>
            <p>Neither can the whole Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, make any Court to condemn without lawful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers, or lawful Witnesses; which, by express Acts of Parliament, is most especially provided in Case of <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> in King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Reign: and <hi>Tryal of Treason,</hi> was most expresly tyed to the course and custom of the <hi>Common Law.</hi> Nay, in full Parliament of <hi>Hen.</hi> the VIII. it was declared, that At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint of <hi>Treason,</hi> in, or by <hi>Parliament,</hi> was of no more force or strength, than it was, or ought to be, by the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law</hi>: or this as good and strong, as that by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor can the whole Parliament, I think, by the Law of Nature, and right Reason, make any (Children, Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots, or all others) whatsoever, to be, so much as Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers or Witnesses; that I say not Indictors, Tryers or Judges.</p>
            <p>By express Acts of Parliament, in <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary; Edw.</hi> VI. <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. <hi>Hen.</hi> IV. <hi>Hen.</hi> I. (for, to him, doth the <hi>Mirror,</hi> and his Laws, lead us as to a clear Crystal Fountain of our Law Process;) none should suffer, for Treason or other Crime, but by lawful Accusers, lawful Witnesses, before those, that by Law, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Indictments; which, with all Enquest, are to be made, by honest, lawful, able men, Neighbours to the Fact.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="293" facs="tcp:49639:150"/>And the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> with the Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, giveth any man leave to except against some for Accusers, others for Witnesses; and many for <hi>Tryers.</hi> It being the known Law of the Land, that one may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the <hi>Array</hi> (either the principal Pannel, or the <hi>Tales</hi>) as well as the <hi>Polls</hi>; and that the lowest Subject, must be admitted, if he require it, to a perremtory challenge of divers, (it is now, in most Capitals, limited to 20. but in <hi>Treason,</hi> it is, as at Common Law it was, to 3 Juries, or 35) which may be challenged, without any particular reason. And the Law of Nature also seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to hear all Reasons, and just exceptions, against any whatsoever.</p>
            <p>Nor, shall I need to shew, how sutable our Law is to the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> in providing, that no <hi>Infant, Ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, Alien, Abjured, Perjured,</hi> or <hi>Attaint, Outlaw'd,</hi> or in <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> be of any Enquest, or <hi>Iury</hi>; especially in Case of Life and Death.</p>
            <p>And for <hi>Tryers,</hi> besides all other exceptions; This was thought enough that any of them had been <hi>Indictors</hi>: which maketh <hi>Fortescu</hi> so much to Glory in our Law, that putteth no man to Death, but by the Oath of four and twenty men.</p>
            <p>I should mispend my time to shew it to be the great Law of the Kingdom, as well as of <hi>Nature</hi>; that none may be <hi>Iudg,</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> in their own Cause; which may ere-long be found perhaps, to be the reason, of the <hi>Three Estates</hi>; and very much of our Common Law,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:49639:151"/>
which is punctual in nothing more, than in providing for a clear distinction of <hi>Accusers, Witnesses, Endictors, Tryers,</hi> and <hi>Iudges,</hi> especially in Cases of <hi>Treason</hi>; which upon divers motions, of the Commons in Parliament, have been so often Enacted and declared to be onely Tryable by the course and custom of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> and no otherwise.</p>
            <p>Nay, in Parliament it self, and Parliament Men, there was, and for ought I find, always, the like course observed. For, in Case of a Peer, the Custom of the Kingdom is, to proceed by a special Commission, to one as Lord <hi>Steward,</hi> and 12 others (at least) for a <hi>Iury</hi> of <hi>Tryors</hi>; besides <hi>Accusers</hi> and <hi>Witnesses</hi>; and a formal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment.</hi> And all from Record to Record; or all this is Illegal, if it be onely by the House of Peers.</p>
            <p>If Charge come from the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> they are as Indictors, being more than twelve sworn men, Trustees to the whole Kingdom; and Neighbours to the Fact, or Party, or both. To which also there must be a legal proof by lawful Witnesses, or else the Charge will not suffice.</p>
            <p>And in such <hi>Indictments,</hi> from the Commons; the <hi>Lords</hi> are the <hi>Tryers</hi>; and the <hi>King</hi> may seem as the <hi>Iudg</hi>; but in other Courts also the Judgment goeth of course upon the <hi>Verdict</hi>; and must be entred <hi>per Curiam,</hi> (as adjudged by the <hi>Court</hi>) although there be but one Judge; or tho' his Mouth pronounce not the Sentence. But we are not yet come, to debate the <hi>King</hi>'s Consent, to the <hi>Lords</hi>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:49639:151"/>
Judgment; an <hi>Indictment</hi> from the <hi>Commons</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is also to me very considerable how the House of <hi>Commons</hi> could, or ever did <hi>Indict.</hi> I cannot deny them to have been a Court, and a Court of <hi>Record</hi>; (although some have seemed to question it; and their <hi>Records</hi> are not so ancient as some others.) But I have not fully understood how they ever did make, or receive a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, Legal <hi>Indictment</hi>; when as they did not give a single Oath, much less, Empannel a <hi>Iury,</hi> or <hi>Enquest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yet some, there be, that without a <hi>Writt,</hi> or any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Commission, did and might do, this, <hi>Virtute Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cii</hi>: But they be known, chosen, sworn Officers of the Kingdom, for such Purposes; as the Peeples Bayliffs, <hi>Coroners, Sheriffs, Escheators</hi>; and some Officers about the <hi>Forest</hi>; who, by the <hi>Common Law,</hi> did Summon and Empannel Juries.</p>
            <p>But so did not the House of <hi>Commons.</hi> How then, did they <hi>Indict</hi>?</p>
            <p>Of all Crimes committed in the <hi>House,</hi> they are, and were, so much, the <hi>sole Iudges,</hi> that they seldom use, to complain, much less to <hi>Indict</hi> any other.</p>
            <p>And for any thing done <hi>abroad,</hi> I hope, they do not use to take <hi>Rumours</hi> and <hi>Reports</hi> (though from their own <hi>Members</hi>) to be sufficient for, or equivalent to a legal <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment,</hi> on Oath: Seeing their scarce is, or can be any Case so <hi>notorious,</hi> but it may be pleaded unto by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of <hi>Law,</hi> or <hi>Necessity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And although I should yield the <hi>Commons</hi> to be the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:49639:152"/>
               <hi>Masters</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> in making it; yet they pleased to allow others, to be <hi>Iudges</hi> in their Laws.</p>
            <p>And if they reassume this also, yet it may be more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to judge of some <hi>Law,</hi> than of any <hi>Fact</hi>; at least as it may be <hi>cloathed,</hi> so as a curious search, or <hi>Enquest,</hi> may be requisite to lay it clear and naked.</p>
            <p>Neither can I see, how it may be necessary, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against any by force, or illegal Process, when it is easie, as well as just, to go rightly, as to do right.</p>
            <p>For who can imagine a Case so dark and intricate, but it may be contrived so, that particular men may be <hi>Accusers</hi>; and others <hi>Witnesses?</hi> with a clear and real distinction between <hi>Indictors, Tryers,</hi> and <hi>Iudges</hi>? most of all in Cases notorious and evident. For in such there may be less fear of the <hi>Iuries Verdict</hi> against <hi>Evidence</hi>; or of the <hi>Iudges Sentence</hi> against the <hi>Verdict.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or if this should happen in a Tryal; is there not a most heavy doom appointed by Law for all <hi>Iurors</hi> that <hi>forswear</hi> themselves, and goe against their Evidence?</p>
            <p>Is there not a clear way of Relief, by Writ of <hi>Attaint</hi>? Is it not worse than Death, to forfeit all Estate, and be thrown into Prison; while both Wife and Children must be turned out of Doors and All? For his House must be pulled down, his Ground be plowed up, and his Trees rooted out; with loss of <hi>Franchise</hi>; and with a perpetual Brand of <hi>Villany.</hi> This is the <hi>Common Law</hi> for a <hi>perjured Iuror</hi>; and that also in Petty Cases: how much more might it be just in Case of Life and Death?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="297" facs="tcp:49639:152"/>And for <hi>Corrupt Iudges,</hi> our Law is very severe; altho' we have much lost the Custom of the Grand <hi>Eyres</hi> in this also; &amp; King <hi>Alfred</hi> be long since dead; who hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 30 or 40 more unjust Judges, than <hi>Cambyses</hi> flead. And for that the <hi>Mirror</hi> may be a good Comment on some Passages, in <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Life, by <hi>Asser</hi>: And if it be true, that <hi>Horn</hi> lived to the end of K. <hi>Edward</hi>; it is much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that on such occasion, he did not also mention some of those Judges by him so punished; when there was scarce any left but good <hi>Iohn</hi> of <hi>Mettingham,</hi> and <hi>Elias of Bechingham.</hi> And of this the Dissertations of <hi>Fleta</hi> may be added to all before; as that of Sir <hi>William Thorp</hi> and the Great Judg, in the third Part of <hi>Institutes,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout corrupt <hi>Iudges,</hi> and the <hi>Iudge</hi>'s Oath.</p>
            <p>It is very considerable, how curious the <hi>Iews</hi> were in Creating, or rather Ordaining of Judges. For indeed the Phrase of <hi>Ordination</hi> seemed to be first raised from Them. For which I have little to add to Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> on the <hi>Eutychian,</hi> or <hi>Alexandrian</hi> Antiquities, (as old as St. <hi>Mark</hi> the Evangelist.) Nor can it be denied but the Jewish Judges and Magistrates had a very good Right; and so used (as we find in the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the <hi>Kings,</hi> and <hi>Tirshatha's</hi>) to Read and Expound the <hi>Law Moral</hi> as well as <hi>Iudicial.</hi> Nay, in this, they seemed to have some advantage of the <hi>Priests,</hi> or <hi>Levites</hi> that had work enough most times in that which was but <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial.</hi> This may Expound those Pieces of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Old and New; where we find some explaining
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:49639:153"/>
Scripture; being neither Priests, nor of the Tribe of <hi>Levi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Iews</hi> Punishments, of evil Judges, are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and most remarkable; nay, where all others were again restored to their Offices after Corporal Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, their Lord <hi>Chief Iustice</hi> or <hi>President</hi> of their <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> or any Chief <hi>Iustice,</hi> could never be restored a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after such punishment; no, not to be as one of his inferour Colleagues. So just he ought to be and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect by daily experience, added to his own wisdom.</p>
            <p>Our Laws are so just, and so good, in themselves, that there could not be be so much cause of complaints, in all our Gates, (for such were the <hi>Iews Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi>) if our Judges were such, as they should, and might be. And yet I cannot deny but that there be very great abuses among the Lawyers, and Attorneys, or Solicitors; but if the Judges were as just, and wise as they may be, inferiour Officers would soon amend, or comply for Love or Fear, so much as would prevent Complaints and many of their Causes.</p>
            <p>But it is the work of a God and not of a Man, to reform abuses, in all Courts of Justice. <hi>Hercules</hi> did never cleanse so great, so foul a Stable, or a Stall; yet in this also, a wise and just Parliament, will do much, and will need none of my help, or advice.</p>
            <p>How tender all should Delegates be, in making De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates: But in nothing should they be more tender, or more circumspect, then in this of making Judges; For in these of all Delegates, our law is most scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="299" facs="tcp:49639:153"/>Before the Statute of <hi>Merton,</hi> those that held by suit Service, were bound to appear in Person, because the Suitors were Judges, in causes not their own; but by that Statute, they had power given, to make Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; but it was only, <hi>ad Sectas faciendas,</hi> to make, or follow suites for them, but not to sit as Judges: For, (as the Commentator addeth) they could not depute, or make Attornies in a place and act judicial.</p>
            <p>I will not, I cannot say, the Commons of <hi>England</hi> cannot choose, or constitute their Judges; but this I say, or believe, their delegates ought to be exceeding Curious (I had almost said, exceeding Scrupulous) in making Judges, and in bounding them to law, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, both in way, as well as <hi>End.</hi> I must again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it; That it may not seem enough to settle Judges, just and wise and good: Nor only to provide, that they may do what is just (I speak of end) but men are men, and ought in cases of such consequence, to have their Way, their Rule, and Square, (by which they must proceed) to be prescribed in their Patents or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, that they may do justly too, as well as what is just.</p>
            <p>To me it seemeth to be reason, or the law of nature unto men, that the <hi>Supreme Court,</hi> should so limit all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriours, that it may not be left at large, to their list or pleasure, to condemn or sentence without Hearing, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation, Witness, or without such Process and Tryal, as shall be clear and plain, and so prescribed in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or Commission.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:49639:154"/>If it be not so done, and expressed, I know not what appeal can be, but from the Court, before Judgment: For, what appeal, what writ of <hi>Error,</hi> or what Plea can a man frame upon their Judgment, who have no Rule, no way of process prescribed, and so cannot Err, Transgress, or Exceed their commission, no, not if they should without all accusation, proof, or witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses condemn one to be sliced and fryed with exquisite tortures. They are Judges, but unlimited in way of Process, infinite and purely <hi>Arbitrary.</hi> No they are <hi>Men,</hi> and so they must be <hi>Rational</hi> and <hi>Iust</hi>; which was presupposed by them that gave so vast power.</p>
            <p>They may be <hi>Iust</hi> indeed, and so they should, but yet no thanks for this to their <hi>Commission,</hi> if it do not bound, and limit out their way and manner of Process, as it doth their work, and <hi>Object,</hi> or their <hi>End</hi>; which was the wont of English Parliaments, who were Just and wise themselves, that they did see or fear it might be possible for their <hi>Committees,</hi> to be most <hi>Unjust</hi> and <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary,</hi> if they were not most exactly limited.</p>
            <p>Of all Commissions, none were more curiously drawn and Pointed out by our Ancestors, than those of especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi>; because the cases were not only heinous (so they ought to be;) but such as for some extr ordinary cause emergent, seemed to be as it were <hi>Extra Iudicial,</hi> and such as could not stay, and abide the usual process of the settled Courts of Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:49639:154"/>Yet of these also did our Fathers take most especial care, that they might be <hi>Iust</hi> (in <hi>Way</hi> as well as <hi>End</hi>) and that they might not be <hi>too High</hi> in <hi>Iustice</hi>; for it seems that they had also learned an usual saying of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, <hi>Summum jus est injuria</hi>: So that in divers of the Saxons Laws, we find <hi>High Iustice (Summum Ius)</hi> to be as much forbidden as <hi>Injustice.</hi> And I should tremble at it, as an ill Omen to hear Authority commanded, the the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> or any other Court, should be now Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bench of <hi>High-Iustice</hi>: For in <hi>Iustice,</hi> the higher men goe up, the worse, or so at least it was esteemed by our Ancestors.</p>
            <p>Their constant limitation was in every such Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, <hi>Thus</hi> and <hi>thus you shall proceed; but still according to the Laws and Customs of England: Secundum Legem &amp; Consuetudinem Angliae</hi>; and no otherwise, that is, as <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tescu</hi> will say, <hi>you shall be pittiful in Iustice, and more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then all the world, besides this Kingdom.</hi> And if such a limitation were not expressed, this was enough to prove the Commission, Unjust and Illegal; which is so well known to all Lawyers, that I need not cite <hi>N.

            <p>Nay, in King <hi>Iames,</hi> among the great debates of U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting <hi>Scotland</hi> to <hi>England,</hi> when it was driven up so close, that instead of <hi>Secundum Legem &amp; Consuetudinem Angliae,</hi> it might be <hi>Secundum Legem &amp; Consuetudinem Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae</hi>;
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:49639:155"/>
It was resolved by all Judges, that there could not be, that little change but of one word (that doth so limit such Commissions) but by consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>And in divers Parliaments of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Hen.</hi> 4<hi>th.</hi> there were many Statutes made, to limit all Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi>; as that they must never be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but before; and to some of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> of the <hi>Bench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> or of the Grand <hi>Eyre.</hi> Nor those to be named by <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> but by the <hi>Court</hi>: And with this usual Restriction according to the known clause of the <hi>Statute of Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster the</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward the</hi> 1<hi>st.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Printed Statute must be compared with the Roll, and with the 2<hi>d</hi> of <hi>Ed. the</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> for else, there may be in this (as in other Printed Acts) a great mistake, by leaving out, or changing one particle: for that Clause, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be for heinous offence,</hi> hath such influence into all the words before; that by the known Common Law a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persedeas</hi> doth lye to such Commissions, <hi>quia non enormis Transgressio</hi>; as the Register may teach us.</p>
            <p>And although by Law there may be granted a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Association; with a Writ of <hi>Admittance,</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the <hi>Iudges,</hi> assigned for <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi>: yet in all those Commissions and Writs the Rule must be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, <hi>quod ad Iustitiam pertinet</hi>; and that also according <hi>to the Law and Custom of the Kingdom,</hi> which is so much the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> that I need not wonder at the great Judg, who in all his <hi>Institutes,</hi> and so many <hi>Reports,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:49639:155"/>
those words absolutely necessary to the work of a <hi>Lawful Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for more prevention, or Redress of injustice and Arbitrary Process, were our Ancestors so punctual in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring <hi>Records</hi> of all Proceedings in the Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; which is so agreable to <hi>Reason,</hi> and the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> That the whole Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, cannot it self proceed in matters of highest concernment, but by <hi>Record.</hi> Much less can it Licence other Courts, to be without, or above <hi>Record</hi> in such Affairs.</p>
            <p>It is so well known to be the custom of the Kingdom, that I shall not need to shew it in the Statute of <hi>York,</hi> in <hi>Edw.</hi> 2d. and many others, in affirmance of the great Charter, <hi>nisi per Legem Terrae (But by the Law of the Land.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. it was, in full Parliament declared to be the <hi>Law of the Land</hi>; that none should be put to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer but upon <hi>presentment before Iustices, or matter of Record.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the 2d. of <hi>Westminster</hi> is very punctual in requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Records</hi> for all legal exceptions, (as well as other matters;) and provideth, that in case an <hi>Exception</hi> should not appear on <hi>Record,</hi> the Party must produce the <hi>Iudge's Seal</hi>; which may be required by <hi>Writ,</hi> and cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; no not in such <hi>Exceptions</hi> as the present Court do <hi>over-rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for Enrolling <hi>Records,</hi> the same Statute provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, That the King should not Erect Offices, or Elect Officers for <hi>Enrollment</hi>; Fot that by the Common Law
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:49639:156"/>
this did belong to the Courts themselves, and Judges therein: As to the Sheriff also, to Elect the County <hi>Clerk</hi> for <hi>Enrollments</hi>; so that the King himself could not Elect him, as we find in <hi>Mitton</hi>'s Case. So punctual is our Law, in all, concerning <hi>Rolls, Enrollments</hi> and <hi>Records.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which is also the Law of <hi>Nature</hi>; and for many Reasons. As for that of Appeal, to which all Courts on Earth must willingly submit. Nay Heaven it self ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits <hi>Appeal,</hi> from its justice to its mercy; so it would to Justice also by some <hi>Writ of Error</hi> if it could commit an error. But however, that its Judgments may be cleared to be just, it also proceedeth by Record. For God hearkeneth, as the Prophet saith, when ought is good, (when they meet and speak well together; a Record is made, and bound up as a Jewel;) and when evil also, some are Watchers to Record it. For the Books shall be opened, and we shall all be judged by the Record of Heaven, and our own Consciences, which are now foul Draughts, but shall then be as fair and clear as those of Heaven it self.</p>
            <p>But in Courts on Earth, if there be no Records, there is scarce devisable a legal Traverse or Tryal, whether all be right, or appeal if any thing be wrong. For what Appeal can any man make from that which doth not appear? but it is only a Transient Air or Breath, which may as soon be denied as it was spoken!</p>
            <p>How can Errors, not appearing, be corrected or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Parliament it self, or any other Court,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:49639:156"/>
but onely that keepeth Records of all our thoughts, as much as of our words or actions.</p>
            <p>I may be tedious in shewing how our Law hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allowed Appeals in Ecclesiasticals; They were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in the Assizes of <hi>Clarendon</hi> in opposition to <hi>Appeals Foreign,</hi> which were first attempted by <hi>Anselm,</hi> as some affirm, but the Date is later. And the Lord <hi>Dier,</hi> of <hi>Appeals,</hi> is now printed in the 4th. part of <hi>Institutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judgment of <hi>Delegates,</hi> on such <hi>Appeals,</hi> is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>definitive</hi>: And yet not so but that it may be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed by a Court below the Parliament: for which we have the <hi>Commission of Review</hi> granted upon the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates</hi>; nay and upon High Commission it Self, as by a Clause in that Commission appeareth. To which may be added <hi>Killingworth</hi>'s Case, and divers others.</p>
            <p>Of the Court <hi>Admiral,</hi> much I might add from the Laws of <hi>Olerom</hi> in <hi>Richard</hi> the 1st. and the Rolls of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 3d. and <hi>Edward</hi> the 1st. of which also the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator on <hi>Littleton's continual Claim</hi>; and the 22 Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the last part of <hi>Institutes.</hi> How it lieth open to the common Law, and to daily <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> may be fully seen in its Complaints to King <hi>Iames,</hi> which were as fully answered by all the Judges.</p>
            <p>It is no Court of Record, and so did all the Judges declare in 8 <hi>Iacobi</hi>; yet it must keep Records enough to ground an <hi>Appeal</hi>; which lieth from thence (as from Courts Ecclesiastical) to <hi>Iudges delegate</hi>; of which the 8th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and other Statutes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="306" facs="tcp:49639:157"/>
               <hi>County, Hundred, Baron</hi> Courts; and those of <hi>Antient Demesne,</hi> (with all <hi>Close Writs</hi>) are not of <hi>Record.</hi> The <hi>Sutors</hi> are the <hi>Iudges</hi> (as was said before) in Cases not their own. And some have thought they did proceed (much by fancie) without legal Proof and Witnesses, till the great Charter, commanding all <hi>Bayliffs</hi> to put no man upon <hi>Oath,</hi> without <hi>faithful Witnesses.</hi> But we have found the Charter long before King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. And in that Phrase of <hi>Bayliffs</hi> (which in <hi>France</hi> are Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and Magistrates, as in eldest Towns or Cities with us) some great Lawyers include all <hi>Iudges,</hi> as <hi>Fleta</hi> with the <hi>Mirror</hi>; which also calleth <hi>Coroners</hi> the Peoples <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs</hi>; and the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Returns are <hi>de Baliva.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These inferiour Courts being not of <hi>Record,</hi> held petty Pleas of Debt or Damages, under 40 <hi>s</hi>: (Antient <hi>Demesn</hi> had other prviledges) but not of forceable Trespass, <hi>Vi &amp; Armis</hi> (finable to the Crown.) Yet these also must keep Copies or some such Records as may suffice for <hi>Appeals.</hi> For they may be questioned, and their Proceedings being denied shall be Tryed by <hi>Iury,</hi> and upon their judgments lyeth a Writ of <hi>false judgment</hi>; not a Writ of <hi>Error.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But in the Case of <hi>Redisseison</hi> the Sheriff is <hi>Iudg</hi> by the Statute of <hi>Merton</hi>; and a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> lieth on his judgment. But in Case of <hi>Debt, Detinue, Trespass,</hi> or other action above 40 <hi>s.</hi> where in the County the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff holdeth Plea by force of a Writ (or Commission) of <hi>Iustices</hi>; the <hi>Sutors</hi> are still the <hi>Iudges,</hi> and no Writ of <hi>Error,</hi> but false judgment lieth on them. Nor doth
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49639:157"/>
the <hi>Coroner's</hi> judgment of <hi>Out-Lawry</hi> in the County Court forfeit Goods till it be returned and appear on Record<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nay, the Coroners Certificate, on a <hi>Certiorari,</hi> did not disable the <hi>Out-Law</hi> (although the King might seize his Goods) till the Return of the <hi>Exigent, Quinquies Exact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But a Writ of <hi>Error</hi> is proper to Record, and from Record, and a Plea of <hi>Nul tiel Record</hi> is not tryable by Witness or <hi>Iury,</hi> but onely by it self in a Court Record. Such are the Sheriffs Turns, and from them (as from <hi>Counties, Hundreds</hi>) came the Court <hi>Leets</hi>; which may be held by prescription against the <hi>Great Charter</hi>: In which <hi>Leets</hi> the Steward is <hi>Iudg</hi>; as in the <hi>Turns</hi> the Sheriff and Bishop was, till the first <hi>Norman,</hi> who by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament exempted the <hi>Clergy</hi> (as was touched before.) But the Laws of <hi>Henry</hi> I. bring them again into the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</hi> So also the 10th. of <hi>Marlbridg</hi>; and before it the Laws of <hi>Clarenden</hi> for all <hi>Barons,</hi> or Tenant <hi>in Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te</hi> to attend the Great Court till Sentence of Life or Member, which continued long in the Parliament also.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Turn</hi> enquireth of Common <hi>Nusance,</hi> and of <hi>Felonies; de Furtis &amp; medletis,</hi> whence our <hi>Chance,</hi> or <hi>Chaud Medly</hi>; hot Debate or sudden Fray: see the Notes on <hi>Hengham</hi>) but not of Murder, or Death of Man; which alone (of all Felony) belongeth to the Coroner. He was a very antient Officer, and ought to be made a Knight; for which the Register and Rolls of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. where a Merchant, chosen Coroner, was removed, <hi>quia communis Mercator.</hi> He must have a
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:49639:158"/>
good Estate, and might receive nothing (of Subjects) fot doing his Office. But by late Statute he hath a <hi>Mark on Indictment of Murder</hi>: yet upon Death by mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he must take nothing. See the Comments on the 1st. of <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Coroner's Court is of Record; and he may take Appeals as well as Indictments (upon view of the Body) and must enter them, but cannot proceed, but deliver them up to the Iustices (which is as antient as the <hi>Great Charter</hi>) for the next Gaol-delivery, or the King's Bench sometimes also; he is <hi>locum tenens</hi> to the Sheriff; and he standeth when the King dieth. When also so many think there is no Sheriff; but it may be more considered.</p>
            <p>I must not stay in the Court of <hi>Peepoudres,</hi> (incident to every Fair or Market, as a Court Baron to a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) although it be a Court of Record; and a Writ of Error lyeth on its judgment; for which <hi>Iones</hi> and <hi>Hall's</hi> Case in the 10th Part of <hi>Reports,</hi> and in the 4th <hi>Institutes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not speak of Writs of Error from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Pleas to the Kings Bench; from the King's Bench to the Exchequer-Chamber; and from thence (as from the King's Bench also) to the Parliament; or of the known Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. making it Felony to steal, withdraw, or avoid Records, or any parcel of Record.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="309" facs="tcp:49639:158"/>But of no <hi>Records,</hi> is the Law more punctual than in of extraordinary Cases, of <hi>Oyer and Terminer,</hi> which were more private oft, and less fixed, being transient on emergent Cases; which yet being heinous, seemed to require most exact <hi>Records,</hi> especially because there might be Appeal so just and needful, if the Judges exceeded but one tittle of their <hi>Commission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were discontinued or expired, then the <hi>Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and all <hi>Records</hi> were to meet in their proper Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the King's Bench: but in other Cases Records of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi> were sent into the Exchequer. So in <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3d. As in <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Results on charitable uses, and the like, were to the Chancery by Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The <hi>great Seal</hi> was the Soul to inform and actuate the <hi>Body of Records</hi> in all exemplifications from the Rolls; in all Writs Pattents or Commissions; and the rather also, that by this nothing of moment might be hudled up, but duly weighed and considered, while it passed so many hands and judgments as it should before the Sealing.</p>
            <p>Nor shall I add, that an Act of Parliament it Self is not pleadable in a Court of Record, but from <hi>Record,</hi> or under the <hi>Seal</hi>; whence the old custom was to remove the Records of Parliament by a Writ of <hi>Certiorari</hi> into the Chancery; thence, by the Lord <hi>Chancellor,</hi> into the Kings Bench; and thence, by a <hi>Mittimus</hi> into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Plea and Exchequer; with an usual Writ command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:49639:159"/>
all the Courts to keep and observe such Acts of Parliament, which of Old were Proclaimed by the Sheriffs, and were put under the Seal; (as we may see by the Proclamation now printed among the Statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3d.) and they were not hudled into Print in those Days; not of such vertue in Print as on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and under the Seal. For there were not then such Printers, or Copiers that (without much caution) our fore-Fathers durst trust with all their Lives and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states; which by one dash of a Pen the change of a <hi>not,</hi> a <hi>with,</hi> a <hi>to,</hi> a <hi>for</hi> or a <hi>from,</hi> might be soon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed or enslaved.</p>
            <p>Much less then should a Court of Record be Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but by Record; yea, and that be shewed under the Seal also. For when the Seal was moulded, our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors ordained that no Jurisdiction should be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able but under the Seal, which should be known, and obeyed by all the People; as the <hi>Mirror</hi> discourseth at large.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Edw.</hi> the 4th. it was resolved by all the Judges, in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> that no man could be a <hi>Iudg</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> by Writ (which was also Sealed) but by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Pattent, or a publick Commission. But the <hi>Lord Chief Iustice of England</hi> hath of late no such Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Pattent, yea a Sealed Writ; and of Old he was also Created by Pattent till about the end of King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 3d. if good Authors deceive me not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:49639:159"/>It seemeth also somewhat disputable, whether he were not included in the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. for Commissions to the Judges, by Letters Pattent under the Seal.</p>
            <p>However, the words are plain enough, for <hi>Iustices of Eyre</hi>; which of Old were also by Writ, as those of <hi>Oyer and Terminer</hi>; but now not to be but by Comissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Pattent under the Great Seal.</p>
            <p>Which Commission should also be read and shewed in Court lest there be some kind of <hi>Demurrer,</hi> or excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto jurisdiction, which hath been in some Cases at the Kings Bench, and may be by Law to all now Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges by special Commission, except it be produced un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Seal, if the old Books deceive us not; who do do not onely ascribe all jurisdiction to the Seal, but in all legal exceptions ever admit of that to the <hi>Iudg,</hi> if he be a Party, or have not jurisdiction, or be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise incompetent.</p>
            <p>That the Parliament also will never Erect or Create any Court of Record, but by Record, and open Commission under the Great Seal, I do the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, because the Seal is so proper and peculiar to the Parliament, being made by common consent; (of which the <hi>Mirror,</hi> and others at large) and by such common consent used and committed to the special care of the Chancellor, or Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as he was called for keeping that which our Fathers esteemed as the Kingdoms Key or <hi>Clavis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="312" facs="tcp:49639:160"/>It is well known how King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d. was brought to acknowledg, That among all great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> or <hi>Chancellor</hi> did especially belong to the Choice of the Parliament: and <hi>Ralph Nevil</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others refused to yield up the Seal to the King when it was demanded, saying that he had received it by the Common Councel of the Kingdom, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Warrant he would not deliver it; of which both <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the continual use of this Seal in Parliament, it is the Law and Custom of the Kingdom, that the Lord <hi>Keeper</hi> shall have place in Parliament still to be there with the Sael (although he be often no <hi>Peer,</hi> and have no Vote but) for making and Sealing of Charters, Pattents, Commissions and Writs framed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>For although the Register (made or continued by Parliament,) be now so full that there be little need; yet the framing of <hi>New Writs</hi> was a great work of <hi>Old Parliaments,</hi> as appeareth in the Books and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, as in that of <hi>Westminster</hi> the 2d. <hi>de Casu con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simili.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as if the Parliament had made no Laws at all, but onely New Writs the <hi>Old Modus</hi> brancheth out all the Laws of Parliament into Originals, Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Executives, which all know to he the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Writs; Those especially <hi>de Cursu,</hi> drawn by the Cursitors; for <hi>Brevia Magistralia</hi> were let to
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:49639:160"/>
be framed by the <hi>Masters of Chancery,</hi> as appeareth at large in <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Fleta</hi> and in the Oath of the <hi>Six Clerks,</hi> or other Clerks of Chancery in <hi>Ed.</hi> 3 with that of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>de casu continili</hi>; in which Statute it is asol provided, that if the <hi>Masters</hi> could not agree in framing such a <hi>new Writ,</hi> they might, if they saw cause, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spit the Parties till the next Parliament, that so it might be formed by Advice of all the great Lawyers of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Yet besides this of making and sealing of <hi>Writs,</hi> there was another work, and great use of the <hi>Masters of Chancery</hi> in Parliament: Which was the <hi>Receiving of Petitions,</hi> (As the Rolls of most times witness) It being the old <hi>Mode</hi>; and others accounted it somewhat against Reason, that Petitions should be taken and brought into the House, by those that were to debate and determine them, and so might at pleasure keep them <hi>Out,</hi> or too hastily might press them in.</p>
            <p>Whereas they were to be filled up in course, and so to be debated as they were received, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entrusted to the care of known and sworn Officers of the Kingdom: Although of late, their work in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament be so strangely degenerate from that it was of old: when also beside <hi>Receivers,</hi> there were some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for <hi>Tryers of Petitions,</hi> who (as it seemeth) were to enquire of matter of Fact, expressed in the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it might be cleared and rightly stated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came to be debated in full Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:49639:161"/>I do not deny but these <hi>Triers of Petitions</hi> were most frequently some of the Bishops, and other Barons: But by this I am not convinced, that the Lords had by <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Legislative</hi> Power, or were <hi>the</hi> sole <hi>Determinors</hi> of all Petitions, as some would infer; or that they were the sole Judges; except also the Petty Jury that are Tryers of Fact, shall be esteemed the sole Judges of Matters of Law.</p>
            <p>And yet I shall not deny, but Petitions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuses or errors in Judicature were often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermined by the Lords as the great Judges; but of error in the King's Bench, as Judges above the King, (as was shewed before) or from the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. In Queen <hi>Ellzabeths</hi> Time, for the seldom meeting, or great Affairs of Parliament, the Writs of Error from the King's Bench were by special Act of Parliament to be brought before the Judges of the Common Pleas, and Barons of the Exchequer, and by them to be determined.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But with these express Limitations, as the Law shall require; other than for Errors to be assigned, or found, for, or concerning the Iurisdiction of the said Court of Kings Bench, or for want of form in any Writ, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, Verdict</hi> &amp;c. and that after all, <hi>the Records, and all concerning them, be remanded to the King's Bench, as well for execution as otherwise, as shall appertain; and (with this express Proviso) That any Party agrieved by such Iudgment, in the Exchequer, shall and may sue in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:49639:161"/>
for a further and due Examination.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which I do not see such Parties agreed were abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely tied to Petition the Lords onely, although it were onely in a Case judicial. Yet I deny not but in <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. there was a Committee made of a Bishop, two Earls, and two Barons to hear and determine all Petitions complaining of Delays or Grievances in Courts of Justice.</p>
            <p>But with great Limitations, so that they must send for the Records and Judges, which were to to be present, and be heard, and then by good advice of the Chancellor, Treasurer, Judges (and other of the Council) to make an Accord; yet so that all be remanded to the Judges before whom the Cause did first depend, who were then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Judgment according to the Accord of the said Committee.</p>
            <p>And in Case it seemed to them to be such as might not well be determined but in full Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that then the said Records or Tenors should be brought by the said Commitee to the next Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; it being the Common Law of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and so expressed in all the old Books, that all new, unwonted, difficult matters of consequence should still be brought and submitted to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of full Parliament, so that all our Iudges did, and ought to respit such Causes till the next Parliament, of which there be almost innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:49639:162"/>
Precedents in all the Rolls.</p>
            <p>Nay, in <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. there was a Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Lords and Commons appointed to hear and determine all Petitions present in that Parliament. But afterwards it was adjudged and declared, That such a Commission ought not to be given; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting or betraying the High Power of Parliament into a few private hands; as we may learn out of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th. beside other times.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Modi of Parliament</hi> admit that some extraordinary Cases, where the Estates could not agree (or the greater part of the Knights, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, Citizens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) There, by consent of the whole Parliament, the Matter might be compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to 25. chosen out of all Degrees, and to fewer, till at length it might come to 3. who might determine the Case, except that being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it were corrected by Assent of Parliament and not otherwise.</p>
            <p>And this seemeth to be the Law of Nature and right Reason, That Delegates should not delegate others, which was one reason why the Commons never made <hi>Pracies</hi> as the Lords did. Nor might any Committee so determine but there might be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from it to the Parliament. Nor doth the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament it Self conclude so, but that there may be Appeal from its self to its self, even to its <hi>Iustice</hi> if it erre, or at least to its mercy by some motion or Petition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="317" facs="tcp:49639:162"/>In one Parliament of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d. it was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted, that no man condemned by Parliament should move for Pardon; but another Parliament 10 years after did annul this Branch, as unjust, unreasonable and against the Law and Custom of Parliament. For from this, which is the highest here, there still lieth Appeal from its Self to its Self. For which also, by the Laws and Customs of the Kingdom, there were to be frequent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that so the errors or omissions of one (being still human, and therefore errable) might be corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and amended in another.</p>
            <p>By express Statutes of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3d. we are to have Parliaments once every year, <hi>and oftner if need be.</hi> They were of Old three or four times a year, as may be found in all the Old Historians, speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the great Feats in the <hi>Militia</hi> in King <hi>Alfred</hi>'s Time, they were to be twice a year; and that at <hi>London</hi> as the <hi>Mirror</hi> affirmeth, which we compared with the Laws of the <hi>Confessor</hi>: And I speak also of King <hi>Edgars</hi> and <hi>Canutes</hi> Laws for the <hi>Celeberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Conventus ex qualibet Satrapta,</hi> which the Great <hi>Iudg</hi> applieth to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>Eternity it self would be a Burthen unto him that is not pleased with his Being: so would Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence to him that is unhappy in his acting: It was therefore goodness in God to limit man, as well in Doing as in Being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="318" facs="tcp:49639:163"/>It was also the Wisdom of our Ancestors to bound and limit out the Being, Acting, and continuing not onely of other Judges, but also of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Yet the <hi>Old Modi of Parliament</hi> agree in this, That a Parliament should not be Dissolved till all Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were discussed and answered; and that after all there should be Proclamation made in some open place, whether any had a Petition or just Address to the Parliament; and if none replied then it was to be Dissolved.</p>
            <p>I need not shew the Care of our Ancestors, or former Parliaments for most strict observation of their own good Orders and Customs of Parliament, which are such so just and reasonable, that they well deserve a peculiar Discourse by themselves; and suppose it not impossible to clear them more by the practice and consent of most Ages in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, which might also be useful for the Times to come.</p>
            <p>And although it might be possible to find some of their old custome fit to be changed; yet my hope is they will retain and observe such Rules of right Reason, good Orders and Customs as may still make this an Happy Nation; and that they will be mindful of their great Trust; for which they are accountable: And however it may be in this World, yet they also must be judged at his coming, who
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:49639:163"/>
shall bring every Work into Iudgment with every secret Thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil? And I am not ashamed both to long and pray for his coming; <hi>who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords</hi>; The Prince of <hi>Salem,</hi> that is <hi>Peace,</hi> as well as <hi>King of Righteousness, Melchizedek,</hi> the Lamb upon the white Thone.</p>
            <p>All the Creation groaneth; and the Spirit and the Bride saith, come Lord Iesus, come quickly.</p>
