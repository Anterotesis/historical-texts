            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>1. First the most <hi>lamentable estate of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of</hi> Germanie, <hi>and other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries in</hi> Europe: Where the Gospel did shine, and Gods worshippe was exercised fruitfullie to his glorie: But nowe by the crueltie of the preuailing <hi>Papists,</hi> fearefull desolation is wrought in these places, GODS Sainctes bereft of their liues, their blood spilt as water in the streetes, their women shamefullie abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, their goods taken from them: And the estate of them who haue escaped the rage of the sword, worse than the slaine. Their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties lost and themselues either driuen from their dwellings or compelled to forsake their God &amp; Religion, &amp; take themselues to Romish Idolatrie, or to banishment. And vnder the name of an Imperiall reformation, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:21139:4"/>
but a <hi>Godlesse deformation,</hi> setting vp the abomination of ignorance, and errour where the light hath beene.</p>
            <p>How many Prouences sometimes pleasant, in a peaceable professing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Trueth, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise of God, are now turned in a wildernesse: And the Houses of God prepared sometime on the top of the Mountaines, and exalted aboue the Hills, wherevnto people did flowe, are destroyed: And the Lords displayed banner, vnder which many did merch in comelie order, is cast down, &amp; manie mothers in Israel, <hi>famous Colledges and Universities</hi> are scattered, and the abomination of desolation erected in them.</p>
            <p>So wee may say with the Prophet, <hi>Come, &amp; behold the workes of the Lord, what desolations hee hath wrought in the Earth.</hi> Psal. 16. 8. <hi>The Heathen are come in the inheritance of the Lord, his holie Temple haue they defiled, and made Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem heapes of stones: The dead bodies of Gods Saincts haue they giuen to bee meate to the Fowles of heauen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the flesh of thy Saincts to the beastes of the earth: Their blood haue they shed as water a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Ierúsalem, and there was none to burie them: They haue deuoured Iacob, and made his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling place waste.</hi> Psal 79. 1. 3. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath forsaken the Tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among them: He deliuered his strength in captiuitie, and his glorie in the enemies hand.</hi> Psal. 78. 61.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:21139:4"/>And wee may lament with <hi>Ieremie. How doeth the Citie remaine solitarie, that was full of people? Shee is a widow: Shee that was great among the Nations, And Princesse among the Prouince is made tributarie.</hi> And wee may wish with that same Prophet, <hi>Oh, that mine head were waters, and mine eyes a Fountaine of teares, that I might weepe day and night, for the slaine of the Daughter of my people.</hi> Ierem. 9. 1<note place="margin">5.</note>
            </p>
            <p>This worke is a part of Antichrists persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for now hee is both breathing threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings &amp; slaughter, against the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and executeth his crueltie against them, because of their obedience to Gods voyce in comming out of Babell, and that according to the bloodie decrees of the Counsell of <hi>Trent.</hi> For after that Sathan had for a long space ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his <hi>first propertie of lying</hi> by Antichrist his first borne involuing and holding these We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne places of <hi>Europe</hi> vnder the errours of a false Religion: And seeing that Manger his malice, God in the appointed time brought in the Light of the Gospel, and discouered that darkenesse: Then hee tooke him to his other <hi>propertie and practise of blood,</hi> to maintaine by force his discouered Heresies: And hee set An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist and his supposts to worke, to put out the Light of the Gospel, in destroying the professours of it.</p>
            <p>So the indyting of the Counsell of <hi>Trent</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:21139:5"/>
beares: <hi>Ad reformandum Ecclesiam &amp; exstirpan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das Haeresies, To reforme the Kirke, and roote out Heresies;</hi> That is to say in the Romane sense, <hi>To confirme and establish the deformities and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of their Church, and roote out the Trueth,</hi> which God hath brought in againe by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. And from that tyme, hee hath sent out his <hi>Emissaries, Iesuites</hi> and other <hi>Locusts</hi> from the bottomlesse pit, to stirre vp the Kings of the Earth to fight against the Lambe: This is the quarrell now debated in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And albeit hee hath cast in the mixture of<note place="margin">6.</note> ciuill respects, in rights to Kingdomes and Dignities, and such like, to blind the eyes of the simple, as to make them belieue that all these warres are onelie for ciuill and not for Sacred things: Yet sure it is, that all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is directed and sweyed by the <hi>Pope:</hi> For his maine end is to roote out the Gospel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish his false Religion: His purpose serueth to the end of his associat Kings &amp; Princes, and their power serueth his end. As they plotte and worke joyntlie in the worke, so they share in the end for their seuerall aduantage: For the Countreyes subdued, fall as a prey and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the enlarging of Princes Dominions, and therein Idolatrie is established, as the <hi>Popes</hi> recompence.</p>
            <p>Beside, what euer be the mixture of the cause, yet their maine intention is manifeste from
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:21139:5"/>
themselues: For one of them in his alarme to this warre, stirreth vp the <hi>Emperour to destroy the Protestants, as Moses did the Moabits: And if he did not so, his life should goe for their life, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabs</hi> for the King of <hi>Syria. Sciopp. Classicum belli Sacri. cap.</hi> 1. 2. 18.</p>
            <p>Next, their <hi>Cardinals</hi> consulting, how to restore their Church to her auncient integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie aduised the <hi>Pope, that there was no better way to doe it, than by prosecuting this warre, to the roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out of Protestants.</hi> Aphorisml.

            <p>God doeth so afflict his Church, not for her<note place="margin">7.</note> Religion, but for the abuse of it: He hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs out of <hi>Babell,</hi> and wee haue obeyed his voyce in comming out, and haue vndertaken to walke in the Light of God; but wee haue contemned that Light, and in the midst of it brought out the workes of darknesse: Sinne is grieuous in euery person, tyme, and place, but most grieuous in the Church, in the time of so cleare a Light: And where euer men sin, they are in Gods sight, but his eye in a more particular manner is ouer his Church.</p>
            <p>A Father is angrie at faults in his seruant, but more angrie at them in his Sonne: The more liberall and bountifull God is to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the greater is their sinne, and heauier shall bee their judgement <hi>Woe to thee Chora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, woe to thee Bethsaida, for if the great works which were done in you, had beene done in Tyrus and Sydon, they had repented long agoe in sack-cloth and ashes: But I say to you it shall bee more easie for Tyrus and Sydon at the last day than for you.</hi> Matth. 11. 21. 22.

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:21139:6"/>God may justlie compleane of vs, as hee did of the Iewes. <hi>Hee planted a Vineyard in a fruitefull Hill, and fencedit, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choisest Vines, and built a Tower in the midst of it, and a Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse in it: And hee looked that it should bring foorth Grapes, but it brought foorth wylde grapes: And now, O Inhabitants of Ierusalem, and men of Iudah, iudge I pray you betweene mee and my Vine-yard: What could I doe more to my Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, than I haue done? And now I will tell you what I will doe to my Vine-yard, I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall bee eaten vp, and breake down the wall thereof, and it shall bee troden downe, and I will lay it waste.</hi> Esa. 5. 1. 2. 3. 4.</p>

            <p>Thus God dealt with the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and after<note place="margin">8.</note> the like manner hee is now dealing with the Churches reformed, to bring them to amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement in time, that they may eschew a finall destruction: Their heauie calamities who are now vnder that bloodie persecution of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, are cleare documents to vs in this Land, commanding vs in time to turne to God, lest the like or a worse befall vs.</p>

and reproach, and the wall of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> broken downe, and the gates thereof burnt with fire, hee sate downe and weeped, and mourned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine dayes, and fasted and prayed before the God of Heauen. Neither could all his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie happinesse smoother the griefe of his heart: But when the King perceiued the sadnes of his countenance, and asked the cause of it, he said, <hi>VVhy should not my countenance bee sadde, when the Citie, and House of the Sepulchre of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers lyeth waste.</hi> Nehemia. 1.

            <p>And <hi>Ieremiah,</hi> though hee was at libertie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people, and well looked to by <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaradan,</hi> yet when hee saw <hi>Ierusalems</hi> desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: <hi>For these thinges I weepe, mine eyes casteth out water, because the Comforter that should refresh my Soule is farre from mee, my Children are deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, because the enemie preuaileth.</hi> Lame. 1. 16.</p>
            <p>Beside, the respect of their persons, their<note place="margin">10</note> cause should also moue vs to this holy griefe: The Gospel of Christ &amp; true Religion in them, is persecuted and oppressed: And if wee haue found grace and comfort in that Gospel, should we not be grieued whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so glorious a meanes of grace is obscured, and the cause of our good God borne downe by his enemies. God hath lighted that candle, to discouer the darknesse

            <p>We ought then a brotherlie compassion to<note place="margin">10</note> them, vnder their trouble, because they are Brethren, and fellow members of Iesus Christ, and the more, because their affliction, is not for ciuill or common causes, but for Religion: As wee are commanded to mourne, with them that mourne, so much more, with them that suffer for the Gospel: <hi>Bee partaker of the suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Gospel, according to the power of God.</hi> 2.

            <p>Shall Sathan make errour and heresie, so forcible in his Supposts, as to joyne their heartes and hands, to giue their power to the Beaste, to fight against the Lambe? And shall not Trueth and Charitie, in the Children of God, procure at least, a brotherlie compassion

of the griefes of other? The first is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to see the Spirit of diuision make such an union among his adherents: But it is a greater wonder, not to see that compassion in them who are one Spirit in Christ Iesus.<note place="margin">12</note>
            </p>
            <p>But though wee would in the hardnesse of our heart cutte our selues off from all feeling of their miseries, that would not secure vs from punishment but rather double our sinne, and hasten a double punishment vpon vs: Wee stand in that same case with them: In a true Religion, in the abuse of it, and so vnder Gods processe for our sins: And it is a great mercie of God, that hee hath spared vs so long, and giuen vs so large a time of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: When hee might haue begunne his Iudgement at vs, hee hath begunne at other, that by their example we might turne in time, &amp; preuent his heauie strok: If forraine miseries beyond Sea, will not moue vs to sorrow, let our own home sins &amp; da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers moue vs to repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tance.<note place="margin">13</note>
            </p>
            <p>And for this ende, wee haue to consider, our owne state in this Land, <hi>as the second cause of our Humiliation:</hi> God hath blessed vs with his Law &amp; Gospel, but we haue sinned against them both: There is no precept of the Law, whose breach is not shameleslie practised &amp; avowed 1.

from their own heart, and turning all to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. 2. <hi>Idolatrie</hi> (once alluterlie banished) is cropen in, and setteth vp the head in this Land, and manie who professed the Trueth, are gone backe to Poperie: They close their eyes from the shining light, that is readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue and reforme them: And are so possessed by errors and darkenes, that they abhorre the light, which wold pull them out of their fleshly delights. Their case is to be pitied. who so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie losse themselues, refusing Saluation, and running head-long to Hell. 3. The abuse of the <hi>glorious Name</hi> of the Lord our God, is gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen a popular disease, &amp; reigneth in all Estats, &amp; the better sort out-run the common people in so grieuous a sinne. And the rifenesse of it hath put it out of the respect of a sinne, and hath turned it in the flower of their language, as though all speech were but wersh, and could neither fill the mouth of the speaker, not the eare of the hearer, except the Name of GOD bee profaned, and God himselfe thereby thrust through.

more libertie is taken in vaging, in drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, &amp; chalmering, &amp; wantonnesse, in idle and profane speaking in it, than in other days: As if God had set it a part, not for his owne honour, but for the workes of the flesh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Though wee bee not bound to judaize in the Sabbath, yet are wee bound Christianlie to spend the Lords day in abstaining from euill, and busying our selfe in the works of Pietie &amp; Charitie, as the Sabbaths proper Exercise: as a memoriall of the Resurrection of Christ, &amp; our Redemption perfected thereby: and a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of our eternall Sabbath, &amp; rest in heauen.</p>
            <p>5 <hi>Disobedience</hi> to <hi>Superiours,</hi> is a reigning sinne: Though God for their further honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hath placed the Precept that commandeth their obedience, Next to the Precepts of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and calleth the dueties of it by the Name of Pietie, yet it is least respected. <hi>Parents</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall are misregarded: <hi>Pastours</hi> who beget and feede people in Christ, are contemned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And supreme <hi>Authoritie</hi> disobeyed of the most part. 6.

in marriage is lesse respected and keeped then light promises amongst men: Whereby thogh their were none other sinnes, a way is made to ouerthrow families, for God cannot blesse Inheritance in the hands of wrongous Heires. 8. Secret and open hurting of the lots of men, is a common practise, and no man standeth in awe, to make his Neighbours ruine a stepping stone to his owne exalting. The most part without regarde of God, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or humanitie lose their Soule, and quite the Heauen for the baggage of this life.</p>

            <p>10. As for the abominations of the heart, though they bee hidde from vs, yet they are manifest to God, and by these and the like fruites, the world may see, that the heartes of the most parte are voyde of God, and are vyle puddles to defile themselues, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow this Land with sinne: These filthie foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines are not seasoned with the salt of Grace, but send out the deadlie waters of filthienes, to burden this Land, and make it spew vs out.</p>

            <p>This Infidelitie bringeth out all sortes of <hi>Disobedience:</hi> When the heart by Faith is not purified, and ioyned to God, it is casten loose to all kinde of iniquitie, without any restraint of euill, or constraint to good: Our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and reading, is not mixed with Faith, and so bringeth not out the obedience of faith, if wee neither belieue the promised reward, nor threatned punishment, wee cannot obey the directing Precept.</p>

            <p>And with all, this wicked disposition, a worse is joyned, that the most parte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake sinne, nor repent, nor suffer it to be called sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or themselues to be reproued and censured for it.

            <p>This is a great policie and preuailing of Sathan, hee desireth nothing more, than to holde men sleeping to death in sinne: And hee knoweth no meanes more able to waken them, than faithfull Pastours: Therefore hee laboureth to discredite them by contempt, that their warning may bee fruitlesse: And thus hee doeth by secrete and close degrees: Hee maketh not men at the first to contemne Pastours, and their Callings, but to mislike their reproofes and taxing of sinne, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is some hope, so long as God holdeth Pastours in a land: But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temne that his mercifull ordinance, it is iust with him, to send them harder Messengers of wrath.</p>

            <p>The signes of a desparate and incurable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease in man, are foure speciall which are all<note place="margin">24</note> to bee found in this Land.</p>
            <p>1. The first is, <hi>senslesnesse of all paine:</hi> Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse after a long strife with nature, preuaileth so farre against her, that as it hath expelled

health, so it taketh away the feeling of that losse. 2. <hi>Next conceate of Health</hi> vnder that state: That notwithstanding of the great dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, yet they conceate of strength and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the minde affected with the bodie, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staketh the true estate of it. 3.

            <p>All these are spirituallie in this Land. 1. An uniuersall senslesnesse, of our spirituall State: All Doctrine of the <hi>sicknesse of the Soule by sin: Of the nature of Conscience: The sense of God of his mercie and wrath, and such like,</hi> are to the most part but as free discourses, without trueth or use: There is not so much of the life of God in them, as to know or feele that there is such a thing: All are closed vp in the fatnes of a hard and senslesse heart. <hi>This is senslesse A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme.</hi> 2. And notwithstanding of this, there is a strong conceate of perfection in some: They judge themselues in their owne light, &amp; ponder them in their own ballance, and thinke all that is spoken in Scripture against sinners pertaineth not to them, but others, and all that is spoken of grace, and promises, is layed in their lappe alone: <hi>This is proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saisme.</hi> 3.

neuer thinke of a Physitian<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>This is fleshlie Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie.</hi> 4. And the last are worse, they tak not the information of Pastours, neither can they abide their Admonitions, when they are rebuked for sinne. Then they cry out as against <hi>Ieremie. The Earth dow not beare this mans words and railings.</hi> And take vpon them to prescriue to their Pastours, both mater and manner of Doctrine, <hi>They say to the Seers, See not, &amp; to the Prophets, Prophecie not vnto vs right things: But speak vnto vs pleasant wordes, prophecie deceites.</hi> Isa. 30. 10.</p>
            <p>They will gladlie heare the sweete Doctrine of the Gospel, but not of the Law: Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie but not practise; discoursing of Doctrine and Controuersies, but not usefull applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And will heare the sinnes of other men, other callings, other Countreyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, but not their owne sinnes reproued.</p>
            <p>

Therefore shall the Land mourne, and euery one that dwelleth in it, shall languish.</hi> Hos. 4. 1. 2. 3.</p>

This is one olde lesson, wee haue of our first Parents. <hi>Adam</hi> layed the sinne vpon the Woman, and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man on the Serpent: Wee are forward to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sinne, but are ashamed of it, when it is committed, and would father it on another: Wee defile our selues reallie by the guiltinesse of it, and labour to cleanse vs by a conceate: But God will not bee so put off, and that shif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is a doubling of our guiltinesse.</p>
            <p>So, after that <hi>Core,</hi> and his complices were punished, the people murmured against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> saying, <hi>Yee haue killed the people of the Lord.</hi> Nu. 16. 41. The cause of <hi>Corahs</hi> pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, was not in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but in <hi>Corahs</hi> sinnes, who inuying their credite, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiouslie affected the like, and seditiouslie made a faction, and drew the people after him, against them whom God had set ouer them: But the foolish people, not considering his sinne, nor their owne factious following of him, layed all the blame vpon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is to harden our selfe in our sinne &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie,<note place="margin">45</note>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:21139:26"/>
               <hi>and to freeze on our dregges.</hi> Zeph. 1. 12. But euerie one of vs ought to <hi>examine first &amp; most our selues,</hi> and wee shall finde seuen abominations in our hearts: If we looke in the glasse of Gods Law, we shall see our leprosie, &amp; bee forced with the <hi>Lepers</hi> to cry out, <hi>I am vncleane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am vncleane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So <hi>Dauid</hi> (albeit GOD beeing angrie at <hi>Israel</hi> suffered him to number the people) said to the Lord, <hi>I haue sinned, and I haue done wickedlie, but these sheepe what haue they done?</hi> 2. Sam, 24. 1. And <hi>Ieremie</hi> putteth himselfe in with the rest, <hi>vvee haue sinned, and thou hast not spared.</hi> Lament. 3. And <hi>Daniel, Wee and our Fathers haue sinned.</hi> Dan. 9. It is a token of true Grace, in the censure of our selfe, with the <hi>Apostle,</hi> to count our selues <hi>the first of all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> and a token of true Repentance. 1. Tim. 1. 5. In the appearance of sin with <hi>Ionah,</hi> to say, <hi>I know, that for my sake, this storme is come vpon you.</hi> Ionah. 1. 12. Euerie one of vs, hath broght his coale to this great fire of Gods wrath, so, let euery man come and take out the coale, hee hath cast in it, &amp; draw waters out of his broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heart and powre out the teares of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to quench it withall: <hi>Let vs search and try our vvayes, and turne againe to the LORD.</hi> Lament. 3. 40.</p>
            <p>As on the one part wee ought not <hi>Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie</hi>
               <note place="margin">46</note> to lay all the fault on others, so neither
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:21139:27"/>
should weelazelie waite vpon the Repentance of other: Euerie one ought indeede to stirre<note place="margin">47</note> vp another to this holie Exercise: But if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remaine in their hardnesse, and will not bee stirred vp to seeke the Lord, wee ought not to delay Repentance by their euill example.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Euerie one is bound to keepe his owne Soule: If yee vvill not repent, my Soule shall mourne in secrete for your pryde.</hi> Ierem. 13. 17. As the multitude of the godly cannot secure an euill man from Gods justice, hee found out <hi>Achan</hi> among the thousands of <hi>Israel,</hi> and punished him: So the multitude of impenitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, shall not hyde one mourning Sinner from his mercie: He sendeth not out his wrath, till <hi>first hee marke them, that sigh and cry for the abomination of Ierusalem</hi> Ezch. 9. And promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to <hi>Baruch his life for a prey.</hi> Hee had the <hi>Arke</hi> readie to saue <hi>Noah,</hi> and a <hi>Zoar</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <hi>Lot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Next, for this holy Exercise, <hi>let vs rent</hi>
               <note place="margin">48</note> 
               <hi>our hearts,</hi> and that by a true and godlie sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our bygone and present offences, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting our Soules by a true contrition,</hi> Ioel. 2. As wheate or corne, is brayed betweene the nether and vpper milstones, so is the penitent Soule, bruised betweene the <hi>griefe for sinne,</hi> and <hi>feare of wrath,</hi> with an holie indignation at our selues, for offending so good a God, and taking an holie reuenge or sythment, on our selues for
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21139:27"/>
that vylnesse. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. That when wee remember our wayes, and all our doings, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee haue beene defiled, wee may loath our selues in our owne sight, for all the euills that wee haue committed.</p>
            <p>The reasons of this renting are, 1. Our heart<note place="margin">49</note> is the fountaine, from which all proceedeth, that defileth the man, and ought to bee stopped. 2. It is the forge-house, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Sathan forgeth all iniquitie, and must bee ruined. 3. And the place of the conception of all our miseries, therefore by an <hi>heart-brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king godlie sorrow,</hi> it must be so disabled, as it losse the power of conceiuing, or bringing foorth of sinne as of before. 4 It is the bellie of the <hi>Viper</hi> for conceiuing, but it is not rent in the deliuerie of that venemous brood: Therefore it ought to bee rent in remorse for it, and with that renting, wee must bring out the birth of a sincer confession of our sinne, <hi>Let vs lift vp our heartes and our hands to heauen, and say, VVee haue sinned and haue rebelled, and thou hast not spared.</hi> Lament. 3. 41. 42.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdlie, for the time to come, we must<note place="margin">50</note> 
               <hi>purpose with our selfe, and vow to God amende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our life,</hi> &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> studie and practise of new obedience: These holie vowes, will both bind our corruption, that it breake not out at all occasions, and stirre vp the grace of God to a life worthie of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21139:28"/>True Repentance will so presse our corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may finde for the present a weight to bow it downe, and a knyfe to cutte the throate of it: And it will strengthen Gods grace by remouing sinne, which is the bane of it. It is a repeating of our first conuersion, and a notable promouing of Sanctification, by so solemne a worke, adding a sensible degree of killing the old <hi>Man,</hi> &amp; the quickning the new.</p>
            <p>This is the fruite of our wrestling with God, euen to halt with <hi>Iacob:</hi> Though wee haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, our corruption will bee so disjoynted, as it be not so strong therafter. So, God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to his owne, by true Repentance, slayeth sin, which Sathan augmented by our falling &amp; disappointing him of his end, turneth his work of sinne in vs, to a destruction of our sinne.</p>
            <p>Fourthlie, wee must strengthen our hearts<note place="margin">51</note> with <hi>confidence on God,</hi> that hee will haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie on vs: We can neuer goe to him with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without this confidence in Iesus Christ, but wee runne from him as a <hi>consuming fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For this end, we ought first to fixe our mind<note place="margin">52</note> vpon him, as hee hath discryued himselfe. 1. A <hi>God full of goodnesse, for hee is gratious,</hi> freelie to pittie vs not looking to our deseruing, but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, aboue,</hi> &amp; <hi>contrare</hi> to it, to helpe vs, bringing all the reasons of his goodnesse to vs from himselfe, and respecting none other thing in vs, than our miserie to cure it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:21139:28"/>2. Hee is <hi>Mercifull,</hi> to pardon our sinnes, and remoue all euill from vs, whom gratious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie hee accepteth, and giueth vs euerie good thing that wee neede.</p>
            <p>3. And <hi>slow to anger,</hi> because the best men are often falling in sinne, and so giue matter of his provocation, yet hee is not soone moued at their sinnes, but waiteth on their Repentance.</p>
            <p>4. And of <hi>great Kindnesse,</hi> that euen in the time of his just anger, keepeth euer his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlie loue and benignitie to them: His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger can stand well with his loue, though wee doe not well consider it: <hi>Hee doeth not afflict vs willinglie.</hi> Lament. 3. 33. <hi>But in the midst of his wrath, hee remembreth mercie,</hi> in the change of his work and action, from blessing to crossing, his heart and affection is not changed vpon vs Hee is not hastie to anger, and long in it, but slow to it, and soone from it.</p>
            <p>Anger is in men according to their seuerall disposition: It is in the <hi>Melancholian,</hi> a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that hee is <hi>slow</hi> to anger, but a vice, that hee <hi>abydeth long</hi> in it: And it is the <hi>Cholerians</hi> fault, that hee is <hi>soone</hi> angrie, but a vertue that hee is as <hi>soone</hi> from it. Our good God, speaking of himselfe according to man, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his anger by the vertues of them both: With the first, hee is slow to anger, and with the second hee is soone appeased: And this is to our great comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:21139:29"/>5. And he <hi>repenteth him of euill:</hi> Although our sinnes force strokes out of his hand, yet hee is grieued for vs vnder them, and by his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den relieuing of vs, so soone as wee repent, doeth testifie, that hee hath neither pleasure in the death of sinners, nor in the troubles of his owne: <hi>In all their afflictions hee is afflicted.</hi> Isa. 63. 9. And these diuine properties and their worke is not as his <hi>strange vvorke, and strange Act,</hi> but in those thinges, <hi>hee deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because mercie pleaseth him.</hi> Isa. 28. 21. Ierem. 9. 24. Micah. 7.</p>
            <p>And for our fuller confidence, wee haue not simplie to consider this his goodnesse in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,<note place="margin">53</note> but as it is presented and offered to vs in a <hi>Couenant,</hi> which is confirmed by Christ.</p>
            <p>His goodnesse is in himselfe as a Fountaine superabounding, but the <hi>Couenant</hi> is as a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> or <hi>Conduit,</hi> conuoying it to vs. His good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse assumed our Nature in Christ, to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall vnioun with the Sonne; to assure vs both of the grounds of that communication of his goodnesse, and of our right to it; and of the way how it is: That beeing and belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in Christ our Brother, wee may haue <hi>boldnesse and accesse by that way, which his blood hath consecrate toward the Throne of Grace.</hi> Heb. 10. When in our mourning for sinne, our Faith looketh to Christ, whome our sinnes haue pierced, and intreate God, to looke on
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:21139:29"/>
the Sonne of his loue, in whome hee is well pleased, <hi>wee haue confidence to bee heard in that wee pray for:</hi> Zachar. 13. No man can tryst and meete with God in Christ the great <hi>Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker,</hi> who is both the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>pryce</hi> of our peace, but hee shall finde reconciliation in him.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, our owne <hi>Experience</hi> may giue vs confidence: When this Yland was inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded<note place="margin">54</note> by that great Nauie, that was called, <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vineible:</hi> God made the Seas to burie our Enemies, as it did the <hi>Aegyptians: Anno</hi> 1588.</p>
            <p>Next, when Sathan saw, that our GOD vvas God of the Seas, hee tooke him to fire, and put it in the heartes of cruell Papists, to attempt the blowing vp by <hi>Powder,</hi> of the King, the <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Flower of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of <hi>England:</hi> But God discouered that hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish plot, and brake their bow at the lowsing of their Arrow. <hi>Anno</hi> 1605. When <hi>Morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie</hi> passed through all this Land, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued many, God vvas intreated by our Prayers, and stayed it. <hi>Anno.</hi> 1623. When hee brak in with a fearefull <hi>Pest</hi> among vs, and we hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled our selues before him, he commanded the destroying Angel to depart from vs. <hi>An.</hi> 1625.</p>
            <p>When hee threatened extreame <hi>Famine,</hi> in the rotting of all our Cornes, wee called on him by Fasting and Praying, &amp; immediatelie thereafter for seuen weekes gaue such serenitie as scarcelie any man doeth remember the like. <hi>Anno</hi> 1626.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:21139:30"/>Hee is that same God, that hee was then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if we will run to him in true Repentance, hee both can and will deliuer vs as of before.</p>
            <p>In a word, we must <hi>processe</hi> our selues seuere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie before God. 1. In presenting our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his fearefull <hi>Tribunall,</hi> and standing there, compare our selfe to that righteousnesse of the Law, and our God, and wee shall finde that our sins are <hi>moe, than the haires of our head.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. When wee haue found it so, wee must cry in the bitternesse of our heart, with the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi>
               <note place="margin">55</note> 
               <hi>knocking on our breast, The Lord bee merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mee, a sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Luke. 18. 3. This sight of our vilenesse, and sorow for it, must chase vs to God, to begge remission of sinne, and to be couered with the righteousnesse of Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Wash mee throughlie from my sinne, and cleanse mee from mine iniquitie.</hi> Psa. 51. 4. We must striue to find remission sealed vp in the peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science. All this processe before God, must be formed in our <hi>conscience,</hi> &amp; led in a <hi>spirituall fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:</hi> Many a time we doe the worke of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligently, and content our selues with a light thoght &amp; motion of these things: But we must labour to bring our conscience to a sight &amp; our heartes to a feeling of them, without which God cannot bee pleased, nor we blessed in this worke.</p>
            <p>And this processing is a great blessing of God, because it bringeth vs back to the first processe,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:21139:30"/>
that God formed in vs, at the time of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion; and acquainteth vs with that Processe, which wee shall see at the last day; and shall se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure vs from the terrour of it.</p>
            <p>Wee shall then count our selues happie, for tymous processing our selues, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we shall see others condemned, who now neglect to doe it.</p>
            <p>Further, wee must remember our <hi>ordinarie measure of Deuotion</hi> will not serue our turne in Fasting: But as the solemnitie is more than cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomable occasions: So our Deuotion in it must as far exceede our ordinarie, as it is aboue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie occasions: The Sabbaths seruice had the own measure aboue the daylie Sacrifice: So our Griefe, Zeale, Faith, and softnesse of heart, must bee seuen fold more, than at other times: Therfore, is it compared to the greatest sorrow as the sorrow of a <hi>woman mourning for her first borne,</hi> and for the <hi>Husband of her Youth,</hi> and that as the mourning of <hi>Iudah</hi> in the <hi>Vallay of Megiddo</hi> for the slaughter of <hi>Iosiah.</hi> Zach: 12.</p>
            <p>When our Soules by the Grace of GOD, are brought to this holie Disposition, we must also take order for our <hi>Bodie,</hi> that it may know in the owne kinde this Exercise; that defrauding it of the owne desires, wee may bring it to some feeling of that worke, that is within it euen of the <hi>reasoning betweene God and our Soule;</hi> that pinching of it, is both the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stining and amending of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:21139:31"/>Wee must abstaine from mirth and solace: When <hi>Gods Sword is forbished, shall wee then make mirth, and contemne his rodde.</hi>

            <p>The maine thing indeed, that God requireth in publicke humiliation is true <hi>Repentance,</hi> in<note place="margin">59</note> godlie sorrow for our sinnes, and earnest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring of his mercie in Iesus Christ. <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments,</hi> and yet with all, hee requireth also a bodilie <hi>Fasting,</hi> that our bodies bee defrauded, not onelie of their superfluous and vnlawfull desires, but also of their due and lawfull necessities in nourishment and rest, and that for these speciall reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:21139:31"/>1. That the bodie by that abstinence, may bee afflicted and punished, as one <hi>instrument of euill to the Soule:</hi> Though strength and health of the bodie bee a blessing of God, yet oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it affecteth the Soule, and either stirreth it vp to euill, or else is a readie weapon of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnes, to execute the euill desires of it.</p>
            <p>2. That it may bee taught by that defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and punishing, what is the <hi>punishment of sinne.</hi> 3. That since it is a great <hi>impediment to our Soule in good,</hi> when it is satisfied in all the desires: it may not hinder, but rather further the Soule in so holie an exercise, but the felt necessities of it, make it to spurre our Soule to bee earnest in the seruice of God, who is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie able to saue both Soule and bodie.</p>
            <p>4. Lastlie, for the <hi>compleete Humiliation of the whole Man:</hi> that as both Soule and bodie haue sinned, and euerie one of them haue had their owne parte in that wickednesse, they may now suffer conjunctlie, and bee humbled for it before God.</p>
            <p>VVith prayer and Fasting other things must<note place="margin">57</note> bee joyned: First <hi>course and base Apparrell,</hi> that none come before God in their best cloathing, but in their course and common garmentes: Costlie rayment doeth no more agree with Fasting and Repentance, than <hi>laughing</hi> and <hi>surfette:</hi> An heart <hi>sopped with sorrow and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesse</hi> for sinne, can neither desire, nor take
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:21139:32"/>
paines vpon the <hi>busking of the bodie.</hi> Remors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thoughts can neither breed nor dwell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a <hi>painted face,</hi> and a <hi>husked bodie:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition in the heart commandeth a neglect of the flesh: As our flesh ought to bee taught by defrauding of nurishment, so also in baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and neglect of apparrell.</p>
            <p>In most of our former Fastes, this hath beene a blotte, that people haue come to the Lords House in their best garments, vvhen hee hath cryed for sacke-cloth and ashes: They mak no difference betwixt <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Feasting:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Repentance</hi> and other <hi>ioyfull solemnities,</hi> as <hi>Communion and Thankesgiuing.

            <p>VVhen our Parents sinned in <hi>Paradise,</hi> their nakednes made them ashamed, and that shame made them couer ther nakednesse vvith anie thing that come first to hand. Busking at Fasting is not of <hi>shamefastnesse,</hi> but a <hi>shamelesse out-facing</hi> of the vvorld, their own Conscience and the Iustice of God.

            <p>2. The second thing to bee joyned with Fasting, <hi>Is a large offering for the support of the</hi>
               <note place="margin">58</note> 
               <hi>Poore:</hi> It is our tyme of supplication to God for his grace, whereof wee both desire and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a large measure: VVhy should vve not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bee liberall to the Poore? As vvee vvould haue him open handed to fill our hearts with grace, VVee should be free to helpe their necessities: Beside the measure of our daylie offering to them, wee are bound to conuert the charges
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:21139:33"/>
of our house to their comfort, that vvhat wee spare on our selues in Fasting, may bee lent to God, and giuen to the poore.</p>
            <p>Vnlesse this way wee helpe them, vvee offer to God but a lame sacrifice, and turne his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to our owne worldlie gaine, because that vvhich we spare on our selues, remaineth vvith vs To be large in <hi>Deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; niggard</hi> in our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> to the poore, is to proue, that we count more of our <hi>moneyes</hi> than of <hi>Deuotion:</hi> And to moue God to respect it as little, as wee doe</p>
            <p>This hath also beene a great fault in our former<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fastings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wee ought therefore to giue our dinner to them that are hungrie, that Christ hungring in the poore, may receiue that which the fasting Christian doth abate: And so our Fastes may bee filled and fatted with Almous deedes, and wee may reioyce that our Fasting hath made another to eate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Thirdlie wee must also joyne heerewith all <hi>requisite godlie Exercises,</hi> to bring our hearts<note place="margin">59</note> to that holie Disposition, that God, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, as, 1. The <hi>reading and hearing of the Law of GOD,</hi> that vvee may see our <hi>dittay</hi> in the Commands that wee haue broken, and our <hi>Doome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:21139:33"/>2. The <hi>hearing of Pastours,</hi> apply that Law to vs, and lance our Conscience by their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: So <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon pierced y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
               <hi>Iewes</hi> hearts vvhen their sins vvere layed to their charge, &amp; they were forced to seeke ease to their wounded Conscience: <hi>Act.</hi> 2. And when the <hi>Leuits</hi> did expound the Law, the people mourned before the Lord. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. That piercing sharpnesse of the worde, chaseth them that are wounded to God: The heart pierced with conscience of sinne, can find no rest, but in him.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>reading of Bookes of deuotion,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other good ends, are vvritten by godlie men to stirre vp the heart to a tendernesse, and affectuousnesse in the worshippe of God.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Conference with Pastours, and other well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Christians,</hi> For the mutuall stirring vp of our hearts to that holie Exercife: As coales joyned to coales, augment the heate, so god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie conference increaseth both zeale &amp; affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>5. Heerewith must be joyned holie <hi>Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> All worldlie thoughts must bee put out of our Soule, and the thoughts of God onelie keeped in it: Our heartes are hard; and not soone moued wee must labour on them paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie, and hold them on the ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is not enough that one sort of people fast, but all of euery sort and state; For all haue sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">60</note> and are impannelled at the barre of Gods Iustice: <hi>Gather the people, sanctifie the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, assemble the Elders, gather the Children, and these that sucke the brests.</hi> Ioel. 2. 16. And the King of <hi>Ninivie</hi> did fast, &amp; made <hi>all his seruants to fast also.</hi> Ionah. 3.</p>
            <p>1. Pastours haue their part in this worke.<note place="margin">61</note> To informe the people of their sin and danger of wrath, and waken vp their conscience by the terrours of the Law, that being priked in their hearts, they may cry out, <hi>Men and Brethren, what shall wee doe.</hi> Act. 2.</p>
            <p>2. And not that onelie but also in example to goe before them: <hi>Let the Priestes the Lordes Ministers weepe betweene the Porch &amp; the Altar.</hi> Ioel. 2. That thereby, they may shew to the people, that they themselues belieue the things which they speake of sinne and death, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21139:34"/>
that the worke of Humiliation is good when they practise it affectuouslie.</p>
            <p>3. To interceede with God for their people, that hee would pardoun and spare them: <hi>Spare thy people, O Lord, and giue not thine Inheritance to reproach.</hi> Ioel. 2. <hi>Moses</hi> was so zealouslie carefull of the peoples safetie. that hee wished <hi>his name to bee rased out of the Booke of Life, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they were destroyed:</hi> And <hi>Phineas</hi> seeing the plague, breake into the Campe, made atonement for them.

            <p>
               <hi>Our tyme is like the tyme of Ieremiah and Ezechiel.</hi> God hath now presented the <hi>roule of his Booke vnto vs, and it is all written within and without, Lamentation, mourning, and woe.</hi> Ezech. 2. 10.</p>
            <p>Our duetie is as <hi>Noah,</hi> to fore-warne the world of the Floode: As <hi>Ionah</hi> to denounce destruction against <hi>Niniuie:</hi> And as men that <hi>stand in the counsell of God, to discouer the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the people, to turne them from their sinne, and turne away their captiuitie.</hi> Ierem. 23.</p>

            <p>The people also ought to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider their dueties<note place="margin">2</note> heere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. 1. To count it a blessing of God to haue Pastours that will waken them, for none of themselues, can awak out of the sleepe of sin: <hi>Dauid</hi> a Prophet, &amp; tender hearted, had neede of a <hi>Nathan</hi> to waken his sleeping Conscience. 2. Therefore they should <hi>heare and receiue infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from their Pastours,</hi> whom God hath set ouer them: As hee hath bound Pastours vnder heauiest paine to informe them, so are they bound in Conscience to heare them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue their instruction. 3. To deale with their pastors, to interceed for them with the Lord: <hi>Cease not to cry to the Lord for vs, that hee would deliuer vs from the Philistmes, said Israel to Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel.</hi> 1. Sam. 7. 8. <hi>And pray to the Lord, for thy seruants, that wee die not ibid.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>4. To <hi>ioyne their prayers</hi> with the prayers of their Pastors: If they lye still in senslesnesse, the prayers sent vp to God for them will not auaile. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> desired <hi>Moses</hi> to pray for him,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:21139:35"/>
but prayed not for himselfe. Thogh <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> stood before me, <hi>yet my mind could not be toward this people.</hi> Ier. 15. 1. But when <hi>Pastors</hi> &amp; people joyne their prayers together, then God suffereth himselfe to bee bound with the bonds of his owne making, euen his mercie and trueth in the promise layed vpon him by faith, in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent prayers.</p>
            <p>A cleare proofe of all these dueties, in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours and people, is in <hi>Samuel</hi> the Prophet, and the <hi>Israelites:</hi> When hee reproued them for their sinne <hi>the people drew out water (not out of wells, but out of their broken hearts) and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it out at their eyes, and fasted, and weeped that day,</hi> and said, <hi>Wee haue sinned against the Lord,</hi> and besought the Prophet to pray to God for them. Then hee offered a sacrifice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and cryed to the Lord for them, and the Lord heard him, and deliuered in their handes the Hoast of the <hi>Philistimes,</hi> which was come vp against them. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>If wee minde sincerelie to approue our sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues to God in Fasting, it must bee both <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke and priuate,. Publicke humiliation</hi> at such solemne times, is both first and most required, for sindrie reasons. 1. <hi>To iustifie God,</hi> who hath arrested vs, and threatned or begunne judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, by publicke confession of our sinnes, proclaiming that hee hath just cause of wrath against vs; and so by that publicke homage
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21139:36"/>
done to him, to acknowledge our oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to him, for a newe holding of the life that hee spareth to vs.</p>
            <p>2. Secondlie, to make a more <hi>forcible on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set on him,</hi> by all our prayers joyned together. For he who hath promised to heare vs in secret apart, and to bee in the midst of two or three, that are met in his Name, will not he be in the midst of some hundreths, and thousands when they are come before him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. And he who said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Moses, Let me alone</hi> (as though <hi>Moses</hi> prayers did bind him) shall hee not suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to bee stayed from executing his wrath, when many thousands feruent and faithfull prayers lay holde vpon him at once.</p>
            <p>3. For our <hi>mutuall and greater incitation:</hi> Many who in Congregations meete together, possiblie haue gone before other in euill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, and some haue offended and stumbled at the fall of other.</p>
            <p>It is therfore moste expedient, that these see one another in that solemne Deuotion: That they who haue giuen euill example in sinne may giue good example by their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: &amp; they who haue conceiued just offence of other, may lay aside their offence, when they see them ryse fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their sin. <hi>Dauid</hi> offended ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie by his sinnes, but doubtlesse his Repentance satisfied them, and conuerted moe people to God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:21139:36"/>4. For <hi>Sathans greater conuiction,</hi> hee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no lesse in drawing vs to sinne, than to yock God and vs together, &amp; so to set vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as guiltie persons to bee destroyed, both in this life, and at the day of our last rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning: But in these publicke Assemblies hee seeth the case altered, that God hath <hi>preuented the terme,</hi> and in place of a <hi>wrathfull meeting,</hi> to come to a <hi>friendlie commoning,</hi> &amp; to end in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reconciliation. <hi>When God commeth downe in these meetings, and melteth the hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and reconcealeth them to him, such a sight is an heart-breake to Sathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVe ought also to joyne <hi>priuate Humiliation</hi>
               <note place="margin">64</note> 
               <hi>in our Houses, with that publicke Exercise. And they shall mourne euery Familie apart. The Familie of the house of Dauid apart, and their wiises apart: The Familie of the house of Nathan apart, &amp;c.</hi> Zech. 12. And that for sindrie causes. 1. We <hi>pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> our houses by sinne, and therefore ought to sanctifie them to God particularlie, in the time of a solemne Fast. <hi>Dauid</hi> sanctified his House after <hi>Absoloms</hi> sin, and shall not wee much more consecrate our houses for our owne sinne?</p>
            <p>2. For <hi>Preparation</hi> to the publicke worship: If wee come out of our owne houses to Gods House, without anie preparation, wee cannot looke for a great blessing in the Sanctuarie: Priuate worshippe before wee come out, is as a seede for the greater and publicke worke.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:21139:37"/>3. And when we haue beene in the Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and returned to our houses, wee ought to turne it in an <hi>Haruest</hi> in them in reaping the fruit that we haue fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in publick: Our Houses then are both the <hi>Barne</hi> and the <hi>Garner:</hi> wherein wee prouide the seede that wee take out to the Sanctuarie, and to the which wee bring in the <hi>Haruest,</hi> and increase that we haue found in it.</p>
            <p>4. Priuate worship is <hi>a seale of the sinceritie of Grace,</hi> for manie doe counterfeate Deuotion &amp; Repentance in publicke, who haue none exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of it in their houses, all their care is to be seene of men, and so they are <hi>holie in the Church, and profane at home:</hi> But to exercise Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe feruentlie in priuate, is a token of a true and vigorous grace of God.</p>
            <p>5. For <hi>greater libertie, to utter groaning, wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, humbling, and prostrating of our bodie in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, than wee can in publicke,</hi> there wee doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things which would finde an vncheritable censure, if they were seene of men: <hi>Affections once loosed, will breake out in sindrie actions, which in publicke wee must suppresse; but in priuate wee giue them libertie. Hannah</hi> vttered griefe of heart in the Temple, and was misconstrued by <hi>Eli,</hi> but her priuate deuotion at home, though with greater libertie was not offensiue, but a cause of her husbands more tender affection to her. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. <hi>Dauid</hi> in priuate, <hi>watered his</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:21139:37"/>
               <hi>bedde with teares.</hi> Psal. 6. <hi>And filled his house with roaring, which in publicke hee did moderate.</hi> Psal. 32. And by this priuate worship, is not onlie to be vnderstood, when the whole Family meeteth together in their Hall, or other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient roome, but beside that, when the Master of the house hauing discharged that duety with his Family, goeth a part to some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teered corner of the house, &amp; there is yet more free in his deuotion than hee can bee in the sight of his Familie: And so other of the house, who are come to vnderstanding or any measure of Grace: <hi>This is, the Familie aparte and their wiues aparte.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In end, we haue three thinges to consider in<note place="margin">65</note> all his work 1. First our <hi>preparation for it:</hi> The worke is <hi>transcendent</hi> to the naturall man, and craueth preparation to lift him aboue Nature, in so heauenlie an exercise. Though sudden ejaculations waite not on preparation, because in them wee are set to worke vpon an instant, by some urging occasion, yet in the set dyet of his worshippe, we are bound to an holie preparation: And in this solemnitie we haue neede to double the measure of our deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, beeing called to the highest extent both of afflicting Nature, and stirring vp the grace of God in vs.</p>
            <p>It is therefore needfull, to try if God prepare vs for the worke. This we shall know. 2. If he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:21139:38"/>
open our eyes, to see how needfull this humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is for vs, by seeing our sin &amp; his just wrath, that wee may be driuen to that resolution that wee must either breake off our sinne by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or else be consumed in his anger 3. And by this sight, if he wake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our sleeping conscience and make it to set vs to worke, <hi>that we giue God no rest, till hee giue rest to his beloued.</hi> 4. This is some proofe of that which God telleth <hi>I haue beene sought of them that answered not, and found of them that sought mee not: And before they call I will answere.</hi> Isa. 65. 1. Where our miserable State hid from our selfe, is seene of him, so as hee pittieth it to helpe it, that our miserie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witting of vs, calleth for mercie: As the sores of a sleeping Childe moue the Father to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion: And though wee neither seeke him, nor call on him, in anie knowne or sensible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling, yet his Fatherlie pittie answereth the cry of that our necessitie, when wee know not: <hi>This is a preuenting Grace in this point:</hi> Whereby God finding vs in the pitte of miserie, setteth downe <hi>Iacobs Ladder</hi> to vs, afore wee know of our estate, or thinke of a deliuerie.</p>
            <p>Next, wee should try <hi>our disposition in the</hi>
               <note place="margin">66</note> 
               <hi>worke</hi> it selfe, if Gods preuenting Grace in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration bee seconded by an assisting Grace, which standeth in those points. 1. If hee <hi>soften our heart,</hi> to powre out it selfe as water before him, and bruse it, so as to bee an acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:21139:38"/>2. If hee powre vpon vs <hi>the Spirit of Grace and Supplication,</hi> his Spirite making interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for vs, to helpe our infirmities, in teaching vs both what to aske, and how to pray, with groanes that cannot bee expressed.</p>
            <p>3. If hee giue vs <hi>Boldnesse</hi> to draw neere to the Throne of Grace, and to finde accesse to him in the blood of Christ, and libertie of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in all our deuotion.</p>
            <p>4. If he giue vs the <hi>desire</hi> of our heart, in <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi> it as we <hi>desire,</hi> to be both casten down for his offence, and raised vp in <hi>hope and confidence</hi> of his mercie: To feele our hearts melting in a godlie sorrow, is matter of vnspeakable joy; while that sorrow is melting the heart, the sense &amp; conscience of that disposition, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forteth our heart whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we find Gods Spirit hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs our will ouer our hard heart, to sacrifice it to God.</p>
            <p>5. If wee see his beautie in the Sanctuarie, when hee <hi>holdeth the golden Scepter of Peace, like Assuerus,</hi> and commeth downe, and moueth people to teares and groanes. When the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord, or the Prophet charged the people of their sins, they did mourne, so that the place was called <hi>Bochim or mourners.</hi> And assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euery one according to their necessitie and place, making the Pastours <hi>as Trumpets, to speak and not spare, his words in their mouth is as the Hammer, that breaketh the Rocke in pieces.</hi> Ierem. 23. 23.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:21139:39"/>When hee casteth downe, and raiseth vp, woundeth, and healeth vs againe, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth so in the Congregation, that it may bee seene <hi>hee hath appointed that meeting, and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth it to reconceale his people to himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. If as hee worketh a godlie sorrow in our heartes, so <hi>bee putteth wordes in our mouth for his intreatie: Take to you wordes, and turne to the LORD, and say to him, Take away all our iniquitie, and receiue vs gratiouslie, so will we render the calues of our lippes.</hi> Hos. 14. 2.</p>
            <p>And againe, <hi>Let them say, Spare thy people, Lord, and saue thine Inheritance.</hi> Ioel. 2. 17.</p>
            <p>It is a token, God will heare vs, when he giueth vs his Spirit to helpe our infirmities, and dytteth our bill: <hi>Hee cannot refuse that sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, which hee formeth himselfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hee heard <hi>Daniel, and send him comfort while he prayed: While I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sinne, the Man Gabriel beeing caused to flee to mee swiftlie touched mee, and said, At the beginning of the supplication, the Commandement came foorth.</hi> Dan. 9. 20. So sonne as wee are humbled on Earth, and send vp our supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to God, hee is readie to answere vs to our heart.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie, how vvee close that <hi>Exercise:</hi> If<note place="margin">67</note> as it beginneth in sorrow for our felt miseries, so it <hi>end in ioy,</hi> because our sacrifice is turned in ashes. VVee haue sufficient grounds of good

successe vpon his promises: But beside these promises in his vvord, his vvorke in preparing vs for it, and disposing vs in it, are a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to our hope: When hee <hi>powreth out the</hi> Spirit <hi>of Supplication</hi> on <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> then assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redlie hee will <hi>breake vp a Fountaine to the house of Dauid for sinne, and for vncleannesse,</hi> Zac. 13. 1.</p>
            <p>VVee know not his purpose and thoughts concerning vs, but his Spirit vvho knoweth his minde, reuealeth them, and this is an sort of reuelation by his working: For as he knoweth the minde of God, so hee vvorketh the godly to that disposition vvhich he knoweth is most requisite, for obtaining the purposed blessing. Therefore that holie and heauenlie, libertie, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome sort of euidence to vs, that God hath both purposed for vs, and will giue vs the blessing, which wee craue after that manner. When he strengtheneth vs to wrestle with him, like <hi>Iacob,</hi> hee will not depart, till hee blesse vs, and of wrestling <hi>Iacobs,</hi> make vs his preuailing <hi>Israel</hi> on whom is his peace.</p>
            <p>But, let none deceiue himselfe by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar<note place="margin">68</note> 
               <hi>apprehension of Peace,</hi> or fainzie to himselfe a <hi>ioy</hi> where hee hath none: God hath giuen <hi>vs the infalible mark of good successe of Fasting in new obedience: Who so after Fasting walketh not in a newnesse of life, is deceiued by his seduced heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is cleare, both by the Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and remission: True <hi>Repentance</hi> is
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:21139:40"/>
not onelie in a sorrowing for sinne, and refrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from it, for a day or two, but for all our lifetime thereafter. The purposes &amp; vowes of obedience, which we make in our Repentance, must be practised and performed: Though the act of Repentance indure not euer in it selfe, yet the vertue of it remaineth constantlie in the godlie.</p>
            <p>In Baptisme we are Sacramentallie changed, and at the time of our effectuall calling, wee feele that Sacramentall grace in justification, and sanctification, and all our following dayes vvee are bound to goe forward in them: Since Repentance then is nothing but Sanctification contracted: And sanctification all our life is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but Repentance inlarged and continued, it will follow that if sanctification doe not kyth constant after our Fasting, there hath beene no true Repentance in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Remission of sinne proueth the same:</hi> For though Iustification, and Sanctification be two seuerall graces in themselues, and bring seuerall <hi>respects</hi> &amp; <hi>dispositions</hi> in vs, yet they are inseparable, for God neuer pardoneth the guilt of sin, but iont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie therewith he slayeth sin originall: As he wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth away the blot of all sinne, so he woundeth deadlie the roote of sinning sin in vs: And the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science of our washing in the blood of Christ, doeth euer beget in vs a care to keepe these gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cleane which God hath cleansed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:21139:40"/>Therefore, if there be not after our Fastings a visible amendement of life, neither haue wee repented, nor God pardoned our sinne, but we haue added greater and worse sinnes to the former, and brought vpon vs a degree of <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall induration</hi> and hardnesse of heart: When Christ had healed the sicke man at the <hi>Poole</hi> of <hi>Bethesda,</hi> hee commanded him, <hi>Sinne no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.</hi> Ioh. 5. So when we are washed in the house <hi>of the Lords aboundantlie powred out mercie,</hi> let vs keepe our selfe from sinne thereafter.</p>
            <p>If God be with vs, &amp; accept our Prayers, then<note place="margin">69</note> we may be sure of these following fruits. 1. Of <hi>Remission of sinnes,</hi> in Iesus Christ: So when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> confessed his sinnes, and said, <hi>I haue sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Lord:</hi> hee was answered by <hi>Nathan: The Lord hath also put away thine iniquitie:</hi> he had a warra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d more speedilie to absolue him, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had to accuse him. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the forlorne Son came in Repentance to his Father, he receiued him in his fauour &amp; house againe. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15 He seeth no sin in <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor transgressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in <hi>Israel:</hi> Our God pardeneth iniquitie, &amp; passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his Inheritance; hee retaineth not his anger for euer, because hee delighteth in mercie.</p>

            <p>2. He will <hi>accept of our persons,</hi> vnder his shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, nothing holdeth vs out of that secrete<note place="margin">70</note> refuge, but our sinne, because hee is of purer Eyes, than hee can beholde sine, and he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sueth sinne in all, and can no more protect an impenitent sinner, than hee can denie, his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.

            <p>They are more foolish than Sathan, hee durst not hurt <hi>Iob,</hi> without a <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission</hi> of God, but they think all possible &amp; lawfull to them: And when he set on to execute that <hi>Commission,</hi> though malice blinded his desire, yet not his minde, for hee did fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> see a disappointing, because hee knew Gods loue to <hi>Iob,</hi> by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie pledges and testimonies of his sinceritie in Grace: But our enemies are not so wise as hee: They goe on without <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission, sought &amp; obtained</hi> they expound their preuailing, as Gods sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence approuing their cause, and see not that all their businesse is a prouyding of a <hi>Coffine,</hi> and beare-trees, to carrie them out of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with shame &amp; confusion.

Hee hath giuen them a hard, but a just commission against vs for our sinnes. <hi>Assur is the rodde of mine anger, I will send him against an hypocriticall Nation, against the people of mine anger will I giue him a charge to take the spoile:</hi> But they passed the bounds of their commission, and satisfied their owne wicked heart vpon the people of God. <hi>For Assur meaneth not as God doeth, but his heart is to destroy and cutte off Nations,</hi> Isa. 10.</p>
            <p>They say, <hi>Let vs defile Sion, but they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither vnderstand his Counsell.</hi> Micah. 4 12.
