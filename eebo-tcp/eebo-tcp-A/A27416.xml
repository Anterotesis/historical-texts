            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> by many spatious inlets, they at last disgorge
and lose themselves in the Ocean. <hi>Zealand, Holland, Friesland,</hi> and <hi>Gronin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen</hi>
are plaid upon by the Sea towards the North; then turning towards
the East, the same Provinces of <hi>Groninghen,</hi> and <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> border upon

the County of <hi>Zutfen,</hi> which is one of the 17 Provinces, whereof the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55461:5"/>
Body of the Low Countrys was formerly framed, when the said
Countrys were joyn'd together in one: yet do not the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
enjoy whole <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> a certain proportion whereof is in the
Archdukes possession; but to countervail this, they likewise extend
their dominions into the Provinces of <hi>Brabant</hi> and <hi>Flanders.</hi> That part
of the Countrey which the United Provinces injoy in <hi>Brabant</hi> and
<hi>Flanders,</hi> is held by them under the name of the General Union of the

                  <p>THE United Provinces abound almost with all things, through
the accommodation of the Sea and Rivers. That which of
themselves they chiefly abound in, is, Fish, Pasture, and Cattell; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it almost to be exprest what quantity of Butter and Cheese
they send abroad to other parts, and reserve for their own proper use:
Their situation is exceeding low, subject to Windes, Moisture, and
Rain; and their Inhabitants may be said to live inclosed by water:
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> are the lowest, and most infested by the Sea, the
force and violence whereof is withstood and held in, by large high
Rampires of Earth, built up with great Stones, Raftures of Wood,
and other tenacious and condence Materials, where occasion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires:
in <hi>Holland</hi> more particularly, they indeavour to keep the
Country dry by great store of Wind-mills, and other Artificial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins;
yet the greatest part thereof lies under the water in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Season; so as you would think that the land were then swallowed
up by the Sea: the said Provinces are very well peopled, especially,
<hi>Holland</hi> wherein Trafick is the most frequent, and the Concourse
of Forraigners greatest. They have in them great store of great
Cities, and handsom Towns, the chiefest whereof are <hi>Nininghem</hi> in
<hi>Ghelderland;</hi> in <hi>Holland, Amsterdam;</hi> in <hi>Zealand, Midleburgh;</hi> in the

                  <p>THE Men of these Countries are for the most part of a large Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of a handsome and fair aspect, and strong and able of body;
their mindes are no less vigorous then are their bodies, which is seen
by the so long and pertenacious resistance, which hath been by them
made to the Spanish Forces; They are of an open and pleasant Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
very industrious, and much given to Traffick; very apt for all
Arts, especially such as are Manual, and Mechanical, they love li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
above measure, and therefore are most tenacious of their
Priviledges; and hence it is that they are apt to be jealous and easie
to alteration; and their double flexibility made use of as a means by
him who excited the troubles in these our times in <hi>Flanders,</hi> made
them without much difficulty afterwards rebel, both against the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church, and against their natural Prince. The first flame of this
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55461:5"/>
Combustion broke forth in <hi>Zealand,</hi> &amp; therefore this is the most obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
of all the other Provinces, in her hatred to the Church and <hi>Spain.</hi>
Hence was kindled that great fire of War which for the space of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
one whole half age, could never be extinguished, till at last it
was rather smother'd up then quench'd with the Truce which was
concluded for twelve years; at the first some of the aforesaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
united themselves with but small Forces, and the first band
of Unity was only between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> which flanked by
Rivers and by the Sea, and having an unalterable obstinacy, added to
the natural strength of their situation, might easily even with a very
few handfuls of earth, make good their party against a vast Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;
afterwards, as the War continued, other Provinces suffering
themselves also to be corrupted by the licentiousness of heresie and
out of a desire to reduce themselves to a Free Government, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
already begun gather'd strength, till at last the seaven above said
Provinces did formally confederate themselves; and openly denying
all obedience to their Prince, they declared themselves by their own
proper authority to be free, absolute, and soveraign; they took up
Arms at first under pretence of the violation of their Priviledges; and
have since fought for the conservation of their usurped Liberty; till
with the managing of Articles, it was agreed upon by the Truce, that
they may repute themselves for Free Provinces, and the Catholick
King and the Archdukes may hold them notwithstanding as subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Provinces.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Government of the Vnited Provinces; and first how
each of them is Governed in particular.</head>
                  <p>BEfore the United Provinces made any insurrection, or reduced
themselves to the condition of Free Commonwealths, their
Government was the same with that, which as yet is observed in
those other Provinces which are under the Archdukes. Each of their
Governments was composed of Three several Forms joyned in
one: to wit, Monarchy, Aristocrasie, and Democrasie: but so tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
as the most sublime part consisted in the person of the Prince:
and the Optimati, and popularity did also retain their part in a
moderate proportion. Their States (by which name of States is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
the Body of each Province which they represent) were
framed most commonly of three Orders of Personages: Ecclesiasticks;
the better sort of Nobility, and Citizens together with the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
of the best Towns. The Eclesiasticks were for the most part
Abbots of several Monastical Orders, and their Monasteries were
usually in the Countrey; and unless it were in their intervening up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasions in the resolutions of the States when general meetings
were had, they had little to do in the administration of Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
the Nobles did also usually dwel in their Castles, and Country
Territories, and the principal Offices of every Province were exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
by them. And the Cities divided generally into 3 sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
to wit, into some few Gentlemen of a middle condition, into
the better sort of Citizens, and into the meaner People, were gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55461:6"/>
according to their Priviledges and ancient Customes, like unto
so many little and particular Republicks; and their government was
so framed, as the chiefe Magistracy of every place being in the hand
of personages of most respect, yet the other two inferior degrees of
persons, did participate proportionably in the supream Magistracy.</p>
                  <p>The assembling of the Generall States of all the Provinces, as also
those of every particular Province, the nominating of their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors;
the renewing the chiefe Magistrate of every Citie every year;
the providing for Offices which were enjoyed by the Nobility of the
Countrey; the conferring of other Offices of Judicature upon men of
the long Robe which are distributed in every Province, together with
many other prerogatives depended upon the supream authority of the
Prince; which, as I have said, made the Prince to have the most su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
and eminent place in Government. The Prince and people
did then hold together joyntly after this manner; The Prince con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
himself with a power not altogether absolute, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with a limited Liberty; their government being just such as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Head and the Members in a mans body. The same Prince
had three chief Councels, which serv'd for eyes to all the Provinces
by him governed; to wit, a Councell of State, a Councell of Reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue,
and a Privy Councell. In the first, the most important publick
affairs were handled; in the second, the Prince his patrimony, and the
monies contributed by the Provinces; and in the third, matters of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
depending upon the supream Authority of the said Prince. And
thus the Prince and People seemed to vye in the cementing and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
themselves as it were with the bonds of Free-will, whereby to
cause the most pleasant and proportioned harmony whith could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
in the aforesaid government. Thus were the United Provinces
governed before the insurrection: Now I will shew how they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
at the present.</p>
                  <p>Monarchy being extinguished in them all, the States in each Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
do succeed in that supream Authority which formerly did reside
in the Prince. And the States which in most of the Provinces did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
consist of three degrees of personages, doe now consist in all of
them, only of the Nobility and Cities; Heresie having totally extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
the Order of Ecclesiasticks, save onely in the Province of
<hi>Utricht,</hi> which did for a long time belong to Ecclesiasticall Princes,
so as there is some shadow of this Order yet observed in their meetings
of the States, wherein some Chapters of Canons doe concur part
Hereticks, part Catholicks, who are notwithstanding tolerated in that
Citie. Thus of a Government which was chiefly Monarchicall, the
United Provinces are become a Government partly Aristocraticall,
partly Democraticall, according as some one of these Governments
hath the greatest influence in them. Yet in almost every one of these
Provinces, the two forms are tempered together, and some beams
of Monarchy may be said to appear, by reason of the particular privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
which are granted by the Provinces to their Governors, on
whom many things now depend (as shal be shown in due place) which
did first relate unto the supream authority of the Prince.</p>
                  <p>Let us now consider the Government of every particular Province
apart, that we may consider afterwards how the union of them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is govern'd. And because <hi>Holland</hi> doth much surpasse all the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55461:6"/>
other Provinces in the number of Cities, in the multitude of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
in Opulency, and in Traffick, let us see in particular how this
Province is governed; for then some short Observations will serve to
be made of the rest. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was Governor of <hi>Holland,
Zealand,</hi> and <hi>Utricht,</hi> when the insurrection in <hi>Flanders</hi> first arose,
which was at first begun, and afterwards obstinatly maintained by the
first two of those Provinces; and because the same Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
was the first contriver thereof, that he might the more easily compasse
his ambitious ends, he propounded two things in particular: The one,
to beat down the Nobility as much as might be, which might prove
great obstacles to his design: And the other, to work it so, as not any
one in <hi>Holland</hi> should be uninvolved in the same Insurrection: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
under various pretences made the people jealous of the Nobility:
And on the other side did so handle the matter, that whereas formerly
there was onely six Cities in <hi>Holland,</hi> which went together with the
Nobles, in forming the States of the Province, they were increased to
much a greater number. The spetious pretence whereof was, that for
the more easie maintaining of Arms in the common Cause which was
now in hand, it was necessary that all the chief Towns in <hi>Holland</hi>
should particularly communicate in the Government; but the true
and more hidden end was, to the end that every part of the Province
might by its own proper ingagement make the Insurrection the more
universall. So then, these six Cities (for by this name I will term in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently
those Cities and pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cipall Towns which concur to make
up the States of every Province) were increased to the number of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen.
The first were these, <hi>Dort, Harlem, Delfe, Leyden, Amsterdam,</hi> and
<hi>Der-Goude:</hi> and the twelve others which were afterwards added were,
<hi>Roterdam, Gorchom, Schedam, Schonhoven,</hi> the <hi>Brill, Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mar, Horn, Encusen,
Edam, Manac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>am, Medemblick</hi> and <hi>Purmerent.</hi> So as of these eighteen
Cities, and of the order of the Nobility, the States of <hi>Holland</hi> are at this
hour composed: Neither doth the whole order of Nobility share a
greater part therein, then doth every single and particular Citie.</p>
                  <p>I will now tell you how every particular Citie is governed: First,
the chiefe managing of affairs consists in a Councel composed of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
prefixt number of persons; they have afterwards a chief Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
and others of lesser condition. The persons of the Councel are
seldome changed, but the Magistrates are altered every year. All the
Magistates are chosen out of the number of this Councell. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
is usually compos'd of one or two Burgamasters, some Sheriffs,
one Scout master, one Treasurer, &amp; one or two Pensioners. Thus are
the persons call'd which intervene in the chiefest Magistracies. The
Burgamasters part is to look unto such things as chiefly concern the
government of the Cities, and their Territories. The Sheriffs together
with the Scoutmaster deal in the administration of Justice, both Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
and Criminall. The Treasurer manageth the publick monies; and
the Pensioners are Doctors of the Law, and are verst in Citie busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and serve for Councell to the chiefe Magistrate. The other les<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ser
Magistrates depend upon the greater, and have cognisance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
things belonging to the government of every Citie. This is
briefly the form wherewith the Cities in <hi>Holland</hi> are generally go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned.</p>
                  <p>The Councell of Justice is the same that it was in the former go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:55461:7"/>
To this Councel the civil causes of every City have their
address by way of appeal, and it comprehendeth also the Province of
<hi>Zealand;</hi> in criminal causes no appeal is allowed, the absolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of determinating, residing in the chief Magistracies of every Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and because formely a new appeal was allowed from the Provincial
Councel of <hi>Holland,</hi> as also from almost all the other Provinces of
<hi>Flanders</hi> to a supreme Councel, constituted in the City of <hi>Malines;</hi>
insteed thereof the said two Provinces have erected a supreme Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
in <hi>Holland,</hi> which they call the High Councel; to which appeals
are made from the Provincial Councels both of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand:</hi>
Here are final judgments given, no place being left for any farther ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
save that sometimes a review of the cause is allowed, wherein
some Judges are added. And thus much may serve for the course of
Justice.</p>
                  <p>In such resolutions which are to be put on concerning the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
publick affairs which appertain to the common interest of all
<hi>Holland,</hi> the Assembly of the States of the Province must be call'd;
which States, as hath been formerly said, are made up of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and Cities, and Represent the whole body of the Province:
The Nobles are but few, and their power as small: The Cities which
intervene in the Assembly are those already named, and for Deputies
in their name, there are usually sent thither one of the Burgamasters,
together with one Pensioner; the Nobles making likewise their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
according to their wont. The States meet usually three or
four times the year, more or less according as occasion requires; when
they are met they treat and resolve upon such things as are taken into
debate; and then of so many Cities one onely as it were is framed,
and they are no longer then divided members, but one united body,
bound and fastned together by the tye of publick good and the rule of
reason; and it is seldom seen but that what is agreed upon by the major
part is yeelded unto by the lesser; else force would not avail them,
since they are all equal in Liberty. The degree of the Nobility have
the first rank, and then the Deputies of Cities take their places, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their several degrees. The Assembly being ended, the
Soveraign Decrees thereof are executed by a permanent and constant
Councel, newly instituted in this alteration of Government, which
represents the body of the said Assembly. This Councel is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of Deputies, which are likewise voted thither by both the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Nobility and Cities; and these Deputies are changed from
time to time. The publick moneys which are contributed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
are therein handled, and the care thereof is to propound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to the Nobles and Cities for the convocation of the Assembly, as
also the calling and reducing of it together.</p>
                  <p>After this <hi>Holland</hi> hath a Governor of the intire Province, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes
very great prerogatives both of honour and Authority; the
managing of the Militia depends on him, and whatsoever appertains
to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>afety of the Province; without his approbation the States of
the Province resolve upon nothing of importance; and in the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
of many Offices the States nominate three persons, and he
choseth one of-those three which he pleaseth: he may also remit the
punishment of faults committed; he changeth and renueth every year
the chief Magistrates of every City; and to this purpose double the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55461:7"/>
the most important Priviledges which the Governor enjoys, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with many others makes him be very much respected and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
in this new form of Government in <hi>Holland:</hi> so as of one of
the Princes Officers which he had wont to be in the former Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
he is now instead of him, made head of the Province: but yet
a Head subordinate to the supream-authority of the States, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present
now as I have said, that supream Eminencie which did first
consist in the person of the Prince; This in brief is the Government
of the Province of <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Form almost is followed by the other Provinces; in some
notwithstanding the number of the Cities is greater, in some lesser,
which concur with the Nobility, to frame the States of the Province.
And the popular multitude is in som greater in the Government of the
Cities, in some less. Every Province hath its particular Councel of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
as in former times, to which Councel only in Civil affairs appeals
are made from sentences given in the Magistracy of Citys, both in <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Zealand,</hi> as hath been said. Affairs receive their finall determination
in this Councel, unles it be in point of review, as in the high Councel of
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand.</hi> Every Province doth likewise acknowledge a
Governor, though many times one and the same Governor exerciseth
this Charge in divers Provinces; as Count <hi>Mauris</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to his Father the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the Government of <hi>Holland,
Zealand</hi> and <hi>Utricht,</hi> to whom the Government of <hi>Overisel</hi> is since ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and Count <hi>William</hi> of the said Family is Governor of <hi>Friesland</hi> and
<hi>Groninghen;</hi> and this may suffice for what concerns the particular Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of every Province.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Government of the whole Vnion.</head>
                  <p>AFter having considered every one of the United Provinces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
as divided Members, I come now to the Government of
them United all together in one Body. The Body of the Union con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
chiefly in the great Assembly of the States General of the whole
seaven Provinces. This great Assembly represents the Soveraignty
of the Union, and retains now the same eminency over them all, as
the Prince did in the former Government: This Assembly is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the particular States of each Province: So as the particular
States are formed of two sorts of Persons, of the Noble men of the
Country, and of the Deputies of Cities; just so the General Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the whole Union is of the same nature with the particular As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies
of each particular Province, and is composed of the same
two degrees of personages: as oft then as any new occasion ariseth
wherein great affairs are to be treated of which concern the common
interest of the Union, the great Assembly is called; the Summons
being given out, each Province sends its Deputies, and send more or
less in number, as best pleaseth each Province. Of these Deputies
the General Assembly is formed, and is divided into as many Votes, as
the Union is divided into Provinces; the Votes being numbred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the number of the Provinces, and not according to the
multitude of the Deputies: The great Assembly being met, they fall
upon such resolutions as appertain to the common Interest of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:55461:8"/>
whole Union; as of War, Peace, Truce, of making new confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
or of dissolving such as are already made; of laying on new Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
or taking off such as are already laid on: and other such
like important affairs, all which have respect to the Generall Union.</p>
                  <p>To pitch upon such resolutions, it is requisit that the seaven Votes
of the seaven Provinces doe concur; and because the Interest of one
doth not always agree with the Interest of another; hence it is that
they usually proceed very slowly in all businesses; and some time that
is contradicted by some one Province, which is unanimously agreed
upon by all the rest, each of them being desirous to depend with equall
liberty upon its proper member or Vote, as all of them with equall
commodity depend upon the entire Body: but because in disputes
obstinacy doth sometimes prevail over reason; in such cases, the
Deputies of such Provinces as are of one and the same mind, are wont
to chuse some of themselves whom they send to the Province whose
Deputies differ from the great Assembly, thus to endeavour to make
them joyn in their Votes with the rest; and thus opiniatracy at last
yeilds to reason. Thus was <hi>Zealand</hi> drawn to give way unto the Truce,
to which it appeared to be too obstinately averse. Upon occasions
then of the highest importance, the great Assembly of the Union is
usually called, as hath been said; and in the resolving upon any thing,
the Votes of the seven Provinces must all agree.</p>
                  <p>This great Assembly is notwithstanding but very seldom call'd; it
bears with it too much of business, for thereupon all the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
must not only move, but even all the best Cities, and best qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
noblemen that are in them. It is said that in the last great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
at <hi>Berghen-ap-Zone,</hi> when the Truce was concluded, the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which met there were in number 800.</p>
                  <p>And because it is requisit that there be a continuall standing Power
which may execute what hath been resolved upon by the great
Assembly, the States Generall of the seaven Provinces have unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
settled a firm and constant Councell which doth represent
the great Assembly, and keeps it continually in being, upon the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
whereof the execution of the Soveraign decrees of the great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
doth depend.</p>
                  <p>This Councell consists of Deputies which are from time to time
sent by the Provinces: Besides the Authority of executing the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
decrees of the great Assembly, the same Councell doth expedite
the weightiest affairs wherein the Interest of the whole Union is from
time to time concern'd: and if it shall so fall out that the great Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of the States Generall be to be called for any new extraordinary
business of great consequence, this Councell drawes up the motives
and sends them to the particular States of every Province, to the end
that preparation may be had in every one of them requisit for the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
convocation of them all. The Authority of this Councell is
very great; it is called the Councell of the States Generall: and it is
distinguished into seaven Votes, as the great Assembly which is by it
represented, is distinguished into seaven Provinces.</p>
                  <p>One of the Deputies is head of this Councell by the name of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident,
and to the end that the prerogative of every Province may be
equall, the Presidents are weekly changed, beginning with those
Provinces which are prime in dignity, and which are followed by the
rest.</p>

To boot with the Councel of the States General, the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have three Councels apart, one of State, one of the Treasury, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
of the Admiralty which, depends upon the Union, and which
are subordinate to the Councel of the States General; the power of
the Councell of State is also great; on it depends the execution of
things belonging to the War, and the disposing of moneys which are
disposed of by the Union in land Service; all Military affairs even of
the Army are likewise ordered by the said Councell; and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
in occasions of War is always attended by some of the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
to see that his undertakings be mannaged by their joynt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
who do then represent the Supream Authority of the Union;
besides matters belonging to War, the said Councell hath its part in
the most important Affairs, being as it were a Senat which always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervenes
in the Resolutions of highest nature, which are handled in
the Councell of the States Generall. The Councel of State is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of Deputies who intervene there in the name of each Province,
and the Governors of Provinces have therein a place also.</p>
                  <p>Into the Councell of the Treasury such moneys are brought as are
contributed by every Province for the Occurrences of the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
and this Councell is likewise framed of Deputies of the said
Union.</p>
                  <p>The Councell of the Admiralty hath cognisance of Maretine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
and through it doth pass the moneyes which the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
receive by their incomes by Sea, the body of this Councell is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into six members, four of which are distributed in <hi>Holland,</hi> one in
<hi>Zealand,</hi> and one in <hi>Friesland,</hi> and these members are likewise Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sent thither from each Province: all the Deputies who intervene
in these Councels which depend upon the body of the whole Union,
are frequently changed, and each Province alters them according to
their particular Governments.</p>
                  <p>The same general Union hath also a supream head in the managing
of their Armes by land and Sea, which command at this present is
executed by Count <hi>Mauris</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> who succeeded his Father the
Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> therein, as he did in being Governor of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
Provinces.</p>
                  <p>This in brief is the form of Government which is now observed in
the Commonwealth of the general Union of the United Provinces,
in which form it may be observed, that as every Province hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to vary as little as may be from the former Government, so
the whole Union hath had the same respect. To this purpose the same
chief Councels are retained which were formerly observed for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch
of affairs which did appertain to the Common Interest of the
whole Low Countreys, except only the Privy Councell, whose affairs
is now handled in occurrent businesses by the Councell of the States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Generall; and for what belongs to the Admiralty, the Councell by
reason of the multitude of Maratine affairs which continually occur
in the United Provinces, hath rather been added unto, then instituted
anew; for at all times the Princes of the Low Countreys have had
an Admirall, who together with many other Officers did as then form
as it were a Councell for Sea affairs.</p>
                  <p>These Councels which depend upon the general Union, do usually
reside in the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> except only the Councell of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
which is divided into many members, and through severall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55461:9"/>
Provinces as hath been said. The <hi>Hague</hi> is an open Village, but which
for scituation, the resort of People, and exquisit buildings, may be
compared to most of the noblest and most delightfull Cities. The
Counts of <hi>Holland</hi> did antiently reside in the <hi>Hague;</hi> and in the Palace
built by the said Counts, the abovementioned Councels meet. The
fitness of <hi>Holland</hi>'s scituation, as also of this Palace, and the laying of
the first and strongest roots of the rebellion there hath occasioned the
Prerogative of being the place of publique Councels, and affairs to
that Province.</p>
                  <p>By the preceding narration you may see what the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole United Provinces in common is, and that the joynt
Government of them altogether holds great proportion and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondence
with the several Government of each one of them. The
Cities and Nobles are as it were the Mussels which shape out the
Member of each Province, and the Provinces are as members where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the body of the whole Union is composed; the particular States
of every particular Province hold the Soveraignty thereof; and the
States Generall retain the Soveraign Eminency of the Union; the
particular States consist of Noblemen and Cities, as also do the States
Generall. The Assembly of the particular States of each Province
meet upon great affairs; and the Assembly of the States Generall of
the whole Union upon affairs of greater importancy, as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
States of every Province are still kept on foot in the Councell
which depends thereon; so is the great Assembly of the Union in the
Councell of the States Generall which represents the whole Body.
Every Province hath a Supream Head, and the whole Union a Head
of great Eminency. By this conformity, and mutual knots of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the United Provinces are tyed together and joyntly concur in
what concerns the common Interest.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The Land-Forces of the Vnited Provinces.</head>
                  <p>LEt us now consider the strength of the United Provinces; first
therefore as by land, then by Sea; in what concerns the land, the
strength of their Country, the condition of their Towns, the aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ammunition for War, the quality and number of their Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
may aptly be taken into consideration. First the strength of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces cannot be imagined to be greater then it is. They
are secured on many parts by the Sea; and within land, the <hi>Mause</hi> and
the <hi>Rheine</hi> distinguished into several branches, together with the <hi>Ysel,</hi>
and many other Rivers serve them for Bulwarks in many other parts.
<hi>Zealand</hi> in particular is divided into many Islands, so as by reason of its
scituation it may be said to be Impenetrable. <hi>Holland</hi> is likewise almost
unaccessable on all sides, in respect of the many large Channels, and
Arms of the Sea, which do so many several ways divide it, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
it; and generally the scituation of all the other Provinces is low
and spungie; full of channels and rivers, and very hard to be wonn into.</p>
                  <p>But their Towns are no less strong then is their Countrey; all the
Towns upon their Frontiers are strongly munited, particularly those
which lie towards the Archdukes Countrey, where their jealousies are
greatest. And to begin with <hi>Sluse</hi> in the Province of <hi>Flanders;</hi> this is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55461:9"/>
a place which is thought almost untakable, as well for the strength of
its scituation, which is altogether amongst Marshes and low Channels,
as having all the higher parts thereof very well fortified with outward
Earth-works where the Trenches may be opened. In <hi>Brabant</hi> they
have the strong Fort of <hi>Lillo,</hi> almost within sight of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> They
have <hi>Berghen-ap-Zone, Breda, Gatrinburg, Heusden, Grave,</hi> and the strong
Hold of <hi>Crevecoeur,</hi> all of them places strongly munited both by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and Art. On that side of <hi>Ghelderland</hi> which lookes towards <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant,</hi>
and in that part thereof which is within the Archdukes Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
the Low Countreys have likewise many strong Holds, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Fort of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> near <hi>Balduke</hi> in the Island of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell,</hi>
and not far off that of <hi>Worden, Niminghen,</hi> and <hi>Schincks Scence;</hi> to
boot that on that side of <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> the <hi>Rheine</hi> and <hi>Mause</hi> make the
entrance very difficult. More inward the said Provinces have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
many strong places, both by scituation and Art; nor is it almost
to be exprest what diligence they use in the managing of their Towns
and Forts.</p>
                  <p>For what concerns warlick ammunition, all the strong Holds and
Towns of the United Provinces are aboundantly well provided; they
have great store of Artillery every where, and of all other Provisions
necessary for War, of Engins, and all sorts of warlick Instruments;
great likewise is their Provision of Victuals every where; and 'tis
seldom or never seen that they lose any place for want, either of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
or ammunition, which are particularly extracted out of <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zealand,</hi> and cannot with greater accommodation be distributed, being
convey'd in boats by water to every place, and where rivers are wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
their default is made good by channels cut out by hand, of which
the whole Countrey is full, and as it were link'd together.</p>
                  <p>As for the condition and number of their Soldiers; their Militia is
composed of partly homebred Soldiers, partly forreiners; their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
is not great enough to furnish them with Soldiers sufficient in
number for their occasions, nor are all their people equally adapted
for the Militia profession. Those of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> are not good
at land-Service; the other Provinces breed Soldiers good enough
both for horse and foot; but by sea the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> bear
away the bell, not only among all those of the Northern Nations, but
even throughout the whole World. The greatest Nerve of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Militia consists in the Soldiers of their own Countrey which lie
most within land; but the strongest and most solid nerve of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
consists in the number and condition of their forrein Forces. Since
the first beginning of the War of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
began to be favoured by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> they have always
had great store of Soldiers from each of these Kingdoms; yea e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
since the Truce they have a great strength of foot from <hi>France,
England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to boot with the Souldiers of these Nations,
they take into pay a great number of <hi>German</hi> foot. The United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
may at this time have in their Army about 6000 French-men,
4000 whereof are maintained by the Crown of <hi>France</hi> under two field
Marshals, the other 2000 are mingled amongst those of the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
The English may be about 3000, the Scots 2000, and the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
3000: All the rest of their foot consists of their own Soldierie,
by this account we may judge that the United Provinces maintain
now since the Truce 20000 foot, and 2500 horse; to boot with the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55461:10"/>
4000 forementioned French foot, which together with 200 horse are
still maintained by the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> By reason of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
jealousies of the Spaniard, they have not any ways lesned their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
forces, though the Truce be made, and have cashier'd but few of
their own men. Of forreinors, the French are much commended for
their valour; next the English, and after them the Scots; the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
are naturally slow, but well govern'd, and very usefull for ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

works which happen howerly in their Armies; and as for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
themselves of the United Provinces, they lean more to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Dutch, then of forreinors, and this may suffice for their
Strength by Land.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of their Maretine Forces.</head>
                  <p>FOur considerations may also be had concerning their Forces by
Sea. The quantity of their Vessels; the aboundance of all things
necessary to furnish them, the number of their Mariners, and their
Skill in Navigation.</p>
                  <p>To begin with the number of their Vessels, by common judgment
it is esteem'd to be as great as almost that of all <hi>Europe</hi> besides. The
number of ships which people the arms of the Sea, the Bays and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> is almost infinit; besides there are very
many in the Marratine parts of <hi>Friesland;</hi> but their number is greatest
in <hi>Holland,</hi> and more in <hi>Amsterdam</hi> then in any other City of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
It will not be amiss to say something here in particular of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam:</hi>
On the more Northern parts of <hi>Holland</hi> the Sea, after having
made its way through more then one obstacle by land, and made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
breaches, washes <hi>Holland</hi> again in its most shut-up parts, and
makes there a large Gulf which in their language is called <hi>Zuyderzee</hi>
the Sea dividing it self from this greater gulf into many lesser, which
are all Navigable for any Vessel how great soever, comes at last to
shut it self up, and as it were to hide it self within land in a deep chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
upon whose banks the City extends it self; the Walls whereof
are not only wash'd by the Sea, but the said Sea passeth through the
City, in many Channels by which lesser Barks do commodiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
from the greater all sorts of Merchandize which are carried into
the Warehouses and Magazins of the City, the greater Vissels ride
within sight of the Walls, which are so many and stand so thick, as
their Masts and Sails do bound the sight of the lookers on: so many
ships fraught with all sorts of Merchandise come from all parts of the
World, to meet and inglobe themselves as it were in <hi>Amsterdam;</hi> so
as that Town may in these days be esteemed the most frequented and
Merchantlike, not only of <hi>Europe,</hi> but even of the whole world. This
City is grown to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> greatness and Opulency by reason of the War;
though commence did formerly flourish there very much, the War
hath much diminish'd the Traffick of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and hath afforded oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to the Hollanders and Zealanders to Traffick into the Indies;
so as these are the reasons of the so great growth of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> In
former time <hi>Antwerp</hi> was the staple Town of Merchandise of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
and <hi>Lisbon</hi> was the like for those that come from the Indies; but
since the War, <hi>Amsterdam</hi> hath as it were monopolized all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55461:10"/>
both of <hi>Europe</hi> and the Indies; and hath almost quite
undone both <hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Lisbon;</hi> by reason whereof the concourse of
vessels to that is city very great: <hi>Roterdam</hi> is held the next place for traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
in <hi>Holland.</hi> Here are likewise at all times great store of shipping,
and many ships are here built, it being one of the chiefest Arsenals of
<hi>Holland:</hi> near to <hi>Roterdam</hi> lies <hi>Dort</hi> drowned as it were in a large chan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nel
of the Sea, a City whereunto many ships do also continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort.
Near to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> upon the same Gulf of <hi>Zuyde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>zee</hi> which hath
been spoken of, many other good Towns lie frequented by great and
numerous Vessels, but especially <hi>Enchusen,</hi> a place famous for building
of shipping: many other Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> by reason of the Arms of
the Sea, are very full of ships; and because <hi>Holland</hi> is inviron'd almost
every where by the Sea, and that the water stands there in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
because many Rivers run through it, and the Channels therein
cut by hand, which always are very full of Vessels; some have wittily
said that there are more houses in <hi>Holland</hi> on the water then in the
land: as for the shipping in <hi>Zealand,</hi> great store are built there like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
and specially belonging to the City of <hi>Midleburg,</hi> which is the
chief City of that Province. <hi>Flushing</hi> is likewise a very famous Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>
Town in <hi>Zealand;</hi> and because this Town lies more forward in the
Sea then <hi>Midleburg,</hi> it may be term'd the Gate which opens and shuts
up the entrance into <hi>Zealand:</hi> In this Haven there are therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
many Vessels, and hither come those first, which come for <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
Many ships likewise are set out from <hi>Friesland,</hi> and particular<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
from <hi>Harlinghem,</hi> a famous Haven which looks towards <hi>Holland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great aboundance of all things necessary for them, is answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to this their store of shipping: and that which is the greatest
wonder is, that <hi>Holland</hi> which abounds most in all these things, doth
not produce almost any of them from within her self: there doth
not grow any corn of whatsoever sort in <hi>Holland;</hi> yet <hi>Europe</hi> hath
not a more plentifulf Granary: No flax growes in <hi>Holland,</hi> yet from
thence doth issue an infinit deal of linnen cloth: no wool comes from
<hi>Holland,</hi> yet is there great store of cloth made there: There are no
woods in <hi>Holland,</hi> yet this Province builds more ships then almost all
<hi>Europe</hi> besides: <hi>Holland</hi> abounds within it self with cattel, with fish,
and all things made of milk; which being salted, and great provision
made thereof, their ships are plentifully provided therewith: like
provision is likewise made of all other sorts of Victuals necessary for
life, of cloth for wearing, of sayl clothes for sayling, and of all things
else which belong to Navigation; so as there is not only nothing wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in the United Provinces of what is necessary for setting forth
whatsoever number of ships, but a great superaboundance thereof.</p>
                  <p>Then for the number of Mariners, who are the animated Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Navigation, they yeild not in number to the other unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e
necessaries. The People of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> do generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
themselves to one of two professions, either to Merchandizing
or Seafaring; and because both these Provinces are very full of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
especially <hi>Holland,</hi> there are enough left for Sea affairs. All
the Inhabitants of <hi>Zealand</hi> except those of <hi>Midleburg,</hi> are Mariners;
their number is infinit in <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> as in the most Merchant Towns
which are scituated on the Sea; and in this Province the Rivers and
Channels may be said to be the habitations of these sort of men; to
which in nature and in profession an infinit number of Fishermen do
correspond.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:55461:11"/>
But after all this, how great and how miraculous is their Skill in Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation?
The People of those parts are naturally more adicted to sea, then
to land Affairs. The very Children suck in the precepts of Navigation
with their Mothers milk; and every house in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> may be
said to be a School thereof: when they have run over the more neighbou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
seas in their younger years, being grown more strong, they betake
themselves to plough up the farther deeps, till by their continual Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
having measured every Angle of the Ocean, they dare venture even
upon the taming of the fury or tempest thereof.</p>
                  <p>There is no Climate, Star, nor winde which they are not well acquainted
with: They are bred up in these sorts of Labours and sufferings; and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphing,
as it were, over even Nature it self, contrary to the Laws thereof
they joyn together the farthest distant Seas; carry the one Pole to the
other, and making one Hemisphere of two, they joyn together, not onely
in Commerce, but as it were in one place, the farthest remote Nations of
the Earth. Thus by their so many singular successes in Sea-affairs, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
by their Navigation in the <hi>Indies,</hi> but chiefly by the attempt which
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> made, not many yeares agoe, towards the
Northern parts of the Frosen sea, their renown is grown so great through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole World, as they may be said to have clouded the glory of all
other Nations. These People did not apply themselves in former times
in sayling to the <hi>Indies;</hi> the <hi>Spaniard</hi> did not permit them so to doe, till
the Warre was commenc'd; and after it was begun, they being suffered
notwithstanding to frequent the <hi>Spanish</hi> Seas, they were contented with
this near and moderate gain, rather then to adventure upon vast and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
Traffique, which was to be fetch'd from new Seas, and from new
and unknown Winds. The Rebels of <hi>Holland</hi> were afterwards forbidden
by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to come neer any of their Ports. Irritated therefore by
despair of losing at once the Commerce with Spain, and their share of that
of the Indies, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders</hi> resolved to venture of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into those so remote parts. Nor did they make any long delay:
They furnish'd out some few ships at first, and putting to Sea; made to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the South, and then turning towards the East, they with much
courage ended so long and toylsome a Voyage.</p>
                  <p>This their first Adventure did not notwithstanding prove very fortunate,
nor much gainfull to them: but having much better successe in their after-Voyages,
they in a short time rendred those <hi>Seas</hi> so familiar to their People,
that they goe now to the <hi>East-Indies</hi> with as much ease, as if they went for
Pastime from one of their own Ports to another. But this so great a
daring ended not here: nor were they contented to have addrest their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
to the commerce of the <hi>Indies.</hi> After they had found out this new
way of Traffique, and after having brought by many Voyages an inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
Treasure of Spicery into <hi>Holland,</hi> to the great prejudice of the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> they had courage enough oftentimes to insult over the <hi>Portugals</hi>
in those Seas, and even to besiege them within those Townes and Cities
which had been by them alone for so many years peacefully possest. They
likewise have sailed into the West <hi>Indies,</hi> but they cannot as yet get any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
there, meeting with greater difficulties and more obstacles, for
that it is almost totally populated with <hi>Spanish</hi> Colonies; yet had not the
Truce insued, they had designed to have raised new Forces that they might
get footing there likewise; to the end that they might continually infest
those Seas, and the firm land; and have a narrower watch upon the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish</hi>
Fleet, which if it should at any time fall into their hands, the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:55461:11"/>
would thereby assuredly receive a greater blow then they have
done at any time before: by what hath been said, it may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
how great the strength of the United Provinces is by Sea, and
what advantages they are likely to make thereby upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Revenue, and Expences of the Vnited Provinces.</head>
                  <p>IT now remains that we see what moneys the United Provinces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
and how they lay them out; it is commonly judged that in
time of War, according to the greater or lesser occasions of expence,
they contribute one year with another eight millions of Florins, for
the service of their generall Union, which amounts to the sum of
3200000 Crowns, at the rate of five shillings a Crown, in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
disbursement every Province contributed its particular propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
according to the utmost of their abilities, unless it were some
moneys which by the way of common hostility in the time of War
was gathered in common from the whole Union: All hostility being
now at an end by the Truce, this kind of Tax doth likewise cease. In
time of War also, because all the Ports of <hi>Flanders</hi> were continually
besieged by the Ships of the United Provinces, all Forrein Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
were unloaded in <hi>Holland</hi> and in <hi>Zealand,</hi> to the great profit of
those two Provinces in particular, and to the great advantage of the
General Union: Whereas now the Seas being open, much Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
will certainly be hereafter brought into the Ports of <hi>Flanders:</hi>
The Union hath not now almost any income by the way of common
disbursement; and therefore the moneys which the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
contribute for the expence of the whole Union, consist in what is
raised severally from every one of them.</p>
                  <p>The United Provinces raise almost all their moneys by way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
which to say truth are so great there, as they cannot well
be greater; but the People bear them patiently! Their Liberty
could not long endure without Arms, nor their arms without stipends,
nor their stipends without impositions; and the United Provinces will
always so apprehend the Power of <hi>Spain,</hi> as they will easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
to be always prepar'd for War, that so they may the easilyer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
all new hazards.</p>
                  <p>The monies which are raised in common from the said Provinces, are
contributed as hath bin said, according to the possible abilities of each
of them. <hi>Holland</hi> which is the greatest and richest of all the rest, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
the one half of the whole: next to <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> is Taxed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
then any of the other six; and the other concur with their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
proportions: For example sake; of a hundred <hi>Holland</hi> furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
fifty; <hi>Zealand</hi> about twenty; <hi>Friesland</hi> twelve; and the rest with
very little difference the remainder.</p>
                  <p>The moneys must needs be very great which the United Provinces
spend in their common interest, their Countrey being considered,
which is but of a small circuit; besides every Province reserves a
proportion for several occasions of their own; but Traffick makes
good what is wanting in Land; and the commodiousness of the Sea,
supplyes their narrowness of ground; and the industry of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:55461:12"/>
the defects of Nature. They manage their moneys to the
best advantage, their Army which may be said to exhaust the whole,
is paid with many limitations; in paying of the Soldiery they account
forty days to the month, so as their Military year falls very short in
months. The United Provinces use not those entertainments, nor
those advantages of Pay which are used in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Army;
so as their sallary being limited, they are well pay'd, and their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
do not mutiny; and consequently they are not subject to such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of Muteny, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are, by which the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi>
hath been greatly indammaged. All the moneys of the General U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
are laid out as hath been said, in the maintenance of their Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;
and 'tis thought that the United Provinces in time of Truce do
disburse therein 2800000 crownes a year.</p>
                  <p>The said Provinces are much indebted to <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> for
moneys which they have received from those two Crowns upon
several occasions in time of War; and they also upon the same
Terms owe great sums upon Interest to divers Merchants of their
own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>Every Province apart hath their particular Revenues, as also their
particular expences: <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and <hi>Friesland,</hi> are at great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
in maintaining their Banks and Channels, that they may keep
their Country as dry and passable as they can; but <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi>
are particularly at great Charges in keeping out the Sea, which doth
oftentimes strangely indammage them; the Ocean appears more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
and more tempestuous on that shore then in any other part of
<hi>Europe;</hi> and there you would believe the Sea and Land to be at grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
variance then any where else, and that there the two Elements
shewed their greatest enmity one to another.</p>

I will now tell you how their Militia is Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd:
Count <hi>Mauris</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> is General of all
their Soldiery; but being to speak of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
who is at this time of so high esteem, it
is requisit, to the end that I may the more clearly set down his Actions,
that in the first place I treat of those of his Father the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,</hi>
who hath been so much heard and spoken of in this our Age;
to the which I am likewise invited by a particular desire I have by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting
the Nature, Actions, and death of this Prince; to give
you a breviat of the beginnings, chief events, and end of this last
so long and memorable War of the Low Countreys:</p>
                  <p>The House of <hi>Nassaw</hi> hath its originall, and still keeps its chief
root in <hi>Germany,</hi> and is accounted one of the antientest, and most
noble of those parts. Out of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Germany</hi> came <hi>William</hi> (so was the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> called) into <hi>Flanders</hi> when he was yet but a childe, and was
received into the Service of the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, by whose
particular favour, rather then by any necessary proximity of blood,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:55461:13"/>
he afterwards remained heir of the House of <hi>Schalloune;</hi> and of a bare
Count of <hi>Nassaw</hi> (being inriched with much wealth) came likewise
by this succession to inherit the Principality of <hi>Orange</hi> in <hi>France:</hi> He
together with this, acquir'd greater Fortunes from the Emperor: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
when <hi>Charls</hi> went to spend the rest of his days privately in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and his Son King <hi>Philip</hi> staid for a while in <hi>Flanders, Orange</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
still in great favour with the King: <hi>Philip</hi> was likewise after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to return for <hi>Spain,</hi> so as it was necessary to think upon some one
who might supply his place in the Government of <hi>Flanders:</hi> Two
Princesses were chiefly in nomination thereunto; the one <hi>Christierna</hi>
Dutches Dowager of <hi>Lorrain;</hi> the other <hi>Margaret,</hi> wife to <hi>Octavius
Fernese,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> the first being Neece by the sisters side to the
Emperor, the other his natural daughter. <hi>Christierna</hi> was much
desired by the Nobility of the Countrey, as she who by the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was well known in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and who by reason of the
conformity of those two Countreys was likely to be more gratious in
her Government, and more conformable generally to the Pallat of the
<hi>Dutch;</hi> and the peace which chiefly by her means had but a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been concluded in <hi>Cambrey,</hi> was yet fresh in their memory; and
the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was of all others chiefly for the choice of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erna;</hi>
for he had some hope to marry a daughter of hers, by which
means he did aspire to be the Arbitror and Moderator of her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>On the other side, the Kings officers of State were more for <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret;</hi>
'twas thought she would be more affectionate to the Kings affairs
then <hi>Christierna,</hi> to whom they gave the title of a French woman, and
thought her more interested in the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> in respect of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain:</hi>
Whereas <hi>Margaret,</hi> in respect of her neerer relation to the blood
Royal, by reason of so many interests of the Family of the <hi>Fernesees</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and for that <hi>Alexander</hi> her onely son
was then intended for the Kings Court, as a pledge of greater depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy,
was held to be wholly for the Spanish Faction. At last the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations
which made for <hi>Margaret</hi> prevailed; whereupon she was
chosen, and declared to be Regent of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to that purpose
was sent for from <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <p>THe Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> being netled by this Election,<note place="margin">An. 1559.</note> was afterwards
stung to the quick, with the obstacle which he met withal in his
pretended Marriage with the Dutchess of <hi>Lorain</hi>'s daughter. The King
did not like that one so great in <hi>Flanders,</hi> should yet become greater
by this neer leaning stock of <hi>Lorrain:</hi> and that insteed of such aliance
as might become a Subject, he should be raised to an aliance so neer
the King himself: nor had the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> such a stroke in the
Government afterwards with the Regent, as he willingly would have
had; he therefore grew wroth within, and had a great desire to try
some novelty, and therewithall to open his way to more eminent
Fortune amongst the general innovations. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> was
in great esteem with the Dutch; and truly he was a man of very
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55461:13"/>
great parts: Of a strong body, constant minde, flowing tongue, and
good at counsel; he was very dextrous, and wonderful vigilant; but
these vertues were counterpoised with much greater vices: There
was no faithfulness in him, no goodness, no shame to do evil; his
religion was onely outward; he was of an unquiet minde, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ambitious; nor was there ever any who knew better how to winde
people by deceit, nor how better to clothe his own ends with zeal to
the Publick.</p>
                  <p>The King being return'd or <hi>Spain,</hi> the first jealousie given by the
Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> was his Marrying of <hi>Anne</hi> daughter to <hi>Maurice,</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of saxony, who was a Lutheran. Returning from <hi>Germany</hi> with
his new wife to <hi>Brussels,</hi> he met not with much difficulty in ordering
his pre-meditated revolutions. The people of <hi>Flanders</hi> were then
much stir'd up, and all the three orders of which the body of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
were framed, were almost equally agrieved. The Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick,
by a new erection of Episcopacy which resulted to the great
dishonor of the Monastical Abbots, in whom the highest degree of
Ecclesiasticks did before consist: The order of the Nobility, because
they saw they were forever to be deprived of the presence of their
natural Prince, and to fall into the Government of a Forraigner, wher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the too great and too Imperious authority which the Cardinal
<hi>Granville</hi> held with the Regent, appeared to them to be in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
too intollerable: The Popular order; for that the people of
<hi>Flanders</hi> being accustomed to live in much liberty, and many of them
being there upon faln into the licentiousness of Heresie, they could not
endure the new rigour of the publick edicts, against such as were
infected, which rigour was termed by the hateful title of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish

                     <hi>Orange</hi> had always tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rised
with the <hi>Regent;</hi> but when he heard that the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:55461:14"/>
on his march, and drew neer, he openly discovered his minde, and
retired into <hi>Germany,</hi> together with his brother <hi>Lodovick:</hi> He thought
it now no longer time to temporise: he considered he might do so
whilst he had to do with a Regent, who was a woman, and in the
power of Dutch forces; but what security could he hope for from
so great a Commander, as was the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> who came to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the Kings orders in the head of a Forraign Army, with his
sword in his hand; what suspitions might he think his former acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had occasioned? and how many had he indeed given? And he
feigned his fears to be the greater, that he might stirre up greater
desire of Revolutions; resolving then not to wait the arrival of the
Dukes Forces, he withdrew to the parts which lay neerest <hi>Germany,</hi>
that he might there wait the time which might recal him to those in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations

                  <p>THe Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> entered the Low-Countries the year 1567, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
with him a powerful Army, all of them being almost Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;
more powerful in valour then umber of men. He took
upon him the Government; his first intentions were to secure such
of the Nobility and Cities as he most suspected; he therefore forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
imprisoned Count <hi>Egm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

others of the Nobility of that Country; and prepared heavy
yoaks of Citadels for many Cities, which were of greatest conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
either for their scituation or for their Inhabitants: the first and
chiefest was that of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and to the yoke of Citadels, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the bridle of armed Garrisons.</p>
                  <p>These so rigorous Foundations of Government being laid by the
Duke, it remained to see what commotions might thereby be made
as well within as without <hi>Flanders;</hi> there were great dangers both
within and without. From <hi>France</hi> to boot with the wonted jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> received from this neighbourhood, they had
reason then to doubt the faction of the Hereticks, who with very great
Forces kept that Kingdom then infested and troubled. The Queen
of <hi>England</hi> conspiring likewise with the <hi>Hugonets</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> had the
same designe of fomenting the Heresy and Rebellion of the Low
Countreys, and to do what in her lay to bereave the <hi>Spaniard</hi> quite of
them, to the end that her Kingdom might be free from the nighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
of this suspected power. Such Hereticall Princes of <hi>Germany</hi>
as were nearest, affrighted by the example of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and
apprehending least the slavery which was introduced upon those of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> might be extended even into <hi>Germany,</hi> did readily agree in the
same thoughts and Councels; these were the dangers from abroad;
but those at home were of no less importance, for that the <hi>Dutch</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> so much in Climat, in Customs and in Laws,
and that Nation being so incens'd against this by reason of what had
happ'ned of new, it was plainly seen, that the Dutch would only for
bear rising till they might have occasion of discovering themselves.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:55461:14"/>
The first dangers arose from without; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> and his
brother <hi>Lodovick,</hi> were retired as hath been said into <hi>Germany;</hi> neither
were they then idle. Their Family was greatly allyde and adhered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
in those parts, and they wonn easie belief to their reigned and spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
pretences, wherewith under the title of the common good, they
coloured their departure from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and their privat ends: it was
not long ere they took up Arms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Lodovick</hi> was the first who carryed
the War into <hi>Friesland,</hi> wherein he proved very fortunate: Count <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who was sent against him by the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> with great
Forces was routed, and himself slain in battel: The Duke being here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at
moved, resolv'd to go himself in person to fight, and drive out <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovick;</hi>
having first caused the heads of Count <hi>Egmont</hi> and Count
<hi>Horn</hi> to be strucken off at <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ussels;</hi> the Army was instantly on its
march, and speedily led into <hi>Friesland;</hi> where the Dukes arrival, fight
and victory, was one and the same things; so as <hi>Lodovick</hi> being defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and made to fly, he retyred again to <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had again prepared a more important war
against the Duke: He not long after entred the Country with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull
Army which he had raised in <hi>Germany;</hi> which being increased
by <hi>Hugonot</hi> Forces from <hi>France,</hi> after he had in vain laboured to get
some men from <hi>Liege,</hi> he staid in <hi>Brabant,</hi> hoping assuredly to raise
some insurrections thereabouts, and to get footing in some chief City;
but for that time he failed in his designe; for he found the Duke of
<hi>Alva</hi> on his Front, who having the art of incamping and conquering
without the expence of blood, did in a short time drive him out of the
Countrey. The Duke returned in triumph into <hi>Brussels:</hi> and if he
had been pleased after the punishments he had inflicted within the
Town, and the Victories he had brought from abroad, to have tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
and mitigated the rigour of his Government, there had been
great hopes that the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> might have been accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in some convenient manner, and the signes thereof grew already
greater by a general pardon sent from the King; when the Duke being
inexorable, would not revoke the resolution he had taken of laying
some new and unaccustomed Impositions upon all the goods, as well
moveable as immoveable, which were in the Country. The <hi>Dutch</hi>
thought it then too hard that they should not only undergo, but that
themselves should nourish the slavery, which by so many several ways
the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> would introduce amongst them; who till that time
were wont to live without almost any grievances, and to be govern'd
as Free men. The risings in the Low Countreys being then become
inevitable, the first thunder thereof was heard in <hi>Zealand:</hi> Then

to make the Duke of <hi>Alva's</hi> rigidness be forgotten; but as
wounds ill cured at first, usually become uncurable, so, so many and

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:55461:15"/>
Neither swords, nor lenetives could any longer avail. The
pertenaciousness and daring of the Rebels growing still greater, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hov'd
the Commendador to trie whether he could tame them by the

Commanders, to whom so important a Victory cost the loss of but
very little blood; but they reaped but little good thereby, by reason
of the mutiny which not long after brake out amongst the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
for want of pay: After the battel at <hi>Mock,</hi> the memorable siege
of <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland</hi> succeeded: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> had already brought
them within the Town into great straits, when they found themselves
without, to be in very great danger. The Hollander took a desperat
advice to relieve <hi>Leyden</hi> by cutting many rivers into one, whereby they
drowned a great part of the Country, and so at last relieved the Town
by water, which they could not do by land; and the City was freed
from the siege, the besiegers becoming the besieged, and many of
them perished in the waters.</p>
                  <p>There were some hopes at this time of putting an end to their
troubles by som fair accommodation. The Emperor <hi>Radulphus</hi> appeared
therein, who sent <hi>Ambassadors</hi> to <hi>Flanders</hi> to this end; but this endeavor
proved quickly vain, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and their adherents being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
too contumacious, and suffering themselves to be too easily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
away by the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his artifices, wherby he wrought so,
as those just conditions of Peace propounded on the King of <hi>Spains</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
were not admitted of. They consisted chiefly of two points; that
the Rebels should return to their due obedience to their King, and
that they should restore the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Religion into its former
condition. Upon these conditions, the King offered to satisfie the
rebels in all the other principall concernments, as in taking away all
foreiners; in taking away all garisons and Impositions, and in restoring
them to their Priviledges and former government. The rebels did
not openly deny obedience to the King; but that they might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
unto their allegiance, propounded difficulties not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
nor overcome, and for what concerned their Religion, they
went about to justifie their old intentions by various pretences; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
by affirming that <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> would be in a great
measure unpeopled, if all they were to go from thence who wereof
the reformed Religion, as they term'd it. All Treaties of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

quit the Low-Conntreys; to boot with the first dislike which the
<hi>Dutch</hi> had in general of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> those of the Councell made use

after a great many of them had again mutinied with danger of much
prejudice to the Countrey thereby. They were then by publick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of the whole Councell, all of them proclaimed Rebels; and
the people in all parts rose up in Arms against them; upon the same
pretence they betook themselves to besiege the best Forts which were

all their Forts fell into the hands of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who had joyn'd their

                  <p>Another practice of importancy yet remained to end the business,
wherein the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> used his utmost skill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was, That
all the Provinces of the Low Countreys should be reconciled in one,
and to joyn together with <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> and that they should all
unanimously provide for the common Interest. The Deputies of all
the Provinces except, <hi>Luxembourg, &amp;c.</hi> convened together to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in <hi>Gaunt,</hi> which is the chiefest City of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and concluded the
peace which went afterwards by the name of <hi>Gaunt.</hi> The chief Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
thereof were, that all Forreiners were to be driven out by the
Common Arms; that they should indeavour to get the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
them to their first Government; that for what concerns Religion,
except <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> all the other Provinces should suffer no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religion to be exercised in them save what was <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick;
and that the results of matters of Religion in those two particular
Provinces, should be reserved to be determined by the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
which were to meet as soon as might be. The Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
thought it impossible that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should approve of this
peace, and therefore firmly believed that all the other Provinces
would very speedily joyn in the same Insurrection with <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>Zealand.</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> this mean while met together from many parts, and

to be Rebels, and exposed them as it were to a publick and generall
slaughter, went towards the Citadell of <hi>Antwerp.</hi> They rested very
few houres of the day, and were very weary when they came thither,
notwithstanding without taking any manner of rest, they with one
accord resolved either to die, or sup that very night in <hi>Antwerp;</hi> they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:55461:16"/>
made no long delay: they marched out of the Citadell in good order
to the number of about 3000. and gave on with such resolution and
force upon the Enemies trenches, who in great numbers besieged the

through them and making them fly, was one and the same action, and
effected as soon as begun. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> sufficiently glutted with the

they spent three whole days, and which was the occasion of those

want of pay, to <hi>Don Iohns</hi> default, as the said <hi>Don Iohn</hi> found himself
presently to be much suspected, and in danger of inevitable treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
against his person. The Lady Margaret of <hi>Vallois</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarr,</hi>

on the King of <hi>Spains</hi> behalf, and some Deputies in the
name of those Provinces which joyned in the Insurrection, did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene;
some tollerable composition of the affairs in <hi>Flanders</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
in <hi>Spain,</hi> regard being always had to the Catholick Religion and
to the Regall Authority; but all their diligence proved at last vain:
so many were the difficulties which were met withall in the Treaty,
and so inestricable had the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> made them by his usuall
cunning.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty at <hi>Cullen</hi> proving vain, the King thought he could now
no longer forbear the last demonstration of his just anger against the
Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> he proclaimed him to be guilty of high Treason,
the Head and Author of the rebellion in the Low Countreys, the
publick bane and chief Author of all the Evils; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
hereat incensed, flew presently to desperat Councels; and laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
the first pretended colour of the War which was that they fought
not against the King, but against the pride and tyranny of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
as he and those that sided with him termed it, he began barefac'd
to deny obedience to the King, and easily induced his followers to
do the like, and to provide themselves of a new Prince. The Duke
of <hi>Alanzon</hi> was thought the fittest of all others for this purpose, out
of hopes that they might ingage the King of <hi>France</hi> in the Dukes In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest:
whereupon the Duke was received into <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and with
publick solemnity sworn Prince of the Low Countreys. <hi>Orange</hi> had
no particular affection to the French; but he indeavoured and hoped
to keep up the Rebellion of <hi>Flanders</hi> by means of the French Forces,
and to handle the business so, as the Dutch growing at last weary of
the French, and despairing of ever being pardoned by the Spaniard,
they might come to frame a Free Government, whereof he might be
the Moderator and Arbitror: in which variety of successes, if more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:55461:18"/>
favor'd by Fortune, he could not get to bee made absolute Prince of
all the Revolted Provinces, he hoped that he might yet prove to be so
in Holland and in Zealand; two strong and powerfull Provinces, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with Heresie already, and which now acknowledged no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
then his. These were the ends to which it was thought <hi>Orange</hi>
his blind Ambition did tend; the joyful presages of <hi>Alansonne</hi> the new
Prince did this mean while forbode no good to his hopes; for at the
same time a bold Bischayard came to him, and within his own House
discharged a Musquet at his head. He was cured of this wound, but
this foretold another of the like sort, which not long after was the
occasion of his death.</p>

&amp; those on the Kings behalf went on still prosperously. The Arch-Duke
<hi>Matthias</hi> had lost all his hopes a good while before; so as hee was
forced to return into Germany with no great Reputation. <hi>Alanzon</hi>
was likewise weary of the Dutch, and the Dutch of him: Neither
could the Duke bear with the indignity of the Conditions, whereby
he became rather to receive Lawes, then to give them in such form of
Government as was prescribed him; nor yet could the Dutch tolerate
that the French aydes should correspond so badly with the promises
made by the Duke. The Duke was the first that began to stir; Hee
endevoured to take Antwerp by force, and to establish his Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
by Arms: Som of his People had already entred the City, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to pillage it; but the People betaking themselves to their Armes,
the French were presently driven out with no lesse slaughter then dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor:
Nor was it possible, for all that the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> could do,
(who thought the present alteration not yet ripe enough for his ends)
that the Dutch could be brought to forgoe the ill will which they had
conceived against the French; so as ere long the Duke was necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to return for France, without any reputation or hope, and his
people abased and but ill treated.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of Orange after these affairs had shut himself up in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
with his mind wholly bent to find out some fuel wherby to keep
alive the fire of Rebellion, which was already so well kindled; when
at once the blow came, which cut both his Designes and his Life short.
He that wounded him was a Burgonian, and the wound was given by
a Pistoll, which he desperatly discharged at his Head. This hapned
at <hi>Delfe,</hi> where the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> then was, who dyed almost pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
upon it, not being able to speak a word. This was the end of
<hi>William</hi> of <hi>Nassaw</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the 52. year of his Age. A man
who without doubt might have been numbred amongst the famousest
of our Times, if resting contented with his own so considerable For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
he had not by violence and illegall meanes endeavoured to raise
himself to a greater. He dyed reputed an Heretick; and which is more,
not thought to have any Religion at all in him. Hee profest Liberty
of Religion and Government, that he might the better invegle the
People, and under the name of Liberty oppress it the more; Those
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:55461:18"/>
that sided most with him, were the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Zealanders;</hi> and his

he appeared rather to be Prince thereof then Governour; and 'twas
said, that they had resolved to choose him for their Prince.</p>

which that they might be the more firm and stable, there wanted not

death, they were so far from listning to any thing that might
tend to a reconciliation, as they resolved to continue the War even to
the last Gasp, rather then ever to return to be under the command of
Spain. The first thing they did after the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his death,
was to honour his memory with solemn Pomp and Obsequies. And
presently substituted Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> his Son, in his Fathers Honors
and Titles, beleeving firmly that hee would prove true Heir and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor

became his Brother-in-Law.</p>
                  <p>The King of Spains Forces were this mean while Victorious in all

Friesland were already returned to the Kings obedience; and
the Catholick Forces had made good progress on all sides. Only <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp</hi>
made resistance, &amp; did a little retard them: but the difficulty of the
siege of <hi>Antwerp</hi> made for the Prince his Glory, since the greater the
Obstacles were which he met withall in managing the siege, his valor
appeared to be the greater in reducing it at the last. He master'd the

way; and frustrated the mighty Machines of a great Ship, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Boats with Fire-workes, which with an ill Omen they termed,
The Wars end, for they made no long Resistance afterwards. This

faln into the Prince his hands; so as the Rebels were never in so bad

Her daring increased together with her ambition, upon the
unhappie success which befell a Fleet at Sea, which the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
had sent against her Kingdom; but the Dutch Rebels began quickly
to be weary of the English yoke; and it was not long till being glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

those Provinces, and reduce them to a conformable obedience; but
this at that time was kept privat amongst the Arcana Regia.</p>
                  <p>The War grew now hot between the Kings of France and Spain;
and the French Forces were chiefly turned against Flanders; so as at
the Cardinals arivall he was necessitated to carry his Forces towards
<hi>Picardy,</hi> wherein he had great good success; for he presently took
two places of great importance; <hi>Callis</hi> and <hi>Ards,</hi> almost underneath

which the King was at last resolved to do, when he found the resistance
of the Rebels in Flanders to grow every day greater and greater: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Archduke being become the Kings son in Law, and having so
great a portion given him, began to buckle the closer to a peace which
was then in Treaty in Flanders with the King of France; hoping by the
friendship of so powerfull a neighborhood, the easilyer to reduce the
Rebels to his obedience; and the desired peace insued. The Archduke
parting from thence to bring the Infanta from Spain, heard the newes

                  <p>Cardinall <hi>Andrea</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> remained in this intrim Governor of

were at this time, but it availed them but little; they only recovered
Remburg, and on the contrary, the disorders of the Kings Army
grew to be so great by being made to winter by violence and rapine
upon divers newtrall Countreys about the Rheine, as all that part of
Germany grew into great indignation, even to the taking up of Arms.
Cardinall <hi>Andrea</hi> ended his Government, having undertaken two
things; the one in vain, which was the indeavouring to take Bomale,
together with all that Island between the Vahall and the Mause, and
the other wherein he succeeded, which was the making of a great
Fort, which by his name was called the Fort of Saint Adrea, in an

Archdukes were threatned, but it was not sufficient to withstand them
all; for Prince, <hi>Maurice</hi> besieged and took <hi>Graves,</hi> one of the most conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
places in all <hi>Brabant.</hi> This mean while the siege of <hi>Ostend</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued:
and Frederick <hi>Spinola,</hi> brother to the Marquiss, had in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
besieged it by Sea, with a Squadron of Gallies brought from <hi>Spain,</hi>
whereby the Enemies would not have been a little indammaged, had
not Frederick whilst he fought valiantly in a bickering at Sea been so
soon slain. The siege at <hi>Ostend</hi> had already continued so long as the
besiegers began to dispair of ever taking it; the scituation of the
place, the cunning and courage of the besieged had made that place be
generally held impregnable, when the undertaking was affigned over
to the Marquiss <hi>Spinolo,</hi> he fully satisfied expectation, his diligence was
such, and so much did he despise all dangers, as the besiegers at last
found themselves necessitated to yeild; for they wanted ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
though never succour without; the Town was surrendred after
three years siege; and certainly it was one of the most famous sieges
that hath been heard of at any time, and the Town was as stoutly and
gallantly defended; by <hi>Spinola's</hi> egregious actions in this success,
'twas seen what might be expected from him hereafter in greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises.</p>
                  <p>Prince <hi>Maurice</hi> was not idle this mean while, he had again besieged
<hi>Balduke,</hi> and not able to compass that designe, he afterwards besieged
<hi>Sluce</hi> in Flanders, intending either to raise the siege of <hi>Ostend</hi> by this
neerer diversion, or to counterpoise the loss of that place by taking of
the other; he failed in the first, but very luckely obtained the other,
which was a business of very great importance; for the scituation,
strength, and every other considerable circumstance of <hi>Ostend</hi> were
paraleld in <hi>Sluce;</hi> which was taken within a few days, and without the
loss of any blood; whereas the taking of <hi>Ostend</hi> cost so much time, so
much money, and so much blood: here ended the Enemies procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
till the Truce; which was afterwards agreed upon: all that was
gotten in the interim was on the Catholicks behalf. The Command
of the Army being given to Marquiss <hi>Spinola,</hi> together with the charge
of Camp-Master-Generall of the Army, he carried it home into the
Enemies Countrey, having first taken the Pass upon the <hi>Rhei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with two Forts, the one on the one side, the other on the other
side thereof, he took <hi>Oldensell, Linghen,</hi> and <hi>Groll</hi> in <hi>Friesland,</hi> and made
the passage upon the <hi>Rheine</hi> the better, by the recovery of <hi>Reinburg:</hi>
passing suddenly from thence to the relief of <hi>Groll</hi> which was besieged
by Prince Maurice, he wonn it, as it may be said, a second time, and
more gloriously then at first, causing <hi>Maurice</hi> shamefully to retreat, and
before his retreat to refuse the battel which he offered him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Spinola</hi> had proposed unto himself things far beyond this: he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
to have entred farther into the Enemies Countrey, and passing
over rivers to make himself Master of <hi>Utricht;</hi> a City of great conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and there to plant the War in the very Gates of <hi>Holland,</hi>
and in the bowels of the Enemy; but the natural strength of their
scituations, a new muteny which happ'ned in the Army, and an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit
number of other difficulties hindred him from making further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements,
and at last instructed him better how weighty a business
it was to go about to quell the Rebellion of <hi>Flanders</hi> by force, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'twas better to think how the differences might be agreed by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:55461:21"/>
Peace. The Enemies were already grown to bold, as they had many
years before carried the War by Sea (where they were strongest) home
even to the very doors of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> They had infested the coasts
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had wrought themselves by sundry navigations into the
East Indies, and were plotting to do the like in the West Indies: so
as the dammage which the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> received in the former,
was so great, and what they had reason to apprehend in the other of
so great consideration, as they did necessarily require some remedie,
which was, that by compounding the affairs of <hi>Flanders;</hi> the affairs of the
Indies might likewise be compounded: Peace was therefore again
indeavoured, but proved at first but in vain; and at last after a very
long Treaty, and wherein mighty difficulties were met withall, a Truce
of twelve years was concluded between them. The Enemies would
never give way to any commencement of the business, which was at
first had by a suspension of Arms, neither would they confirm the
conclusion of the Truce which insued, till it were declared in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
first place,<note place="margin">An. 1607.</note> that the suspension was at first had, and the Truce at last
concluded with them, as with people of free Provinces, to the which
neither the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor yet the Archdukes had any pretence at
all: and this was the first Article of the Agreement: the chiefest of
the others were, That during the Truce all manner of hostility
should cease on each side: That this mean while, each of the Parties
should peacefully enjoy what they did at the present possess:<note place="margin">An. 1609.</note> That
in this interim no new Fortifications should be made by either side:
That Commerce might be free throughout the whole Countrey as it
was before the War: That it might be free to Traffick every where,
save that out of <hi>Europe</hi> the Inhabitants of the United Provinces were
not to negotiat in Countreys belonging to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> By
which words, without nominating the Indies, 'twas pretended that
their People should be excluded from those parts of the Indies which
were subject to the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> These were the most essentiall Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles;
to boot with many others concerning matters of Justice, and
the restitution of Goods.</p>
                  <p>Thus was the Truce concluded, and thus was the War of <hi>Flanders</hi>
which could not be wholly extinguished, husht for a while.</p>
                  <p>A War so long and full of so many and so famous accidents, as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
beyond all others of our times, the memory of our age will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobled
to Posterity; and it may be truely said, that <hi>Flanders</hi> in this
present age hath been as a Military Scene in <hi>Europe,</hi> which for forty
years together, till the conclusion of the Truce, hath exposed to the
Theater of the Universe all the Novelties, and most memorable spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
which were ever seen in any preceding War, or shall ever be
seen in any that shall insue.</p>

                  <p>NOw to return to where I left off, in the beginning of the last
Book; Count <hi>Maurice</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> governs the Forces of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces by Sea and Land; and having had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
thereof with so much reputation in the time of War, he exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
the same authority now in the time of Truce; and doubtlesly
he deserves the Fame which he hath wonn of being one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
Commanders of this our present age. He is Master of the Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
profession, no less by Art, then by experience: he is especially well
verst in the Mathematiques, which he hath particularly studied, and
keeps always some one with him who is very skilfull in this Science.
He is chiefly esteem'd in two parts of the Militia; in training of men,
and in Fortification: in all his Sieges his Fortifications have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
proved impregnable: and to him is chiefly attributed the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing
of those in our times which are used without the Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
whereby places are now a days much longer defended then they
were in former times: As for Training, he is likewise very good
thereat, and hath always kept that Art in practice: yea now that
there is no War, he often makes all the neighboring Garisons be
drawn forth together before the <hi>Hague,</hi> and he himself forms them
into several bodies, to exercise the Soldiers; and hath caused the same
exercise to be used once every week in all the Garrisons of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces.</p>
                  <p>What Count <hi>Maurice</hi> his undertakings have been may be gathered by
the short narration which hath been made. In some, to say the truth,
it hath been wisht that he had been more forward and willing to fight;
and their number is not few, who more freely have given him the
name of irresolute, and fearfull: they have said that it was meerly
inevitable necessity which made him joyn battell with the Archduke
at <hi>Newport;</hi> that not to hazard himself in a fight, he did not relieve
<hi>Reinburg,</hi> as he easily might have done, when Marquiss <hi>Spinola</hi> besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it; and that his fear was apparent when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ose from before <hi>Groll,</hi>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:55461:22"/>
shunning to encounter the same <hi>Spinola,</hi> whose Forces were far inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or
to his. 'Tis certain, that <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> who was
always a severe censuror of the Military actions of <hi>Flanders,</hi> spoke not
much honorably of Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> for not having reliev'd <hi>Reinburg,</hi> and
for rising from before <hi>Groll,</hi> and he would often say, that the said
Count was not to be called a great Soldier because he used to fight
only amongst dikes and rivers, not ever indeavouring an Incounter in
open field: but men do so differ in their judgements, as some blame
those actions which others account praiseworthy; and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more usuall then to hear the greatest Commanders termed fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
instead of being esteemed wary: remiss instead of, circumspect;
and but bad mean soldiers, instead of skilfull in matters of War; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
ought also to be had, who makes the War, where it is made,
and who maintains it; according to which considerations it must be
confest, that no man could have been found out fitter then Count
<hi>Maurice</hi> for the affairs of the United Provinces, more corresponding
with the condition of their people and Countreys. By his so cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Governing their War so long, and by his making so good use of
their banks, rivers, and other advantages of nature, he hath withstood
the Torrents of so many Nations, who have falne down into <hi>Flanders</hi>
to fight in the behalf of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> he hath consumed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhaustable
gold of their Indies; he hath made use of the so many
mutinies amongst the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and by his safe and circumspect wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of War, he hath at last procured a Truce to the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which hath turn'd to their great advantage and establishment.
But say he had shewed himself more ready to have falne upon more
hazardous and generous resolutions; it was not in his power to do
so. He had always in his Army with him some Deputies who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
the Union of the Provinces; which Union having always held
as one of the most important maximes of Government, to make use
of well digested and wary Councels, the said Deputies upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
left more Authority in Count <hi>Maurice</hi> to execute, then to resolve
upon their undertakings; and out of this reason he hath chiefly justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himself, when by any of his Military Actions he hath incurr'd the
spoken of imputation. But on the other side it cannot be deny'd
that together with his own valour, Count <hi>Maurice</hi> had great good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
in his gaining so great a reputation in War, he govern'd an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
which was well paid, and well provided of all things; always
befriended by rivers and banks; and he never had any muteny in his
Army, nor any of those competitions or brawles betwixt Nation and
Nation, which so often happ'ned in the Catholick Camp; and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
between the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Italians,</hi> to the great prejudice of their
undertakings: so as amongst other advantages he hath always had
the Reines of Discipline free in his hands, without which an Army
is nothing else then a wood of weapons full of all disorder. To what
hath been touched concerning Count <hi>Maurice</hi> his backwardness, it may
be added that his slowness and remissness in actions of these present
times may appear to be the greater, by how much the like of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss
<hi>Spinola</hi> have been the more quick and resolute: and truely to
weigh well the proceedings of the one and the other of them in Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
affairs, you would say that <hi>Maurice</hi> had been one of <hi>Fabius</hi> his
Schollars, and <hi>Spinola</hi> one of <hi>Cesars.</hi> The one having almost ever
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:55461:23"/>
shun'd, and the other ever sought after fighting; the one shewing
himself to be a delayer, not only by nature, but by chusing his advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
and the other wholly intent through courage and forwardness,
to make the events on his side advantagious.</p>

are touched upon.</head>
                  <p>PRince <hi>Maurice</hi> his reputation is very great (as hath been said) in the
United Provinces; yet without all doubt 'twas greater during the
time of War, then it is now that weapons are laid down; he used
all the means he might at first to hinder always of coming to an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
and afterwards that no resolution might be taken of Peace,
or Truce: but he could never keep the Treaty off, nor hinder that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by the one or the other way weapons might be laid aside. By the
present Government, the other chief Heads for the managing of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
affairs took Authority upon them; and having since kept it, and
still the more establish'd it, since the Truce, the Authority of Arms
hath been weakned and lessened through idleness: the chiefest and
most esteem'd of these at the present is <hi>Iohn Barnevelt,</hi> Advocat of
<hi>Holland,</hi> and the usuall Deputie of the same Province in the Councell
of the States General of the whole Union; <hi>Barnevelt</hi> was he who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
chiefly in the negotiation of <hi>Truce;</hi> and by him Count <hi>Maurice</hi>
was then counterpoised, as he still is; his experience being great in
Publick Affairs, and the practice and Authority which he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
got in that Government very great.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> to boot with his superintendency of Arms, is also
the chief Head in the Civil Government of the United Provinces:
being the Governor of four Provinces, as hath been said; and Count
<hi>William</hi> the Governor of <hi>Friesland</hi> and <hi>Groninghen,</hi> as also <hi>Ernestus</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor
of <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> having dependancy on him, as General of the
Armies. Count <hi>William,</hi> Count <hi>Ernestus,</hi> Count <hi>Henry,</hi> and Count
<hi>Iohn,</hi> all of them of the house of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> are now in the service of the
United Provinces: The first two are Cousens, the third brother, and
the last also kinsman to Count <hi>Maurice:</hi> Count <hi>William</hi> hath always
held the principal place in the Army next to Count <hi>Maurice;</hi> a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
of great experience and valour, and hath supply'd the place of
Lievtenant General of the Army. Count <hi>Ernestus</hi> is Camp-Master.
Generall, and is esteem'd likewise a man of great Valour, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
if occasion should require, of Governing the whole Army. Count
<hi>Henry</hi> is <hi>Maurice</hi> his brother by the Fathers side; he is General of the
Horse; and though he be but a young man of 26 years of age, he hath
given Good tryall of himself in all occasions of War which have been
presented. Count <hi>Iohn</hi> is a bare Captain of Horse, Count <hi>Maurice</hi> is
the head of all those of <hi>Nassaw;</hi> neither can it be said how great the
respect is which they bear, and reverence which they use unto him;
All of them receive great pay from the United Provinces. Count
<hi>Maurice</hi> in respect of so many Offices, may be thought to receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
two hundred thousand florins yearly, which comes to twenty
thousand pound sterling; wherein is to be comprehended 25000 flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:55461:23"/>
amounting to 2500 pound, which the Provinces since the Truce
have given by way of remuneration to him and his heirs for ever.
Count <hi>William</hi> receives four thousand pound sterling yearly, Count

ordinary pay of a Captain of Horse.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Maurice</hi> resides for the most part in the <hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Holland;</hi> and
lives in the same Palace, wherein the Councels of the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the United Provinces do meet: very great is the obsequie which
the whole People shew unto him: and for outward shew, you would
rather take him to be the Prince of those Provinces, then Head of their
Military and Civil Government. He keeps great correspondency
with the neighbouring Kings, and the Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi>
and is greatly esteem'd and honour'd in all those parts; but even to
the remotest parts of the Indies, and into all those Southern and
Eastern Countreys is his fame carried, by the Navigation of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
and <hi>Zealanders,</hi> who have often shewn his Picture, as victorious
at <hi>Newport,</hi> magnifying at once the renown of their Commander, and
the fame of their own Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Maurice</hi> is very rich; he is said to have great store of money,
and that he hath above a million of Gold in ready Cash; which is not
much to be wondred at; he having always received very great pay
from the United Provinces, and gotten notable emoluments, as well
by means of so many places which he took during the War, as by
the so much gain which the Hollanders and Zealanders have wonn by
their Navigation at Sea: he hath shared deep in their acquisitions by
Land as General of their Army, and of their gettings by Sea, as being
their chief Admiral. He is Lord of <hi>Flushing</hi> and of <hi>Fervere</hi> in <hi>Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and of <hi>Graves</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> good and considerable Towns; and of
other places of less importancy: He is now about 45 years old; he
hath no wife, nor seem'd he yet to have ever any inclination to marry.
His chief kindred are the Prince Elector Palatine in <hi>Germany,</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Bullion</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The first is the son of a sister of his by
the Fathers side, and the othér husband to another sister of his by the
Fathers side also.</p>
                  <p>It is doubted by many whether Count <hi>Maurice</hi> did ever aspire to
make himself Prince of the United Provinces or not. On the one side,
the love and reverence which the People bore to his Father; the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of a new and unstable Government; his so long command o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Armies, and that, with so great Authority, and his Props
from without, have made it be often believed that he was not content
to rest in his present limitated Fortune. On the other side, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces being so continually well satisfied with his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
his way of demeaning himself, which was not after a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
fashion, as was his Fathers, but rather Stately and proud; and his
indeavour rather to lay up, then to spend money, fearing that forrein
Princes might peradventure not be well pleased that the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
should return to be governed by one man only, are considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which have made it be believed that he had no minde to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
Fortune, nor to aproach near those precipices which usually
border upon so immoderate desires. Perhaps he with more secret
wisdom, did expect those conjunctures of time, which either did not
afterwards insue, or are already past. The United Provinces do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:55461:24"/>
day better the grounds of their Government, and love Liberty
too well; which after so long agitation, and so many Tempests, is at
last brought home into their havens: Peace now rules; all noise of
War is at an end; and the Authority of other Chiefteyns will every
day grow greater, upon whom the chief administration of publick
Affairs is to depend, and it may be believ'd that they will never see
the Authority of any one man grow too high.</p>

                  <head type="sub">What the greatest enmities of the Vnited Provinces be.</head>
                  <p>BY what hath been said it may easily be comprehended what the
greatest Friendships be, and what the greatest enmities of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces with forrein Princes; but I will treat more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
hereof as in its proper place. Their Enmity will certainly
be always greatest with the Pope, and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> both which they
have so highly offended: their double rebellion did at first arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
these two Princes, and hath indammaged them the most; by
depriving the Catholick Church of its ancient Patrimony of so many
of the Faithfull; and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> of those Dominions which do
belong by so just a Title to the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Therefore they
will always by all possible means that they can, endeavour to beat
down the Catholick Religion both within, and without their Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories:
To the which though they be much moved by the meer licen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sciousness
of Heresie, yet will the consideration of the so much more
appugning the King of <hi>Spains</hi> cause, incite them the more thereunto.
At the beginning of the Rebellion they imbraced Heresie, to alienate
their people the more from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
form a Government, which even in the point of Religion might
be directly opposite to that of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> so as they
will seek to establish their present Form by Heresie; and
by this tye, to fasten better the forrein Intelligence which they hold
with all the Enemies to the Catholick Church, to boot with the
means they use to those Princes which oppose the <hi>Spanish</hi> Power and
do indeavour to acounterpoise thereunto. 'Tis seen how many and
how perverse their designes have been to introduce their Sect in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts; they have sailed even to the Indies, and by their Traffick
have infected those parts with their Heresie; and at home Calvinisme
doth chiefly rule amongst them, which is the worst of all Sects, and
that which above all others makes subjects revolt against their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
yet divers other sects are tollerated amongst them, and also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Catholicks, particularly in <hi>Holland;</hi> but the Catholicks are wholly

                     </gap>'d the exercise of their Religion; and are likewise much opprest
in other things; not so much for being Catholicks, as for being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
ether well disposed, or at least not so ill affected towards the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> as the Hereticks amongst them are. 'Tis apparent then
that the United Provinces have been moved in a great part to wage
and maintain War against the Catholick Church, that they might
maintain it likewise more effectually by their Forces against the
Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> And for what remains, 'tis not to be doubted, but
that by all the most pernitious ways of State that may be, they will
endeavour all the prejudice they can to that Crown.</p>

                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:55461:24"/>
Their tallent is alike evil against the Archduke <hi>Albertus</hi> and his
wife the <hi>Infanta Donna Isabella,</hi> who are now Princes of the Lowcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys;
for they never made any difference between the Interest of
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that of the Archdukes, since they saw them
come into <hi>Flanders</hi> with so little hope of issue.</p>
                  <p>'Tis no doubt that they will always shew the like aversion to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes in <hi>Germany</hi> which are of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> and
that they will readily joyn upon all occasions with the rivals, or ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of that House; as is seen in the fresh occasion of the Archduke
<hi>Leopolds</hi> entrance into <hi>Iuliers;</hi> which place they had the boldness to
sit down before, despising all Imperial Majesty, and all the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
Authority.</p>
                  <p>They have no occasion of friendship or disfriendship with the
King of <hi>Polonia;</hi> unless it be their dislike of that Kings greatness and
felicity, who is so zealous for the Catholick Faith, and so desirous to
propagate it: they therefore together with the King of <hi>England</hi> have
aided Duke <hi>Charls</hi> in <hi>Swethland</hi> against him; and certainly are not well
pleas'd with those his progresses which he hath made, and daily increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in <hi>Muscovia:</hi> yet the opportunity of the Port of <hi>Dantsick,</hi> frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the ships of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> may in some sort make the
United Provinces desirous of his friendship.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the friendship which the Vnited Provinces hold; and first
of that with the Crown of France.</head>
                  <p>THe greatest friendships which the United Provinces have had,
and do still hold, is with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> they have had their
chief prop and maintenance from these two Kingdoms. The Duke
of <hi>Alanson</hi> entred, as hath been said, more then once into <hi>Flanders</hi> with
whole Armies; and 'twas always thought that under colour of his
youthfull spirit, blam'd in appearance by the Kings his Brothers,
<hi>Charls</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France,</hi> he carried on in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
(though secretly) both his and their ends: which were that by
his means the States of <hi>Flanders</hi> might be severed from the Crown of
<hi>Spain.</hi> Those designes in the behalf of <hi>France</hi> being at the same time as it
were vanish'd, and conceiv'd, and that Kingdom being involved in so
many &amp; so long civil discords, the rebellion was for many years chiefly
maintain'd by forces from <hi>England:</hi> and the Queen making use to her
advantage, of the evils as well of her confederates the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as of
those of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> her enemies; she sent the Earl of <hi>Lester</hi> at that
time into <hi>Holland</hi> with an entire Army, and demanded <hi>Flushing,</hi> and
the <hi>Ramakins</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> and the <hi>Brill</hi> in <hi>Zealand,</hi> which are the chief
Maretine keys of both those Provinces, to be assigned over to her as
cautionary Towns, and to be garisoned by the <hi>English.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Great were the aids which King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
afford to the United Provinces, when he had once compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and quieted the affairs of his own Kingdom; and since the Queen
of <hi>Englands</hi> death, his Authority and belief amongst them did so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease,
as being chiefly perswaded and almost constrained thereunto
by his indeavours, they first were induced to treat, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the Truce with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:55461:25"/>
In this last peace of friendship of the King of <hi>France,</hi> they saw not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that many designes lay hid, which caused great suspitions
in them. 'Twas said that the King of <hi>France</hi> began after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of the King of <hi>England</hi> to make it be understood, that he would
likewise have some Towns delivered up into his hands, in change for
those moneys and aids which he furnish'd them withall for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of their War; whereupon those Provinces grew into such
jealousie, as it was held for certain that this was one of the chiefest
reasons which induced them to think of agreement: yet the King
held always the same authority and confidence with them as before;
till the last commotions of <hi>France</hi> falling out, after the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi>
flight, and the King preparing to take the field with a powerfull
Army, the United Provinces began to have new apprehensions of his
ways. The King had Written into <hi>Holland</hi> to the Dowager Princess
of <hi>Orange</hi> whose husband was slain, that upon the occasion of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
approach in those parts, he would come privatly to the <hi>Hague,</hi>
where he would be her houshold Guest. At this newes, though sent but
by the way of Jest, the United Provinces grew very apprehensive. They
feared that if the King should come, he in so happy a conjuncture,
would practise some designe of his own which might tend to their
prejudice; and especially that he should indeavor to be chosen their
Protector: A Title which might seem to taste of favour, but when
narrowlier looked into, full of suspition; so great Princes seldom u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to take upon them such protections, unless it be to give Laws to
those that they protect; and how could they have withstood the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
of so great a Prince in their own homes, and with so great Forces
it in their Country, and upon their Frontiers? by reason of their
being freed from these suspitions. it may be thought that the United
Provinces were less sorry for his death, which in other respects proved
a very grievous loss to them.</p>
                  <p>They do now notwithstanding receive the same signes of friendship
from the Queen Regent, which they did from the King her husband:
and 'tis to be believed that for the time to come, good corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
will always be had between the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and the United
Provinces. The <hi>French,</hi> because the severing of the United Provinces
from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> makes so much for them; and the other that
by the favour of <hi>France</hi> they may keep themselves still the better from
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Empire: yet would not the <hi>French</hi> that the united Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should arrive at such a greatness of power as they aspire unto; for
so the whole Low Countreys might turn into one Hereticall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
as they lately were under one onely Catholick Prince:
Their power would then doubtlesly be no less dreadfull by land, then
it is now by sea. But of all other their neighbours the <hi>French</hi> ought
chiefly to apprehend this, by the boldness which would grow in their
<hi>Hugonots</hi> in <hi>France</hi> by the increase of these Heretick Forces in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
Whereupon 'tis thought, that the King of <hi>France</hi> was in this respect
chiefly induced to be so servent in indeavouring the Truce; that he
might leave the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces, and the Forces of the united Provinces
so equally counterpoised in <hi>Flanders,</hi> as that <hi>France</hi> might receive no
prejudice from either side: And 'tis not unknown what troubles have
often befalne that Kingdom from thence. First when the Princes of
the House of <hi>Burgony</hi> govern'd <hi>Flanders;</hi> and since, after that those
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:55461:25"/>
Provinces, with so many other Kingdoms and Dominions came under
the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The late King of <hi>France</hi> maintained at his own cost two Brigades
of Foot and 200 Horse, as hath been said: and still permitted his
Subjects to fight in their service, and did moreover in time of War,
yearly assist them with large sums of money. The same people keep
now in their Service, and are maintained as at first at the charge of
that Crown. There are many other <hi>French</hi> likewise under their pay:
and for all things else the same confederacy is kept on both parts, as
was in the time of the late King.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the friendship which the Vnited Provinces hold with the
King of England.</head>
                  <p>GReat Friendship and Intelligence was held between the Queen of
<hi>England</hi> and the United Provinces, as hath been said, after the
death of the Duke of <hi>Alanson,</hi> and that the civil wars fell out in <hi>France,</hi>
the Queen of <hi>England</hi> may be said to have been their only supporter.
And though the jealousies were great which the United Provinces
had of that Queen in the Earl of <hi>Lesters</hi> time, yet when they were
freed of that Earls Government, their suspitions began to grow less.
And the same correspondency was held on both sides as was before.
The Queen furnish'd them with their best foot, the <hi>English</hi> having
always been the best foot Soldiers of their Army: They contracted
almost all the debts which they owe the Crown of <hi>England</hi> in the
Queens time; then when being reduced to so great a want of Forces,
she sent them over not only men, but moneys to pay them.</p>
                  <p>The Queens ends in fomenting the rebels of <hi>Flanders</hi> were chiefly
two. The one, her own particular, which was, to increase the Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
amongst her neighbours, the more to secure her own falling off
from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> In the other she shared with the <hi>French,</hi>
which was to sever the States of <hi>Flanders</hi> from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and more particularly the Maretine Provinces, as it fell out after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
And doubtlesly if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had peacefully inloy'd the
Low Countreys, both <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> would have had reason to
be afraid of them; lying in the middest between the Maretine For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of <hi>Spain</hi> on the one side, and the so great and many Forces of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
on the other side.</p>
                  <p>The United Provinces had likewise two ends in their friendship
with <hi>England;</hi> the one to be assisted in their revolt from the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the other to make use of the near neighbouring Heresy
of <hi>England,</hi> the better to strengthen their new Sects, and by that
means to resist the <hi>Spaniards</hi> the more easily: the respect of Traffick
hath also made this friendship be much desired by both sides: the
Commerce is very great which the City of <hi>London</hi> holds with <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
Midleburg,</hi> and with all the other Towns of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand:</hi>
and the <hi>Hollanders</hi> likewise reap great advantage by their fishing in the
<hi>English</hi> Seas.</p>
                  <p>The Authority and Intelligence which the Queen held with the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces, was then as we have seen, very great: who was by
them esteem'd a Lady of a very high spirit, and of a masculine and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:55461:26"/>
warlike Government. After the Queens death, the late King of
<hi>France</hi> his Authority increased so much amongst them, as the King of
<hi>England</hi> was, and is yet but little esteem'd of by them; yet he even
after peace made with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> hath granted such men to the
United Provinces as they stand in need of, as the Queen formerly did,
with change only of some outward appearances for the better satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> The Governors of the United Provinces
speak of this King in terms of small respect; and seeing him so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
to hunting, and to his book, especially to such as treat of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
they say a privat condition would better become him then
that of a Prince, and that he is fitter to be a Preacher then a King.
But though they speak but meanly of his person, yet they much prize
the neighbourhood and oportunity of his Kingdoms, and have still
continued the same prerogative to the Embassador of <hi>England,</hi> which
was granted in the Earl of <hi>Lesters</hi> time, which is, that he is to have a
place and Vote in their Councell of State. They keep the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy
with the King of <hi>England</hi> as they did with the late Queen, and
the same is renewed by the King with them.</p>

Princes.</head>
                  <p>THe King of <hi>Denmark</hi> and the united Provinces are good friends,
which they are reciprocally invited to by the neighbourhood of
their Countrey. This Vicinity is very commodious for the <hi>Hollanders</hi>
in respect of their fishing, and building of ships, which are made out
of the woods wherewith <hi>Norway</hi> may be said to be covered: for what
remains, the united Provinces have received but little good in their
occasions from <hi>Denmark,</hi> either in money or men. This King is Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
of very large Territories, but so buried in winter and ice, as his
forces are but small though his circuit be so large.</p>
                  <p>They maintain good correspondency with the Heretick Princes of
<hi>Germany,</hi> especially with the <hi>Calvinists:</hi> of which the chiefest are the
Prince Elector Palatine of <hi>Rheine,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> as
for the Service of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> 'tis seen in the difference of the States
of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Guliers.</hi> And the last Palatine when he died, in token
of his confidence, left his sons to their Government and protection:
their conformity in Sect, and more particularly in their aversion to
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> together with the neerness of their Countrys,
hath easily wrought, and will as easily preserve friendship between
them: the <hi>German</hi> Princes are notwithstanding for the most part not
over abounding in moneys, so as the help which the United Provinces
received from thence, in their late War did presently vanish. Now
that they are grown so strong, they may rather assist their friends on
that side, then look for any relief from them, unless it be for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of some men if they shall have occasion for them; as hath been
seen in the behalf of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> at the Siege of <hi>Guliers;</hi> which was
chiefly begun and ended by their Forces.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Italy,</hi> the United Provinces have begun some Intelligence with
the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> when the Truce was concluded they sent an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:55461:26"/>
Ambassador to <hi>Venice;</hi> and received another the like
from the Republick. And affairs stand yet thus between them; but
'tis to be believ'd, that through Traffick, and worldly interest, this
correspondency will grow greater.</p>
                  <p>The United Provinces have likewise now begun to introduce Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and friendship in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> after the
Truce, began to Traffick in <hi>Siria:</hi> and have since been drawn on by
the good entertainment they finde amongst the <hi>Turks,</hi> and by their
own gain, to continue Commerce in those parts: and that they may
establish it the better for the good of their whole Countreys, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces have now resolved to send over one that shall be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
at <hi>Constantinople.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Whether this new Commonwealth of the Vnited Provinces be
like to last or no.</head>
                  <p>NOthing is more fallacious, then to judge of Futurety: It may
not notwithstanding peradventure be displeasing to him who shal
read this my Relation, if I argue here at last with as much brevity as
so dubious a business may permit, whether this new Commonwealth
of the United Provinces be likely to last or not. There are many
considerations which make for the duration thereof. And first, what
is more natural to mankind, or of more power with them then the
love of Liberty? Of all Nations of the world, the Northern people
of <hi>Europe</hi> have always seem'd most desirous thereof; and chiefly those
of <hi>Flanders.</hi> In the time of the Emperor <hi>Vespatian,</hi> how famous was
the antient Insurrection of the <hi>Batavians,</hi> which is so nobly describ'd
by <hi>Tacitus.</hi> There was no talk of bereaving them of that Liberty
which they enjoy'd: notwithstanding, thinking that they liv'd in sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
whilst they tollerated the pride and violence which the <hi>Roman</hi>
State ministers did in various manner use in those parts, they grew
to disdain, and from disdain to rebell, and from rebellion to down
right war: They wanted not in those days a <hi>Claudius Civilis,</hi> who
plaid the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> his part in those troubles. By him, first
his <hi>Battavians,</hi> and afterwards divers neighboring Countreys were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
to take up Arms, till such time as all arms and contumacy being
laid aside, those people remained in their antient dependency and
friendship with the <hi>Romans;</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> on their side with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
from all rigour and violence which might provoke them again
to revolt.</p>
                  <p>The Hollanders that now are, (who were those antient Batavians)
and the other United Provinces, boast that their antient Liberty and
practiz'd Form of Government, discends from these. They confess
that they have always had one eminent Chiefteyn, Head, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
but such a one as hath been always subject to the Laws, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Empire of the Commonwealth, which were from time to
time exercised with very little difference by the Provinciall Orders.
That the title of these heads were afterwards more modernly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
but that the degree of the Commonwealth was not diminished
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:55461:27"/>
with this alteration of Titles, but kept still its supream Authority,
whilst <hi>Holland, Zeala<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d,</hi> and the rest of the Provinces of the Low
Countreys remained sever'd under their own peculiar Earls and
Lords: That when the House of the Princes of <hi>Burgony</hi> came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to Govern those Countreys, their Government was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in many things, the highborn blood and Kingly haughtiness of
that House, not induring to depend upon the Laws and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth:
That the Princes of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> did much less ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
themselves to this moderation. That the Emperor,
<hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, after having gotten new worlds under this Empire, and
King <hi>Philip</hi> his son after having inherited them with the rest of so
great a Monarchy, they disdained to be limited in their Commands
over their Subjects: whereupon they did not only not give way that
the Low Countreys should continue in their former Government,
but by force, and violence alter'd their Laws, took from them their
Immunities, made them so many Collonies to the Spaniard, and laid
heavy yokes of Tribute, and Cittadels upon them. That from hence
the antient Battavians are risen up again, and have taken up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> as their forefathers did against the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Empire. That these have been no less fortunate then those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
since now they preserve the Liberty which they did enjoy,
and have now recovered that which they had almost lost. <hi>Holland</hi> is
full of the Story of these successes, as also all the other United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
The desire of Liberty being then so naturall to all people,
and chiefly to the people of <hi>Flanders,</hi> 'tis easily to be believ'd that the
United Provinces will use all the means they can, to preserve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their present Form of Government, and still establish this
their new form of a Free Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>To boot with the love of Liberty, the Government of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces is now so well and firmly grounded, as their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
is likely thereby to subsist along time; far distant and forc'd
changes which are made from one Form of Government to another
clean contrary, are usually dangerous: But the passage which the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces have made from the Government which they used
before the War, to that which they now enjoy after the Truce, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said that they have alter'd their past form, into another clean
contrary, but that they have only alter'd it in part: their antient
Laws are kept alive, and every Province and City is Govern'd almost
as they were formerly; only the Prince his Soveraignty rests now in
the Orders of every Province, and the Eminency of the Head, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
with the Governor of the same Province. How great then is
the concord which ties and binds the United Provinces together?
How great are their own Forces, and the Friendship which they hold
with Forrein Princes? Concord will keep their minds well disposed,
and keep off all occasions of Domestick Tumults. Their own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
are such as may be thought sufficient to withstand such danger as
may befall them from abroad; and say they were not of themselves
able to do it, it may be believ'd that they would be supply'd by those
very Forrein aids which have joyned with them in the whole course
of the last War.</p>
                  <p>By these reasons which have been alledged, it may then be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd,
that this new Commonwealth is likely every day to grow
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:55461:27"/>
more solid, and better established, to be of long subsistance, yea that
with time it continually grow the greater and more powerfull,
like that of the <hi>Switzers:</hi> and how great is the conformity between
these? The Switzers revolted at first with very small Forces: They
were inflam'd with the love of Liberty; the mountainous scituations
fought for them till such time as the other more potent Cantons, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with the former which were weaker: and at last their Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
came to be so establish'd, as it is not only become durable, but
even formidable upon many occasions to divers Princes. Just so the
Insurrection of the United Provinces had its rise from the two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Holland</hi> and of <hi>Zealand</hi> only; the people were thereunto pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>voked
by the love of Liberty, by the advantage of the sea, rivers,
and other weapons of nature, they made their chiefest resistance at
first: afterwards their affairs went on more prosperously by the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of other Provinces, and the assistance of neighbouring Princes:
till at last this their new power is come to that pass, as that they may
be said to give the Law to others at sea, and not to be likely to receive
it from others by land: there Government is also like that of the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers.</hi>
Though this be rather better then the other by being more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform,
and by the easier joyning of the particular Members of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Province, with the whole body of the General Union.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, many reasons may be alledged why this new
Commonwealth should not be durable. First, for what concerns
the love of Liberty; in lieu therof we see that the benefit which people
receive by obedience, is succeeded; who from time to time have sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted
themselves almost every where to the Empire of some one.
'Tis true, at first all Kings were Heads of the people, and not Kings;
of Commonwealths and not of Kingdoms. But afterwards Custom
hath so prevailed, as people have been disposed and accustomed to
the habit of intire obedience: just as a plant, or humane body we see
are accustomed to live in other earth, and under other Climats, which
differ from their own natural ones. Who would now perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that the leaning toward Liberty could be of force enough to
move a desire in the people of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and other parts, of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to their ancient Forms of their former more free Governments,
whereof they have not only lost the desire, but even the memory.
It cannot be denyed notwithstanding, but that in the more Northern
parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> there are yet freer Forms of Government. The
King of <hi>England</hi> cannot do many things without his Parliament; nor
the Princes of the Low Countreys, without the consent of the
Provinces which are under them. The King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> power is
yet more limited; so is the King of <hi>Polands;</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manies</hi>
Authority is much restrained: But it must be granted that the
Authority of the Supream Head in all these Governments hath ever
been, and still is very great: Wherein the peoples obedience to their
Prince is so ancient, as they can endure no other Government then
that of one alone. It may then also be imagined, that the United
Provinces must necessarily incline, out of their habit of antient obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
to suffer themselves to be Govern'd by some one only man; but
in that Form of Government notwithstanding which they were wont
formerly to injoy, and which may correspond with their antient insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Customs. To which Form when those Provinces shall see
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:55461:28"/>
themselves invited by any oportune conjuncture, it may be thought
that they might easily return to their antient obsequie and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to that Prince, which time and occasion shall councell them to
receive.</p>
                  <p>In answer to that the present Government differs not much from
what it formerly was, it may be said, that the alteration is such,
as from it many others of greater importance may be expected. The
Government is too much alter'd in the so great Authority which
Count <hi>Maurice</hi> holds in them: too much in the Burthen of so many
Grievances and Garrisons; and lastly too much in the power of
some of the Provinces which do almost Lord it over the rest. And
hence it is that the Concord between the United Provinces, is not
effectually such as it appears outwardly to be.</p>
                  <p>Some of them are not well pleased with the so great Eminency
which Count <hi>Maurice</hi> possesseth amongst some others of them. <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is envy'd by them all, by reason of its great opulency. In particular,
there are almost continuall Jars between <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand:</hi> Some
of them complain very much that they are opprest with the same
Grievances and Garrisons since the Truce, as they were in the time
of War: and <hi>Holland</hi> by its not complaining thereof, makes the rest
quarrel the more with it, and with those that Govern there, who
seem chiefly to sustain themselves, by the reputation and support of
the <hi>Holland</hi> Forces: To boot with these diversities of Interest, how
much doth the difference of so many and so various sects withstand
the Union of their minds: many, and in many things disagreeing, are
the Sects into which the People of the United Provinces are divided;
besides the very many Catholicks which are there; and how can their
own Forces be sufficient for their defence, when they draw not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?
since it may so fall out, that such Forrein Princes as now side
with them, growing hereafter to better Intelligence with the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> perhaps will not, or hindred by their own necessities, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
hereafter assist the United Provinces. Out of all these disquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
it may then be gathered, that this new Commonwealth is not
likely to continue in its present condition, but that it will rather fail
therein shortly, and be again reduced at last to the Government of one
only.</p>

                  <head type="sub">The end of the preceding Discourse, and of the Relation.</head>
                  <p>SUppose now that the United Provinces were inclined to submit
themselves again to the Government of one alone; let us see who
this Prince may likelyest be, and by what means it may be hoped that
they may be brought to submit themselves to him: In the past trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> the Rebels necessitated thereunto, fled for protection
first to the French, and then to the <hi>English;</hi> but the new Principality
of <hi>Alanzon</hi> vanish'd almost assoon as it had any beeing; and the Queen
of <hi>England</hi> laying aside her hopes of Domination, was afterwards
content with the Power of advising. <hi>Orange</hi> his hopes and cus'nages
were cut short by death; and Count <hi>Maurice</hi> wants either courage or
oportunity to advance his Fortune. So as it is not to be believ'd that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:55461:28"/>
the United Provinces will ever subject themselves either to the
French or <hi>English,</hi> or to Count <hi>Maurice:</hi> then next to the House of
<hi>Burgony,</hi> the Low Countreys with justest Title will fall into the hands
of the House of <hi>Austria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is thought by the gravest personages, and the best experienc'd in
the Affairs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the United Provinces may return to be
under the House of <hi>Austria</hi> by two several ways. The one, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
out unto them once again a Prince of that blood, who may
succeed the Archdukes instead of Issue. The other, by indeavouring
to induce the said Provinces by such means as shall be thought best
fitting, to return under the obedience of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> in case
the King after the death of the Archdukes, shall not incline to cut the
United Provinces off again from the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The first of these two ways is thought the likelyest to succeed;
and 'tis seen that necessity did at last teach <hi>Philip</hi> the second, when
all other remedies proving desperat, he was brought to make use of
this, though he could not prevail in so doing by reason of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes
sterillity: This remedy will then consist in the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
resolving to Institute one of his own sons for heir to the Archdukes,
which son by some fitting marriage may establish perpetuall succession
of Princes of that Country in <hi>Flanders!</hi> Thus it might be hoped that
the people of the United Provinces might be incited to love this
mentioned Issue, as those from whom <hi>Dutch</hi> Successors might hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
proceed, and that from this love, an inclination to obedience
might insue, and finally Intigrall obedience.</p>
                  <p>'Tis likely that the French would assist herein, to the end that
they might be for ever rid of the neighbourhood and hazard of the
Spanish Forces on that side of their Kingdom which lies open to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Flanders, and the better to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eucure their Countrey from the
vicinity and danger of the Hereticks in the Low Countreys: Since
by the reuniting of those Countreys under a Catholick Prince, they
might have reason to hope that the Catholick Religion would be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up again in those parts where it is now under hatches, and couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the Intelligence which the Hereticks of the United Provinces,
with those of the Kingdom of France would be at an end. Amongst
the English these respects would be more counterpoised: on the one
side they would willingly see the Low Countreys wholly alienated
from the Crown of Spain; for those reasons as have been said before;
but on the other side they would not be pleased to see this so potent
and near neighbourhood of Heresie fail.</p>
                  <p>The second way, which would consist in using such means as were
most conducible to make the United Provinces submit themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the Crown of Spain, is generally judged to be harder to effect
then the former, and may briefly be reduced to two heads, either of
working upon the inclination of the said Provinces, or of endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to subjugate them again by Force. It hath already been seen
how much Philip the second labour'd both these ways, and yet got
no good thereby. As amongst the Elements some agree, and some
are of a contrary nature, so among those people in Europe which are
under the Monarchy of Spain, some are of a temper conformable to
the Spanish Nation, and some of a clean repugnant habit. Their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is easilyer receiv'd, and their Customs imbraced in Italy;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:55461:29"/>
whereas in Flanders the repugnancy almost in all things between the
Inhabitants there and the Spaniards, was a chief cause of the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
and then of the War, and hath at last occasioned the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
off of many of the Provinces: so as to say truth, there is small
hopes that the United Provinces will ever submit themselves to the
obedience of the Crown of Spain, out of their own inclination: In
case then that success be to be dispair'd of by this way, it will remain
that all hopes are to be placed in bringing them to their former obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
by force of arms. Doubtlesly a dangerous and difficult way; as forty
years experience hath shown: if the war be to commence again when
the Truce shall end, will the Spaniards have better soldiers, or better
Commanders? Will their Princes prove better? or will they meet
with more favourable conjvncture of times then formerly? Spain
will never have better Commanders, nor more flourishing Armies
then they have had till now in Flanders. 'Twill never have a wiser
Prince then Philip the second; nor will it ever meet with times more
oportune, then those were when its Enemies in Flanders were
brought so low, and when at the same time they were so little fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Forrein Forces: It is rather to be feared that in such a case
the Enemy might get advantage, being grown proud, by their so great
past prosperity; and made secure that for the time to come the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
strength of their Countrey will never fail them, nor their peoples
first obstinacy, nor the already experienc'd forwardness of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate
Princes, in a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ions against the Crown
of Spain: so as it may be greatly doubted, that if they should fall to
War again, things would go worse with the Spaniard, and that instead
of getting, they would receive new losses. And unless it were for
this doubt, why was the Truce so much desired by the Spaniards?
But the mean while the Truce will afford Spain time maturely to
weigh what will be most advantagious for that Crown, as well touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Kings appointment of a son of his to succeed as heir to the
Arch-Dukes, in manner as hath been said; as concerning what reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
is to be taken, either of prolonging the Truce, or making a
firm peace, or of laying aside all further thought of agreement, and
breaking out into war again; they are all of them businesses of such
importance and weight, as will very well require long and mature
consultation; but above all, that our chief consultations be had with
God, who gives and takes away Kingdoms; changeth and altereth
them as he pleases, and makes humane wisdom oft times prove most
blind, when it appears to be quickest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

down all that belongs to the same Head, in the Kingdoms of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,

                  <head type="sub">Of the Natures and Customs of the Archdukes.</head>
                  <p>THe Archduke Albertus is low of stature, his complexion part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
San guine, partly Flegmatick; as are generally almost all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian
Princes; his face white, his hair light coloured, and his linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
very noble: he hath an Austrian mouth, and his complexion
is rather tender then strong; he is troubled with the Gout; he had
wont to be but seldom troubled therewithall; but of late his Fits
come oftner and are more painfull: he is not subject to any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition
of health; nor can it be said how regular he is in his diet:
at this present he is 54 years old: and thus much for the habit and
temperature of his body. For what concerns his minde he is a Prince
of singular virtue; and first it cannot be said how pious, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
he is; nor how great the zeal and respect is which he shews out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
towards Divine Worship, and sacred things: In all his Demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
you may read a rare integrity, and appearing bashfulness; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he may be an Example not only to all Princes, but even to every
privat man; he is a great lover of Justice, and keeps great modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in all things; he is grave in his actions, and of so compos'd and
equall temper in them all, as he is never seen to vary the least title
from himself: he speaks but little; according to the mode of the
Austrian Princes; and slowly according to his natural Custom: He is
Master of five Languages, his own mother tongue which is Dutch,
Spanish, Latine, Italian, and French: he speaks and uses the three
first, and understands the other two very well: he is knowing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
sorts of Learning, which he got whilst he was Cardinall; and
doth particularly studie the Mathematicks: In matters of business
he is indefatigable, and his chiefest delight lies in business; giving au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
seeeral hours every day, both morning and evening with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
attention and goodness: he is wonderfull secret, and makes as
little discovery by his looks as by his words; you can never read any
commotion of minde in her face, which is always equall and serene;
he is of a constant nature, as he hath shewed in his patient bearing
with so many adversities as have befalne him in the late Wars: He
suffers in the common opinion by being irresolute and slow; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
he is better for peace then war: which commonly requires
Councel and resolution at the same time; and cannot admit of so
harmonious and equall order in actions, as the Archduke useth. This
his so slow proceeding and with such gravity, ariseth partly from the
naturall temperature of his body, but much more from his having li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
so long in <hi>Spain,</hi> where he formed Customs to the Idea of those
of King <hi>Philip</hi> the second, whom he set before him for his example
in all things; nor was that so grave and well weighed manner of
proceeding to be blamed in the King, as being according to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
and nature of the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> nor had the King ever any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of altering that his usual way of living in time of peace with the
different way of proceeding which is requisit in war; but Flanders re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
a Prince more affable, and tractable, and the wars there more
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:55461:30"/>
efficacious and more resolute actions, then are those of the Arch-Duke.
For what concerns the way of Government in <hi>Spain,</hi> he did very well
to imitate King <hi>Philip,</hi> but for what concerns <hi>Flanders,</hi> and the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of Arms, he might have done much better to have taken his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the Emperor <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth for his example; who knew very
well how to temper his proceedings, and accommodate them to the
so many and differing natures of People whereof the body of his
Empire did consist. The Dutch seem rather to reverence, then
to love the Arch-Duke; they reverence him for his so many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
but doe not greatly love him, because hee never was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable
with the People, as they desired he should bee. This his
so great Retirednesse and Gravity, is accompanied with an high pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuality
of Majestical state; which he will have kept up, and which
to say truth, is not so generally approved of upon all occasions. But
'tis no wonder if amongst the Harmony of so many egregious parts
there bee some dissonance, or discords of humane affections. For
all things else, the Arch-Duke is indued with excellent qualities,
and deserves to bee recorded to posterity for one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
and most considerable Princes vvhich our Age hath affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>But the Infanta <hi>Donna Isabella,</hi> his wife, of whom I am now to
speak, is no lesse worthy to be recorded to posterity. Her complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion,
wherein bloud and flegme doe likewise predominate, is very
like her husbands. She is higher of stature then most women are, and
in these her present years she still keeps that Majestical beauty in her
eyes and countenance, which was thought in her youth to exceed all
others. She is graceful in all her actions, and a certaine benignity
appears throughout all her behaviour, accompanied with Greatness,
which violently draws unto her the love of all men; she is now about
forty six years old; in perfect health; she is given to exercise, and is
a great friend to Hunting, and field pastimes. Sometimes she her self
on horseback will Hound her Hawk, and Govern the Chase. As for
her gifts of minde, she is undoubtedly one of the gallantest and most
signilized Princesses that ever lived, and represents unto the life in all
Princely vertues, that famous <hi>Isabella,</hi> her Progenetrix, whose name
she bears, and from whose bloud she is descended.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be exprest how gracious and affable she is; how liberal
and magnanimous; how just; but chiefly how Pious and Religious.
Her zeal unto the Church is very great; nor hath shee any more ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
desire then to see it flourish every where, especially in those He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
Provinces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> where formerly the Piety of her Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors
did shine no lesse, then in these others which do faithfully stand
still for the Catholike Religion. Such is the modesty and retirednesse
of her Ladies, as you would say they lived in a Monastery, not a Court.
And yet on the other side, you shall not see a Court fuller of Majesty,
and more jolly then hers, in all occurrences which may arise, either in
Turnements, Hunting, or other Recreations, which are used in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Courts. Her mind is truly Heroical, and above the reach of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
fortune, as was particularly seen in the Arch-Dukes ill luck at
<hi>Newport.</hi> Upon which occasion it might oft times be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
her constancy was greater when shee first heard that the Battle
was lost, or when she heard that the Arch-Duke was taken, or at the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:55461:31"/>
third advertisement that he was at liberty, but sorely wounded. She
hath left the Government of those States which were her Dowry, to
the Arch-Duke, being willing to dis-robe her self thereof to the end
that business might be the speedilier dispatcht by passing through the
hands of onely one; and that the greater her husbands authority was,
the people might bear the greater respect unto him. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the Arch-Duke doth not any thing which he doth not first
fully communicate to her; but adviseth with her in all things, and
receives great help from her sublime wit, which nature hath indued
her withal, and from the singular experience which she got in so high
and famous a School of Wisdom as was that of her glorious Father
King <hi>philip.</hi> But the Arch-Duke doth this likewise, as moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
by the love which they mutually bear one to another, which
doth equall, if not exceed all example of matrimonial affection. It
appears almost incredible, that there can be such an uniformity of
thoughts and will in two several persons; no discord being ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
to be between them in any thing whatsoever, as if there were
but one soul in both their bodies. In all these things the Infanta is in
particular highly to be commended; who being Princesse of these
Countries, having in her a masculine spirit, yea, even a greater reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
then the Arch-Duke; is notwithstanding pleased to submit her
self so strictly to the Laws of Matrimony, as she is content with the
very bare Title of a Wife. And doubtlesly shee is generally much
more beloved then her Husband, and is of far more amiable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
for she is exceeding affable in her conversation with all people,
and hath extraordinary indowments of nature, which wins the very
souls of all men. So as in the common opinion a better tempered
Principality could not be desired, if the vertues of the Infanta and the
Arch-Duke being joined together, some particular defect wherein
that Husband is wanting, might be supplyed by some particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
wherein the Wife doth superabound.</p>

consists in the persons of the Arch-Dukes; that of the
Optemati in the two Orders or States of the Church-men and Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and the Popular in the like of the Cities and Villages, (as they are
here called) wherein for the most part none but the common sort
of People divided into their several occupations, do inhabit. The
Monastical Abbots whereof the greatest part of Ecclesiasticks in every
Province, doth consist; inhabiting usually in their Monasteries, out
of the Cities, and the Nobility in their Country habitations.</p>
                  <p>The States of every Province consists of these three sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
over which the Prince keeps his particular Prerogatives. So
as these three forenamed Orders cannot by their own proper authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
call together the States of the Province; the doing whereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
always on the Prince; who upon any occasion either of his
own, or of the Province, calls them together, and propounds unto
them the business; to which every Order gives their Answer; and
without the consent of all the three Orders, the Prince cannot of
himself determine any thing. In this point his will is bounded by the
will of the people; who sometimes absolutely deny what hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of them, and will maintain their ancient priviledges of being
intreated to what they give way unto, and will injoy a subjection mixt
with liberty.</p>
                  <p>The States General of all the Provinces is formed of the particular
States of every Province; the particular States meet together every
year once; in which meeting little or nothing is now adays handled,
but the renewing of the consent of the three Orders for the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the supply which every Province uses to contribute towards
the Prince his maintenance. But the Convocation of the States General
is very seldom had; this being a great Body to govern, and usual sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
by the authority and greatnesse of the Prince. Nor did they
ever meet in all the time of the Arch-Dukes, save at the very first,
which was that they might confirm the resignation which King <hi>Philip</hi>
the second made of those Provinces to his daughter the Infanta.</p>
                  <p>For what concerns Justice; civil affairs come first to be handled by
the Magistrates of Cities, when the people of the same City are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
therein; and afterward passe by way of Appeal to the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Councels, which are in every Province. But the causes of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and <hi>Titulati</hi> are first argued in the Provincial Councels, from the
sentence whereof, all causes are generally caried by Appeal to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:55461:32"/>
Councel erected at <hi>Malines;</hi> except the Provinces of <hi>Brabent,
Gheldars,</hi> and <hi>Henn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ult,</hi> where causes receive their final determination.
In criminal affairs, the Magistrates of Towns and Cities give sentence,
who in this case have absolute power over their inhabitants; but judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in criminal affairs wherein the Nobility or <hi>Titulati</hi> be concern'd,
is reserved to the Provincial Councel; and this in short, is the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in general of the Arch-Dukes Provinces.</p>
                  <p>The Arch Dukes have three chief Conncels for the dispatch of such
businesse as depend upon their own particular authority. The Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of State, the Privy Councel, and the Councel of the Treasury.
The Councel of State was anciently of great esteem. Affairs of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
weight were therein handled and resolved, and the chiefest Lords
of <hi>Flanders</hi> were wont to be admitted thereinto; but now there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
nothing but the shadow or bare title thereof. The last revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
occasioned, and do still produce great suspitions, and made it
appear, that secrets are not secure when known to so many. Yet at
this very time, the prime Lords of the Country do covet a place in
that Councel; and some Ecclesiastical person of highest esteem, hath
still been placed therein. But the Privy Councel keeps its ancient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.
All causes of Justice, or grace which depend upon the Supream
Authority of the Arch-Dukes, are therein treated of; and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
are usually seven, the President being therein comprehended,
and some one Ecclesiastical person. The Councel of the Financies or
Treasury, manage the Arch-Dukes Monies, which come in most from
the Provincial contributions; and some part from the Arch-Dukes
patrimonial estate, and some imposition of Taxes. The Arch-Dukes
Revenues or Incomes are then of three sorts: The first and greatest
part consists in contributions, and is laid out in the maintenance of
such Garisons as are requisite in many Frontiers of those Provinces;
one part only excepted, which together with the Kings money is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd
in payment of the Armies Horse. The monies which come in
by the other two ways, go towards the maintenance of the Archdukes
house, and other their extraordinary expences which daily occur. The
Provincial contributions may come to about 200000 Florins a month,
or twenty thousand pound sterling: in the time of war they came to
20005. pounds a moneth, but are now reduced to the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
sum. The other two sorts of Incomes may rise to about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thousand Florins, or six thousand pounds a moneth; The Arch-Dukes
get but little from their patrimonial estates, because they are
already almost all ingaged; neither doe they get much by their Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of Taxes, the whole Country being almost free from them by
vertue of their priviledges.</p>
                  <p>The Province of <hi>Flanders</hi> is greatest, and richest, and consequently
contributes much more then the others doe. <hi>Brabant</hi> comes in the next
place, which is likewise a plentiful Province, and of large extent: the
Provinces of <hi>Artois,</hi> and <hi>Henault,</hi> contribute almost a like with it, and
that of <hi>Silla</hi> but little lesse. There is not much difference amongst
the others; for though the circuit of the Dukedome of <hi>Lucemburg</hi> be
large, it is not very vvealthy; and as for the Dukedome of <hi>Ghelders</hi>
or <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> which is one of the greatest and richest Provinces of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> the Arch-Dukes possesse but one fourth part thereof, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
three remaining under the Dominion of the United Provinces.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:55461:32"/>
No Relief at all comes from <hi>Burgouy,</hi> by way of Subsidy. Yet the
Arch-Dukes receive a considerable Revenue from thence, from the
salt which is made in that Province; and somewhat also from some
Patrimonial estate, which they have therein. So as we may make ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
that all the Arch-Dukes Revenues in the whole, come to
20008 pounds sterling a moneth.</p>
                  <p>All the Arch-Dukes Provinces are very well peopled. <hi>Brabant,
Ghelderland</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and seated lowest, and abound most in Rivers,
and consequently in Traffick; but the rest are more given to Arms,
particularly those which coast upon <hi>France;</hi> which are <hi>Burgony</hi> and
the <hi>Walloan</hi> Provinces; under which name is understood <hi>Artois, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,
Namure, Limburg,</hi> and that part of <hi>Lucemburg,</hi> which looks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>France:</hi> the City of <hi>Cambrey,</hi> and Countrey of <hi>Cambresis,</hi> being
likewise therein comprehended. These are the Provinces which
confine upon <hi>France;</hi> the others border some upon <hi>Germany,</hi> and
some upon the United Provinces; and onely <hi>Flanders</hi> joins upon the
Sea.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dukes Militia consist of six hundred Curassiers, and one
thousand two hundred of the Guard, which are divided into divers
companies under the Lords of the chiefest Provinces; and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
also in the men of those Garisons which are maintained upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Frontiers as hath been touched upon before. Those of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassiers
and Guard are notwithstanding kept in standing pay, but only
their names inrolled; neither doe they injoy any thing thereby, in
time of peace but some exemptions and prerogatives of small impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
In time of war they receive such pay as was assigned them
when this Militia was first formed; which was wont to bee held in
great esteem, being almost wholly composed of Gentry; but at this
time it consists altogether of the baser sort of people, and is in all
things else much faln from its former repute; These are the proper
Forces of the Arch-Dukes, to boot with those which upon occasion
may be raised out of their own Territories, which commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
Warlike men.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dukes Forces which have any relation to pay, are but
weak, for their Revenue is but small, and such as cannot any ways
supply expences; so as many of their places are not so munited as
were needful; and if they were besieged, 'tis to bee feared they
might easily be lost; but in all Kingdomes and great Dominions the
expences are generally greater then are the Revenues wherewith to
maintain them, and the expences of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by reason of the so
many years war, and so very expensive, have been so excessive, as
they have not only exhausted the Arch-Dukes own Revenues, and
treasury, and reduced themselvs and their Countries stil to greater ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities,
but they have likewise consumed the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and left the body of so potent and great a Monarchy languishing
and exhausted.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III.</head>
                  <head type="sub">Of the Arch-Dukes Court.</head>
                  <p>THE Arch-Dukes Court is framed according to the manner of
the other <hi>Austrian</hi> Princes; who have generally instituted their
Courts in imitation of that of the house of <hi>Burgony</hi> in former times.
The chief Officers are these three; the Lord high Steward; the
Master of the Horse; and the Groom of the Stool. Under the Lord
high Steward is comprehended 4 other Stewards of the Hous. Under
the Master of the Hors 4 Querries; and all the other Gentlemen of the
chamber W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> attend upon the Archdukes person are under the Groom
of the Stool. Upon these Offices many other Orders of inferior persons
do depend. The Carvers, Cuppers, and Suers, together with almost all
the other houshold Officers are subordinate to the Lord high Steward.
As are the pages and all that belong unto the Stables to the Master of
the Horse; and those that attend upon the Arch-Dukes Bed cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to the Groom of the Stool.</p>
                  <p>These three are the chiefest Offices, and have no dependency one
upon another; and therefore they all three strive for Prerogative;
though in the common opinion, the office of Lord high Steward bee
the greatest. He hath liberty to enter at all houres into the Arch-Dukes,
and also into the Infanta's most privat Lodgings: Hee hath
the chief command of the Family, and hath a particular place in all
publick Audiences; and in the Chappel at Divine Service. Other
Stewards depend chiefly upon the service of the Infanta. With her
the first Lady of her Bed chamber hath the first place, and under her
are the other Ladies and women servants. The place of chief Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
is also a place of great esteem, as also those of the Captains of the
Guard. Which Guards are of three sorts. One of Archers, one of
Halberdiers, and one of Lances and Harquebusses, And this last is
the Guard which the Arch-Duke hath, as Generall of the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> Army. These which I have named are the chiefest and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pallest
Offices of the Arch-Dukes Court; there be also a great many
inferiour Offices.</p>
                  <p>Count <hi>Agnover</hi> one of the prime Gentlemen of <hi>Spain,</hi> and a man of
great desert, is at this time Lord high Steward. It is not many
months since the Arch-Dukes honoured him with this place; he having
been many years Groom of the Stool; which place he still keeps, as
also that of Captain of the Guard of Lances and Harquebusses. The
place of Master of the Horse is at this present void, by the death of
the <hi>Count Soldre,</hi> Knight of the Golden Fleece, who did injoy it. <hi>Den
Piedro de Tolledo</hi> is chief Chaplain; who was Embassadour from the
Arch-Dukes in the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Baron <hi>Barbanson</hi> is Captain of the Archers, and Count <hi>Frederig de
Berg</hi> Captain of the Halberdiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both of them Gentlemen of the
best rank in those parts. The Infanta's chiefe Lady of her Bed-chamber,
is the Lady <hi>Schacencourt,</hi> who went from <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi>
to wait upon Queen <hi>Isabella,</hi> the Infanta's Mother. She is now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
old, so as by reason of her great age her place is in many things
officiated by her Niece the Lady <hi>Katherina Livia;</hi> who is a Lady of
excellent parts, and much esteemed in Court: but by her own place
the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> is Cup-bearer to the Infanta; who is waited
upon at the Table by her Ladies as the Arch-Duke is by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:55461:33"/>
of the Chamber; both of them using to eat together both
at Noon and Night.</p>
                  <p>The Ladies, as also the Gentlemen of the Chamber are all of
them principal personages, some of them having the Title of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and being Knights of the Golden Fleece: so as the Arch-Dukes
Court, for what belongs to the service of their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and generally in all things else may v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

flourishing and splendid Court in Christendome.</p>
                  <p>Their Court is the more innobled by the usual residence of the
Popes Nuncio, and of divers Princes Embassadors, and Ministers
of State; there are three who receive the entertainment of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors;
they of <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>England:</hi> though he of <hi>France</hi>
is not styled by his King, with the Title of Embassador, that he may
give precedency to him of <hi>Spain,</hi> as is used in the Court of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Arch-Duke speaks to all Embassadors, as also to all other Lords
of how great quality soever they be in the third person, except they
be such as are or may be Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to those he gives the
Title of Signoria. But the Infanta useth <hi>

follows the Kingly style of <hi>Spain,</hi> in all things. The Arch Dukes imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the customes of that Court, likewise in the service in their
Chappell, and in the celebration of their publick Feasts. And it
may be said in generall, that both these Courts walk in the same
steps, unlesse it be that the Court of <hi>Brussels</hi> may seem in some sort
more pleasing and delightful by reason of the Freedome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and by the intercourse of so many Nations which by reason of
the Army are usually seen there. And in this point the Court of
<hi>Flanders</hi> may doubtesly be said to exceed all those of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>I Now come to the Arch Dukes Affairs, and to the Officers who
doe manage them. Their Affairs are of two sorts; the first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
themselves; the other have respect to the Crown of <hi>Spaine.</hi>
The first are managed by Dutch Ministers, the second by <hi>Spanish:</hi>
For their own Affairs, these are they who deal chiefly therein. In
the Affairs of that Country, the Auditour <hi>Lewis Verreychen,</hi> their first
Secretary of State; in Forrein correspondencies <hi>philip Prats</hi> Secretary
of State also; for matter of Monies, Count <hi>Ester,</hi> of the house of

of Justice, at present in default of the President, the Councellour
<hi>Massio,</hi> and the Councellor <hi>Pequio,</hi> both of them of the Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
The Auditor <hi>Verreychen,</hi> is a man of excellent parts: He hath been
imploy'd in great Affairs, particularly upon the occasion of the last
peace between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and of the Truce concluded in
<hi>Flanders;</hi> so as experience accompanies his other good parts. <hi>Philip

to be spiritually given, and liberal, and by these two means hath
wrought himself into a good opinion with the Arch-Dukes, and hath

                        </gap>o</hi> is a man of dispatch, and
very able in the managing of publick affairs; and having won credit in
<hi>France,</hi> where he was Embassador for some years from the Archdukes,
he is imploy'd as well in politick as judicial affairs. In such occasions as
fall out in <hi>Germany,</hi> the Secretary <hi>Antonio Suares,</hi> is made use of, a Dutch
man by birth, and one of the Archdukes ancient servants.</p>
                  <p>For those things which do respect the King of <hi>Spains</hi> interest in the
Provinces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> these are likewise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted chiefly to the Arch-Dukes
care, out of two respects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The one by reason of the Arch-dukes
being General of the Kings Army here; and the other, for that the same
Arch-Duke and the Infanta his wife (their mariage proving steril) are
as it were Feoffees in trust in those States, which are after their decease
to fall unto the crown of <hi>Spain</hi> again: so as executing the place rather
of Governors then of Princes of <hi>Flanders,</hi> they therefore are very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
of the Kings interest, as he who is to be their next successor. But
to speak more particularly of those the Kings Agents who are subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
to the Arch-Dukes; the weight of the <hi>Spanish</hi> affairs lies chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now upon three, the Marquisse <hi>Ambrosius Spinola,</hi> the Secretary
<hi>Iohn Mancicidor,</hi> and the Archdukes confessor; which confessor though
he depend chiefly upon the Archduke, yet being by birth a <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
and a man of great experience and abilities, he is imploy'd in all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
which do most import the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Marquisse <hi>Spinola</hi>'s authority in this court is exceeding great. Five
of the chiefest honours which the crown of <hi>Spain</hi> can bestow are in a
short time confer'd on him. He is of the Order of the Golden Fleece;
he is one of the Kings Councel of State; he is Superintendent Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of all the Kings monies which are laid out in <hi>Flanders;</hi> he is Camp-Master
General, with the title likewise of Governor of the Army; and
finally, in this his last journy into <hi>Spain,</hi> he hath received the honour of
a Grandee. 'Tis now 11 years since the Marquisse led those <hi>Italian</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> which were first to have served his bother <hi>Fredericks</hi>
designs; he being dead, the Marquiss succeeded in the same designs, to
advance his Fortune by the Military way in <hi>Flanders,</hi> neglecting the
pursuit of civil honours in <hi>Genua.</hi> Being egg'd on thus by these designs,
which were occasioned chiefly by the emulation which was between
him and Prince <hi>Doria,</hi> in their native country of <hi>Genua,</hi> he brought 8000
foot with him into <hi>Flanders,</hi> who came absolutely under his command.
Being thus become a General before he could well be said to be a sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
he soon after with equal forwardnesse ran into great reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Whereunto the taking of <hi>Oftend</hi> gave him the first rise. The two
Fields of <hi>Friesland</hi> followed after, in both which the Marquisse shewed
great vigilancy and valour, and knew very well how to supply the
want of experience which he could not purchase in so short a time
with every other proof of Military Government. He afterwards labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with incredible industry and wisdome in bringing the difficult pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of the Truce to an end; which lasted above two years; and
which made it appear how excellent he was at the managing of the
most difficult enterprises both military and civil. He is a very vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Minister, and is so indefatigable in matter of businesse, as though
he weary all men, he is never weary himself. In him there are
many actions which seem contrary within themselves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:55461:34"/>
On the one side he undertakes all things which he takes in hand with
great servency; and treats of them afterward with extraordinary
studie and patience: Businesse seems to be to him a pastime; yet
no man minds his business more then he, or is more intent therein:
He seems to them who consider the splendid living in his house, to
be given to Luxurie; yet no man is more indifferent in all things
which concerns his own person; he eats and drinks not minding it:
his rest is not to rest; and especially when he is in the head of an
Army, he shewes himself no less their chief in bearing with hard
ships, then in commanding over them; in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ine, he is a Minister of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
valour and understanding; very advised in his Councels, very
tractable in his comportment, and very upright in the administration
of publick affairs: It cannot be said how averse he hath alwayes
been to self-interest, and hath appeared so much the closser handed
in managing the Kings moneys, as he hath been the more liberal of
his own in his excessive expences. His Authority (as I have said)
is very great in this Court: All the most important affairs of the
Army pass through his hands; and in all other the greatest affairs of
State, he hath likewise always the principal part.</p>
                  <p>Great is the Authority likewise of Secretary Mancicidor; he was
secretary of the Army, when the Arch Duke being as then still Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall,
came first to be Governor of these Countreys, and hath from
that time to this, discharged that place with great praise and integrity;
he is come out of the discipline of <hi>Don Iohn d' Ideachez,</hi> a very famous
Officer; and he hath always and still doth prefess to have his chief de
pendency upon him. Mancicidor shew'd his integrity, and how far
he was from self-interest, when the Truce was made; in the manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
and conclusion whereof there was not a Spaniard but himself:
for setting aside all by-respect of self-profit, he never rested from
such Offices which made most for the Publick service: and no doubt
but that for what concern'd himself, no man lost more by the Truce
then he; for whereas in the time of War his place was worth ten or
twelve thousand Crowns a year, now in the time of Truce 'tis hardly
worth three thousand Crowns a year: He is austeer in his looks and
behaviour; of a very composed nature; one that ruminats more then
he speaks; but professeth great truth in what he saies; and this his
so cleer proceeding, hath wonn him great credit and authority with
the Arch-Duke; though he shuns the making of it appear as much
as he can: and so by refusing all company, and concourse, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the more fix'd, by how much the less appearance he makes: He
is an Officer very well esteem'd of here, as also in Spain, in witness
whereof the King made him of late one of his chief Councell of
War.</p>
                  <p>But the Arch-Dukes Confessor hath no lesser share in what concerns
the Spanish Interest in Flanders. <hi>II Padre Maestro Fra Inego di Brizaela,</hi>
of the Dominican Order, executes this place; he was placed therein
by Philip the second, when the Arch-Duke came to the Government
of these Provinces; at which time <hi>Fra Inego</hi> for his eminency in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,
was Regent thereof in Rome: so as he hath been now about
17 years in Flanders, and hath still continued the same place to the
great satisfaction of. the Arch-Duke, and applause of all others:
And though by reason of this his place, he hath no particular imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

may notwithstanding be said, that his is as it were a supream Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
whether affairs of all natures are brought. And the Arch Duke
who as hath been said, imitates the actions of Philip the second in all
things as much as he may, and who conforms himself generally to the
mode of the Court of Spain, hath easily suffered this man to come by
authority, for that great is the authority which the Kings of Spains
Confessors usually have; and for that this man is known to be very
capable of all manner of business: But his authority is particularly
increased since those two Journeys which three years agoe
he made into Spain; by one of which he wrought the King of Spain
and his Councellors to give way unto the Truce; and by the other,
that such assignement of monies as was requisit should be established
Now, since the last Voyage, and after his having seen and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in so many affairs, the Arch-Duke hath made him one of the
Councell of State: By this occasion the Confessor hath likewise left
a great opinion of himself in the Court of Spain; and from that time
to this 'tis thought that he may be imployed by the King himself <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <head type="sub">What Intelligence the Arch-Dukes hold with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</head>
                  <p>THe Kingdoms and States which do neighbour upon the Arch-dukes
Provinces are these: On the south the Kingdom of France,
on the west that of England; on the north the United Provinces;
and towards the east, their Countrey joynes upon the states of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
German Princes: upon those of Cleves and Juliers, of Trevers,
Cullen, Leidge, and they confince also on the side of France, for a
long space upon Lorain; on which side the County of Burgony is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from all the other Provinces.</p>
                  <p>There are general jealousies between the Arch-Dukes and these
their neighbours, not out of any considerations of the Arch-Dukes
own persons, but for such as concern the King of Spain, as their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</p>
                  <p>In former times when the Low Countreys were in the possession
of the House of Burgony, they had wont to ballance the Forces of
their confining Princes, according to the times, now in one sort, now
in another: and commonly the Dukes of Burgony, and Kings of
England joyn'd together to counterpoise the greatness of the Kings
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:55461:35"/>
of France: who on the contrary, had always the Kings of Scotland
for their adherents: but when the House of Austria grew to so
great a height, the face of the Affairs of Europe began to alter; and
the Princes correspondencies alter'd together with their Interests. The
Forces of Europe being then weighed, and put into the scales; the
French liked not their being inviron'd by the States of the Crown of
Spain by the way of the Pirenean Mountains; by Flanders, by the
Fleets of the Mediteranean, and Ocean Sea.</p>
                  <p>The English were afraid to see themselves begirt, and as it were
placed between the arms of the Spanish Empire by reason of the
same Fleets of the Ocean, which might be maintained in Spain and
in Flanders: and generally all the German Princes, but especially
the Hereticks liked not to be flanked by so great a Power. All the
neighbours did therefore joyn together in indeavouring to cut off
Flanders from the Crown of Spain; and to their forces of Arms,
the like of Heresie were joyned; the new Sects whereof could not
be so well secured in these northern Countreys, being to contend
with so great a power as was that of the seventeen Catholick Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of the Low Countreys joyned together under the obedience
of the King of Spain.</p>
                  <p>The War of Flanders broke forth then at first fomented by these
externall Aids, and by the same means did still continue, till the
fire thereof was rather sweep'd up then quench'd by the twelve years
Truce: and if the neighbours have not prevailed in cutting off the
whole Low Countreys from the Crown of Spain; yet have they
seen many Members sever'd from it, and that Crown deprived in a
great part, of his former vast Empire upon the sea.</p>
                  <p>And how hath it rejoyced them since, to see this new Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
of the United Provinces, reduced into a fix'd and vigorous
Body, make head against it? a Commonwealth compounded of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels
and Hereticks: the soul of whose present Government is Lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
and whose desire of enjoying it will still increase, by their assue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
thereunto. The King of Spain being then to succeed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Arch-Dukes, the forenamed neighbouring Jealousies keep yet
alive; and will be much greater, when the King shall be possest of
these Provinces.</p>
                  <p>At the present, since the Truce, better correspondency is held
with all the neighbours, then was in time of the former Warre;
which whilst it lasted, France and England never ceased furnishing
the United Provinces with such Assistance as they needed.</p>
                  <p>It is to be imagined that better Intelligence may better be held in
particular between Spain and France, by reason of the double mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
which is contracted between the two Crowns. Though it may
also be doubted, that this Intelligence may be regulated more by
the consideration of Interest, then by that of Blood.</p>
                  <p>And doubtlesly it is not to be believ'd that the French by reason of
this alliance with the Crown of Spain, will disert them with whom
they are joyn'd in their particular friendship and confederacie with
the United Provinces. The Examples fresh in memory of the late
Kings of France, and the last King of Spain, may sufficiently shew
by their past alliances, what may hereafter be expected from the
like: so as the most which at this present conjuncture of time, the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55461:36"/>
Arch-Dukes, and King of Spain can expect from the French, is that
they will interpose themselves as occasion shall require in friendly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
either in prolonging the present Truce, or in turning it into a
secure and lasting Peace.</p>
                  <p>Thus far the conjunction of the two Crowns may be believ'd to
prove advantagious for the Affairs of Flanders: whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
it may be held for certaine, that the French will appear
openly against the Spaniards if upon any other conjuncture of time
they shall goe about to subjugate the United Provinces againe by
Force.</p>
                  <p>But the Neighbourhood with the King of England is, and ever
will be more jealous. The Rebellion of Flanders was chiefly favour'd
by Forces from England in Queen Elizabeths days; and the now
King James Treads in the Queens steps, in his succession to that
Kingdom: and is much the more pertenacious therein, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate
in his hatred to the Catholick Church, by his having made
himself supream Head of the Church of England, not only by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but more by his Doctrine and Learning. He hath endeavour'd,
and still will endeavour as much as lies in the King of Englands pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
to prejudice the Affairs of Flanders, that he may thereby also
wound the Catholick Church, which was the end likewise of the
late Queen. He is likewise most jealouse of the Spanish Forces in
Flanders; as well by the Example of what the late King of Spain
endeavoured against the aforesaid Queen from those parts; as for
that Flanders is the safest refuge which those Catholicks have who
withdraw or fly from his Kingdoms: so as to boot with the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which the French have always received and given in the
Neighbourhood of Flanders, those of Heresie are added in the
English, which consequently make the Rent greater betweene
these Countreys, and those which are under the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
                  <p>The Arch-Dukes are chiefly jealous of the Neighbourhood of the
United Provinces; and though Armes be laid aside by reason of
the Truce; yet the jealousies on both sides continue still the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
which will turn again (as may be believ'd) to the taking up of
Arms, when the Truce shall be expired. The United Provinces nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
their people as much as they can, in fear of the King of Spain,
which is considered more by them in the persons of the Arch-Dukes,
then by any of the Neighbouring Princes; and this they endeavour
now no less then before, to the end that their people may so much
the willinger concur to the maintenance of such Forces as they do
still keep on foot since the Truce, in great numbers by heavy Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
                  <p>Thus they live in perpetuall jealousie of the Arch-Dukes, and
Crown of Spain: but they occasion likewise no less jealousies on
their behalfs out of so many and so known considerations: nor is
is to be doubted, but that upon occasion of this Free Commerce,
they will by all secret wayes endeavour both to corrupt the
Loyalty and contaminate the Religion of these yet obedient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
                  <p>The neighbourhood between the Hereticall States of Germany
and those of the Arch-Dukes, is likewise suspitious, and will be
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:55461:36"/>
now much the more since the Dukedoms of Cleves and Juliers are
falne into the hands of Heretick Princes: from which parts the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of Flanders was always likewise fomented; and by the example
of what is past, the Hereticks will assuredly govern themselves in the
future: and it may be believ'd that on the contrary the forces of Spain
will do what in them lies to their prejudice.</p>
                  <p>The conformity of Catholick Religion hath occasioned the better
correspondency between the States of Flanders and the Archbishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks
of Cullen and Trevers, and the Bishoprick of Liege. Though
sometimes these Forces by reason of the irremediable necessity of
War, have not been able to forbear using some violences upon the
aforementioned Countreys.</p>
                  <p>Lorrain hath scaped the best of any; and consequently the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
on that side hath stood and stands still upon better terms
then any other: and truely Spain hath wont to make great esteem
of the alliance of the Dukes of Lorrain with their King, and of the
Commodity which they thereby receive in passing such of the Kings
Forces as come from Italy into Flanders, through that Countrey.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the Army which the King of Spain maintains in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</head>
                  <p>TRUCE is a suspension of Arms, and a certain medium between war
and peace; but though this affair of Flanders had been an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
peace, and not a Truce, for a determinat time, yet must an Army
still have been maintained here; these Countreys being inviron'd
with suspitious neighbours, and by reason of homebred dangers
which some evil humors even of these very Provinces might produce.
The Army was then only lessened here, after the Truce was agreed
on, and 'twas resolved, to cashier such who upon occasion might be
readiest to be raised again, and to keep such in pay, as would be more
difficult to be listed hereafter. All the Dutch foot were dismist, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
it were some few, which shall be mentioned hereafter; and the
Spaniards, Italians, Burgonians, and Irish, together with a select num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of the antientest Wallouns; and because Spain was exhausted of
moneys, and Flanders much more, it was determin'd that for the les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening
of so great expences, a strength of Soldiery should be kept on
foot, as should only be sufficient upon all occasions, to withstand the
first shock, till such time as new Forces might be raised; and thus the
army was then reduced to about 12000 foot, and 1600 horse, all choice
men.</p>
                  <p>There are three Brigadoes of Spaniards, two of Italians, one of
Burgonians, one of Irish, and three of Wallouns; and 18 Companies
of horse, distinguish'd into Launciers, Curassiers, and Harchebugers;
eleven under Spanish Captains, four under Italians, and there under-Captains
of these parts: to these are added some choice Companies
of Spanish foot, together with some Dutch, as hath been said; and a
very small addition of such English and Scotch Catholicks as were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:55461:37"/>
of late years into the Army, after the peace made with the
King of England. The Spanish foot may in all be about 4500; the
Italians 2000, the Irish 1000; the Burgonians 800, the Wallouns 2000
the Germans about 300, and the English and Scots 200: the horse
are mixt of Spaniards, Italians, Wallouns, and others of this Country,
which amount in all to about 1600 horse, as hath been said; there
are besides a certain requisit number of Officers for the Artillery,
maintained, but these since the Truce are but very few; to all these
sort of people is added many Trattenuti, entertain'd persons about the
Arch-Dukes person, and many other Tranenuti about the Army;
both of which are thus termed, because they are paid apart, and are
not comprehended within the ordinary body of the foot and horse:
This is shortly the Soldiery which is maintained now by the King of
Spain in Flanders, all which are paid with his moneys, except such
horse as the Arch-Dukes do pay, as hath been said before.</p>
                  <p>This Army is like a great Animall which lives in continual voracity;
so as it needs much food to maintain it in requisit vigour. The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of moneys which for this end is sent from Spain is 90 thousand
crowns a month 70000 whereof is spent in payment of the Army; and
the rest upon other occasions. The expence of the Artillery is now
very little; and generally all that was needfull for field-service in the
time of War: an Army drawn into the field may be said to be a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
City, govern'd by Military Laws, and inviron'd every where
with Iron walls; and therefore at such a time requires all those things
which is requisit for a walled City; whence it is that expences in time
of war must needs be excessive. They are now much moderated by
the Truce; for where the King paid in the last war, whereof Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiss
Spinola was General, 300000 crowns a month, he pays no more
now then what hath been said, and the Arch-Dukes proportionably
have much lessened theirs.</p>
                  <p>Very many are the Officers which are requisit for a well-govern'd
Army; of which many are more for the pen then sword; of these the
Secretary of the Army is in greatest esteem; and next him the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-master-general,
and then the Pay-master-General, and the Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers;
all which Officers have their under-officers. Then the Justice
which is used as well in causes civil as criminal, is administred by an
Auditor-General, accompanied with divers others, who are likewise
subordinate to him.</p>
                  <p>But the chief Commanders who have the Government of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
are the Camp-Master-General, the General of the Horse, and the
General of the Artillery; in the Body of Foot, the Camp-masters
with such Officers as depend upon them, follow next after; in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of horse, the Lieutenant General, the Commissary General, and
the Captains of horse with their inferior Officers; and in the body
of the Artillery the Lieutenants, and those who are called Gentlemen
of the Artillery; together with those of inferior place who belong
to that Office: There are likewise two Church-Ministers in the Army,
the Viccar-general, upon whom depend such Church men who are
imployed in such spiritual functions as do occur; and the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the Kings Hospitall, which is continually maintained in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
for the cure of diseased and wounded Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>All the Nations whereof this Army is composed have at all times
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:55461:37"/>
given great testimony of their vallour: continual emulation hath
been between the Spaniards and Italians; the Spaniard always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to superiority over the Italian; and the Italian to equallity with
the Spaniard. And the contension between these two Nations, hath
sometimes produced dangerous disorders, and disturb'd divers good
successes which in several occasions were very hopefull. The Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
are now distributed into Garrisons, and almost all of them upon
the Frontiers; and their Commanders are generally antient and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd
Soldiers; but by reason of the so many years war, and
through the so many mutenies which have hapned, the Discipline
wherein the Army had wont to flourish is much corrupted. Of late
years there are few souldiers who have not their wives; and between
women and the love of their children, of necssity Military vigour
must fail and grow less: nothing more then this hath reduced the
Soldiery into poverty; poverty hath been the chiefest cause of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenies;
and nothing hath more corrupted the Discipline, and more
indammag'd the Kings affairs then mutenies; which thro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gh these
disorders hath suffered almost as much by their own Forces, as by those
of the Enemie; but as in humane bodies the older they grow, the
longer they do languish; so this Army of Flanders by so long a war,
hath felt the infirmities of age, and the defects thereof; and nothing
hath been judged better for the cure thereof then rest, which the
Truce hath now caused these Countreys to enjoy.</p>
                  <p>And this may suffice for what concerns Temporal Affairs, as I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
unto my self at first. Now I will proceed to the Ecclesiasticall,
which are proper to the Nuntios, as they represent the Apostolick

RELATION of FLANDERS.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Ought to account it a great happiness to me, that I
have been a servant to the Apostolick Sea in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
in this imployment of Nuntio, which by
reason of its so many particular circumstances, is
to be esteemed so remarkable. I have negotiated
here between two of the greatest Princes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom;
in one of the prime Courts of Europe;
in one of the gallantest Countreys that can be seen; in a publick
School of the noblest actions that can be undertaken. These Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
(as hath been said) are inviron'd by France, England, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces, and Germany: and such is the relation between the
affairs of Spain and these of Flanders, as both of them may be said
to joyn in one common and reciprocall Government. These Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
do every day entertain and transmit great store, and great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of publick affairs: no considerable alteration can happen amongst
the neighbours; which hath not some reflexion here; nor can there
any thing of importancy arise here, whereof the neighbours do not
partake. In these six years now near at an end, since I came to Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
great affairs have hapned in these parts: The Treaty of Truce
indured two years, which began to be handled at my first arrival; and
this business was so long in contriving, by reason of the difficulties that
were met withall, in ripening and dissipating the humours which so
long a war had aggregated.</p>
               <p>Almost presently after the Truce, two great commotions arose; the
one through the affairs of Cleves and Juliers, when the succession of
that House failed; the other by the Prince of Cunde's flying from
France, who was received into protection in these Provinces by the
King of Spain, and the Arch-Dukes: and as long as Henry the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
King of France lived there was still danger, that for the one or the
other of these, and finally for them both, bitter war was to arise in these
parts; nor did the Hereticks for all this lose their forwardness in the
affairs of Cleves and Juliers: they took the Town of Juliers by force,
and threatned Cullen; so as it behov'd Flanders to oppose her Forces
to their threats, and so that City was secured: but for all this the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks
did not forbear, nor yet afterwards, to raise up innovations on
that side by the alteration of Government which they changed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisgrane,
and by the fortifying of Mulen, which they did much to
the prejudice of Cullen.</p>
               <p>On the behalf of England; at my first coming hither, the Earl of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone's
flying from Ireland hapned, who was received in Flanders,
whereat the King of England was much offended; and the said King
continued still in his suspitions, that some of the English Catholicks
who were conspirators in the gunpowder-treason, were secured here in
Flanders; and in the war which the same King hath made with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of books come forth under his own name, against the authority of
the Church of Rome, the first blowes were felt here, and here it was
requisit that the first defence should be made.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:55461:38"/>
But very Tragical have the events been which have happened in
<hi>Germany,</hi> since I came into <hi>Flanders;</hi> which have all had relation to
this Arch-Duke, by reason of his nearnesse of bloud, and other inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
with the two brothers which took up arms one against another,
representing scenes and spectacles so full of horror. In the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
the Emperor <hi>Radulphus</hi> was almost driven out of <hi>Prague,</hi> and in
the second, almost taken in the Castle; bereaved in the first of a great
part of his Territories, and almost of all of them in the last. The only
name of Emperor remained to him, that death might bereave him of
some one of his past glories.</p>
               <p>The Electors after this shewed a great alienation to the succession
of King <hi>Matthias.</hi> Neither were the doubts small that in such a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis
of time the Hereticks would molest the new Election of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
by force of Arms. And that particularly they were to conspire
with the United Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> in these their designs. So as it
behooved to use all possible indeavour and industry to induce the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
to favour King <hi>Matthias,</hi> to the end that the Universal Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
might not be altered; in which it may be truly said that no body
laboured more on this side, then the Arch-Duke <hi>Alber<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

was very earnest in procuring the general quiet; and then doubled
his diligence in the new Election. First, in the behalf of his brother,
and then in keeping himself from being chosen. And perhaps his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
in the latter was more necessary then in the former: by the
declared disposition which the Electors shewed towards him, who
were already inclined to keep the Empire in the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> but
not as yet, to have King <hi>Matthias</hi> to succeed. Which action of the
Arch-Dukes in indeavouring all those meanes to shunne the Empire,
which might have been used to obtain it, deserves to be for ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to posterity; so well did he know how to govern his own o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
with such moderation and judgement, knowing what was best
for the common welfare of <hi>Germany,</hi> and the particular good of his
own house. The general joy of <hi>Matthias</hi> being chosen Emperor was
afterwards so much the greater, by how much greater the fears were
that his succession might prove turbulent and dangerous. And thus at
the present do the publick Affairs in these Northern parts of <hi>Europe</hi>
injoy this Calm. In my time then have the above mentioned oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
happened both here at home, and here abouts; in which,
together with an infinit number of other Affairs of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
<hi>Flanders</hi> hath had her share, and hath made her neighbours
taste thereof.</p>
               <p>But of all others I have ever esteemed it my greatest good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
to have had this place confer'd upon me in a time when a suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of Arms was agreed upon for some monethes, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
established by a Truce for twelve years. I hereby saw a large
Field opened unto me to come by a full knowledge of the Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Affairs in this Country, which is under the Nunciature of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and to indeavour some cure for the parts as they may be term'd
of this body, which the inveterate indisposition of so long a Warre
had left infirm and weak. There was hardly any memory left of the
Apostolick Nuncio's visitations, through the impediment which the
noise of War had given to these Ecclesiastical Functions. Great also
were the evills which Heresie had produced in the past calamity of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:55461:39"/>
these Provinces. A great many Churches ruined; famous Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
destroyed; the peoples Religion in many places corrupted; the
Discipline of the Catholick Clergy in sundry sorts disordered; and
a thousand other sad footsteps, and deplorable Records of the fury
thereof being left. I could then acquaint <hi>Rome</hi> fully with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of Ecclesiastical Affairs on one side; and on the other side apply
such remedies here upon the very places themselvs, as could proceed
from my weaknesse, by making many journies in visiting personally
all these Provinces, which remain under the Arch-Dukes obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>And because the Truce had made way for free commerce in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces, which are likewise under this Nunciature, I had
great conveniency also, to inform my self fully what the condition of
the Catholick Religion was in them. I first acquainted <hi>Rome</hi> with all
things needful; neither did my labour prove afterward fruitlesse
which through divine blessing, I imploy'd in preserving those Relicks
of Religion which yet remain in the abovenamed Provinces. By
means of this Truce likewise, I had the better opportunity to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the state of Religion in the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Dominions, and to
provide for many things tending to the benefit of such Catholicks as
are there; whose Affairs have likewise great relation to the Nuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of <hi>Flanders.</hi> And these are the Ecclesiastical Affairs about which
till now I have imploy'd my time. Re-assuming then the order which
I spoke of at first, I will treat of each head in the manner which I
have proposed; that is, first of the state of Religion in these
Provinces of the Arch-Dukes, and then of the state thereof in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and the other United Provinces; and lastly, I will shew you the
condition thereof in the Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <p>THE Government of the Ecclesiastical Affairs in the 17 Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the Low Countries, did anciently depend upon four only
Bishops. On the Bishops of <hi>Cambrey,</hi> of <hi>Utricht,</hi> of <hi>Tornay,</hi> and of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras.</hi>
Only one part of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and one part likewise of <hi>Lucemburg<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and
almost the whole Country of <hi>Limburg,</hi> were under the Bishoprick of
<hi>Liege,</hi> and on the same Country of <hi>Lucemburg,</hi> almost all the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
which do surround it, did extend themselves; as Mets and
Trevers on the side of <hi>Germany, Tul,</hi> and <hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>une</hi> towads <hi>France,</hi> and
<hi>Lorrain;</hi> but the Countries neer unto <hi>Flanders,</hi> being in a great part
over-run with heresie, and the evil thereof being crept even hither,
King <hi>Philip</hi> the second obtained of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fourth, that new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks
should be erected, the easilier to hinder those evils which
was feared from without, and also to remedy those which began to
operate in these Countries. The new Erection was this. <hi>Cambrey</hi> and
<hi>Utricht,</hi> which were before but bare Bishopricks, were made Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricks;
and the Arch-Bishoprick of the City of <hi>Malines,</hi> was foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
a new. The new Bishopricks were these; <hi>Nimigham</hi> in <hi>Ghelder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Harlem</hi> in <hi>Holland, Middleburg</hi> in <hi>Zealand, Deventer</hi> in <hi>Overisell,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:55461:39"/>
Leverden</hi> in <hi>Friesland,</hi> and <hi>Groninghen</hi> in the Province of that Name.
These together with the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Utricht</hi> were erected in
the Countries which are at present under the United Provinces; and
are now since the rebellion and the last war extinct. The others were
<hi>Antwerp</hi> and <hi>Balduke,</hi> in the Dukedome of <hi>Brabant, Ruremont</hi> in <hi>Ghel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland;
Gaunt, Bruges,</hi> and <hi>Ipri</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> Saint <hi>Omers</hi> in <hi>Artois;</hi>
and <hi>Namures</hi> in the County of <hi>Namures:</hi> The first fix were placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Malines;</hi> and the other two together with
that of <hi>Turney</hi> and <hi>Arras,</hi> under the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Cambrey.</hi>
There are then two Arch-Bishopricks, and ten Bishopricks, in those
Provinces which remain under the obedience of the Arch-Dukes.</p>
                  <p>The abovenamed Churches are generally poor; except that of
<hi>Cambrey,</hi> which is of an ancient and noble foundation: the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of <hi>Torney</hi> and <hi>Arras</hi> are nobly enough indow'd, both their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
being very ancient: So as in these three of <hi>Cambrey, T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rney</hi> and
<hi>Arras,</hi> Divine Service is exercised with much dignity and splendor.
The other Bishopricks have but small Incomes, and therefore most of
them want Seminaries. The beginnings of a Seminary were laid
some years agoe in <hi>Antwerp;</hi> and it may be hoped that by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
it may have farther progresse. Another is lately founded in <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines,</hi>
and is already in very good condition: another is begun in S.
<hi>Omer. Gaunt, Bruges, Ipri, Bal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>uke,</hi> and <hi>Ruremond</hi> have none; and have
but little hopes ever to have any, for want of necessary commodities.
The Churches of <hi>Cambrey, Torney, Arras,</hi> and <hi>Namures,</hi> have no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ies
apart; but maintain one between them all in the University
of <hi>Doway;</hi> where according to the power of each of them, they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a proportionable number of Students: But of all other Cities,
two good Seminaries if it were possible to have their Foundations
laid, would be very useful in <hi>Antwerp,</hi> and in <hi>Gaunt.</hi> These are the
two Cities of all the Arch-Dukes Provinces which are most infected
with heresie. <hi>Antwerp</hi> chiefly by reason of Traffique, which from the
very first opened the Gates to the mingling, and corruption of Sects,
together with the Traffiquers who introduced them. A good Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
would in particular be of great use and advantage to this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse:
and though there hath always been need thereof, yet now more
then ever, for that since the Truce a good part thereof is under the
Temporal Dominion of the United Provinces. Which though they
promised under their hands to the late King of <hi>France,</hi> not to meddle
with the exercise of the Catholick Religion in those parts, which are
under the Spiritual Government of the Bishoprick of <hi>Antwerp;</hi> yet
their Heretick Ministers do every day indeavor novelties, and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
as much as in them lies to spread abroad the infection of their
Sects in those parts. <hi>Gaunt</hi> is likewise a Merchandizing City, having
three Rivers which run through the midst of it, and are of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
for Traffick. But to boot with the contagion of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Sectaries, the people of <hi>Gaunt</hi> have willingly suffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be poisoned with the Licentiousnesse of Liberty.</p>
                  <p>In former times those of <hi>Gaunt</hi> were always somewhat contumaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and licentious against their Princes: and have since shewed the
like aversion against the ancient Religion: So as a great part of this
City is infected with Heresie; and certainly it would be a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
as well to the City as to the Diocesse, if there were a good Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:55461:40"/>
there. <hi>Bruges</hi> and <hi>Ipri</hi> are either wholly free from Heresie, or
but little infected therewithal; and their Diocesse are like unto them.
<hi>Balduke</hi> is a very Catholick City, but some parts of the Diocesse is
not altogether so. <hi>Ruremond</hi> is a very poor Church; almost not at all
indow'd; the people within the Town are well enough affected, but
without, they are somewhat infected. The City of <hi>Malines</hi> is very
clear from Heresie. Some parts of the Diocesse are notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
polluted, particularly <hi>Brussels,</hi> a Town of large Circuit, and for
concourse of people much greater then <hi>Malines</hi> it self. The Cities of
<hi>Cambrey, Arras,</hi> Saint <hi>Omers,</hi> and <hi>Namures,</hi> together with their Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
are generally very constant in the Catholick Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Torney</hi> even since the first commotions in <hi>Flanders</hi> suffer'd it self to
be involv'd in the contagion of Heresie, as also <hi>Valenciana,</hi> a large
Town, and of great Traffick; it is under the Spiritual Jurisdiction
of the Arch-Bishoprick of <hi>Cambrey;</hi> except one part thereof which
is subject to the Bishoprick of <hi>Torney.</hi> So as in both these places the
seeds of Heresie remain yet: But the Hereticks dare not discover
themselves in any of the said places, neither by giving any scandall,
nor by doing any unlawful act in Religion, which may be known;
concerning which the Magistrates, and Church-men are very vigilant;
but chiefly the Arch-Dukes themselvs; who are as diligent therein as
can be desired, not only by the example of their own extraordinary
zeal, but by means of their Supream Authority.</p>
                  <p>All the abovenamed Churches are provided with indifferent
good Ministers, and generally with good Clergy within the Cities.
Good Curats are likewise provided for the Diocesse; and except it
be in the Provinces of <hi>Brabant, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
is well enough provided of them. In those three Provinces there
is great scarcity of them, because the <hi>Flemmish</hi> Tongue is only used
there; so as the other Provinces cannot supply their needs. But in
all the others the <hi>French</hi> Tongue is used, and by reason of a Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
which they have in common amongst them, in the University of
<hi>Doway,</hi> they may provide Curats for such Churches as have need of
them.</p>
                  <p>This University serves chiefly for the Students of the <hi>Walloen</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
and for the others that lie more inward, where they speak
<hi>French,</hi> as in the Provinces of <hi>Torney</hi> and <hi>Silla.</hi> But for those parts of
the Country where they speak <hi>Dutch,</hi> the University of <hi>Lorain</hi> serves
for the same purpose. These two Universities are in the Arch-Dukes
Provinces; that of <hi>Lorain</hi> is very ancient, and keeps still in great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation;
that of <hi>Doway</hi> was built by <hi>Philip</hi> the second for the better
service of the neighbouring Provinces, but <hi>Lorain</hi> is far beyond it for
the concourse of Scholars, Eminency of Professors, and for Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of many Colledges wherewith it is beautified.</p>
                  <p>These two Universities shew great reverence &amp; obsequiousnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the holy See; and particular care is had in each of them, for
putting the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> in practice, they being very zealous in
preserving the purity of the Catholick Faith. The Bishops and Curats
in their several Offices do particularly labour that the Councel be put
in practice; and as for the secular Ecclesiastical Order there is not
therein much to be added. Residencies are there observed, and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patibilies
forborn; and all other Ecclesiastical Functions are generally
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:55461:40"/>
exercised according to the Decrees of the Councel, and they day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reform their customes.</p>
                  <p>But as for the regular Order, to say truth the excesse of liberty
in the Monasteries, especially in those of women, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
in those of the Nuns of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> and Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> is very
great. The Councel was never admitted of amongst them; nor
is it to be hoped that it ever will be, because the chief Monastery as
well of Women as of Men are for the most part in <hi>Campania;</hi> so as it
would be too difficult a businesse to reduce them to strict Cloister ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servancy;
Moreover they are taught to receive in strangers, either
through the visits of Friends, or for the conveniency of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
And although the Guests of the Nuns Monasteries are placed
without the Cloistures, yet this is done with too much familiarity
of Secular conversation.</p>
                  <p>This is the ancient custome of the Country; and truly but few
scandalls are observed to insue hereupon; for liberty it self serves
for a remedy to liberty; by the so great and usual custome of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation;
and for that the people of these parts are but little given
to sensuality, and extraordinarily candid in their behaviours. Very
free is likewise the form of living, which is here observed in several
Chapters of the Canons, whereof there are three; all of an ancient
Foundation. One in <hi>Mons,</hi> another in <hi>Nivella,</hi> and another in <hi>Mabuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa.</hi>
Their Institution is to serve in the Quire at Divine Service, as
doe other Canonists; and they wear a very grave Church habit:
For what remains, they live disperst in divers houses in those towns
where the Chapters are erected, and here they are cloathed as Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars
are; they receive all manner of visits, they daunce and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and except it be the Title, they retain almost nothing of
Ecclesiastical persons: So as one would say, whatsoever is Sacred
in the Church, were utterly profane when out of it. All these she
Canons are of the chief Families of <hi>Flanders:</hi> They all of them do
usually mary afterwards; and those who will not mary live in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
chastity, continuing their Function; and in the same free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as formerly; and yet they doe thus defend their chastity,
meerly with the weapons of natural goodnesse and modesty. As if
they were inclosed within the Walls of the severest and most unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessible
cloisters. So much doth the good natures of some prevail
over severe Laws in many others.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the Monkly Order; the liberty thereof, as I
have said, is great; and 'twill be very hard to work a reformation
therein out of the abovesaid reasons. The Arch-Dukes themselves
inflam'd with a desire to see the Ecclesiastical Government set in a
good way, have much indeavoured that the Monasteries might bee
more strictly kept, but sufficient remedies to remove the difficulties
could never be found. They forbear not notwithstanding to apply
all such remedies as they are able to work this effect; and without
doubt they are of great use: For they nominate according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolical
Indulgence, which they injoy, such persons for Abbots
and Abbesses who are thought doe best deserve those places.</p>
                  <p>There are many, and generally many rich Monasteries in these coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries;
in particular the Order of Saint <hi>Benedict,</hi> Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi> and
the White Friers. The Abbots, and Abbesses have their Lodgings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:55461:41"/>
in the Monasteries, as also their Table and Revenues; and doe
injoy little lesse then a free propriety of their goods: And regular
Government (as hath been said) is much relaxt amongst them. The
mendicant Orders keep indifferent good Discipline; and particularly
the <hi>Franciscan</hi> Friars, after having introduced into them some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents
of the Recollectia. Now that the Reformed <hi>Carmelites</hi> are
likewise entred into these Provinces, the Discipline of the <hi>Covents</hi> of
ancient Foundation, may perhaps in time also grow better, as 'tis no
more then needs. Those of the Order of Saint <hi>Austine</hi> behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
well enough, but the <hi>Dominicans</hi> much better. Two other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Votaries have of late greatly flourisht in <hi>Flanders;</hi> the <hi>Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shins</hi>
and Jesuists, both which Orders have been admitted into all the
Cities and principal places; and the good cannot be greater, then that
which is gathered particularly from the Jesuists; by their institution
of instructing youth in learning and piety. And this may suffice for
what concerns the state of Religion in the Catholick Provinces of
<hi>Flanders.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">Of the state of Religion in Holland, and the other
Vnited Provinces.</head>
                  <p>IT will be necessary now to seek out the remainder of Catholicks,
who have continued in the United Provinces after the late war;
amidst the darknesse and errors of heresie. At the same instant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
that by their rebellion they flew from the King of <hi>Spains</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
they likewise parted from the obedience of the Catholick
Church. The first that took up arms against the crown of <hi>Spaine,</hi>
were <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi> as also the first that flew from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Church. The rebellion spread abroad afterwards in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Provinces, and they served for example one to another in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the Government of them all equal. They imitated one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
likewise in imbracing Heresie, out of a design to oppose the
Catholick Religion professed by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and by this means, to
strengthen the separation from their Empire the more, So as in the
uniting of the Provinces, their government past wholly into the hands
of the Hereticks. And what was first done by <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand,</hi>
was done likewise by the other five Provinces, which from time to
time joyned with them. I will now acquaint you with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Catholick Religion in these very Provinces; but I
judge it first requisite briefly to give you an account of their Heresies.</p>
                  <p>The abovenamed Provinces have admitted of many sects. But
the sect which reigns generally amongst them, is <hi>Calvinisme;</hi> and
of this sect are they who govern. The United Provinces chose
rather to apply themselves to this, then to any other, because their
rebellion was chiefly maintain'd by the arms of <hi>Calvinists;</hi> which were
continually poured into them from <hi>France, England</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> Thus
making religion serve the interest of State, according to the custom
of other Hereticks, the United Provinces did all of them embrace
<hi>Calvinisme;</hi> and would have it to bee chiefly exercised amongst
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:55461:41"/>
them; and that the Catholick religion, which had for so many
years flourished amongst them, should for as much as in them lay,
be wholly supprest. They have also many <hi>Lutherans</hi> mingled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, who are the remainders of that general deluge of
<hi>Lutheranisme,</hi> which at the first over-flowed almost all <hi>Germany,</hi> and
the neighbouring Countries. Great likewise is the number of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists,</hi>
and some <hi>Davidists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Puritans</hi> are likewise there permitted; who are the most rigid
<hi>Calvinists,</hi> who will not acknowledge any Authority in their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Magistrates over the Government of their Hereticall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
And these are all English Puritans, who by occasion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
frequent <hi>Holland</hi> and the rest of the United Provinces. These
are the Sects wherewith the people of these parts are contaminated
in point of religion.</p>
                  <p>Yet no publick exercise is permitted amongst them but <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme;</hi>
nor is there any other Doctrine permitted to be taught in their
Schools. All other Sects are suffered in privat families; which may
notwithstanding bee tearmed publick, for they are preached in
spacious places, capable of all concourse.</p>
                  <p>The greatest number of Hereticks are <hi>Calvinists,</hi> who are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perst
throughout all their Provinces, and their Government is alike
in each of them. The greatest part of Anabaptists are in <hi>Friesland,</hi>
and in the farthest Northern parts of <hi>Holland. Friesland</hi> is also chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
infected with <hi>Davidists.</hi> The most <hi>Lutherans</hi> are in the City
and Province of <hi>Groninghen;</hi> part of them remaining likewise in
<hi>Amsterdam,</hi> by reason of Traffick. The English Puritans are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
all of them likewise out of the same respect in <hi>Amsterdam;</hi>
and some of them by occasion of Merchandising live in <hi>Middleburg;</hi>
So then in all parts, and in every corner of the United Provinces,
the barkings and howlings of so many Sectarists may be heard; who
do notwithstanding all joyn in opposing the Catholicks, though there
be great divisions and differences between themselves; even as rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
Beasts laying aside their rankor amongst themselves, joyn in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it unanimously to prey upon the milder.</p>
                  <p>I will now treat as briefly as may be of the Catholicks; whereof
there be great remainders left in the United Provinces, though the
same persecutions which were at first begun against them continue stil.
But they have not been, nor are they yet so rigorous by much as in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
&amp; in other countries, for the aforesaid Provinces are not permitted
by the form of their government to use such rigor; and having been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
so much busied amongst forain arms, they might apprehend som
domestick tumults, if they should have proceeded with too much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
against the catholicks; good numbers wherof are stil amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to boot that their government having much of popular in it, and all of
them applying themselvs to traffick; the correspondency in merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
&amp; in alliances hath always been very great between the Hereticks
and Catholiques: So as the vicinity of bloud hath caused love between
many of them; and the occasion of Merchandizing hath coupled
together the interests of divers others; and by these means the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Religion hath found some tollerable connivancy, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
and as it were stoln exercise thereof, wherein it was necessary
to be restrained in those parts.</p>

                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:55461:42"/>
Most of the Catholieks in these parts are in <hi>Holland:</hi> The meaner
sort of people are most corrupted; and those Foraigners who when
the rebellion of <hi>Flanders</hi> first began fled from these Catholick Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the united ones, that they might live the more Licentiously in
Heresie. There are many Catholicks yet remaining in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of <hi>Utricht,</hi> and particularly in the City of <hi>Utricht,</hi> as likewise in
<hi>Ghelderland,</hi> and in the Province and City of <hi>Groninghen;</hi> there are
many likewise in <hi>Overisell,</hi> and <hi>Friesland;</hi> but very few in <hi>Zealand;</hi> the
difficulty and dangers of exercising the Catholicke Faith being
much greater there then in any of the other aforesaid Provinces. In
former times a particular addiction to Divine Worship, and Sacred
things did abound in all of them; great were the number of Temples
and Monasteries in all parts; and the peoples piety generally very
great. And the natural candidnesse of their manners was also accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the pure candor of Religion; and women were very
much given to Cloister lives.</p>
                  <p>The Secular Priests and Religious Votaries who live in these parts
are maintained by the charity of such Catholicks as live in the United
Provinces, and by such means as they receive from abroad. There be
many Secular Priests amongst them; but few Votaries. The Secular
Priests Supply the place of Curats amongst Catholicks in the places
where they live. The most of them as also of the Votaries, are in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
there being many Catholicks in that Province, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
more frequent; next unto <hi>Holland</hi> most Catholicks and Priests
live in the Province of <hi>Utricht; Utricht</hi> having been long a City of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Principality, and the people therein having been much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to the Catholick Religion, and much given to sacred things.
There are but few Priests in the other Provinces; partly, because
their number is not sufficient to serve for all places; and partly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they proceed more rigorously against them in the other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
then in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Utricht.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these Priests depend upon the Government of an Apostolicall
Vicar, who was lately instituted with subordination to the Nuncio of
<hi>Flanders;</hi> and for his greater authority, and that he might execute
the Office of an Ordinary in those Provinces, the Title of Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of <hi>Philippi</hi> was afterwards given him. He therefore runs over
thither sometimes, exercising his charge in such sort as he may; but
the settled Residency of the present Vicar is in <hi>Cullen;</hi> where by his
means particularly, a Seminary of Students, most part of which are
<hi>Hollanders,</hi> is to very good purpose erected. This Seminary is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
maintained by the alms of the Catholicks in <hi>Holland,</hi> and other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces. And the Scholars there study Religion and humane
Learning. From thence they are sent to the University of <hi>Loven,</hi> to
study Theology; and are daily sent from thence into these Provinces
to husband the Catholick Faith. The Votaries have their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Heads on whom they depend.</p>
                  <p>Divers dissentions and disputes have oftentime past between the
Secular Priest, and the Votaries. The Priests have never been so
willing as they ought to have been that Votaries should enter amongst
them, and have many times complained, that their Faculty was too
much inlarged in the administration of Spirituall Affairs; as doe
the Votaries on the other side, that the Priests have many times op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:55461:42"/>
them. So as upon these and some other occasions, divisions have
sometimes faln out between them. But they live now together in
concord, their past differences being in a good part composed: By
means whereof the Hereticks have sometimes war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>'d more against
our cause, then by the weapons of their own Sects. Heresie then
reigns in the United Provinces in manner as hath been said; and on
the contrary the Catholick Religion groans under heavy yoaks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them. But by Gods assistance these groans and miserable affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of Catholicks will one day also cease: For it hath been obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in all Ages, that the true Church hath ever flourisht most, when
she hath been most opprest by her Enemies. And on the other
side all Heresie hath been ever seen to burst in pieces, and perish
through its own venome, when it hath ceased to vomit it out.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the state of Religion in England.</head>
                  <p>LET us now consider in what condition the Kingdomes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are in point of Religion: And first, for
<hi>England;</hi> 'tis known and acknowledged, that the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
did not flourish more in any part of <hi>Europe,</hi> then in that Kingdom,
till <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth his Apostasie. No Prince whatsoever had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chast
more Fame for his zeal to the good of the Church, then the said
<hi>Henry,</hi> by the gallant works, whereby he indeavoured to maintain
the Popedome against the Forces of other Princes in divers troubles
in <hi>Italy;</hi> nor in defending the Catholick Religion against the Heresie
of <hi>Luther,</hi> and the Princes who adhered to him therein, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
occasioned thereby in <hi>Germany.</hi> His Book of the seven Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which he composed and publisht likewise then against <hi>Luthers</hi>
self, was a particular example of singular Piety; nor did he think a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing added more to his greatnesse then the title which <hi>Leo</hi> the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
confer'd upon him of Defendor of the Faith. How he came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to doat upon <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> and how having first vented his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
against the Pope, he afterwards separated himself wholly from
the Catholick Church, and growing still more perverse, did at last in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to suppress that religion which he had so gloriously defended
before, are things sufficiently known; and which will alway be the
most to be lamented and fatal, which can be represented upon a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Theatre.</p>
                  <p>But though Heresie took firm root in <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Henries</hi> time, yet
was there no settled form of the exercise thereof there. King <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixt a Prince within age succeeding him; <hi>Zuinglius</hi> his Doctrine
was chiefly embraced. The Catholick religion may be said presently
after to receive new life again, and to be again slain in Queen <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi>
succession to the Crown, and her so soon death. After the
which, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> comming to succeed her in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
that form of Heresie was confirmed which was called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentarian;
the Parliament having interposed its Authority
therein, to the end that that might be the only Religion received in all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:55461:43"/>
parts of her Dominions. In the chief Dogma's Calvin was followed;
whose sect began then to rise, and increased every day; and in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Government the first form of Catholick worship was retained:
Episcopacy being continued, together with almost all the rest of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Clergy in former times: the antient<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ecclesiasticall maintenance
was left to the Bishops and the rest of the Hereticall Clergy: as for the
regular Orders, they were long before quite abolish'd, and all Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
either ruin'd, or turn'd together with their Revenues totally to
profane uses.</p>
                  <p>This form of Government which was introduced in England in the
Queens time, is since maintained by the now King. The sect of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>estant
Calvinists reignes now there, called as I have said, Parlemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian.
The English Protestants are also called by another name <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glo
calvinisti,</hi> viz. English Calvinists; to distinguish them from those of
France, and of other parts, where Calvinisme is followed in its more
rigid and pure form, as it was taught at first, and which hath been
since so largely diffused by the Church of Geneva: together with the
Protestant Calvinists, there are also many direct Calvinists in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
whom they call Puritans; both these sects do agree in almost
all their Dogmata: but they differ in many things touching Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and exterior rites. The Protestants retain the antient degrees
of the same Ecclesiasticall dignities and offices, on which the spiritual
Government did depend in the time of the Catholick Religon. The
Puritans on the contrary, throw away all supereminency of degrees,
and all conformity of ministry with the Catholick Church, and will
have the antientest and fittest amongst them to have the only care of
spiritual matters amongst them; they do wholly deny the Kings Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
in spiritual affairs; whereas the Protestants acknowledge the
King to be the supream Head of the Church of England, as they term
it; thus these two sects do justle in many things; but the Protestant
Profession is that which reignes. Arch-Bishops, Bishops, and next
them the inferior Clergy of Deacons, Arch-Deacons, Curats, and
others, are subordinate to the Kings supream spirituall Government.
There are only two Arch-Bishops in England; the one of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
the other of York; and 25 Bishops; three of which only are under
the Arch-Bishoprick of York; and all the rest depend upon Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury:
the Arch-Bishop whereof keeps the title of Metropolitan, and
is as it were the Kings right hand in the mannaging of spiritual affairs.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be doubted but that this King that now is, is an Heretick
by his true, stif, inward perswasion; nay by his learning, and
by his pretending in particular to great eminency in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
affairs, he hath drunk so deep of heresie, as not content
to be fervent therein in his very heart, he hath pleased by the tongues
of his own books to professe himself publickly throughout all Europe
to be a learned professer thereof, and cunning controvertist therein;
but it is true that, upon divers occasions it may clearly appear, that he
is not fully satisfied with the present form of Heresie in England:
certainly if he were able, he would alter many things both in the es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Tenents, and in the exterior part of Government: he spends
most of his time in discoursing upon these matters of Religion; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
chiefly to entertain himself therewith: he speaks, he disputes
every day thereof; and feeds himself continually with the divers pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:55461:43"/>
which are aboundantly given him, by those who usually dispute
of purpose to be overcome: But he would never be able to alter the
present form of hereticall practice in England, which hath been so
long receiv'd and practiz'd by the publick Anthority and Laws of the
Kingdom: the King will then follow the Sect which predominates,
and indeavour to propagate it since he cannot alter it.</p>
                  <p>The talk is various concerning the Queen his wife, according to
her various proceeding in matter of Religion: before she went from
Scotland she gave evident signes of being inclin'd to be a Catholick; and
increased them when she came to England; for it was constantly believ'd
that at her first coming into that Kingdom upon the occasion of a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
childbed of hers, she used the Ecclesiasticall Sacraments: and
her being always willing to read Catholick books, her seeming to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
reliques, her wearing them many times about her; and her
treating with more familiarity and confidence with divers Catholick
Ladies, who usually did most frequent her Court have always been
reasons which have pleaded for this opinion: and as far as her inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
leads her, it seems that undoubtedly she is to be esteem'd a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick;
at least it may be almost absolutely affirm'd, that she sides not with
heresie; for she never profest Lutheranism<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e after she once quitted her
native Countrey of Denmark, where that Heresie reignes; nor yet
Calvinisme either in Scotland or in England; being seldom or never
present at the preaching of any of those Heretick Ministers; nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
at the Lords Supper as it is used by the Calvinists: but on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side she is so given to festivals and dancing, and to all pleasant
pastimes, and is of so easie and voluble a nature, as the opinion of her
being a Catholick, can only be grounded upon the uncerertain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid
conjectures: she still proceeds with this ambiguity, and the
opinion of others touching her conscience in religion is alike dubious.</p>
                  <p>As for the succeeding Prince it is to be feared that he may prove a
great Heretick by those signes which of his own instinct he hitherto
gives in matter of Religion. To boot that the King hath not been
wanting, nor is yet so, in using all possible means of confirming his
son in Heresie; nay he oftentimes hath, and still doth serve him as well
in place of a Tutor, as of a Father; for he would if it were possible,
have his son to succeed him as well in his wisdom and learning, as in
his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Nobility of England, all that is to be said in point
of Heresie, is this, That the chiefest of the Nobility, unless it be some
very few, who partly openly, partly in secret are Catholicks, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
all of them protestants, and conform themselves to the Kings
pleasure: of the meaner sort, of nobility, or of the gentry, the most
are likewise Protestants, many of them Puritans, and very few pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
Catholicks; but of this sort of nobility many of them are in their
hearts Catholicks, though in outward appearance they seem to be
Hereticks, that they may save their estates, and be capable of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the Kingdom. The meaner sort of people are likewise part
of them Protestants, part Puritans; and the Citizens are generally all
of them infected with Heresie: so as the greatest sort of Catholicks
of that condition are such as live in Villages, and in the Countrey: and
this may suffice to be said with as much brevity as may be, touching
the condition of Heresy in England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:55461:44"/>
I come now to the Catholick Religion: and that you may first clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
understand the Catholicks of that Kingdom, we must distinguish
them; some in England are declared Catholicks; whom they term re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusants,
because they refuse to go to the Heretick Churches; paying
such pecuniary mulcts as are imposed upon those who follow not their
Heresie; others there are who live Catholickly in that Kingdom, but
in secret, not paying any penalties; making therein use of the favour
of great personages, and of their own industery; and others there
are who are Catholicks by manifest inclination; but who that they
may not lose their Estates and Honors, seem outwardly to be Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks:
great likewise is the number of those in England, who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in point of Religion, and have no particular sence thereof,
but are of all beliefs, and follow only a large moral faith; and many of
these certainly would chuse rather to profess the Catholick Religion,
then any whatsoever Heresie; so as to number up the declared Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
and who with true fervor and intension do adhere to Heresie in
England, 'tis thought (according as it may be conjectur'd at large) that
they will not exceed the fifth part of the Inhabitants of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;
but on the contrary, if you will consider the two first sorts of
Catholicks, they will hardly make the thirtieth part of the Kingdom;
there being but few who live profest Catholicks under the rigour of
the penalties; and those not being many who can live Catholickly in
secret, under the protection of great men, or by their own industery,
so as the greatest number will prove those who under a large and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
signification, would be called Catholicks, taking the intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for the deed; and those who make no profession at all of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
Faith, but who if they were to follow any, would ratherest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to the Catholick Religion; the first of these two sorts are called
in England Schismaticks, and the other Polititians.</p>
                  <p>But howsoever, the number of the two first sorts of Catholicks must
be esteem'd great; which may be gathered by the number of secular
and regular Priests, who exercise spiritual affairs amongst them, by so
numerous missions: nor is it to be understood that every Catholick
Family hath its own particular Priest alotted to it: for this will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fall to the share of every thirtie houses; the Priests being necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to fly from one house to another, to shun the storms of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
persecutions; as also to dispence their spirituall functions now
in one Family, now in another, that they may be aiding to as many
Catholicks as they can. This Argument derived from the number of
Priests, and the Ministry which is by them exercised, as hath been
touched upon, may make it appear what the number of Catholicks
are in that Kingdom: great must their zeal and constancy be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
to continue as they do in the antient Faith amidst so many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and penalties. This fervour and this zeal is particularly seen in
women, and most in the most noble; they take the Priests most into
their care; they watch most how to keep them out of danger; and
they read Catholick books more then do the men; and are more verst
in disputing controversies with the Hereticks: but 'tis true that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
may do all these things more boldly then men, for they escape
punishment more easily; yet not long since the King hath much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
his rigour, even to women.</p>
                  <p>The spirituall Government of Catholicks in England depends then
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:55461:44"/>
upon the number of secular, and regular Priests which are within the
Kingdom: who keep in divers parts, according to the greater or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
need of Catholicks. The secular Clergy is governed by one head
who is over them all by the title of Arch-Priest; and this Arch-Priest
hath under him some assistants, who from divers sides with proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
Authority over the other meer Priests, help him to govern. The
Votaries or regular, have likewise their superiors, upon whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
their particular mission doth depend; which do consist
principally in those of the Benedictans, and Jesuits. The Arch-Priests
Authority over the Glergy which is under him, is wholly reduced to
exhortation, admonition, and reprehension: using for his last means
and punishment to suspend such as are incorrigable, from their spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
faculties, or utterly to deprive them of them: no more rigorous nor
better order'd discipline then this can be admitted of amidst so many
obstacles as are in all parts met withall at this time in the exercise of
the Catholick Faith in England.</p>
                  <p>There are very many learned and zealous men in this secular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who partly by composing Books, partly by the blood of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
do gloriously maintain the Catholick Faith in England; the
Clergy-Priests come from forth those Semenaries which to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
are instituted out of the Kingdom in other Provinces, there
are two of them here in Flanders; one in Saint Homers, which is
govern'd very accuratly by the Father-Jesuits, wherein are many
gallant young youths; and another in Doway, under the Government
of a President, and consisting of the chiefest Priests of the Clergy:
The Students of the first are all youths, and when they have finish'd
their course in humanity in Saint Omers, they are then sent to the
English Seminarie in Rome, or else in those other three which are
founded in Spain, to wit; in Valiadelid, in Sevill, and in Madrid; to
imploy their studie in Philosophy and in Divinity, under the care of
the same Jesuits; those of the second (though that of Doway was first
founded) are of more mature age, and in their own colledge read
the graver studies of Philosophy, and Divinity. These Seminaries
are then as military quarters, where spirituall Souldiers learn their
Discipline wherewith to defend the Catholick cause in England;
here they are trained and formed, and pass from these quarters to
make good so hard and dangerous and undertaking, as to fight so po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
adversaries, who because they ground themselves upon an unjust
and wicked cause, do use the more force and violence; but they use
no less deceit, and confide no less in these deceitfull weapons, then
in those wherewith they oppugne our cause with open War. These
deceits and cus'nages are diversly practised by them; but particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their having indeavour'd sundry ways to nourish those divisions
which of late years have begun to arise, between the secular Priests,
and Votaries, and to excite also new ones by the new invented Oath
of Allegiance. There is already convenient remedy taken for the
former; but the dangerous effects which the Oath hath begotten,
do not as yet cease, nor is it to be hoped that they will do soon.</p>
                  <p>The Inventers of this new Engine against the Catholick Religion,
propounded two chief ends therein unto themselves: The one that
the King might have matter whereon to proceed with yet more rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
persecution then formerly, against the Estates and persons of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:55461:45"/>
Catholicks; it being judged that many of them would refuse to
take this Oath, wherein he that is to take it, must in Hereticall terms
denie all Pontificall authority, under whatsoever interpretation or
form over the temporal affairs of Princes: The other to cause a new
occasion of contension between the Catholick Clergy; it being held
for certain that there would not be wanting some amongst the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,
who either for fear of punishment, or through luke warmness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Religion,
would be induced to take the Oath, and perswade others
to do so too; nor have they fail'd in the former; for many Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
since then have been punished with imprisonment, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scation
fo Goods, for their constancy in refusing to take the Oath,
and many for this cause do daily incur punishment. And as for the
second consideration, they have likewise prevailed so far as to see
some Priests, and some Votaries who have admitted of the aforesaid
Oath, and who straying still further out of the way, have gon about
to maintain, that it is not repugnant to the Catholick Faith. But
there are but very few who have yet yeilded to the Oath, and those
also of the less Zealous, and who are least esteemed of for their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and goodness. All the rest of the Clergy have shewed, and still
do shew themselves much averse unto it, as do generally all Votaries:
and many of both sorts, with strength of Learning, and undaunted
courage, despising even death it self amidst a thousand sufferings; have
publickly confuted it, and thereby won singular praise in the
Church, and much worship amongst the Catholicks in those
parts.</p>
                  <p>Amidst these new storms, to boot with the continuance of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
doth the Catholick cause float at this present in England. The
Queen was more greedy of blood; and therefore the sufferings of
Priests and Votaries were more frequent in her days. In this
Kings time, they strive chiefly to macerate them as much as may be
with long imprisonment, and to cause the Secular Catholicks pine
more then ever by depriving them of their Estates, indeavouring thus
to work their ends by a flow and incurable disease: some are also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
against even to death it self; to the end that to their other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities;
that chiefest, even death, may not be wanting, and these
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ighest sorts of punishments which are used against Priests and Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are very horrid; their life being taken away by member and
member before death ceise upon the whole body: and notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
amidst confiscations, imprisonments, death, and so many other
miseries and sore persecutions, the Catholick Faith is still preserved,
and doth rather increase then decrease in England. And as fire is
most intence when most shut up, so the lively zeal of Catholicks
in that Kingdome is the more inflamed, and strengthened by how
much greater the obstacles have been which it hath met withall in
not being able to manifest and inlarge it self.</p>

                  <p>I Will now briefly dispatch what remains to be represented con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the State of Religion in Scotland and Ireland. The King
of Egland was born a Catholick. Queen Mary, a Princesse very
zealous in the Catholick Faith, and who shew'd her self to be so by
her constancy in induring so long imprisonment in England, and even
death at last (Queen Elizabeth causing her to be beheaded) was his
mother: the King remained an Infant in Scotland; and falling into the
Hereticks hands, he easily with his milk drunk in the poyson of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie;
and bent his most tender years under the precepts and pleasure
of those who had the charge of his childhood; amongst which in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
one George Bowhannon was his Tutor; a famous Latin Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
and a no less famous follower of Calvin: so as the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a short time, began almost to be quite supprest in that Kingdom:
and Calvins Sect, on a suden like a Torrent overran all places, all
Bishopricks were extinct, and their goods made the Crowns; and the
new Hereticall Government was reduced to the strictest and exactest
form of Calvinisme; which hath still continued and doth still continue
in Scotland; but the King out of a particular end which he hath of
reducing the Kingdoms of England and Scotland into one body; and
by this means to make his Authority greater in the Scotch Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
thinks now to restore the Bishops of Scotland to their antient
Bishopricks; which when he should have done, he would make the
Heresie of those his two Kingdoms more conformable, and by this
means so much the more facilitate the designed Union in other things
also.</p>
                  <p>And doubtlesly the Kingly power would be greater in Scotland
by the re-admission of Bishops; for then they would make a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
member in Parliament; and by the intire dependancy which they
should have upon the King, he might upon all occasions be sure of
their Votes; but this is a business which is thought will meet with
many difficulties, the Puritan Sect having taken too firm root gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
throughout the whole Kingdom of Scotland, and particularly in
the Cities, who profess, as hath been said, the rigidest Laws of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinisme.</p>
                  <p>During the Catholicks time, there were two Archbishopricks in
Scotland; the one of Saint Andrew, and the other of Glasco; and
eleven Bishopricks, eight of which were under the first Archbishoprick,
and three under the second.</p>
                  <p>As for the Catholick Religion, the condition thereof is deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
in Scotland; of the chief Lords, there are but some very few
that are Catholicks; and but few amongst the Gentry; the
greatest number whereof are of those, who are Catholicks
in wardly, but dare not declare themselves for fear of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment:
all the rest of the Kingdome are Heretiques;
onely the more rusticall People are lesse infected with Heresie;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:55461:46"/>
but also more ignorant in whatsoever concerns Religion, that fervor
was never found amongst the Scots in indeavouring that the Catholick
Faith might be preserved in Scotland, as hath been seen, and is seen in
the English, in her behalf in England; and generally the Scots are
not much given to Ecclesiasticall profession; but to say truth, they
have had but little help of accommodation therein; for except it be
some few youths who are maintained in the Scotch Seminary at
Rome, and in another of the same Nation here in Doway; no other
assistance is given to the Catholicks in Scotland for having of Priests,
whereof there are very few at this time in that Kingdom.</p>

                  <head type="sub">Of the State of Religion in Ireland.</head>
                  <p>BUt look how much the Catholick Vineyard wants workmen in
Scotland; so much the more doth Ireland abound in them. The
people of that Kingdom are generally Catholicks, and almost all of
them profess themselves such. Those rigorous Laws against Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,
which were so many years agoe establish'd by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
have not yet had place there. The Irish are by nature
strangely simple and rude, and very stif in adhering to their antient
customs: they cannot be naturally more devout, then what they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to be, towards the Holy Sea: nor by their natural instinct more
averse to the name of English: So as if they have not been able to
shun the violence by which they were also constrained to receive the
Sect which reignes in England, yet they have always retained the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Religion as far as the calamity of the times would give them
leave. That Kingdom is then generally all Catholick; only in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and most in such as are of most Traffick; some of the Inhabitants
are infected with Heresie; but yet in a very small number in respect
of the Catholicks, who in the very same places may oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Throughout the Countrey, all the people are Catholicks, though
they live in a great deal of ignorance: of the principal Noble men you
will hardly finde four that are Hereticks, and the same may be said of
the gentry in those parts. There being so many Catholicks in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and their zeal being so great towards the ancient Faith, it hath
been easie for them to preserve a great number of secular Priests and
Votaries in their Countrey, who might cultevate it: The latter of
these are almost all of them Franciscans, to whom are added some
Jesuists, and some other Votaries of Saint Dominick, and Saint
Bernards Orders.</p>
                  <p>But the Fransciscan Order hath particularly been always held
in great esteem in Ireland, and many of this Order goe now in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
places in their own habits, and keep the use of singing and Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,
and the form of an ordain'd Government: Very great like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
is the number of Secular Priests; though to say truth,
greater Hability and Learning were to be desired in many of them;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:55461:46"/>
sacred Orders having been conferred upon many in <hi>Ireland,</hi> who
were not requisitely qualified. The best are those who have been
bred up in Seminaries abroad, which are erected in divers places for
this Nation; one in <hi>Doway,</hi> one in <hi>Burdeaux</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> one in <hi>Lisbon,</hi>
in <hi>Portugal,</hi> and another in <hi>Salimanca</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are four Arch-Bishopricks in <hi>Ireland;</hi> that of <hi>Armagh,</hi> of
<hi>Dublin,</hi> of <hi>Cassels,</hi> and of <hi>Toumount;</hi> and twenty eight Bishopricks;
nine of which depend upon the first Arch-Bishoprick; four upon the
second; nine upon the third, and six upon the fourth. All these Arch-Bishopricks,
and Bishopricks, are in the Hereticks hands. Divers
Catholick Priests have notwithstanding the title of the Arch-bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks.
But unlesse it be hee of <hi>Casels,</hi> all the other titulary Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
are at this time upon sundry occasions out of <hi>Ireland;</hi> so as all the
secular ecclesiastical government in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is now in the hands of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
generall Vicars, who are partly constituted in their Archbisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks,
by the Arch-Bishops now absent, and some have had the
same charge in other Bishopricks conferred upon them directly
from the Apostolick See; and the Votaries have likewise their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors
apart.</p>
                  <p>And this may suffice for what concerns the matters of Religion
in these Catholick, and Heretical Provinces of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and in the
Kingdomes of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Here then will I end
my present Relation; humbly praying God that he will for ever
preserve the ancient Faith in these Catholick Provinces of <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and speedily restore it to the Heretical ones. That he will please to
inspire the King of <hi>England</hi> with such a sense of Religion, as many of
his Catholick Predecessors did live and die in. That particularly
he may make him therein like to his Mother Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> who is
become more glorious by her crown of Martyrdome, then by that
which she wore as Queen; That he and all his Subjects professing
thus the true religion, the due worship of God may be fully resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
amongst them, that the former honour may be restored to the
Altars; to the Church the ancient devotion; and that reverence to
the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> Supream Head of the Church, which for so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
former Ages was rendred to him in those Kingdomes.</p>

                     </gap>ur di
Faen</hi> Ambassador from hence in all their names to <hi>Denmark,</hi> to
condole with him for the death of his wife. His Majesty and
their Highnesses willingly embraced this occasion to renue their
friendship with that King, and to knit the knot of Amity the closer
between them for the future. The Embassador was entertained
by the King with extraordinary honor. He gave him the precedency
in all places, and upon all other occasions evidence how great a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
he put upon this favor conferr'd upon him by so great a King, and
by these Princes so neer allyed to him in bloud. The Embassador
returned to <hi>Brussels;</hi> and I desired him that hee would make me
a distinct Narration of that Kings particular person, of his court,
Dominions, of their Government, of the Heresie that rules there,
and of his correspondency with other Princes. And having made a
breviat thereof, I thought it a thing which might not prove disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to the interests of the Apostolick See; nor unpleasing to
our Lord the Pope, nor to your self, if I should acquaint you with
what then came to my knowledge. They may rather prove so much
the more curious and considerable, by how much they are the lesse
known or valued in these parts by reason of the far remotenesse of
the Countries.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is a Prince of a gallant aspect, of a well
proportioned stature, of a very strong complexion, and greatly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to bodily exercise. He is now thirty five years old; and by his
wife who was sister to the now Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> hath three
sons living, and some daughters that are dead. He hath but one
brother, and three sisters, who are all maried. One to the King of
<hi>England,</hi> another to the Duke of <hi>Brunswick,</hi> and another now a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
who was wife to the late Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi> As for his gifts of
Minde; they are many, and very remarkable. He is a Prince of a
great wit, quick and ready at action: So as you would hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he were born under so cold and sluggish a climat as is that of
his Territories; for the most part horridly frozen; he is esteemed to
be a warriour; and in the present war between him and the King of
<hi>Swethland,</hi> he hath alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> shewed a generous minde, and great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
to command in war. He is well read in humanity; he is a great
Master of the Latin Tongue, and delights much to speak it; and useth
very often to write in that Language to his Brother in Law the King
of <hi>England.</hi> He speaks Dutch and French well; and seems to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
Spanish and Italian; he breeds up the Prince his son likewise
in the knowledge of Languages, who is now about nine years of age,
and made him upon occasion of this Embassy, write a Letter in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin
to the young Prince of <hi>Spain,</hi> with offers of much friendship, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:55461:47"/>
in tearms of great observancy and respect. And thus much for the
kings own person, and those of his Family.</p>
               <p>The Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> hardly deserves the name of a Kings
Court. The state and gallantry of other Courts of <hi>Europe,</hi> hath not
as yet gotten into those remote parts, where their manners are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
clownish and simple; for building, housholdstuffe, number of
attendants, and court splendor, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> is rather to be
numbred amongst the petty Princes, then great Kings; and he himself
is of a very familiar nature, far from the ostentation of greatnesse. He
oft times goes from one place to another, waited on by onely one or
two servants; and behaves himself with great familiarity in private
Gentlemens houses; laying aside not onely the person of a King, but
even of a great man. Wherein he himself says he hath some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
design; as to shew his confidence in his Nobility, and to reign
with love, and not by Force in the hearts of his people.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> hath very large Dominions, their vast circuit
being considered; but of no great consideration, the greatest part of
them being almost everlastingly frozen towards the Pool, and nothing
but Woods and huge Mountains in <hi>Noraway.</hi> Besides his two Kingdoms
of <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Noraway,</hi> he is Master of other Countries, and Islands
of large circuit, which are seated so far Northernly, as in some parts
they have almost half a years day, and afterwards as much night. The
best, most inhabited, and fertillest parts of his Territories, is in his
Kingdome of <hi>Denmark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and all that which lies neerest <hi>Germany.</hi> His
Dominions abound not much in Traffick; but the Incomes are great
which he receives from those who must necessarily passe through the
Strait of <hi>Copenhaghen,</hi> which is called the <hi>Sound. Copenhaghen</hi> is the
City wherein usually he resides. Here must all such Ships stay which
Traffick in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; and the Cities that lie thereon: every
Vessel that passeth by there, pays a double rose noble English, besides
some other taxe which they pay for their Merchandize, which are
transported from place to place. He raiseth a great sum of Monies
by this Passage, which is the greatest part of his Revenue. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
receives much pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>it by the Transportation of Cattel out of his
Countries, wherein they abound very much, and produce very large
ones. Great quantity of Timber for the building of Ships, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
for Masts and Sail-yards, is likewise extracted out of his
Woods of <hi>Noraway,</hi> whereof he makes advantage; with all this his
whole Revenue is not thought to exceed one Million of Gold.</p>
               <p>The Government of the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> States, though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of a Monarchical Form, depend chiefliest upon the Optemati;
The Nobility bearing a great sway in those parts; the King can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
nothing of importancy without them; the administration of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
depends chiefly upon them; and the King must proceed with
them rather by intreaty, then command. In <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ine, the King is rather
Head then King; and the Nobles are rather Freemen then Subjects.
The common people have no share in Government; as for his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
they chiefly consist by Sea, he not having any considerable Land
Militia; and in his present war against the <hi>Swedes,</hi> the greatest part
of his Army are Foraigners; as Dutch, English, and Scots. The <hi>Danes</hi>
are ablest at Sea, that Kingdome having Islands on many parts of it;
and consequently the Inhabitants having great occasion to accustome
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:55461:48"/>
themselves to Maretin affaairs. The king entertains ordinarily between
50 and 60 great ships, all of them abundantly provided for whatsoever
belongs to Maretin Affairs, and he himself much delights in the study
of Navigation.</p>
               <p>The Heresie profest by the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> is Lutheranisme. His
Country fell into the contagion of this malady, when <hi>Germany</hi> was
first infected therewithall: and though this Heresie of <hi>Luthers</hi> begot
so many other Sects, and so various afterwards; and that that of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
in particular be so much diffused; yet never would the Kings of
<hi>Denmark</hi> change the first Sect which they embraced; in which resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the present King hath shewed himself more stedfast, then the
rest; The King of <hi>England</hi> hath often laboured to perswade him to
Calvinism; and though not in that rigid form as is taught at <hi>Geneva,</hi>
and as is practised in <hi>France</hi> and in other parts, but clad in those exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
Rites, and accompanied with that form of Government, as it is
now practised in <hi>England;</hi> yet all his endevours have still proved vain;
for the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> would never be brought to alter his first He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie;
but rather when he hath sometimes suspected that some of his
subjects have inclined to Calvinisme, he hath deprived them of all
manner of Government, and hath been very severe in keeping that
Heresie from being introduced into his Dominions.</p>
               <p>The greatest friendship and correspondency which the King of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>
holds with Forain Princes, is with the King of <hi>England,</hi> a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
communication of all weightiest Affairs passing between them.
But by how much the King of <hi>England</hi> is greater and more powerfull
then the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> so much the greater respect doth the latter
shew to the former. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> went himselfe in person
some years agoe to visist the King of <hi>England;</hi> and before and since
hath held the same observancy towards him; and hath kept a special
good Intelligence with the Queen his Sister. He kept always good
correspondency with the late Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was likewise his
Brother in Law; and doth the like now with the Duke of <hi>Brunswick.</hi>
There is not so good an understanding now as hath been formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
him and the United Provinces of <hi>Flanders;</hi> those Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
behaving themselves, as he says since the Truce, and since they
took upon them the pretended title of United Provinces, with too
much pride and arrogancy; to boot that they seemed to favour the
King of <hi>Sweden</hi> more th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n him in the abovesaid war. He likewise com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
much that the United Provinces since the Truce, have begun
to question the Imposition laid upon the passing the <hi>Zound,</hi> pretending
that their Ships ought either not to pay at all, or at least be in some
part eased therein. He seems to be a friend to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
now that both their Interests are conformable in the warre
which both of them made upon Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> who was Unckle
to the King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> Usurper to his first kingdome of <hi>Swethland.</hi> He
likewise holds good correspondency with the Emperor; endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to keep fair with the Empire, upon which, part of his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
descends towards the confines of <hi>Germany.</hi> His kindnesse is not
such with the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> whose sister he maried, as so

mentioned distastes. He hath no particular interest of Friendship nor
enmity with these Arch-Dukes, with the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the king
of <hi>France;</hi> yet the Forces of his Country assisted <hi>France</hi> against the
crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the past revolutions between those two Crowns.
And hence it is peradventure, that the Catholick king, and these
Arch-Dukes, indeavour now to gain this present king, that they
may sever him from the United Provinces upon any new occasions of
troubles that may arise here in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Dated from <hi>Brussels</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

               <head>A Short RELATION of the Hugonots in FRANCE,
sent to ROME from the Cardinal Bentevoglio, in
the time of his being Nuncio with Lewis the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
King of FRANCE, to Cardinal Burghesse,
Nephew to Pope Paul the fifth, <date>the seventh of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember
1619.</date> upon occasion of a general Assembly
made then by the Hugonots at Louden in FRANCE.</head>
               <p>THE Heresie of our times began in <hi>France,</hi> in the time of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi>
the first; it encreased, but as it were in secret under <hi>Henry</hi>
the second; broke forth in publick, and got strength in the
tender years of <hi>Francis</hi> the second; and then encreased mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and overrun the whole Kingdome in the Infancy of <hi>Charls</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th.</hi>
It did neither encrease nor decrease much in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
third. The Catholick Religion was rather endammaged then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged
upon occasion of Catholick League. And finally, <hi>Henry</hi>
the fourth, after having come to the Crown by force of Arms; weary
of war, and desirous to secure himself the better by the way of peace,
did really establish the liberty of conscience, and gave way to other
great advantages in favour of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> of that kingdome; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into
Heresie did first chiefly enter through Faction, and hath since
been maintained by Faction. Nor is it to be doubted but that under
pretence of liberty of conscience the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have introduced a sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from the State.</p>
               <p>This separation appears in two sorts: the one in what respects
matter of Religion, and the other in what directly concerns the State.
In the first the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have already formed an entire government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part:
to the tolleration whereof, through the calamity of times 'twas
requisite that divers kingly edicts should concur. In the second it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that their end is the same; which is to establish likewise a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
politick government apart, which may be as contrary to the
temporal Monarchy of kings, as the other is to the spiritual Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of the Church.</p>
               <p>Both these governments consist in the gathering together of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes:
and to speak first of that of their Churches, they have their
meetings of every particular Church apart; and of more Churches
together, then of those of an entire Province; and lastly, of as many
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:55461:49"/>
as are in the whole kingdome. The first are tearmed Consistories,
the second Colloquies, the third Provincial, and the last Nationall
Synods.</p>
               <p>The Consistories are composed of Ministers, Elders, and Deacons.
They are more or lesse in number, according as the Churches are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or lesse. The Ministers duty is to preach, and the chief Functions
of every Church are officiated by them. The Elders do superintend
in many things which respect Discipline; and the Deacons distribute
the Alms. The Consistories sit every week once, or oftner upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions;
most voices cary it in the resolving of any affairs; which are
either such as respect the profession of faith, or Ecclesiastical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
in those which concern the profession of faith, nothing can
be resolved of without the consent of the National Synod; but in
what concerns Discipline, when the Consistory cannot resolve of it
self, it adviseth with the neighbouring Churches by way of Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies,
and Provincial Synods; wherefore the Colloquies meet every
three moneths, or at least twice a year; and the Provincial Synods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
year once or twice.</p>
               <p>The Colloquies are composed of four, six, or more Churches; and
Provincial Synods are likewise proportionably formed of divers Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies.
Thus then are Affairs managed; from Consistories to
Colloquies; from Colloquies to Provincial Synods, and finally,
from Provincial to National Synods; which meet usually once eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
two years: one Minister, and one Elder go usually from Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories
to Colloquies; and the like number of the Churches of each
Colloquy, to Provincial Synods: but from a whole Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
but two or three Ministers, and as many Elders are sent to the
National Synod: to the end that the number be not too great of those
that must intervene therein.</p>
               <p>In every Colloquy a Minister doth preside or sits in the Chair, whose
part it is to propound the businesse; and it is so ordered as that some
times one church, sometimes another doth precede; which is not done
onely in Colloquies, but also in Provincial and National Synods; that
equality may be observed; which is the point chiefly driven at in all
Affairs. In Consistories, voices are counted according to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
but in Colloquies, and Provincial and National Synods, the
voices are counted according to the number of churches, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the persons; for whether they be more or lesse that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
one church, they all make but one voice of that church in Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Synods, the convocation depends sometimes upon one, sometimes
upon another Province. And they are called sometimes in one, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in another Province; according to the conjuncture of times,
and the occasion of affairs.</p>
               <p>In dividing the Provinces of the kingdome, the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have not
observed the usual order of dividing them; but have made many of
one; and one of many; according as the kingdome is more or lesse
corrupted with Heresie in the several parts thereof. The most infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Provinces lie beyond the River of <hi>Loire,</hi> which divides <hi>France</hi> as
it were through the middle; and of those more particularly, <hi>Poictou,</hi>
Saint <hi>Onge, Guien, Languedock,</hi> and <hi>Dolfeny;</hi> at this time then <hi>France</hi>
is divided by the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> into sixteen Provinces; and according to
this number are Deputies sent to the Nationall Synods, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:55461:49"/>
onely of Ministers; and to the General Politick Assemblies,
which consist of three sorts of persons, as shall be more particularly
shewed elsewhere.</p>
               <p>The Provinces which are divided by them in Form aforesaid are
these; The Isle of <hi>France, Burgony, Normandy, Britanny, Anjou, Berry,
Poictou,</hi> Saint <hi>Onge, Rochel,</hi> the lower <hi>Guyen,</hi> the upper <hi>Languedock,</hi>
with the upper <hi>Guyen,</hi> the lower <hi>Languedock,</hi> the <hi>Sevene,</hi> and the <hi>Viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rese,</hi>
(which are likewise two parts, in <hi>Languedock) Dolpheny,</hi> and
<hi>Province.</hi> In which division you see that four Provinces are made out
of <hi>Languedock,</hi> out of <hi>Guien</hi> one and an half; and <hi>Rochel</hi> which is but
one onely city, goes for a whole Province. Yet this is onely observed
in the General Politick Assemblies; for in the National Synods <hi>Rochel</hi>
is numbred only for one single church. The countrey of <hi>Bearn</hi> is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
joyned in Union with the aforesaid Provinces, but with certain
particular advantages; the Kings Edicts in favour of the Catholick
Religion, and the restitution of Ecclesiastical goods, not having yet
been admitted of there.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Hugonots</hi> churches in the aforesaid Provinces may amount to
about seven hundred; and accounting one church with another, you
may allow two Ministers to every church. <hi>Calvins</hi> Doctrine is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
in all of them; and to shun the multiplicity and confusion of
sects, Calvinisme is the onely Sect which is permitted in <hi>France.</hi> And
as for the number of <hi>Hugonots,</hi> estimation is made that of fifteen Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
of Inhabitants which are in <hi>France,</hi> there is one Million and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Hugonots.</hi> And thus much for what belongs to the Government
of <hi>Hugonots</hi> in matter of Religion.</p>
               <p>As for the other point of the separation of Government in things
which respect the State; 'tis clearly seen that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> conspire to
make a popular Common-wealth Government, which may be direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
opposite to Monarchy. At first they had certain places of safety
granted them to free them from suspition of having any violence u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
towards them in matter of Religion. They were likewise suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Summon once in three year a Generall Political Assembly to
name some Deputies, two of which were to reside constantly at the
Court, to manage the affairs of their whole Body; and to endeavor
the execution of the Regall edicts, according to the tenure thereof.
But abusing still more and more their soveraigns clemency and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
they have so altered the face of affairs, as their first palliated
pretences of liberty of conscience, is now seen to be by them turned
into designs of absolute liberty of Government; and all matters of
Religion, into apparent practises of Faction.</p>
               <p>This hath been more evidently seen since the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth; Father to the now King. For in this Kings minority, the
<hi>Hugonots</hi> making use of so favourable a conjuncture, have of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
introduced <hi>Cerutes</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> according to the custome of the
Germane Liberty. They have made their Councels in every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,
permanent and settled, according to the use of the United
Provinces of <hi>Flandsrs.</hi> And finally, they have begun to call by their
own authority, and oftner then at first, their general Political Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.
In all which things it is evidently seen that their end is to form a
particular assembly of Deputies of their whole Body, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>^ may likewise
be firm &amp; stable, and w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>^ may continually represent the same body in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:55461:50"/>
Union and Soveraignty, which would be a meer instituting of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
Councel like to that of the States General of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of <hi>Flanders;</hi> by which Councel the Soveraignty of their Union
is still represented and kept alive.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Hugonots</hi> Political Government consists then in the assembling
of multitudes together, as doth the government of their Churches in
manner afore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aid. In every Province they have a Councel composed
of three sorts of persons: Gentlemen, Ministers, and people of
a third condition; and this Councel is changed every three years:
In this Councel their politick Affaires as they happen from time to
time, are handled; and in this Assembly the Gentry precedes the
Ministers; as on the contrary, Ministers precede the Gentry in
Ecclesiasticall Assemblies; when it may so fall out that any of the
Nobility may Intervene there out of some requisite occasion.</p>
               <p>But if the businesse be of great Importance, so as it can receive no
resolution from any one Province, the Province interessed hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
unto the Circuit, and assembles the neighbouring Provinces
which belong to that Circuit; and if the Importancy be such as that
circuit cannot resolve it, they call another Circuit into their aid, and
so another till they come to the generall Convocation of the whole
Assembly, when the businesse is of such consequence as that it is to be
handled and resolved on by the Interposition and Authority of the
whole body of the <hi>Hugenots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are but three Circuits; every of which comprehends under
it a certain number of Provinces; and the <hi>Hugonots</hi> have introduced
these Circuits, that they may the sooner assemble now one part, now
another of the Provinces according to their need, and yet so much
the sooner if the General Assembly be requisite. As was particularly
seen this year in the businesse of <hi>Bearn;</hi> upon occasion whereof the
<hi>Hugenots</hi> went first from Circuit to Circuit, and afterwards assembled
together twice in a Generall Assembly; first, at <hi>Ortes,</hi> in the same
Country of <hi>Bearn,</hi> and the second time at <hi>Rochel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the calling together, and keeping of their Politicall Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
they observe the same order as they do in their Ecclesiasticall
meetings, as well in constituting a President, as in the plurality of
voices, and in keeping an exact equality; so as no one Province can
have any Prerogative over another. When the time of the General
Assembly is come, whether it be called by the kings permission, or by
the <hi>Hugonots</hi> themselves; in the Councels of each Province the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Affairs of that Province are first discust. Then each of them
send their Deputies (of the three above said Orders) to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Assembly; where with common Authority of the whole body,
such resolves are made as are requisite, as well in respect of every
Province, as of their whole Body.</p>
               <p>But in the former Assemblies, wherein due form was observed,
the <hi>Hugonots</hi> did onely, as they were permitted, choose their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
for three years, till the time of the new Generall Assembly.</p>
               <p>To this purpose they chose sixe persons, out of which the
king chose two: and this Deputation being made, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
in a few days agreed upon which they were to make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the king, they quickly were dispatcht, and ended the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:55461:50"/>
Now of late they seem to pretend to name only two deputies, at least
not to consent to any save two such as they like best, to the end that
the King may be as it were excluded from having any share in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations:
they wil have no time prefixt them to make their demands,
neither will they depart, or end their Assembly, till they have answer,
and be satisfied in their demands: and hence it is, that the Hugonots
not thinking themselves secure by reason of these their contumati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
proceedings, in the place where the Assembly had wont to meet,
(for the place was likewise to be chosen by the King) they have of
themselves and their own free will removed it to some other place,
where they thought they might be with more safety, and finally when
they could do no more, they have brought it to Rochell, which is
their new imagined Cartharge of France; where they hope or rather
dream to found with a formidable power both by land and sea, their
already design'd future Commonwealth; but which is now indeed
their chief Sanctuary, where they plot a thousand mischiefs every
day against the King and Church, and least fear to be punished.</p>
               <p>The General Politicall Assemblies are permitted by the King to the
Hugonots, from three years to three, when they are had as they
ought to be and to the aforesaid ends: it seems now consequently that
they are tacitly permitted to assemble themselves firt together in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Province, that each of them may send their Deputies to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Assembly: all the rest exceeds the Kings permission, nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Orders and express Authority of the King. They have a
great many Towns in divers parts of the Kingdom, which from time
to time upon certain limitatious, the King hath given into their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,
to seucure them the more from any violence that may be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
them in matter of Religion, which are therefore called places
of safety; to these others have since been added, which are called
matremoniall Towns, as married after a manner to the former, and
depending upon their Garrisons; no Garrisons being assigned to these
martimoniall Towns. On this side the Loire the Hugonots have but
very few Towns; but on the other side they have great store, with
greater or lesser Garisons, according to the quality of the Towns, and
persons who command therein; they receive moneys from the King
to pay the said Garisons, which may amount to 60000 pound sterling
a year: though all these Towns of security in time of peace, have
either no Garisons at all, or but very weak ones; the Governors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
turning then their pay into their particular purses: they likewise
receive 20000 pound sterling a year by name of an aid, to maintain
their Ministers; but but little of this falls to the Ministers share, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
usually laid out in other expences, which regard the Hugonots
pollitick ends; they themselves bearing the greatest burthen in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of their Ministers, by publick contributions, of what may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
to that purpose: and to boot with these common sums given to
the whole body of the Hugonots, the Kings gives about 30000 pound
in severall pensions amongst them.</p>
               <p>The King hath the naming of all the Governors of all their places
of security; but they must be Hugonots: Rochell is not notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any of their Towns of security, nor is there any Governor
placed there by the King: Rochell hath a particular Government
by it self, after the manner almost of a Free Commonwealth; so as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:55461:51"/>
it h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rdly acknowledgeth any Regall authority: and that it may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it less, and so grow to greater liberty, it joyn'd at first, and
still continues to do so more and more with the Hugonot Faction. But
though Rochell be none of their Towns of security, yet is it one of
the Hugonots chiest strengths; so strong is the scituation of it both by
Sea and land; so strong both by Art and Nature, and so aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
furnished with all things needfull to make a powerfull and long
defence.</p>
               <p>By the way of Rochell they keep continuall correspondency with
England; by the way of Sedan, a strong Town belonging to the Duke
of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ullion; they keep the like with Germany, and the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
of Flanders; and they will now keep better correspondency
with the Prince of Orange, he having of late succeeded his brother
in that Principality, who was a Catholick; but their closest intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
is in Geneva; by means of which City they likewise hold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
with the Heretick Cantons of the Switzers; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
with that of Bearn, which is the strongest, and lies nearest to
Geneva. For what remains, their Towns of security are more for
noise then strength, being all of them almost but of small considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
so as few of them in time of War would be able to maintain a
siege: In time of trouble they raise their best soldiers from the
mountainous parts of Sevene in Languedock; and gather moneys now
by way of contribution amongst themselves, by reprisals of the Kings
Revenues, and by all other means which use to make way to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders
and confusion of Civill War. Their peremptoriness and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
plottings makes them strong: But above all things they make
advantage of the discords and commotions which often arise amongst
the Catholicks in France, never losing any oportunity which makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Crown, either of receiving the turbulent Catholicks into
their Faction, or in joyning with them.</p>
               <p>The chiefest amongst the Hugonots at this time are the Dukes of
Bullion, Roan, Tremoullie, and Seugh; the Marshall Diguieres, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
de Schatillion, and Monsieur de la Force; Roan is Governor of
Poictou; Diguieres the Kings Lieutenant in Dolpheny, but with such
Authority as he may rather be called Prince of that Province, then
the Kings Lieutenant; La Force is Governor of the Countrey of
Bearn; and the rest though they have no particular Government of
Provinces, are yet highly esteem'd of out of many other considerations.
Bullion and Diguiers, for their age, experience and valour, are men
highly valued; yet Bullion is held to be false, and one not to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ted
in; whereas Diguieres hath always had the repute of generous and
faithfull. There are continually jealousies between these great ones;
and ambition bears them often to designes wherewith the rest are not
well pleased; so as the rest of the Hugonots do not confide much in
them: but these jealousies are particularly fomented by the Ministers,
as well in the great ones against the people, as in the people against
the great on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, to make their own Ministeriall Faction the greater.
And this may serve for the second point.</p>
               <p>It may then be granted by what hath been said, that Heresie hath
introduced in France a separation of State; and that the Hugonot
Faction aspires directly to the Government of a Commonwealth,
and designes to compass it by the ruine of the Church and Monarchy;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:55461:51"/>
but God at last confounds the wicked, and his right hand always
fights and overcomes in the behalf of the righteous: so as it is not to
be doubted but that the Church and Monarchy will be preserved,
and the Hugonot Faction consequently extinguished: nay it is to be
hoped, that the present King by Divine Providence is preserved (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as his father hath foretold to many) to this triumph. Digui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres
is decrepid; Bullion old and infirm; the other great ones are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
at ods between themselves: that mad fervour of conscience so
radicated at first in the Hugonots, growes every day less and less in
them; and unless it be among the meaner sort of people, who are
most deceived, the sence of Religion appears already to be wholly
turned to Faction in almost all the rest; which Faction may be said to
be divided into three parts, rather then to but one: the Nobility
makes one, the People another, and the Ministers a third; and who
shall well consider them, will finde that the Hugonots strength never
had; nor never is like to have any strong foundation within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
out of which reasons it may be judged that these Hydraes
heads of Impiety, and Rebellion, will at last be cut off; and that this
present King to the great honour of his name, and to the Immortall
glory of God, is he who is to be the queller of this Monster. On
the contrary, the King is in the prime flowre of his age; and is alrea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy
known to be a great lover of Piety and Justice; yea that beyond
the expectation of his age, his chief aim is to succeed his predecessor
Saint Lewis, as well in worth as in name. The Princes of the blood
and all the other Princes are now Catholicks; as are also almost all
the other chiefest Lords: the Parliaments are Catholick; the Cities
and chiefest Towns Catholick; and the Ecclesiasticall Order growes
every day better in manners, learning and discipline: and lastly it is
to believed that France after so many ages of an United Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will never consent to the authority of any other then that of the
antient Catholick Church, and to that of her antient and Soveraign
Monarchy.</p>

               <p>THE Treaty of the Truce of Flanders made of late between
Philip the third King of Spain; together with the Arch-Dukes,
Albertus and Isabella, and the States General of
the United Provinces of these Countreys, may doubtlesly be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
amongst the most memorable, affairs of our time. If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:55461:52"/>
the time therein imploy'd, it was above two years; if the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
who intervened therein, all the chiefest of Europe had therein
their share; if the difficulties which were to be overcome, there were
never any greater met withall in any negotiation: and lastly, if we
will consider the effects which insued thereupon, nothing could be of
more importance to the publick affairs of Christendom, then the 12
years cessation of those arms, which had so long troubled almost
whole Europe with the bitter Wars of Flanders: It was my fortune
to be present at so important an affair, at the beginning of my Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioship,
the indeavours therein were already begun when I came to
Brussels; and some notice was likewise taken thereof at Rome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I parted from that Court; wherefore I received strict Orders
from the Pope both by word of mouth, and instructions, that I should
watch very narrowly over whatsoever should insue upon so weighty
occurrances, and particularly over such occasions as might arise upon
such a conjuncture, of any ways bettering the state of the Catholick
Religion in the United Provinces. Thus my Princes commands,
the Duty of my imployment, and the very business it self which had
drawn upon it the eyes of all Europe, made me the more dilligent in
observing what had already been done therein. I came to Flanders,
(as I have said) at their commencing, when the overture had been
made by a suspension of Arms for some months: and indeavouring to
be as well informed as I could; I took short notes of what discourses
past therein between my self, and Embassadors of forein Princes, and
the other chief Officers of the Court of Flanders; I found that (ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the narrative a little higher) that the beginning and progress
thereof till my arrival was thus.</p>
               <p>Marquiss <hi>Spinola</hi> having the Command of the Catholick Army gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
him, after the taking of Ostend; the Spaniards labour'd very
much to get into the heart of the Enemies Countrey. Their designes
were to get some safe pass over the Rheine; and when they should
have got footing on the other side, to indeavour afterwards to pass o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Isell, and to carry the War into the very heart of Holland.
To this end <hi>Spinola</hi> after having raised the Forts over the Rheine at
Rurort, and possest himself of that passage in the former of the two
fields before the Truce; had then advanced farther towards the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
of Friesland, and taken Linghen a strong hold, and Oldensell, a
town near Linghen; and in the last field had divided his Army into two
parts; had again incamped himself with one of them beyond the Rhein,
using all his might to pass the Isell, and betake himself to the taking in
of some important place; and that the Count <hi>Buquoy</hi> had indeavoured
with the other part to pass over the Vahall, and to take Niminghen, a
town which commanded that river a great way; but the climat of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
being naturally moyst and rainy, the summer that year did so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound
in continuall showrs, as by reason of the overflowing of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
it was impossible either for <hi>Spinola</hi> to pass over the Isell, or <hi>Buquoy</hi>
the Vahall, and the enemy had so fortified the banks on their side, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ether
with all those Frontiers, as though the heavens had not fought
for them, their own forces, and fortifications would have much impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the ends which the Spaniards had propounded unto themselvs; <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi>
despairing to compass his forenamed designes; after having
taken Groll, a very considerable place; and having made <hi>Buquoy</hi> joyn
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:55461:52"/>
with him had besieged and taken Renberg; and thus by means of this
place, which is of great importance, had made himself master of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
passage over the Rhein, much better then that which he had first
got. These were the Spaniards conditions and designes; and these were
<hi>Spinolas</hi> undertakings in the two last fields wherin he govern'd; and
doubtless the events thereof would have bin of great moment, though
very far short of the conceiv'd hopes: for respect being had to the so
great preparations, the enemys fear would have bin greater then the
blow it self would have bin unto them: and in Spain it was thought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to continue such an excessive provision of moneys as was that
which was disburst, which was 300000 crowns a month; though double
that expence was not since able to hinder the Army from mutinying
when the siege of Renberg was hardly ended, a thing whereat <hi>Spinola</hi>
was much afflicted; and which made him the more take those things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
consideration, which som of the gravest and best experienc'd Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors
or officers had already oft times done both in Spain &amp; Flanders,
touching the difficulties and dangers which the war of Flanders carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with it; and the undertaking to subdue the enemy by force of
Arms. They discoursed thus amongst themselves. <q>That all the good
they had reaped by 40 years war was, their having made the enemy the
more strong; more resolute to defend their usurpt liberty; more firm
in the union which they had establish'd amongst themselves; and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
united to the forein Princes who sided with them: That Nature's
self might be said to have fought always for them, by their bulwarks
of sea and rivers, and their strong scituations in all others parts; and
that where nature was wanting, there industry together with their so
many wel munited places did make amends: that their power by land
was very great in all things else; and their power at sea so great, as that
the crown of Spain had bin much indamag'd thereby, even in the East
Indies, and was in danger of being yet a greater sufferer by them in
the West Indies also: what a mass of strength (on the other side) and
mony must it cost the K. to maintain the war of Flanders; that doubtles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his Empire was very large, but much disunited; Flanders, the most
disunited member of the whole body of his dominions both by sea and
land; that the sea was block'd up by the enemies ships; that their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
by land did depend upon many Princes, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> always caus'd great
difficulties in their sending of aid, and destroy'd their men more by
their marches then by their bick'rings: then, how many corruptions &amp;
disorders had bin rooted in their army? and how could they be reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
during the war, they being the effects which so long a war had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably
produced? that insted of obedience, strife reign'd amongst the
nations; that there were now more wives then soldiers, more mutinys
then years; that their own forces were almost as dangerous to them as
those of their enemys: and mutenies gowing so familiar, now of one,
now of another nation, &amp; oft times of many nations at once, what a sad
day wo'd that be, when the whole army should mutiny together? a day
which would bring the K. affairs in Flanders to their utmost danger, as
also the caus of the catholick religion; for the defence wherof the war
at first was chiefly made, and hath been so long maintained by the
Spanish side. If then by so many reasons and so long experience,
war against the enemy were to be esteem'd so fruitless, is it not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
(said they) to come to some fair agreement with them? is it not
better to order our Army anew, and in the mean time to get strength,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:55461:53"/>
and laying down arms, except what with time would make most to
the Spanish advantage? Arms being laid down, the King of France
already grown old, might in this interim die, and with him that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
might chance to cease, which was subministred to the enemy
by a Prince of such power and repute: that after his death the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of France might peradventure change face, their King being so
young: the like might be expected in the affairs of England, their
King being a new King, and a Scotch man; but ill look'd on by that
Kingdom; the enemy having likewise received considerable succors
from Scotland: and in case any of these things should happen, how
much would the affairs of Spain be bettered? but above all it was to
be hoped that even peace it self might turn to a secret war against
the enemy: that the fear of the Spanish Forces was the bond which
fastened their Union closest; so as this fear ceasing through the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of quiet, some domestick evil might arise amongst them,
which might break the Union; and some oportunity in favour of
the King and Arch-Dukes, of regaining some of the rebellious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
by under-hand dealing, and of subjugating the others after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
by force.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These reasons were doubtlesly very weighty, and of great conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and had been oft times argued in Spain; whereupon the King
had at last resolv'd that if he could not effect his ends by arms, all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
means should be used to come by some convenient Treaty of
agreement with the enemy in Flanders: and the affairs of Flanders
may be said to depend totally upon the King: For the marriage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Arch-Duke and the Kings sister, proving barren, and the
Provinces of Flanders being consequently to return unto the King
again, he had therefore chiefly maintained the war with his Forces,
and consequently all Treaties of agreement were chiefly to depend
upon his authority. The Arch-Duke inclin'd likewise very much to
bring things to some accommodation; he being a Prince naturally gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
to love his quiet, and full of years and experience, might compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
better then any other the dangerous consequences which the war
of Flanders brought with it: but it was very hard to find out a way how
to treat of accommodation. A while since the enemy seem'd to be quite
averse unto any such treaty; and stil swelling with prosperity &amp; succes,
they resolv'd never to listen to any whatsoever treaty, till such time as
the K. and Archdukes should first publickly declare that they treated
with them as with free Provinces and States, unto the which the K. nor
Archdukes made no claim or pretence whatsoever: wherein the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
found great repugnancy in himself, and foresaw the like in the
King. He thought that to declare those now to be a free people, against
<q>whom they had fought as against rebels, would be to confess that their
former war had bin unjust; and that to seem so willing now to put an
end unto it, would be likewise a declaring that they were no longer
able to maintain it; what honor should they lose herein? how could
they with credit treat of peace or truce with their own rebels; and how
dangerous a president would it be, to make liberty the reward of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion?
for such an example in favour of those Provinces which had
rebelled, would be an invitation to such as kept yet their obedience,
to do the like.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This preparation of the affairs of Flanders was in the beginning of the
year 1607. Father <hi>Iohn Neyen</hi> a Franciscan Fryer, was then at Brussels;
he was born at Antwerp, and after having tane upon him that religious
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:55461:53"/>
he had staid a while in Spain, to pass the course of his studies there, and
by that reason was well acquainted with the affairs of that Court. He
return'd from thence to Flanders, and being become Commissary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of his Order in those parts, he kept very much at Brussels: He
was very religious, of an eloquent tongue, very well fitted to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of his Country, and therefore as well acceptable in privat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
as in the Pulpit; and much vers'd in the negotiations of the
age. The Commissary had some acquaintance in Holland; and by
chance a Holland Merchant who was a friend of his was then in Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels:
This Merchant was very inward with divers of the chiefest that
sate at the Helm in the United Provinces: The Arch-Duke being at
privat Councell with <hi>Spinola</hi> and some others of the Kings Officers in
Flanders, 'twas thought expedient that the Commissary should di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose
the Merchant to go to the Hague in Holland to indeavour some
new Overture of Treaty. The Merchant went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he found no eare
would be given thereunto, till the abovesaid Declaration of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
free States were granted, and that this should precede all other
things. The Arch-Duke was sencible of the aforesaid repugnancies
in condescending thereunto; yet all the former considerations being
again weighed, it was at last judged, that it was best to yeild to the
present necessity, and that all means should be used to procure a ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
of Arms, and to enter into a Treaty of accommodation.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If the Treaty should have good success, the success would suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
applaud the Treaty; if it should not succeed well, but that
they must be forced to continue the war; the making of such a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball
Declaration would not import much: 'Twas added, that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that they treated with the United Provinces, as with free States
unto which the King and Arch-Dukes laid no pretension, was always
to be understood by way of supposition, to wit; as if they were free,
not signifying a true and legitimate liberty; which they by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
could never justly come by, nor justly injoy: which being
so manifest, neither did the King nor the Arch-Dukes lose any right
which they formerly had to the United Provinces, though they
should make a Declaration thus limited.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sudden advertisement was sent to Spain of what had been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by the Merchants means; and all things were again represented
unto the King, which were thought likelyest to induce him to give
way, that some treaty of agreement might be had with the United
Provinces, in such manner as hath been said. The reasons which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
in Flanders, did so likewise in Spain, in perswading the King to
give way to the Treaty which was desired. Whereupon the Arch-Duke
resolved to send the Commissary Generall in person, into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
to indeavour once more some fairer way of commencing a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and to yeild at last, if there were no remedy, to what the United
Provinces pretended unto. The Commissary took his journey about
the end of February; and being come to the Hague, he soon percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
there was no hopes of ever being heard in any thing whatsoever,
unless the abovesaid Declaration should precede: whereupon being
admitted into the Councel of the States General, which is the supream
magistracy by which the whole body of those Provinces is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
he open'd himself thus unto them.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus,</hi> and the Arch-Dutches the Infanta
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:55461:54"/>
his wife, had always desired to see the Lowcountrys once free from
Civil wars; that so many and so bitter calamities of war, might be
turned to the enjoyment of a happy Peace. That Peace was the
end of War; which not being to be had but by the way of Treaty;
they did consent on their side that the Declaration of Liberty which
they knew the United Provinces do pretend unto should precede;
that it became all good Princes to indeavour all means whereby to
cause quiet unto their people, and that to justifie this their so just and
religious end to the world, they had willingly descended now to an
overture of treaty; and to second the success thereof would be as
willing to do any thing that might tend to the good of the weal-publick.</q>
This Proposition being wel discust in the Councel of the States
General, they thought that whatsoever could be desired, made then
for the advantage of the Low-Countreys; whereupon they resolved to
accept of the offer: and before the Commissary departed, a suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Arms for eight months was agreed upon, which was to begin the
next May; and it was likewise concluded that the Treaty should begin
the next September. The Commissary went from Holland with this
answer. Not long after the Arch-Dukes declared by a particular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
or Proclamation, that they came to suspension of Arms with the
United Provinces, as with Free Provinces and States, unto which they
did not lay any pretence; the States Generall did also the like on
their side: the Commissary did likewise promise that the King of
Spain should by the Arch-Dukes procurement ratifie the same with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
three months: and he did likewise desire in the names of the Arch-Dukes,
that the States would inhibit all hostility by sea, promising
that the Arch-Dukes would oblige themselves that the King of Spain
should do the same: to the which the States after some difficulties
condescended: all this was afterwards published by the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
to their people with great demonstrations of joy; and they gave
an account thereof to their confederate Princes; but more particularly
to the King of France and King of England; from both of which,
Embassadors were forthwith sent to congratulate with them. The
affairs of Flanders were at this pass when I came to Brussels, which
was on Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> his eve, 1607. it cannot be exprest how all men
on all sides did rejoyce, in expectation of what the event would prove.
Soon after my coming to Brussels the Kings ratification came; to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the which, as also to give a more particular account of what had
past, the Arch-Duke had dispatch'd away Commissary <hi>Neyen:</hi> The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
came in general terms; and so pen'd, as it was to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the United Provinces would not allow of it: yet <hi>Lewis Verreychen,</hi>
chief Secretary of State to the Arch-Dukes was suddenly sent with
it into Holland. The United Provinces shew'd strange arrogancy in
these Negotiations; and particularly a great suspition of being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach'd
by the Spaniards; whence it was to be believ'd that they would
interpret all that should come from that side in the worst sence.</p>
               <p>You have heard what the number and Government of the United
Provinces are, and how they are seated. How Holland and Zealand are
seated in the bosome of the sea, and the other five lye more inwards
into the land; these therefore did more willingly give way unto the
Treaty at the first, and did afterwards appear more inclin'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
it. The principall and Fundamental Law of their Union is,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:55461:54"/>
That in resolutions apertaining to the common interest, the Votes
of all of them must equally agree; so as their businesses proceed but
slowly; they being to be treated of apart in every several Province,
and alike uniform consent to be gathered from them all by long and
tedious perswasions, as their liberty is in all of them alike; The kings
ratification being then sundry times consulted on, and with great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
these difficulties were objected by the United Provinces. That
the Ratification came in general tearms; that it did not contain the
essential clause touching their liberty; but that the King still styled
the Arch-Dukes Princes of the Low Countries; that the King writ
himself, I the King, as he used to do to his own Vassals; that it was
written in ordinary Paper, and not in Parchment; as is usually done
in things of great importance: and finally, that it was sealed with a
little seal, and not with a great one; as it ought to have been. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reychin</hi>
being afterwards sent for in, these difficulties were propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him and exaggerated rather in an insolent then free manner:
and it was at last concluded, that the United Provinces would by no
means accept of the Ratification in manner as it was by him presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <p>The common peoples madnesse is always very great, but more
when they are smiled upon by Fortune. They are full of arrogancy,
and rashnesse, in time of Prosperity; and as base and abject in Ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>versity:
So as a multitude must either not be treated with at all, or
these alternate defects must be patiently born withall. <hi>Verreychin</hi> used
therefore such dissimulation as was requisite; and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
their suspicions. He assured them that such a ratification would
not have been sent from <hi>Spain,</hi> did not the King intend to make it
good; that his intentions were excellent, and that he did vie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
with the Arch-Dukes; he prayed them to allow time for another to
come; that he did again promise in the name of the Arch-Dukes to
cause another ratification be sent in the same form as was by them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired.
The resolution put on in <hi>Holland</hi> was; that the Arch-Dukes
should procure a new ratification to bee sent from <hi>Spain</hi> within sixe
weeks, which should contain word for word the same Declaration of
Freedome, which the Arch-Dukes had made in their Instrument; that
it should be written in Latine, French, or Dutch, and should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
by the King, with his own name; and to the end that no more
errors might be run into, the form thereof was given to <hi>Verreychin</hi> in
all the three Languages.</p>
               <p>Father <hi>Neyen</hi> was this mean while returned from the Court; hee
acquainted them how hard it was to procure the King to send the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ratification, though in general tearms; yet he affirmed that he
did verily hope that a second would come in particular tearms. The
<hi>Spaniards</hi> knowing what necessity there was to commence a treaty thus
with the United Provinces; since no other way would be admitted
of. The Arch-Dukes did again signifie this necessity; so as not long
after the second ratification came from <hi>Spain,</hi> but it was so penned, as
'twas feared the United Provinces would raise new scruples in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
it; it contained the pretended declaration of liberty; and all
the other clauses that were desired. But in the conclusion this was
added by the King; that if the matters of Religion should not bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon as well as the other points, his ratification should signifie
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:55461:55"/>
nothing; and affairs should still continue in their former posture. It
was also written in <hi>Spanish,</hi> subscribed as usually, I the King; and in
all things else according to the former manner. Yet it was believed that
these last rubs would easily be removed, by the example of the Kings
having done the same in the two peaces which were lately concluded
with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and King of <hi>England.</hi> The other difficulty
touching the new added clause, was thought the greater. And that
word Religion seemed to be immaturely put in; since it might raise
jealousies in the United Provinces; as if it were already determined
in <hi>Spain</hi> to make Propositions against the liberty of their Government,
and against that Declaration which the King at the same time made in
form aforesaid. The Commissary and <hi>Verreychin</hi> were sent both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with this second ratification into <hi>Holland;</hi> who in the presenting
thereof, made large professions to the States General again, of the
great good inclinations of the King and Arch-Dukes towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
good, and how desirous they were particularly of the low coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
welfare.</p>
               <p>The States took time to give their answer; and after much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation,
their answer according to their wonted arrogance, was
thus: That the Kings ratification was not answerable to the form
which they desired; and that amongst other things the new added
clause could not be allowed of: since the King knew very well, as did
also the Arch Dukes, that the United Provinces were free Provinces,
and would always be so, though no agreement were made. That not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the States would acquaint every Province with the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and would within six weeks make their resolution known:
But with this protestation, that they intended not that by vertue of
such a ratification any thing should be propounded which might tend
to the prejudice of the freedome of their Government, in case that
the Treaty went on.</p>
               <p>This answer being given, the Commissary and <hi>Verreychin</hi> return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to <hi>Brussels.</hi> Whilst affairs were thus negotiated in <hi>Flanders,</hi> divers
interests, passions and ends were upon this occasion discovered to bee
not onely in the neighbouring Princes, but almost in all the Princes of
<hi>Europe.</hi> In <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperour <hi>Rodulphus</hi> the second, pretended
that no Treaty of agreement could be made in <hi>Flanders</hi> without his
participation and consent; taking for granted, that the low countries
did depend upon the Empire; and therefore no separation could
be made therein without his authority: Wherefore he had written
some Letters to this purpose to the Catholick King, the Arch-Duke,
and to the United Provinces.</p>
               <p>The King and Arch-Duke answered him in general tearms; as
did also the United Provinces; save onely that they added a long ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification
of their cause, and of their war against the <hi>Spaniard</hi> till the
present. Neither was there any more news heard of the Emperor in
the whole progresse of the Treaty. But <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France,</hi>
was not so negligent in the consideration of these passages. Hee had
sent Embassadors upon this occasion at the first in <hi>Holland;</hi> the truest
and most intrinsecal end whereof was, that he might have a share in
what was to be done, and specially to cause jealousie in the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
and by this means to induce them to make use of him, and to make
him Arbitrator in the differences.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:55461:55"/>
The King of <hi>France</hi> was then in his chiefest greatnesse and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
and enjoyed his kingdome in perfect peace and honour; after
having arrived thereat through many difficulties, all which he had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
with incredible constancy and valour. He considered the
Affairs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> after several manners; on one side he could have
wished that the War might continue, and that thereby the affairs of
<hi>Spain</hi> might still be impaired, even till at last they might lose whole
<hi>Flanders.</hi> On the other side he saw himself well strucken in years; his
children very young; and that in case he should fail, fresh troubles
might in a short time arise in his kingdome, which might chiefly bee
fomented by the <hi>Spanish</hi> Forces of <hi>Flanders;</hi> that the disorders of
those Forces were not so many, but that if the War should continue,
very necessity would force them to find out a remedy; nor the danger
of their losses such as might not be evaded by the power of so great a
Monarch; which made him desire to see <hi>Flanders</hi> without War, and
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without Forces so neer at hand. Neither did hee
like that the United Provinces who were already become so formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
at Sea, might by their growing too great be as dreadful at Land.
For the Hereticks of his kingdome could from no part else be better
fomented to rebel. The King amidst these various considerations had
his eye fixt upon these passages of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and because his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
was very great in the United Provinces, he believed they would
never come to any accommodation with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> without his
consent.</p>
               <p>At the first he seemed to be averse to the affairs in hand; though
to say truth, he did not well know what he had best to doe: but hee
did this of purpose to enforce the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to put the Negotiations
into his hands. Great dexterity and cunning was requisite to the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
on of these designs. He therefore chose for this so important
affair the President <hi>Iannine;</hi> a man of great experience and abilities;
and one who was then chieflyest employed by him in State affairs. He
sent Monsieur <hi>de Rosse</hi> along with <hi>Iannine</hi> (who was sen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> extraordinary
Embassador into <hi>Flanders</hi>) to continue afterwards his ordinary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador
in the United Provinces. Having both of them exercised
their Offices in the entrance into the affairs spoken of, they staid in
<hi>Holland; Iannine</hi> did diligently observe the whole carriages, and
wrought himself every day more and more into the affairs, which
still encreased the jealousie of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the ArchDukes;
who then began to see clearly, that it behoved them to have recourse
to the King of <hi>France</hi> his mediation; who already had complained to
the Commissary Generall in his return to <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and the Arch-Dukes had proceeded so far without his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in the aforesaid businesse. Almost the like passions and artifices
appeared in <hi>Iames</hi> the first, King of <hi>England,</hi> who was newly come
to that Crown. The same reasons appeared in him for desiring the
continuance of the war in Flanders, as did in the King of France: for
the King of England being strong at sea, and confiding in the strength
of all his Kingdoms scituation, as also in the conformity of his ends
with those of the United Provinces in favouring heresie, he could
not much fear their Forces; though they should grow greater. He
was the more secure likewise by having Flushing and the Ramechins
in Zealand, and the Brill in Holland, sea Towns of great Importance
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:55461:56"/>
in his hands; as pawned for monies lent by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to the
United Provinces; and for that their chiefest strength consisted in
English and Scottish soldiers, who were in their Army. He foresaw
he should have greater cause to be jealous of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if being
free from the war of <hi>Flanders,</hi> they might endeavor to molest him in
any part of his Dominions: especially in <hi>Ireland,</hi> an Island which is
almost wholly Catholick, well-affected to them, and much dis-affected
to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of these reasons it was believed, that the King of <hi>England</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the War in <hi>Flanders</hi> might continue. But being a great lover of
Quiet, and much given to Hunting, and to his Book, and wholly fix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
in warring by writings with the Church, it was therefore judged hee
would not at last, shew himself totally averse to see the affairs of
<hi>Flanders</hi> in some sort pacified. To boot that not being able for scarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Monies to give any considerable succor to the United Provinces,
his power would be but small in perswading or counselling the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of war, since he could not much assist it by his Forces. Yet
it very much Imported those Provinces to preserve his friendship,
were it onely that they might raise soldiers out of his Kingdome.
Wherefore they entertained his Embassadors which were sent into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
at the beginning of this Negotiation with very much respect, and
trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d with them with all confidency.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Englands</hi> end in sending of them was almost the same
as was that of the King of <hi>France:</hi> To wit, that he likewise would
have a share in the businesse which was in hand, and to enforce the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to make use of him likewise therein. The King of <hi>Denmark</hi>
sent likewise Embassadors to <hi>Holland;</hi> as also the Prince Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> the Lantgrave of <hi>Hesse,</hi> and other
German Heretick Princes; who all of them seemed to shew their
good affections towards the United Provinces in so important an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.
These businesses which were thus begun grew very hot in
<hi>Holland:</hi> every thing was in motion, and great was the expectation
what the United Provinces would resolve, as well touching the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ratification come from <hi>Spain,</hi> as also whether they would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
or break the Treaty. But of all others Count <hi>Mourice</hi> of <hi>Nassaws</hi>
thoughts were most busied at this time. His Father the Prince of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range</hi>
being dead, he being yet but a youth of sixteen years of age, had
got into all his Fathers Military and Civil employments, with the
great good will and approbation of the United Provinces. And encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
no lesse in valour, then in years, after so many enterprises and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperous
successes, his authority grew daily greater amongst them. He
had won it by Arms, and he thought hee could best preserve it by
Arms. And by means of the publick trouble of war, he hoped some
favourable conjuncture might the easilier be opened unto him, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
himself one day Prince of those Provinces.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted, but that his ambition carried him thus high;
for his Father was very neer attaining thereunto; and his own deserts
being added to his Fathers, his hopes ought rather to be augmented
then diminished. To boot with the Supream Government of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
he had succeeded his Father in the Civil Administration of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Zealand, Utricht,</hi> and <hi>Overisel.</hi> His brother Count <hi>Henry,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
of the Horse of the United Provincees, and the Counts <hi>William</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:55461:56"/>
and <hi>Earnestus,</hi> the one of them Governour of <hi>Friesland</hi> and <hi>Groninghe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi>
and the other Governour of <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> were all of them of his
House, and depended on him almost in all things, so as the whole go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the United Provinces, as well Military as Civil, may bee
said to be in his hands: and his Domestick power was the greater by
his great friendship and alliance with Forain Princes. The Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
in hand made nothing at all for his present condition, nor for
that which peradventure he had an intention to raise up unto himself.
And say he had a minde to have hindred it at the beginning; what
colour, or what pretence had he so to doe? Since the United
Provinces in the Proposal made by the Arch-Dukes for a Treaty, had
gotten all that they desired; when the first ratification which came
therefore from <hi>Spain,</hi> proved vain, <hi>Mourice</hi> began to hope well in the
breach of the begun Negotiation: and by occasion thereof augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the common jealousies. He inlarged himself very much and with
great fervency in calling to minde their late good successes; so
many mischiefs, cruelties, and Horrible Inhumanities committed
as he affirmed, by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> together with many other things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to make all manner of Treaties with them suspicious, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the hatred which those of the United Provinces always bore
to that Nation. And though the second ratification was come in very
ample manner, yet did not he goe lesse in continuing to do the same,
hoping to make this second appear likewise faulty in many things.
The time drew neer of giving their resolution therein; concerning
which they had had many meetings; at last, one day when the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
of the States General was fuller then usual by reason of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy
of the businesse, 'tis said Count <hi>Maurice</hi> spoke thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>How much (most worthy Deputies) I have always desired the
prosperity of our Republick, all my precedent actions which have
made mee appear no lesse my Father competitor, then his sonne,
in her service, may sufficiently manifest. I have not laboured lesse
then did my Father, in always procuring the common good; and
if hee lost his life in the publick cause; I have exposed my self to no
lesse dangers in the defence thereof; and certainly it would have
redounded much more to my honour and glory to have dyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
Arms, then it did to him to perish by the hand of that base
and detestable Paracide, who so unworthily slew him. None ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
should more rejoice then I, to hear our Provinces declared to
bee free States, even by our enemies themselves, did I not think
that all these proceedings were but couzenages, whereby more easily
to draw our Liberties again into their Subjection. I apprehended
this even from the beginning of these practises; so that, as I have
hitherto ever aborred them, so do I now abhor them more then ever,
and think it now more necessary then ever to break them wholly off,
and to throw back this second ratification with the same resoluteness
as we did the former. How many tricks, and how many cheats the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have always used in their like treaties; is too well known to
us all. But what need we look after past-times? Hath not the like been
seen, and is not seen in these present negotiations? The first rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
came in general tearms, nor did it contain any thing of ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
but the bare name. The second is come since, which is likewise
so defective, as in my opinion it ought in no way to bee accepted.
Doe you perceive how the King would have it sent in the <hi>Spanish</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:55461:57"/>
Tongue? a Tongue unknown to us, the true meaning and efficacy
whereof we doe not understand? Doe you observe how he uses the
same subscription as he useth to his Vassals? Not having changed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the other things excepted against. And the addition of the last
clause, doth it not evidently enough shew his pretensions that it
shall wholly depend upon his will whether we shall be free or no?
As if from the time that the Duke <hi>d'Alba,</hi> (that Fury and Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand
of all the troubles of <hi>Flanders</hi>) and after him the other Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
had bereft their Countrie of its priviledges, brought forain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
thereinto, put the whole country of fire and sword, and given
sentence themselves against our liberties, and we had not known how
to defend it by our unconquered Forces? We then are free whether
the King declare us to be so or no. And our pretence to this declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is, because it is due to us from all the world, and due to us by him
absolutely, without any conditional limitation of insuing agreement
as he pretends in the additional clause; so as it is now too well seen
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> treat with their wonted frauds; and that they would
pretend they can never lose by any whatsoever accord that should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
the right which they presume to have over our Provinces; that
they may afterwards expect new opportunies to oppresse them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
it may then be granted, that it is not any publick respect, but
their own particular necessity which induceth them now to come to
agreement with us. The necessity I say of their disorders, which
doubtlesly are so many and so great, as we may expect their utter lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of <hi>Flanders.</hi> What darkness, what obscurity is it then that doth pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess
our senses? or what hoodwink and untimely wisdome is it which
teacheth us to intermit and slacken the cours of our victories, whence
they are nearest and most certain? their army is in very great confusi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>on,
without any discipline, without any obedience; corrupted by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
Mutenies: And if the war continue, we shall doubtlesly see
the whole body of the Soldiery Muteny, and then their whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
will rise. How great a part thereof does there already abound
in our sense? We on the other side have a flourishing Army, well
disciplin'd, well paid, and well provided of all things. We have the
assistance of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and of the greatest part of <hi>Germany.</hi>
We maintain a Cause, then which none can bee more just; nor can
there be more constancy be desired in our Peoples wills to defend it:
To these our advantages by Land, our other progresses at Sea doe
fully correspond What greater blow could the <hi>Spaniards</hi> receive from
us, then that which we have given them in the East-Indies? What wil
the other prove which wee are preparing for them likewise in the
West? To this end, to boot with the publick forces, particular Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the richest Merchants of all our Provinces are appointed: so as
when we shal get footing there, to what straits and hazards shal we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
the Spanish Fleet? On the contrary side, how much both publick
and private advantages, how much honor and glory shall our Comon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
receive thereby? Our having gon round the Sea where ever
the Sun shines, with so many and so illustrious navigations, and having
made our names so famous by so many and so glorious Victories, will
be the most memorable things spoken of by our Posterity in after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The fear of losing the <hi>Indies,</hi> is that which chiefly causes the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
to com to some accommodation with us. Who will then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
us to let slip these so propitious opportunities which now offer
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:55461:57"/>
themselves unto us, and see them turned peradventure hereafter to
their advantage? True Victory lies in the making good use thereof.
Which not being done, the too late remedy of repentance serves but
in little stead. We ought by all means possible endeavor not to fall
into such errors; and not suffer our selves to be deceived by the fals
names of repose and peace, and other specious alluring pretences.
These are the means wherewith those lull people asleep, whom they
intend afterwards to oppresse. No Lethargy is more mortal then a
Peace, which is to prove worse then war it self. Our people this
mean while will grow unsinewed by idlenesse. We shall lose those
friends which our wars have purchast to our cause. But the worst of
all evils will lie in the secret venome of discord, which the enemy
will in this interim endeavour to introduce amongst us; and this sort
of Plague will be sooner radicated amongst us them driven out. Thus
by means of rest more fatal farre then arms, our Common-wealth
would fall into the greatest misfortunes, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by their
machinations quietly enjoy what hitherto they have not been able
to doe with their Armies in the Fields. But I never was an Orator;
and as a Soldier me thinks I have spoken more then I need upon such
an occasion. Nor can I deny but that my particular passions sway mee
in what concerns the common good, which is now in hand; which
may notwithstanding all of them be reduced to the implacable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
I bear those, who are our implacable enemies; and hope to
make their power more formidable to others, by the ruine of our
Republick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Authority of so great a man assisted by so many and so forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reasons, prevailed very much with the hearers. <hi>Iohn Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt,</hi>
Advocate Generall of the Province of <hi>Holland,</hi> and one of
her Deputies in this present Councell, was one of those who did most
favour the things which were now in Treaty. His Authority was
very great not onely in <hi>Holland,</hi> but even throughout the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
in the service whereof he had ever had the chiefest employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and had therein continually faithfully discharged his trust.
So as his credit was such at this time with the Union, and his estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
so great, as he drew commonly most men to adhere to him in all
his opinions. He desired to see Count <hi>Mawrice</hi> his power lessened, to
the end that the common liberty might be the more secure both at
home and abroad: though this his emulation cost him afterwards
his life: For not many years after <hi>Mawrice</hi> his Faction prevailed so
far, as for divers faults laid to his charge, (were they true or false) he
was publickly beheaded in <hi>Holland.</hi> When <hi>Mawrice</hi> had ended his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse,
<hi>Barnevelt,</hi> still resolved to defend the contrary opinion, spoke
thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Of so many acts egregious (most worthy Deputies) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> of ever happy memory, did, and which have been since
continued by the Illustrious Count <hi>Mawrice,</hi> the worthy son of so
gallant a Father, in service of our Commonwealth, this is one of the
fruits we reap, that every one may freely speak his mind in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
for what concerns the common good; and if it were ever requisit
so to doe, the nature of the businesse in hand doth now require it. He
hath certainly shewed great gravity and wisdome in what he hath
said: But since the more weighty the affairs are, so much more
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:55461:58"/>
necessary it is to have them maturely debated, I hope it will not be
displeasing, if I alledge all those reasons to the contrary as may be
considered in so important an affair. We shall differ in our opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but not in our end; which is the like in us all, to endeavour all
the advantage and stability which we can to this our Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.
The Illustrious Count did, if I be not deceived, urge two
points chiefly. The one, that the Spaniards do not proceed with
sincerity in these negotiations; and the other, that it is meer
necessity which makes them now seek to come to some agreement
with us, that they may hereafter finde some more favourable opor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to oppress us. As for the first, I hope that none will deny,
but for what concerns the affairs now in hand, we have hitherto ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
all that we have demanded of the Arch-Dukes. 'Tis true
that afterward, the King of Spains first ratification was faulty, and as
such a one, was justly by us refused: but to speak truely, I do not
think this second such a one as ought to be rejected; the defects
whereof being well considered, do more transgress against the
circumstances, then the essence of the ratification which we
demand. The essence lies in this; that the King should acknowledg
our Provinces to be free, and that he should declare he hath no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
or claim thereunto; this, this second ratification doth fully
contain, as doth also the first Declaration made by the Arch-Dukes.
And in fine, it is the very same which we did desire, except it be in
the diversity of Language, and in some other petty things of small
importance, and in the last clause added by the King. Faults which
in my opinion cannot be held any ways essential. First, how can it
be doubted but that the true sense and meaning of the <hi>Spanish</hi> tongue
must be understood by us? Here, where the frequent commerce of
so many of our Cities with all the Principall Cities of <hi>Europe,</hi> makes
all Languages common and known? To boot that the Arch-dukes
Deputies affirm and give it under their hands that it is in the same
Language, with the same Subscription, and alike in all other things
to the ratifications of peace between the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and those
of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>England.</hi> Ought we to pretend to more then what
was then done to two so great Kings? The greater difficulty
would lye in the additionall clause, if it were not evidently known
that it were to be understood, though it were not exprest; since
how can it be denyed, but that if no agreement should bee made
both parties would continue in their former rights? To wit, the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in what is grounded upon violence; and wee in what is
grounded upon so known Justice. But say the <hi>Spaniards</hi> after some
agreement made, should pretend a Title of right over us, tell me
I pray you, wherein could our affairs be therein prejudiced? Should
they peradventure, be Judges in such a cause? In such a case re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
must be had to the Tribunal of the whole world; and each
party to the favour of their friends; or rather to the Tribunal of
Arms, where Armies pronounce sentence, and for the most part
the justice of the cause gives the victorie. It imports but little then
whether their ends be sincere or fradulent in case of agreement:
for then they cannot opporess us by their forces. We must above all
things endeavour to secure our selves from this danger, which neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily
consists in one of two remedies; either in continuing the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:55461:58"/>
out of hope that their necessity will daily grow greater; or else in
ending it by some accommodation, after which our affairs might
be better secured. And from hence I come to the second point.
I deny not but that their present disorders and necessities are great;
but I cannot think them past remedy so far, but that if the war in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the Spaniards may finde sufficient forces to do it. I for my
part finde the Monarchy of Spain to be the same thing that it hath
always been, during the whole course of this war; nay rather increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in this interim by the addition of the Kingdom of Portugall, and
of the East-Indies, which depend thereupon. I finde it to be very
strong both at land and sea: Where hath the formidableness of
their forces been better seen then here in Flanders? What other
power hath at any time maintained so long, so far distant, so hard
and so expencive a war? And shall we believe that the Spaniards
cannot still maintain it? and that they are not likey to finde a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
for their disorders in these parts; and for any hazard they may
run in the East-Indies? the very necessity of making war, will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
furnish them with means enough to continue it. So then we
are again ingaged in war; in a new and more obstinate war then the
former: and what security can we have that fortune will always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
us? we have likewise our necessities; and if they be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
great amongst the Spaniards, remember I pray you that they
have been greater amongst us: and that all humane things being
subject to alteration, and the events of war usually very uncertain;
the times may prove propitious again to them, and averse to us.
Do not we know how much our war depends upon the aids from
France and England? May not the King of France die? Is he not
already very old? may not the Kingdom afterwards alter? and shall
not we then be deprived of all succour from thence? Do not we
likewise know upon what fickle terms the affairs of England stand?
The King being a Scotch man, a stranger in that Kingdom, and therie
being many other occasions which may cause some fear of alterat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on his side? how much would the affairs of Spain be bettered
by any of these accedents? how much worse would ours be? We
ought then to be taught by all reason, and by all the rules of good
Government, not to let slip this happy conjuncture of comming to
some good agreement with the Spaniards. Fortune is flitting, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant,
disdainfull, and exceeding apt to be provoked: 'Tis now the
time to know how to lay hold of her: So as my opinion is, that by
all means we ought to accept of this ratification come from Spain,
and proceed on to some Treaty of agreement: I confess it is not
always in the power of man to enjoy the happiness of peace; but I
verily believe it is now in our power to shun the dangers of war;
which in my opinion ought by all means to be indeavoured: and
certainly we may hope for great advantages from the Spaniards by
this accommodation which they do so much desire to make with
these our Provinces in this their present necessity: As all Pylots
prefix the haven for their end, all travelers their Countrey, and
all motion rest; so all war hath peace for its end, wherein consists
mans chiefest happiness; and shall the war of Flanders be the only
thing which shall never have an end? and shall all our most advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
successes, depend always upon the so uncertain events of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:55461:59"/>
war? We shall be free from these uncertainties, and from so many
dangers which troubles bring with them, by reducing our selves at
last to a quiet condition: we shall then much better re-order the
Government of every of our particular Provinces, and of the intire
body of the Union, when we shall be in a quiet condition: This
our Commonwealth will then break forth from out the duskishness
and horror of Arms: which how wonderfull a fight will it be, and
what unacustomed praises will it produce in the Theatre of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse?
when it shall be seen how our Provinces do unite themselvs
in one body; with what sort of Laws and Magistracy they conspire
together; how unwounded the Liberties of each of them remain,
and how uninjur'd it passeth through every one of them, as through
so many veins to the entire body of their general Union. We shall
have Ambassadors sent to congratulate with us from all parts; who
will return rather envying then rejoycing at this our so great felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
We shal pay the debts we have contracted abroad: we shal ease our
selves of those we have here amongst our selves; and we shall in,
rich our treasury, by taking off so many and so grievous expences:
Our people shall then know that they are truely free, when they
shall enjoy Liberty without any contestation: and being once got
into such a condition, what need we fear to be at any time reduced
under the yoak of that proud, cruel, and Tyrannicall Spanish Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Barnevels</hi> was list'ned unto with much attention: and the reasons
alledged by him, appeared to be so weighty and wisely grounded, as
after some other consultations, it was at last resolved on by the States
General, that they would accept of the ratification: yet there was much
adoe before Zealand could be brought to joyn in this Vote, so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Authority had Count <hi>Maurice</hi> in that Province; whereof he was
not only Governor, but had a great estate there, and enjoy'd such
prerogatives, as he appear'd rather to be Prince then Governor of
that Countrey. The Arch-Dukes were then acquainted with this
the States Generals resolution, and 'twas almost in the same words
which were us'd in the answer which was first given to the Commissary
and <hi>Verreychin</hi> when they brought the ratification into Holland. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caus
the term for suspension of arms was already expir'd, it was by both
sides prorogued, and continu'd to be so from time to time in new terms,
till the end of the Treaty, which was after concluded. I thought
good to incert this in this place, to shun the tedious repetition of the
same things sundry times. Now all the eyes of Flanders were fixt
upon what Deputies the Arch-Dukes would chuse to send, according
to the first agreement, into Holland. The greatest weight of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
affairs which were agitated in Flanders lay upon the Marquiss
<hi>Spinola,</hi> Camp-master-general of the Army, and upon <hi>Manchichidor</hi> the
Spanish Secretary of War; and as for the Arch-Dukes business, <hi>Iohn
Richardotto,</hi> President of the Privie Councell, and <hi>Verreychin</hi> so oft na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
before, were chiefly trusted therewith. These four were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
for Deputies, and Father <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yen</hi> was added for a fift, as one who
had hitherto had a great hand in the business. Marquiss <hi>Spinola</hi> was
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lready got into great Authority by reason of his so many Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Trusts. He was Camp-master-general and Governor of
the Army; Administrator, or Pay-master General of the Kings mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:55461:59"/>
of the Councell of State in Spain; and through his hands all the
Kings affairs in Flanders, as hath been said, did chiefly pass: and the
Arch-Duke likewise seemed to put much confidence in him. Indeed
a States man of singular judgment and valour, of incredible vigilancie
and industry in the managing of whatsoever business either Military
or Civil; and indowed with so many other gallant parts, as he had
reason to be esteemed one of the greatest Statesmen that the Crown of
Spain hath had these many years. The Secretary <hi>Mancicidor</hi> was likewise
highly esteemed of, for his long experience in the affairs of Flanders:
for he had been Secretary of war, even from the time that the Arch-Duke
whilst he was yet Cardinall, was come to the Government of
those Provinces. In the affairs which belonged properly to the Arch-Dukes:
The President <hi>Richardetto</hi> was no less esteemed of; he had
for a long time been the man chiefly employ'd in affairs of greates im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
by the Duke of Parma, and other Governors: and the Arch-Duke,
being made Prince of the Lowcountreys, chose him particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to employ in making the last peace with France, and the like with
the King of England; so as almost all the important business of the
Countrey passed through his hands. <hi>Verreychin</hi> was likewise present
at the making of the two abovenamed Peaces, and had long before
exercised the place of first Secretary of State, and was always held a
man of great wisdom and integrity. Enough hath already been said
of the Commissary General and of his indowments. But when the
Spaniards who were in Flanders, understood who the Deputies were,
and that they were to go to the enemies own homes to treat of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them, it is not to be believed how much they storm'd, and
how much they complain'd of the Arch-Dukes in particular.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Are the affairs of Spain (said they) come to so low an ebb, that
our King must abase himself thus? hath so much time, blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
been spent against the traiterous rebels to bring things to this
end? That the affairs of Spain were now in as glorious a condition as
ever, but that there wanted fitting instruments in Flanders to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nage
them: That tthe Arch-Duke had always shewed himself to be
better at peace then at war, and that now that he saw himself not
likely to have any children, his only desire was to spend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of his days in peace and quietness: that it was impossible so great
a Monarchy should be without a war; nay it was to be desired that
it should always have an Army in the fields for its service. And what
other more fitting Theatre could there be found for the seat of its
Arms then Flanders? a place so Opulent and so much extent? and
placed in the midst of Spains chiefest enemies and maligners? that if
the war could not be always to plentifully maintained, their forces
might be lesened, and conssequently their expences: that thus the
vigour of so great a Monarchy might be preserved even to eternity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Spaniards broke forth into these complaints, and sent them
from Flanders into Spain; but to no purpose: for it was then seen, as
also during the whole Treaty, that the King and the Arch-Duke did
always jump in their opinions: And as for the Deputies going into
Holland; without all doubt it might seeme in all appearance no
ways to agree with the Kings, and Arch-Dukes dignity: but the form
of the Government of the United Provinces considered, no other
manner of negotiation could well be had; for their Deputies were
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:55461:60"/>
so many, that Commissions of bounded, and so many sendings to and
fro, as they were inforced to make orders: to receive new orders, and
new Consents from every Province, which if it had been to be done
out of their own Countrey, the Treaty would never have had an end:
and though afterwards, as you shall hear, it was concluded in Antwerp;
'twas because all things were already disgested, so as they went thither
as it may be said, to a business already concluded. The Deputies
departed about the end of January 1608; and being come into the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
Provinces, they were received by the Governors of their Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
Towns with all honour, and bravely lodged in all places. They
came to the Hague the first of February; and were met half a league
without the Town by Count <hi>Maurice</hi> of Nassaw accompanied by the
other Counts of his House, and all the chief men of those parts.</p>

               <head>The Second BOOK of the TREATY of the TRUCE
of FLANDERS.</head>
               <p>HOLLAND is the greatest, richest, and best peopled
Province of all the United seaven: nay it so far exceeds
all the rest, as it furnisheth half the moneys which are issued
out by the whole seaven Provinces. It is made by the sea, and
sundry rivers a Peninsola, it is in compassed on many sides by the sea,
cut through in many parts by rivers: many channels cut by hand
joyn with these rivers, and there by many lakes within it: so as it
may be doubted whether it consist more of land or water. Besides, it
doth so abound with shipping of all sorts, as it may likewise be questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
whether the number of moveable Habitations on water, or of
Houses fixt on land be the greater. This Province is full of Cities,
and of a great many lesser Towns. Amsterdam is its chiefest City,
and here is the greatest Traffick, not only of Holland it self, but lamost
of the whole North: of all its Towns Hague is the principall, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Village; but so large, so well peopled, and so delitious as it may
compare with many Cities. Here did the Counts of Holland former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
build a Palace for themselves to live in, which the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
do now make use of for the meeting of their Councels which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the Union. Here likewise the Councell of the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
do meet almost every day; wherein things of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
are agitated and resolved by the Deputies of the whole seaven
Provinces. The chief affairs of the whole Union are then handled
in the Hague; and here staid the Catholick Deputies to give a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the Treaty: Before they arrived, the United Provinces had
likewise chosen their Deputies; one was chosen for every Province,
and two of the best of blood amongst them, in the common name of
them all. And these were Count <hi>William</hi> of Nassaw, full Cousin Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> and Min here <hi>Bredrode:</hi> for Holland, <hi>Barnevelt</hi>
was named, and by him the business on the behalf of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
was chiefly to be agitated. At their first meeting, nothing was
done but the producing of the credential Letters on all sides: they
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:55461:60"/>
then began to discuss affairs with an intention to come to a perpetuall
peace if it were possible. The United Provinces offered one Article
in the first place, wherein they pretended, that the King of Spain and
the Arch-Dukes, should acknowledge them to be absolutely Free
States, and should at large renounce all right or claim which might be
pretended unto by them or any of their successors, to, or over those
Provinces, with an obligation not to make use of their Arms or Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
or whatsoever other appearance. This last addition appeared
too arrogant to the Catholick Deputies, who complained very much
thereof to the Embassadors of France and of England, with whom
from the beginning they had had communication in what concern'd
the Treaty: alledging,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That it was an usual thing amongst Princes, still to retain the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of States or Kingdoms, though they were lost, or but pretended
to, whereof there was examples in the greatest Kings of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
That the Catholick King, stiled himself King of Hierusalem,
and Duke of Burgony; the King of France, King of Navar; and that
the King of England did still keep the Title of King of France: That
the United Provinces would be they alone who would introduce
new Laws in the world, and not content to pass from rebellion into
liberty, would pretend, as it were by usurpation to such and so rash
advantages: in fine, that this was a cause common to all Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
wherein they were all by this one act injur'd.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The answer which the Catholick Deputies gave hereunto was,
that they had no Authority to admit of the Article in manner as was
desired: That they would acquaint the Arch-Dukes therewith, and
expect their Answer; but the Embassadors thought these their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
to be artificials, they imagined that the Catholick Deputies
meant to indeer the said renuntiation as much as they might; that they
might the easilyer induce the United Provinces to give way on their
parts in other things, in which opinion they were confirm'd by the
Answer which came from Brussels, which was, that the Arch-Dukes
would consent to the Article in the same manner as it was propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
if the United Provinces by acknowledgement of so great a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
would in lieu thereof abstain from their sailing into the Indies.
The United Provinces seem'd to be as much moved by this answer;
and their Deputies made equall complaints thereof to the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
of their confederate Kings and Princes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>What do the King of Spain and the Arch-Dukes grant (said they)
more then what the United Provinces do already possess? that what
should be granted by the King and Arch-Dukes was nothing but
winde, and a bare Title; whereas if the United Provinces should
give over their sailing to the Indies, they should deprive themselves
of the principal and most important part of their Traffick. That
they had begun and would continue that their Navigation, which by
the Laws of Nature, and right of Nations is allow'd to all men.
That some other thing might be thought upon which in this point
might give reciprocall satisfaction to both sides: But that they
should exclude themselvs from sailing into the Indies, was neither to
be thought on nor hoped for: and why ought not the spoiles of that
new world be common to all? That it was of that immence vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
as more thereof was undiscovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then discovered as yet:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:55461:61"/>
and that the right of the occupiers in those parts, differ'd only in the
better knowing how to manage what they possess.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Both parties argued this point touching the East-Indies with great
stifness and pertenacity; nor would the Catholick Deputies ever di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scede
from their first answer. At last the Deputies of the United
Provinces made three Propositions: The first, that according to the
nature of all peaces, Commerce might be free both by sea and land
to both parties. The second, that for the space of seaven years, the
United Provinces might continue their Navigation to the Indies, and
that one year before the expiration of those seaven years some new
composition might be made. The third, that upon the insuance of
peace, and due observation of all things on this side the line, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces might at their own peril continue their Navigation on
the other side. The Catholick Deputies were not pleased either with
the first or the third propositions. Not with the first, because it left
the United Provinces absolutely free to Traffick in the Indies: Not
with the third, because they saw a peace mixt with hostility was not
likely to last. They did not appear to be totally averse from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
so as they would now agree, that when those seaven years
should be ended, the United Provinces should for ever forbear from
their Navigation to the Indies. To this their Deputies would by no
means consent; this point of the Indies was much stood upon, and
the difficulties thereof inlarged by the particular Company of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in the United Provinces which Traffick into those parts. The
Company was chiefly composed of the Merchants of Amsterdam,
and of Midleburgh: and one was sent in the name of that Company
to the Hague, to shew how great the gain was which they made
by their Trafficking in the East-Indies, and how much the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof did import in other respects.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They alledged that they had already introduced commerce in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
parts of those Countreys; that many were the friendships and
confederations which they had established there; and that those seas
were already frequented by above 150 of their Vessels, and by above
8000 of their Mariners and Soldiers; that great was the gain of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
men, and the advantage no less which the publick received
thereby: that to keep so many of the baser sort of people imploy'd
who would be always troublesome, when at quiet, what was it but
to purge the Republick of so much ill blood, ready to grow corrupt?
That the Navigation of the United Provinces into the Indies had
already made Lisbon groan; that the Merchant Towns of the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueses
in those parts went to wrack; and that their ships were seen
to go and come much possest with fear and apprehension: and
were inforced to be at much greater expence then formerly, for
they had wont not to be greatly vigilant in that their Voyage,
not meeting with any contestation, save from the Seas and wind.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These and many other considerations were represented by the
Company to keep the United Provinces from consenting to the
Spaniards demands touching the Indies: So as both parties adhering
to their opinions, nothing was done therein. The Catholick Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
resolved therefore to send Father <hi>Neyen</hi> into Spain to acquaint
the King with what past; and particularly to receive Orders for what
they should do concerning the Indies; having first declared to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:55461:61"/>
Deputies that they had no Commission to conclude any thing
in that business. They told them also, how that the Commissary
should be back within two months; whereupon he suddenly took his
journey for Spain: and I to shun the tedious prolixity of the less im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
affairs, will here mention only things of greater moment,
wherein their differences consisted. The King of Spain and the Arch-Dukes,
to shew their ingenuity, and the more to honest all conclusion
of agreement, desired that the exercise of Religion might be left free
throughout all the United Provinces: towards which I had not been
wanting, but particularly before the Deputies went for Holland; had
prest the Arch-Dukes much therein: and certainly the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
should by all Rules of good Government, of their own accord
have indeavoured to give the Catholicks, who were in no small num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
amongst them, satisfaction: but the hatred to the Catholick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion
prevailing on the one side with the leading Hereticks, and the
suspition that this was the more to oblige the Catholicks which were
amongst them, to the Spaniards on the other side it was to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they would not consent to any thing in favour of the Catholicks.
The second chief point, was that which concern'd commerce: The
United Provinces would have had it absolutely Free; and the King
and Arch-Dukes would have the Indies excepted, and desired that
many insufferable Taxes might be taken off, to which the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
were subject in Zealand, which were necessarily to pass from
thence to Antwerp, and which every day much les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ened the Traffick
of that City. The other chiefest affairs consisted in the exchange
which was to be made of divers Towns and other places, which the
one side were Masters of, in the others Country; in the adjusting of
confines; in contributions which were paid in several parts by those
whose habitations confin'd on both sides, to free themselves from
Military incursions: in the restitution of goods confiscated in the
time of Warre: and in other the like things of Justice. They trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
sometimes of one of these, sometimes of another, but very lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely;
for great difficulties were met withall in all of them, without
coming to any resolution. The point of exchange of places, was in
particular much argued: The United Provinces were possest of
Sluce in the Province of Flanders, together with the Island Cassant,
which is but of small circuit, but commodious for the unlading of
goods; having in it some Forts.</p>
               <p>They likewise were Masters of Breda, Bergen-ap zone, and saint
Gettringberg, all of them strongly scituated both by Nature and
Art in Brabrant; together with some lesser places, fortified like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
               <p>On the contrary the Arch-Dukes had Linghen, Groll, and Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densell
beyond the Rheine toward Friesland: Linghen is a very
strong Hold, and the other two, places of good consideration.
The Arch Dukes would have desired to have changed these three
places, with those which the United Provinces had in Brabant and
Flanders.</p>
               <p>And because that which was possest by the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vinces,
was much the greater and better part, it was
thought that the Arch-Duke to make the change more equall,
would willingly have quitted unto them all the rest which they
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:55461:62"/>
were masters of in <hi>Ghelderland,</hi> or at least the greatest part thereof.
Long dispute was had upon this Article, but to no purpose; for it was
not possible ever to agree upon it. And with the same difficulties and
prolixity they proceeded likewise in the other Affaires. This meane
while the time was expired wherein the Commissary was to return
from <hi>Spain;</hi> who did not onely not appear, but not any newes was
heard of him: whereupon the United Provinces grew very jealous,
and their Deputies began publickly to complain thereof. The King of
<hi>France</hi> was all this while very attentive upon the proceedings in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and to make the Spaniards the more jealous, he was easily perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon this occasion to make a new League with the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.
The Contents whereof was, That in case the Peace now in
Treaty should succeed, the King of <hi>France</hi> should be bound to assist the
United Provinces with 10000 paid Souldiers, to make the Spaniards the
better keep it: And that they on the other side should give the King
of <hi>France</hi> 5000 paid Foot in case the Spaniards should make War upon
him. The Spanish and Flemish Ambassadors which were at <hi>Paris,</hi>
quarrell'd with the King hereupon; but hee justified it with diverse
pretences, and shewed how that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Arch-dukes
should rather be beholding to him therein, as a business which might
the easilyer facilitate the Peace of <hi>Flanders</hi> which was in Treaty.
These artifices were not unknown in <hi>Spain,</hi> and it was every day bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seen, that no agreement would ever be made with the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
without the King of <hi>France</hi> his Interposition and Authority.
To the end then that he might obtain his mediation upon this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> resolv'd though upon other pretences, to send
<hi>Don Piedro de Tolledo,</hi> one of the chief Lords of Spain, into France.</p>
               <p>And this was thought then the fitter to be done, because the King
of <hi>France</hi> at the same time had sent for President <hi>Iannines</hi> to <hi>Paris;</hi>
with whom advising upon the Affairs of <hi>Holland,</hi> and the King resolving
upon the aforementioned things which might make him desire to see
she affairs of <hi>Flanders</hi> setled; he sent him suddenly to the <hi>Hague.</hi> But
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>annines</hi> grew quickly to despaire of seeing any Peace concluded. He
found the business more perplext with difficulties then before, and
the mindes of both Parties more exasperated. The United Provinces
could not tolerate the Spaniards slowness; for the Commissary did
not appear at all, nor was there any news heard of what hee had done
in <hi>Spain.</hi> Whereupon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ir Deputies resolved to know directly the
King of <hi>Spains</hi> finall intention touching the Indies, which when they
should not know, presently to break off the Treaty; and this they
prest upon the Catholick deputies with much instancy, who made them
this Answer:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the King desired a happy end of the begun Treaty, and that
he would at last condiscend to that renunciation which they desired,
and in manner as was by them propounded: But that on the other
side, he expected that in requitall of so important an Affaire, they
should forbear going to the Indies; and that moreover they should
permit liberty of conscience to the Catholicks within their Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
That the Commissary was already dispatch'd from the Court
with this answer; and that they had already received orders to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them the United Provinces therewithall.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Answer quite overthrew all hopes of Peace. The United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:55461:62"/>
had put on an unalterable Resolution neither to abandon the
Indies, nor yet to admit the Catholick Religion amongst them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
having heard this, they in Writing did presently declare the
Treaty broken, and presented the Writing to the Catholick Deputies.
The Treaty of Peace being thus faln to the ground, it remained to see
whether they might the easilyer compass a long Truce. The King
of <hi>England</hi> had all this while seem'd rather averse then otherwise to the
Negotiation in <hi>Holland;</hi> and having the same ends which the King of
<hi>France</hi> had, to raise Jealousie in the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as hath been said, hee also
made use of the same meanes. In im<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tation of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and
almost after the same manner, hee had at this time made also a new
League with the United Provinces; and though his Authority was
nothing near so great with them, yet was it such, as it might much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede
the proceedings of the new Treaty for a long Truce: And hee
had already complained to the Spanish and Flemish Ambassadors who
were resident in <hi>England,</hi> that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had sent Don <hi>Piedro de
Tolledo</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> putting thereby so great an esteem upon the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and that he had made no manner of Address at all to him. For
these respects the King of <hi>Spain</hi> resolved to send likewise Don <hi>Fernando
Girone</hi> who was then in Flanders, and who was one of the chiefest
Commanders in his Army to the King of <hi>England;</hi> who seemed to bee
very well satisfied therewith; and made large promises to intercede
for the continuing of the Negotiation in Holland, being thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swaded
by his naturall Addiction to peace, as also for the aforesaid
Reasons. Before the Catholick Deputies departed from <hi>Holland,</hi> the
Ambassadors of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> began to set again on foot this new
Treaty of a long Truce: Insomuch as the Ambassadors meeting one
day, <hi>Iannines</hi> in the name of both the Kings made this ensuing Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
in the Councell of the States Generall:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That both their Kings had alwayes considered the Affaires of the
United Provinces, as their own particular concernment, having
maintained them all this while as such by their Councels, and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them by their Forces; but that the end of War must bee Peace;
That to this purpose the United Provinces had been assisted by both
of them; and that both of them were therefore much troubled to see
the Treaty of Peace w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was begun, thus broken: and that they think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it howsoever much better for the united Provinces to enjoy a
commodious and honorable Quiet, then to return to the former dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
and dangers of war; were pleased to propound unto them by
their Ambassadors joyntly, a long Truce instead of Peace. That
notwithstanding in this Truce, in the first place, and before all other
things, it should be declared both by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and by the
Arch-Dukes, that it was made with the United Provinces as with free
Provinces and States, unto which they unade no pretence at all; and
that they should be left Free in point of their Navigation to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
That both their Kings did beleeve that the United Provinces
might bee content with a Truce which was to bring with it such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
advantages for them; and not onely these but peradventure
some others also. That greater difficulties were to bee feared on the
other part; but in case the war were to continue by reason of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
fault, the Forces of the United Provinces would be thereby the
more justified, and both their Kings still the more obliged to maintain
their Cause.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:55461:63"/>
The States Generall took time to advise upon the whole with their
Provinces. The Ambassadors with like conformity apply'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to the Catholick Deputies, who having lost all hopes of peace,
did very much desire to come to some other accommodation, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position:
So they willingly listned to this new proposall of a long
Truce; though they thought many difficulties would be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
in Spain touching the form thereof: They promised the
Embassadors notwithstanding to use all the dilligence they could to
overcome them: and having received assurances from the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
that they would do all good offices for the continuation of the
Treaty, and especially from <hi>Iannines,</hi> on whose means and Authority
they did chiefly relye, they at last went from the Hague, after having
been 8 months entertain'd there, and went to Brussels. The Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
of the Truce lying then chiefly on <hi>Iannines</hi> hand, he did all
all he could to perswade the United Provinces to allow of it, in the
same manner as had been propounded by him and the English Emba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors.
Those Provinces seemed well inclined in general toward
the Truce, though they wanted not some amongst them who would
have had the King of Spain and the Arch-Dukes make the same renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation
in the Treaty of Truce as they pretended unto in that of peace;
but the wiser and more moderate men amongst them considered that
this would be too unjust a pretention, due regard being had to the
difference between a Truce and a Peace, This difficulty proceeded
chiefly from Zealand, and was Fauter'd by Count <hi>Maurice</hi> by reason of
his abovesaid power in that Province, and the almost absolute depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy
which <hi>Maldereo</hi> the particular Deputy of Zealand had upon
him. <hi>Maldereo</hi> had been a menuall servant of the late Prince of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range,
and to say truth, the Interests of Zealand did accord with Count
<hi>Maurice</hi> his particular ends; for the Traffick and wealth of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
was greatly increased by the war; the choice Marriners who
had served and did as yet serve in the voyages to the Indies, were
likewise Zealanders; and next unto Holland, certainly this was the
chiefest and most considerable of all the United Provinces.</p>
               <p>The same difficulties, out of the same reasons were insisted upon by
the City of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland:</hi> but it was thought, that at last
the rest of that Province would prevail over the particular opposition
of that City, in a favourable acceptation of the Truce; which <hi>Zealand</hi>
did still pertenatiously resist: And <hi>Maldereo</hi> very zealous in the Cause,
endevoured to make those words suspected, wherein the king of <hi>Spain</hi>
and the Archdukes were to denounce the United Provinces to be free
States, in form abovesaid. Whereupon one day that this Clause was
treated on, he with great fervency broke forth into these words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Are we Free men, or still Subjects? If we be Freemen, why ought
we not to be publickly acknowledged for such? shall it depend upon
the Spaniards to allow us what sort of liberty they please, now that
they cannot impose that slavery upon us which they would? to wit,
a Liberty more servile then our former servitude; since it must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon the interpretation of their own words? Do not we know
what interpretation they have already given to those words? Doe
not wee know that they take them in such a sense as doth not take
from them any pretended right to our Provinces? At this rate wee
shall get nothing more by this long Truce, then what was had in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:55461:63"/>
bare suspension of Arms: And yet this Truce shall rather look like a
Peace; and it may so fall out, as by often Prolongation, it may at
last be insensibly turned into the nature of a Peace. Then, as in the
Treaty of Peace we did pretend in the first place, That that absolute
abnegation should be made by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Archdukes
which is now Treated of; so ought we still to pretend unto it, and
in that form which may clearlyest declare our Provinces to bee Free
and Soveraign. Shall not he acknowledge them, when all the rest
of the whole world Treats with them as such? To what corner of
the Earth, or of the Sea is it that the Fame of their Liberty, together
with the fame of their Forces is not flown? Let the Spaniards then
do the like, or let al Treaties be broken. That necessity which inforces
them to come to agreement with us, will likewise compel them to do
it in this manner. So since we would make no greater advantage of
this their necessity, with our swords in our hands, as we ought, and
peradventure might have done, we shall at least come by it by this
contestation of Treaty, in such manner as the victory of words can
most promise.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These reasons against the abovenamed clause, and many others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Truce in generall, were exagerated by <hi>Maldereo,</hi> or rather
through his mouth by Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> who labour'd by all other
means, and used all his industry that this Treaty of Truce might prove
vain, as the other of peace had done; the same things were scatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
abroad by his followers, giving out many printed papers to this
purpose, not owned by any: they seem'd to distrust the forein Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
and 'twas whisper'd that though the two Kings advised to
Truce, yet for their own self-interest they would not totally forbear
assisting the United Provinces though contrary to their Councell,
they should reassume their Arms; that howsoever it was requisit to
return to Arms, since it was undoubtedly to be believed, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
necessities being over, the Spaniards would no longer observe the
Truce: That in the mean while, the people of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
cheated by the abusive names of Peace and Quiet, would lose
their former vigour and constancy? That they would hardly be
brought to contribute those moneys afterwards, for the war, which
at first they did so willingly part withall: And that all these would be
seeds to produce pernicious discords amongst their Provinces. Lastly,
they concluded, That though the Spaniards should observe the Truce,
it would be requisit howsoever to keep their Frontiers still we look'd
unto; The which being so many, and the Jealousies on all sides being
now likely to prove so great, the expence in time of Truce would bee
well nigh as much as in the time of War. How much better would
it then be to continue the War, and not to lose the present occasions
which did all of them so smile upon them, and frown upon the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards?
Affairs leaned already towards discord, and the Zealander De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
threatened openly a separation from the rest of the Provinces,
if contrary to the form of common Government, the rest would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
upon Truce without the particular consent of Zealand. <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines</hi>
loitred now no more, but judging this a fitting occasion to shew
his experience, and force of his advices, one day when their contesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
grew highest, 'tis said he spoke to the Deputies of the United
Provinces in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:55461:64"/>
                  <q>Neither did my King ever think (worthy Deputies) that so long
contestations could have had place here amongst you in so great an
Union; nor did I ever beleeve that such distrust were to bee found
here, as some of you seem to have of my behaviour. I will speak of
mine own, leaving the English Ambassadors either to justifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
or make their just complaints. For what concerns my endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors,
I will onely say, Execution is the only share I have therein. So
as to mistrust them, will be much more to offend my King then mee.
And to say truth, what greater injury can hee receive then this? Hee
having alwayes shewed himself so partiall to your Commonwealth, as
he hath almost never made any difference between the Interests of
his own Kingdome, and of your Commonwealth. When hee was
hardly yet come unto the Crown, and had hardly, after so many Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick
and Forraign oppositions, setled his own affaires, the first
thing he did was to assist your Provinces. From that time to
this he hath not been wanting in ayding you with Moneys, Men, and
Counsell; and to make your Cause appear the juster in all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
by his owning it. Doubtlesly hee pretended to assist a Just
Cause: but the justest Actions doe not alwayes prove the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.
Nay these of yours might have been thought the more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
by how much their power is the greater, who take themselves
to be offended. The liberty of your Provinces may be said to have
sayled into the Haven, chiefly by the sayles of his Favor. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot now establish it upon the Anchor of Peace, my King
endevours at least to fasten it upon the Anchor of Truce, which may
prove as advantageous to you. Let us then consider whether such
an Agreement may be truly advantageous to your Affairs: Which
when it shall be known, as I hope it will, sinister discourses will then
soon cease; which if they doe not, it will appear at least, That they
proceed from particular passions, vayled over with the semblance of
Publick good. The business is then touching the making of a long
Truce; and whether the chiefest endeavor ought to bee, That your
Provinces should be therein clearly acknowledged to be Free. Wee
Ambassadors think the clause by us propounded sufficient to that
purpose: That the king of <hi>Spain</hi> and Archdukes should declare that
they made Truce with your Provinces as with free Provinces and
States, unto which they make no pretence at all. But there are some
amongst you who differ from us in opinion, thinking it to be too Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nericall
and Dubious; and who would have the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and
Archdukes make the same absolute renunciation now, as was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
unto when there was a Treaty of Peace. I cannot notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
part from my first opinion; for it appears to mee, that to
boot with the difference that there is between a Peace and a Truce,
this Declaration may be thought to make more for your liberty then
the other. Tell mee I pray you! have not you alwayes declared
That you have taken up Arms against your Prince, inforc'd thereto
by necessity? And that the war on your side could not be more just,
because it could not be more necessary? and by the same reason
have you not set your Provinces at Liberty by your own Authority?
Then if you pretend upon so good grounds to be free, what need you
now that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Arch-Dukes should make these
renouncings? Doe not you see, that such like renouncings of right,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:55461:64"/>
would presuppose it to be more manifest on their behalf? and that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
such a case much more should bee confest by you, then granted by
them? doe not you know that they can grant nothing to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of their successors? Kingdoms cannot otherwise make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
nor kings make any alienable part therein? and since they give
the Laws to others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must likewise in this behalf receive it from
their Crowns. How much better is it then that your Provinces bee
declared by the king and the Archdukes to be free by a general clause,
and that the agreement which is now spoken of, may follow with
this presupposition of your Liberty, without making it doubtfull by
any other kinde of clauses, insted of making it more clear? this form
is not only sufficient, but best. And if it bee not sufficient with the
contrary party; think you that if the Spaniards would not observe
the Truce for some other ends of theirs, they would ask your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
first before they would break it? and that they would first argue
whether they have any right over you, or no? This is the custom of
private suits, not of publick Causes; The controversies whereof are
at last reduced to Field-forces, where hee that overcomes hath the
Right, and no account of the Victory is given.</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>So as you need not care what interpretation the contrary party will
give to those words wherewith they doe acknowledg you to be free.
That which imports you, is, That your people hold themselves to be
confest to be free by those words, and not to be made so. And that
the Princes your friends understand them in the same sense. So
as if it be needfull to fall to armes again, your People may bee more
ready then ever to reassume them, and that your Friends may shew
themselves more dispos'd then ever to favor your cause. But it is too
well known how much more easie it is to use constancy in troubles,
then moderation in prosperity. Tell me I beseech you, those who
are the most zealous amongst you, when did they ever think that the
king of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Archdukes were to condiscend to Treaties so
advantageous for your Provinces? and will you lose this so happy oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion?
shall vain shadows prevail more with you then essentiall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons?
shall seditious Papers which are every where scatterd abroad,
be of more validity amongst you then the sincere and wise Counsels
of two Kings who are so affectionate unto your Cause. Now is the
time then to resolve upon, and to embrace this agreement which is
now offer'd. Doe you see how the Swissers have fared? take them
for your example. And by the similitude of their affaires and yours,
hope for the like successe. The Swissers took up armes at first against
their Princes, not being able longer to undergoe the grievances of
their Government: nor were they above two or three Cantons
at the beginning, and those the weakest amongst them; but their
People gasping for Liberty, and defending it with equall vigor both
of body and minde, they made invincible oppositions to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Forces; till being unconquerable by the forces of the other
Cantons, and the strength of their own <hi>Alpester</hi> scituation, their
Enemies despaired of ever subjugating them. At last they ceased
fighting, and from tottering agreements they came to a firm and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
peace. And who will now dispute the Swissers Liberty? why
may not your Provinces hope for the like success? the severity of
the Spanish Government made <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zealand</hi> take up armes at
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:55461:65"/>
first; their People valiantly withstood their Enemies: The Sea,
Rivers, and the strength of their Naturall situation fought for them;
your other Provinces came in afterwards unto them; and all made
such resistance to the contrary Forces, as there is not any example to
be had of so long a war. The successes have bin various; but at last
they have proved so propitious to you, as a Treaty of accommodation
was sought for by your Enemies; and now we are upon the point of a
long Truce: which if it succeed, will doubtlesly prove very advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous
for your affairs, and will easily bee hereafter renewed upon
the same advantages, or turn'd into a perpetuall peace, which may
prove yet better for you. That which I have hitherto said, seems to
me to be sufficiently clear.</p>
                  <p>In fine, there will be no doubt of your Liberty by this Clause, which
is propounded: Nor is it less to bee doubted that a Truce will bee
more advantageous for you, then unnecessitated to subject your selvs
to the uncertain events of a new war. Fortune is generally seen to
have too great a sway in war; and that mocking at humane arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
she too often makes the more powerfull give way unto the
weaker; and Losses insue where Victories were expected. To wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which, and pass by so many other examples; What more memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
president can you have thereof, then what so lately befell
here before your own Eyes in the Archdukes own person at <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>wp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rt?</hi>
where insted of being Victor, as it was assuredly hoped, hee was
overcome, wounded, and very near being taken prisoner.</p>
                  <p>By meanes of this Truce you will escape so many and so dangerous
uncertainties of war; you will in the interim establish your Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the better; you will ease your people of their disbursements;
you will continue your former Traffick into the Indies; and you
shall finally see an end of those hatefull titles of Perfidiousness and
Rebellion, which hath hitherto bin given by a great many in the
world to your motions and proceedings in arms. And who can doubt
but your Provinces will hereafter willingly concur in such Expences
as shall be needfull, since they will be so easie in comparison of what
they have been? and so much the more willingly, by how much men
doe more naturally desire to enjoy quiet, then to live in troubles: and
by how much Liberty is the sweeter, after having made tryall of
servitude.</p>
                  <p>And surely it is to be believed that those to whom the government
of your people shal be committed, wil use the same care and vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in the administration of publick affairs in time of truce, as they
have prudently done hitherto in the time of war: their chiefest care
will be still more to establish the present concord, which is the soul
which gives life unto the body, and the heart which maintains it: and
and hence proceeds that miraculous temper which of many makes
but one, and of but one many; but yet such as whether they be sever'd
or conjoyn'd do always conspire to the same end. Thus your affairs
being wel order'd within your selvs, you shal have little need to fear
forein dangers: and thus your Truce being at last turn'd into peace (as
'tis to be hoped it wil be) my King shal see the same success in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
as he hath seen in his own, and whereby his kingdom is now
made happy: to wit, after war peace, after troubles rest, and after the
sacking and burning of Towns, and all the orher miseries of Arms,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:55461:65"/>
the commodity, security, and felicity of quiet and peace.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Majesty and presence of the King of France himself; seemed
to break forth in the President <hi>Iannines</hi> countenance and words. He
afterward gave what he had spoken more fully in writing, to the end
that the people might come to the better knowledge thereof, and
that they might the easilyer effect the agreement which was in
Treaty.</p>
               <p>The like offices were done by the Ambassadors of England, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome
fully the pertenacy of the Zealanders, it was resolved that
Deputies should be sent into Zealand in the name of the six other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
to induce that Province to conformity with the rest: which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
much difficulty was at last effected, and all of them concurring
now in the same resolution; the Ambassadors began again to labour to
overcome the difficulties in dispute. Continual correspondency was
had by Letters between <hi>Iannines</hi> and <hi>Richardetto;</hi> so as the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of what was needfull past between them; but the King of Spain
needed no less labouring to be brought to give way to the Truce: news
was sent to Spain of the Proposition made by the Ambassadors of
France and England, and of the new Negotiation introduced by their
means.</p>
               <p>The King would have been well enough pleased with the Truce,
had it been according to usual form, and all things left in the same
tearms on both sides, as they were at present; but to declare the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces to be altogether free, and to suffer them in express
words to traffick in the Indies, seem'd to put too great a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the present Treaty, and ordinary Truces: yet 'twas seen that
'twas impossible ever to come to any accommodation without this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration
of Liberty; and that if the United Provinces had stood so
absolutely upon it before they would be brought to a bare suspension
of Arms for a few months, they would now be much more resolute
in it, in a Truce which was to endure for many years.</p>
               <p>The Arch-Dukes, who saw the difficulties and dangers of the war
in case it should be continued, at a nearer distance, were easilyer indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to give way to the Proposall made by the Ambassadors; and <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nines</hi>
both by word of mouth, and by Letters, had endeavour'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the Catholick Deputies, that to declare they made Truce
with the United Provinces as with free Provinces and States unto
which the King and the Arch-Dukes made no pretence at all, did not
any ways prejudice, the right which the King or Arch-Dukes might
pretend to have over them. <q>He had shew'd how that it was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Declaration; that the word (as) bore with it a sence of similitude,
and not of propriety: That in the declaring of one mans being
friends with another, 'twas never said I hold him as a friend; that
the adding in the last words, not to pretend unto any thing, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the ambiguity of the former words: And finally that
such a Declaration could not admit of any interpretation, save only
during the time of the Truce.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That then the King and the Arch-Dukes ought to be content
to make it; since it was involved in words which might satisfie
both parties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>First, The unskilfull multitude of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
for the outward appearance of their pretended Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:55461:66"/>
them the King and the Arch-Dukes; for the true substance
which was retained in them of leaving their former right still unhurt.
Then opening himself more freely, <hi>Iannines</hi> said; My King in such
a case, would not make any difficulty in granting this Declaration;
for if the United Provinces when they shall betake themselves to
Arms shall not have better Canons and Muskets; words and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations
will avail them but a little.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner, and by these wary and wily ways, <hi>Iannines</hi> as a good
mediator, endeavoured to draw both sides to a Truce; to which the
Arch-Dukes were easily perswaded, and indeavoured to bring the
King to be so likewise; shewing that by this, neither they nor the
King should do any thing more, then what was yeilded unto at the
first suspension of Arms; much repugnancy did notwithstanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
in the King. 'Twas thought in Spain that the Clause where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the United Provinces were to be declared Free States, though
it were limited, would generally be interpreted in favour of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie;
and that when they should have got their desires in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,
the King would not obtain leave for the exercise of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lick
Religion in their Countrey, which he was resolved to have by
way of interchange; and moreover if the Article concerning the
Indies should be condescended unto, how much would the King be
thereby damnified? how much reputation would he thereby lose? To
which difficulties the Arch-Dukes reply'd, shewing that when the
King resolved to have the abovesaid requitall, 'twas only to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
if the peace should be concluded; and that the King and the
Archdukes having absolutely renounced all their right, the united Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
were absolutely free; that the present negotiation of the Truce
did differ very much; by which the King nor the Archdukes could not
lose any piece of their former right, that it was not to be doubted but
that a clause so generall and so limitated, would be interpreted rather
in favour of them, then of the contrary party. That the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
themselves thought so; as also divers of the Inhabitants of the
United Provinces, who were against the Truce, as that which would be
no whit more advantagious for them, then was the bare suspension of
Arms. And as for the point of the Indies, they seemed to have hopes
to end it so, as it should be no considerable prejudice to the King.</p>
               <p>These reasons were not taken as fully satisfactory in Spain; but on
the other side, the King did very much desire the Truce, and that the
so great, and so unnecessary expences of Flanders should cease. The
Duke of Lerma was then in great authority with the King; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
gotten the sole power over the King by such arts as were availa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in peace, he was unwilling to share it with them who might gain it
by such means as war affords: which made him from the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
very earnest in endeavouring the negotiation: and he did now no
less labour that it might come to some good event of agreement; the
same desires were known to be in the Arch-Duke; who therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to send his Confessor to the Court of Spain, to answer all the
difficulties which were insisted on in Spain, the which was thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
also to put an end to so long a negotiation, wherein above two
years had already been spent; which had so tired the two mediating
Kings, as they began already to protest that they would meddle no
more therein, if it were not all the more speedily ended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:55461:66"/>
Father <hi>Inico di Brazuela,</hi> of the Order of the Dominicans, was the
Archdukes Confessor, a very learned and upright man, and one who
had been long experienced in the affairs of <hi>Flanders:</hi> so as men hoped
well of him, and of his fidelity, that hee might reconcile affairs with
the King and State-Officers, he being a Spaniard, a Votary, and of a
very noble Family, and commendable life. Hee was particularly to
take all scruples from the King in the point of pretending by way of
interchange the exercise of the Catholick profession in the time of
Truce, whereof hee was to presse the necessity even for the Cause of
Religion it self. By representing, That if they should return to Arms
again, manifest hazard would yet be run of losing more then formerly
on the King and the Arch-Dukes behalf in Flanders, and consequently
of quite losing the Catholick Religion in the yet obedient Provinces,
instead of regaining it in those that were revolted. The business was
all this while put on by the two Kings Ambassadors: but because to
negotiate by way of Letters was long and tedious, the Ambassadors
minded the Catholick Deputies who had been in Holland, that it
would make more for the purpose to have the meeting in Antwerp,
to end those difficulties which yet remained concerning the negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
This Proposition was willingly listened unto by the Arch-Dukes;
whereupon the Ambassadors, and the Catholick Deputies,
met in Antwerp in the beginning of February 1609. The greatest
difficulty was touching the point of the Indies. The Ambassadors
had always assured the United Provinces, that in the Truce they
should be permitted to Traffick thither; and they therefore desired
that that Article might be laid down in clear and express words. On
the contrary the Catholick Deputies desired that if it should be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to come to a Truce without condescending to that point, it
might at least be understood by tacit circumlocutions, then by nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating
the Indies expresly.</p>
               <p>They desired also howsoever, that the United Provinces should
forbear from coming into or from trafficking in those parts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
which were already under the Crown of Spain. At last after
much arguing this point was agreed upon, and was couched in such
tearms as both the United Provinces, and the Catholick Deputies
were satisfied therewith: for the name of the Indies was left out,
and the said Provinces were forbidden entring into the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys
in those parts: And <hi>Richardetto</hi> had wont afterwards to say, that
this Article was so obscure, as he himself did not understand it: much
disputation was likewise had upon the Article of Contributions:
'twas said that the United Provinces received every year 300000
Crowns of Contribution money, which was a great help to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences.
The Arch-Dukes did not receive neer so much; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
these moneys were all raised by hostility, it was thought a thing
too repugnant to the publick tranquility which was indeavoured, that
this kinde of Hostile proceedings should be continued in times of
quiet: so as the United Provinces were at last perswaded, that all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions
of both sides should be laid down. On the contrary 'twas
necessary to yeild to the pretention moved by them, that the precincts
which did appertain to such Towns as were enjoy'd both on this and
on that side, should be restored to the said Towns. Touching which
point little or nothing returned to the Arch-Dukes hands, whereas
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:55461:67"/>
large boundeurs were restored to the Towns of Breda, and Berghen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ap
zone, together with some others in Brabant which were in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of the United Provinces? yet the Arch-Dukes did so far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail,
and my endeavours were also so earnest therein, as the exercise
of the Catholick Religion only was left in those precincts, as it was
before. To the which the United Provinces obliged themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
being promised by <hi>Iannins</hi> and <hi>Rossi</hi> his Collegue, who gave it
them under their hands, that the King of France should oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to see it performed. Touching the point of exchange of Towns,
there was no means of accommodation therein to be found; so as it
was resolved that each party should still enjoy what they did possess at
the present: nor would the United Provinces ever suffer themselves
to be perswaded in the point of taking away the Taxes and other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments
to which those vessels were lyable in Zealand which passed
through the Scheld to come to Antwerp, whereby that City was
much indamaged, as hath been said. This business was refer'd to be
propounded and examined in a friendly manner after the Truce
should be concluded. And the Arch-Dukes hoped by the benefit of
the Truce, the better to accommodate their own Ports in Flanders,
into which much merchandize was to be brought, which in time of
war went necessarily into Holland and Zealand; because their Havens
were continually block'd up by many of the United Provinces men of
war.</p>
               <p>These were the chief points on which the Ambassadors of France
and England treated with the Marquiss <hi>Spinola,</hi> and the other Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Deputies in Antwerp: the Catholick Deputies endeavouring to
proceed as slowly as might be, that the Arch-Dukes Confessor might
have time to negotiate in Spain, and to send away the resolution
which was expected from thence; which not long after came; and
was the same in sum which the Arch-Dukes had desired, and the
Confessor by the reasons alledged by him, had perswaded the King
unto: great consultations were had notwithstanding before this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
both in the Counsel of State, and amongst the gravest
and learnedst Ecclesiasticks of Spain: for the King would be fully sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
in all those affairs which were to be considered in so important
a business, before he would suffer it to be brought to a conclusion.</p>
               <p>The Confessor himself returned soon after; so as the affairs being
fitted by all parties for an agreement, the two Kings Ambassadors,
who after the negotiation at Antwerp, were gone to give an account
of the whole business to the United Provinces, thought it fitting to
return again to that City, and to bring thither the same Deputies
of the United Provinces, who were first imploy'd in negotiating the
business in Holland; which was approved of by the Arch-Dukes, and
at the same time the Catholick Deputies returned thither likewise, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which was Commissary <hi>Neyen,</hi> who was then returned from
Spain.</p>
               <p>The United Provinces thought this to be the business of highest
nature, and of greatest importancy which had befalne them since
their withdrawing themselves from the obedience of the Crown of
Spain, and therefore it was judged necessary that it should be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the authority of the whole body of the great Assembly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
the General Union; and that the Assembly should consist of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:55461:67"/>
as many Deputies, as could be gathered together upon so great an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currency.
The Town of Berghen-ap-zone was made choice of to
this purpose, scituated not many leagues from Antwerp. Here the
great Assembly met, and 'twas said that the Deputies were eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
in number. The Deputies of both sides, together with the two
Kings Ambassadors, met every day in Antwerp, in the publick Palace
of that City. From whence whatsoever past from time to time was
sent to Brussels to the Arch-Dukes, and to the United Provinces in
Berghen-ap-zone, and resolutions were suddenly taken. When all
points were then adjusted, after so many and so long obstructions, a
Truce for twelve years was established and concluded on the ninth of
April in the year of our Lord one thousand six hundred and nine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
both parties: The Articles were eight and thirty. In the first
it was declared, that the Arch-Dukes made Truce with the United
Provinces as with Free States and Provinces, unto which they did not
make any pretence at all; and they obliged themselves that the King
of Spain should ratefie the same Declaration, together with all the
rest, which was afterwards done in such manner as was requisit. The
other chief Articles contain'd the affairs of chiefest importance, as
hath been shewed above; and in the rest divers resolutions were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
touching the affairs of Justice; and concerning rather par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
then publick Interests.</p>
               <p>Thus did this Negotiation of Flanders end at last; the Issue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was so long expected throughout all Europe.</p>
               <p>And truely at this Truce, as if it had been at an universal Quiet, all
Europe seem'd to rejoice, which had seen for so many years, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst
so many fatall and dreadfull spectacles, the blood of all her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
run upon the Theatre of <hi>Flanders.</hi>

                  <hi>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Illiam,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi> dying about the end of <hi>March,</hi> in
the year 1609. and the Male line of that Familie fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in him, divers Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> laid presently
claim to the Inheritance of his estate, by the right
which lay in the Female line. <hi>William</hi> had had four
Sisters married into <hi>Germany;</hi> The first to the Duke
of <hi>Prussia;</hi> The second to the Duke of <hi>Newburg;</hi>
The third to the Duke <hi>Zweeburg;</hi> and the fourth to the Marqesse of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantz.</hi>
The first died before <hi>William,</hi> and left one Daughter behind him,
who was afterwards married to the Elector Marquesle of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi>
and therefore <hi>William</hi> being dead, the Elector pretended that the right
to that estate fell to his wife, by the mothers side; and that his wives
mother as she who was the eldest, was to be preferred before all the
other sisters. <hi>Newburg</hi> made use of the same pretence of eldership; and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:55461:69"/>
said, that his wife, being the eldest sister living, should succeed in the
first place: The other two pretended that all the four sisters had equal
right to the succession, and that therefore the Inheritance was to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into four equal parts. To both which these four Princes, the
Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> moved an ancient pretence of his, and the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi>
made another claim; <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Newburg</hi> took possession pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently;
though somewhat withstood by the deceased Dukes Vassals,
who desired it might first be declared by the way of Justice, to whom the
succession did lawfully appertain: But the Emperour proved a much
greater obstacle herein; for he pretended, that the Inheritance should
be in him, by way of sequestration, till it should be legally declared who
should be Heir. In this respect he, first by threats, and afterwards by
sending Arch-Duke <hi>Leopold</hi> to <hi>Iuliers</hi> to see the sequestration made, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to take the possession from <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> &amp; <hi>Newburg;</hi> in whose
behalf the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the United Provinces of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and divers other Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> did appear; by whose means
an agreement was made between the two Dukes, that they should equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
possesse those Countries till the main cause should be decided. The
Emperours threats proved therefore vaine, and vain the means used by
<hi>Leopold</hi> in his name; for those two Princes, assisted by a powerful
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
from <hi>France, England,</hi> and the United Provinces; <hi>Leopold</hi> was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to forgo <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and to quit those Territories. It was not disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> or the Arch-Duke <hi>Albertus</hi> did any wayes
incline to meddle in the aforesaid differences; so as <hi>Leoplod</hi> could have no
succour from <hi>Flanders.</hi> Only they did resolve, not to permit that the
United Provinces should make any advantage within those parts, by any
whatsoever pretence: And because they, the United Provinces had
caused some jealousies that they would keep the Town of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> which
was fallen to <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Newburg</hi> chiefly by the means of their
Souldiers, in whom those Dukes greatest strength did consist in this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour;
therefore in case of such a novelty, the Arch-Duke and <hi>Spaniards</hi>
had secretly resolved to do the like in some other part of those Countries;
hoping that one noveltie might serve to cure another, and that then by
an enterchangable restitution of the possessed Towns, their wonted new-tralitie
in those parts might be continued, and the controverted succession
might be decided in its proper Tribunal of the Empire. But the United
Provinces did not at that time make the apprehended invasion: So
as the two Princes continuing their former intire possession, all things on
all sides were then reduced to a quiet condition. The Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
had from the very first sent one of his Brothers, and Duke <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi>
his eldest son, to take by agreement the forenamed Possession,
and both of them joyntly to govern those Countries: Their incomes
were equal, equal their Garisons, and they shared alike in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of government: For what concerned Religion, 'twas left in
its former condition; in the publick exercise the Catholick Religion did
generally prevail; but in many parts the number of Hereticks was the
greater, who were most of them <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Calvinists. Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
was a <hi>Calvinist,</hi> and <hi>Newburg</hi> a <hi>Lutheran.</hi> For all this they kept both
of them most commonly in <hi>Dosseldorp,</hi> a Town situated upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi>
wherein the Dukes of <hi>Cleves</hi> did usually reside; nay, they lived both of
them in the very Castle of <hi>Dosseldorp,</hi> following their several Sects, and
for all other things, they administred Justice in common: but in fine
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:55461:69"/>
the saying is true; <hi>That a Kingdom will admit of no Companions:</hi> This cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondencie
did not long continue between these two Princes; small
jealousies began at first to creep in; then greater suspitions grew up; and
at last they broke into open discord. Each of them endeavoured parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
adherencie, and to make their own sect greater at home, and to
have potent friends abroad: For what concern'd forrain friendship,
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> had the better at first; for the United Provinces inclined mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly
towards him as well in respect of Religion, as having also formerly
held very good friendship and correspondencie with his house: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Newburgs</hi> Son, knowing that he should alwayes have need of potent
friends abroad, and being formerly sufficiently inclined to turn Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
did the more dispose himself to joyn with the Catholick partie in
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ermany;</hi> which he clearly testified by his marrying with the Duke of
<hi>Bavaria</hi>'s daughter: Being married, though he did not at first suddenly
declare himself, he was presently held for a Catholick by the contrary
faction; The Hereticks grew very jealous to see <hi>Newburg</hi> so near allied to
the house of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and to see that he had the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> who was
the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s brother so near his neighbour; and many Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
of his Electorship, and of his Bishoprick of <hi>Liege</hi> so near at hand;
both of which did confine upon a great part of the late Duke of <hi>Cleves</hi>
estate. They did moreover consider, that the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> to boot
with his being one of the chiefest Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> and one of the most
zealous for the Catholick Religion; he together with the Elector of
<hi>Mentz</hi> was head of the Catholick league, made but a few years before;
and he himself alone head of the forces, if there should be any occasion
to use them: so as they thought, that he to boot with his own peculiar
forces, might easily by his means make his son in law <hi>Newburg</hi> be assisted
by the forces of the whole league. But these were not the jealousies
which did most vex the Hereticks: that which troubled them most was,
that the match between <hi>Newburg</hi> and <hi>Bavaria</hi> was made by the interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and authoritie of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Archduke <hi>Albertus;</hi> and
that therefore upon all occasions <hi>Newburgs</hi> interest was likely to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
by the neighbouring forces of <hi>Flanders. Newburg,</hi> on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
did not only suspect the forces of the United Provinces, but those of
<hi>England</hi> and of the Heretical league of <hi>Germany,</hi> which was not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
made in opposition of the Catholick league: As for <hi>France,</hi> 'twas
doubtful to which side it would incline; but 'twas at last concluded that
it would either stand Newtral, or that if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should
move, the <hi>French</hi> would withstand the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> This was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the affairs of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers</hi> both at home and abroad, in
the beginning of the year 1614. The Elector of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> Brother
was dead a little before this; so as he had seen his eldest son, a youth of
above eighteen years of age, upon whom his Mothers right was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend,
to be in his place; who tarried a while in the Town of <hi>Wesell,</hi> and
then went to the Town of <hi>Cleves,</hi> from whence the whole Dukedome
has its name: and on the other side, the Palatine of <hi>Newburg,</hi> (for so was
the Duke and Dutchesse of <hi>Newburgs</hi> eldest son called) continued his
residencie in <hi>Dosseldorp. Brandenburgs</hi> son had many councellors placed
above him, for his <hi>Governours;</hi> but he was chiefly guided in all things
by the advice and authoritie of the United Provinces. The Palatine of
<hi>Newburg</hi> did himself undergo the burthen of all the businesse which did
occur, which he shewed himself very capable of, as well by reason of
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:55461:70"/>
the maturitie of his years, as for many other excellent indowments both
of body and mind: the Jelousies and discords both of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and
<hi>Newburgs</hi> side were already apparent to all men: and because it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
but that some important alteration must needs happen, all the
eyes of the Northern parts were bent upon the affaires of the <hi>Cleves</hi> and
<hi>Iuliers,</hi> and great expectation was had on all sides of what would befal:
the mean while the spring came on; in which time the Palatine of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
met with the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and tarried some dayes with him;
which occasioned a new and greater suspicion amongst the <hi>Brandenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians;</hi>
nor did the Marquesse himself any longer delay Innovations: He
and his men, favoured by the Souldierie which were in the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
nearest Garrisons, endeavoured to surprise, and to make himself
absolute master of the Town of <hi>Dosseldorp,</hi> at a time when <hi>Newburg</hi> was
not there: but being discovered by them that were within, he failed in
his enterprize. <hi>Newburg</hi> was hereat mightily moved; and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
no lesse: amongst which the Archduke, considering particularly,
that if the two forenamed Princes should take up Armes, it would be a
businesse of great consequence, and that from every least sparkle which
was thereby to be raised, some important fire of combustion, might
break forth, and be enlarged thereabouts; he therefore resolved on his
side to use all possible means, that some remedy might be found out
whereby the differences might be composed. He writ to both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
exhorting them to agreement, and declared that both himself and
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would bend their forces against him of the two who
should first offer at any noveltie: He writ thus to both of them that he
might not appear partial to either of them: He likewise dealt with the
United Provinces, to the end that they might indeavour the preservati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Peace between the two Princes: He likewise desired the Queen
Regent of <hi>France,</hi> that she would interpose her authoritie with the two
Princes, to the same purpose. And Lastly, he indeavoured an assembly
of divers Deputies, not only in the name of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi>
but of other Princes also, who should play the part of Mediators, either
to establish the former agreement better between them, or to renew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
which might be more satisfactorie to them both. The United
Provinces seemed to desire peace between the two Princes; which they
signified to the Archduke by way of Answer: and gave the like answer
to the instances made unto them by the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> at the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes
perswasions: Adding moreover, that if necessitie should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
them to take up Arms, they would resolve on nothing before they
had acquainted her Majestie with it: All which things were imparted to
the Archduke, both by the Embassadour of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was at <hi>Paris,</hi>
and by the <hi>French</hi> Embassadour who was at <hi>Brussels.</hi> Notwithstanding
all this, the Archduke and the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> doubted that the Queen of
<hi>France</hi> her intercession (<hi>France</hi> it self being then full of troubles) would
not be of sufficient authoritie with the United Provinces, to detain them
within requisit terms; neither were their doubts vain: Not many dayes
after news was brought of another Innovation made by <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
much greater then that of <hi>Dosseldorp,</hi> and fomented by the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
more openly then was the other. Garrisons (as I have told you
before) were placed in the name of both the Princes, and in equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
where it was necessary to place them: the chiefest was put in the
Town and Castle of <hi>Iuliers;</hi> the Governour of which Town and Castle
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55461:70"/>
was one who had served in the Army of the United Provinces, and who
did much depend upon Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> General of their Army. <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
under pretence of fear (which was likewise his colour for attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to surprize <hi>Dosseldorp</hi>) that <hi>Newburg</hi> had designed to drive out <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgs</hi>
part of the Garrison, and make himself absolute master of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
resolved to make himself master of it; which about the beginning
of <hi>May</hi> he effected in this manner. <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> souldiers took up
Arms one night, and easily drove out <hi>Newburgs</hi> men, who were surprized
at unawares, and when they were disperst both out of the Town and
Castle; and suspicions upon suspicions being pretended by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
he suddenly brought in, at first a small number of Souldiers out of
the nearest Garrisons of the Low Countries, and afterwards a strength
of above 2000 Foot, together with some Horse, all of them belonging to
the United Provinces; who did honest this their action with a specious
pretence. They said that the coming of their Forces into <hi>Iuliers.</hi> was
only to preserve the publick Peace, which the two Princes would by
their Arms violate: that <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> men should likewise be put out of
<hi>Iuliers;</hi> and that they would keep the Town and Castle as deposited in
their hands, till the two Princes should come to a better agreement.
This noveltie hapning, <hi>Newburg</hi> resolved to meet with it by another,
though not of such concernment. He presently possest himself wholly
of the Town of <hi>Dosseldorp,</hi> and began presently to raise some Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
there. <hi>Dosseldorp</hi> lies upon the bankes of the <hi>Rhine;</hi> 'tis a little
Town, but pleasant by reason of its situation, and particularly on the
Castle side, which answers upon the sight of the river. The Castle is not
Fortified, but serves rather for a dwelling house then for a strong hold;
whereas the Town of <hi>Iuliers</hi> is greater, and is fortified by a Castle built
after the modern fashion, with some Royal Bulwarks; it commands a
fertile and large Countrie, extended in a spacious plain, which is called
the Dukedome of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> taking its name from the Town: the seat
thereof is important, for it lies between <hi>Cullen, Leige,</hi> and the Frontiers
of those Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> which are next <hi>Germany:</hi> so as it may be
said to be one of the chiefest Ports on that side toward <hi>Germany:</hi> and
'twas thought a businesse of great moment, that the United Provinces
should be entred <hi>Iuliers:</hi> and being considered as it related to the affairs
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> it was a manifest advantage to the United Provinces, and
consequently a great prejudice to the Archduke and to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi>
and by it also the reputation of the Archduke, and of the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi>
was too foully blemisht: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> which were in <hi>Flanders</hi> said with
much indgnation:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Was it not sufficient for the United Provinces to have made a Truce,
almost wholly after their own will, and to have used such insolencies
both during the Treatie and since, but that now they must invade new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral
Countries in an hostile manner? and therein violate the publick
faith? without any the least claim of particular right? what did there
remain for them more to do now, unlesse it were to erect a Tribunal
in <hi>Holland,</hi> whereby to give Law to the whole North? since arroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
unto themselves, as it were, the sole Arbitrament over the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie
of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> they pretended to dispose of it at their
pleasure; or else to usurp it themselves, and take the Countrie into
their own possession.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But these were but the least complaints the <hi>Spaniards</hi> made; they
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55461:71"/>
complained much more upon the Archduke, and against the Truce made
by him not many years before, to the so great prejudice of the affairs of
<hi>Spain,</hi> as they did alwayes generally think.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That these were the egregious fruits which were gotten by the
Truce: to wit, the losse of reputation (the soul of Empire) to the
Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Truce being made to the so much vilification
thereof; and so many reformations being since made in the Army,
with such exquisit parsimony, as if the Army were a private family,
and the King, a Merchant, not a King; and the Province of <hi>Flanders,</hi>
in the midst of <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; not invironed on all sides by that Courts great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
enemies: that as soon as the Truce was concluded, the King of
<hi>France</hi> had forthwith taken upon him the boldness, proudly to threaten
<hi>Flanders</hi> with his Forces, and to bring it into those dangers, from which
it could not otherwise have been freed, but by the almost manifest
miracle of his sudden death; but that for all this, the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>
the United Provinces, and the Hereticks of <hi>Germany</hi> had not laid
aside their daring; since all of them, after having joyntly assisted <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
and <hi>Newburg</hi> forcibly to take intire possession of the States of
<hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers</hi> it behoved Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> shamefully to quit those
parts: that the Hereticks had since threatned <hi>Cullen;</hi> had taken away the
government of <hi>Aquisgrane</hi> from the Catholicks; Fortified <hi>Mulen</hi> in the
face of <hi>Cullen;</hi> and had in divers other sorts insulted over the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
in those parts: and what wonder was it that such insolencies
should be done by them? since the Arms of <hi>Flanders,</hi> whilome the
Terror of Hereticks, were since the Truce grown so weak, as that they
were become a scorn, and laughingstock amongst them; that if the
maintaining of a flourishing Army in <hi>Flanders</hi> was too expensive, they
might be limited elsewhere, to supply these more important For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
that the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> was to reap Gold and Jewels from the
<hi>Indies;</hi> from other kingdoms ostentation, and a long series of Title;
and souldiers and arms from <hi>Flanders,</hi> her magazine thereof.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did the Spaniards complain aloud and with military freedome;
and truly it is not to be denied but that after the Truce, the affaires of
<hi>Flanders</hi> were reduced to too great a diminution of Forces: the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Army did not then exceed 8000 Foot and 1200 Horse, whereas the
United Provinces did still maintain in theirs above 20000 Foot and 2500
Horse; to boot with the 4000 Foot and 200 Horse, all of them French,
which were paid by the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> For though the Truce was
judged necessary out of very many and weightie reasons; yet was there
no reason why <hi>Flanders</hi> should be afterwards left so weak, as that its own
weaknesse should invite the enemies of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of the
Catholick Religion, to new and rash designs: How greatly insolent the
United Provinces were in possessing themselves of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and how much
prejudice did thereby insue to the Provinces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was sufficiently
known by the Archduke, and by those Spanish officers, who next to him
guided the Affaires of <hi>Flanders.</hi> He therefore resolved to send speedy
advertisment to the King of what the United Provinces had done, advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
him not to indure it: He hinted for remedy, the taking up of Arms,
as it was first agreed on, when they apprehended the like proceedings,
as hath been said; not intermitting howsoever the way of negotiating
not only by the means of the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> but also of the King of
<hi>England,</hi> by whose means it was to be indeavoured that the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:55461:71"/>
should quit <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and should leave affairs in their former conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
and becaus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> it was necessary to recruit the Armie lustily both with
Foot and Horse, when there should be occasion of drawing it out into
the field; the Archduke desired the King, that he would send suddenly
400000 crowns into <hi>Flanders</hi> to this purpose: it cannot be said how
strangely <hi>Spain</hi> was moved at this invasion of <hi>Iuliers:</hi> so as the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes
advice was presently approved of: and it was credibly believed
that the moneys desired should be presently provided. The Archduke
the mean while entered into divers negotiations: the United Provinces
seemed to desire, that the Deputies of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with those of the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and their own should meet in
<hi>Wessell,</hi> as also the ordinary Agents of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> who were
with the two Princes; to the end that they might see whether any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
agreement then the former might be made by an amicable way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the two Princes. The Archduke therefore resolved to send some
one in his behalf likewise to <hi>Wessell,</hi> and to this purpose he chose the
Count <hi>Octavius</hi> Viscount. <hi>Newburg</hi> in particular had prest the Archduke
very much to do this; but the conference at <hi>Wessell</hi> may be almost said
to have been ended before it was begun: for the United Provinces, as if
they would imperiously give laws to the negotiation, propounded, that
<hi>Newburg</hi> should first put the affairs of <hi>Dosseldorp</hi> into their former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
and that afterwards they would think upon some expedient for
those of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> so as should be satisfactory to all parties, which <hi>Newburg</hi>
denied to do, saying that in all reason the affairs of <hi>Iuliers</hi> and of <hi>Dossel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorp</hi>
should be put into their former condition at one and the same time:
So as Count <hi>Octavius</hi> hearing presently after his departure from <hi>Brussels,</hi>
that the Treatie at <hi>Wessell</hi> was broken off, instead of going thither he
went to <hi>Cleves,</hi> where the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> son was: and media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
very much with him in the Archdukes name to bring him to
agreement with <hi>Newburg;</hi> the answers he received were general: He
then went to do the like with <hi>Newburg,</hi> who justified his actions by the
violence of the contrary partie: and because not many dayes before he
had made publick profession of the Catholick faith, he recommended his
affairs with much efficacie to the Archduke, desiring him to interpose his
authoritie that they might be taken into protection likewise by the King
of <hi>Spain:</hi> the indeavours at <hi>Wessell</hi> proving vain, the Archduke renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his former applications to the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> as also with the King
of <hi>England,</hi> to the end that both of them might procure the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
to forgo <hi>Iuliers;</hi> to the which the Queen seemed to be very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
saying, she would send some one of purpose to see some remedy
taken; the King of <hi>England</hi> shewed likewise the same intentions and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse:
But as Princes actions are usually full of jealousies; the Queen
of <hi>France</hi> not appearing so forward, after many dayes in her perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
as she was in her promises, they grew suspicious of the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the <hi>French:</hi> in fine twas doubted that the businesse of <hi>Iuliers</hi> was
done either at first with their knowledge, or afterwards by their approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
'Twas considered what the United Provices had written to the
Queen; that they would do nothing in this affair, before they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
it to the <hi>French:</hi> but the consideration was yet more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
that according to the nature of their government, so streightly bound
in correspondencie with the two Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> it could
not almost be possible that they should of themselves fall upon so bold
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:55461:72"/>
an action. The French Embassadour at <hi>Brussels</hi> did notwithstanding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
affirm, that the Queen knew nothing of the novelty of <hi>Iuliers,</hi>
but that <hi>France</hi> was mightily displeased thereat; and that it was not to
bee doubted but that the Queen would finde out some remedy for it;
that shee had forborn sending the forementioned Expresse into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to Treat with the two Princesse, because shee hoped for some
good issue from the conference at <hi>Wessell;</hi> but that proving other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
they were now to expect what shee had promised. This mean
while some provision of monies were heard of from <hi>Spain;</hi> two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
thousand Crowns were sent at the present, and great hopes were
given that the other 200000. should follow presently, and yet a
greater summe; the Summer was already well advanced, neither was
any news yet heard of the coming of any one from <hi>France,</hi> nor that
there was any intention of sending any; so without any further expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
from <hi>France,</hi> the Archduke without any more delay, resolved
to augment the Army, and to raise new men. Hee determined to
raise 6000. Almains, and 7000. Walloons, and that a levy should bee
made thorowout all the Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> of 1300. horse, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
into Curassiers, and Harqubusiers the ancient Souldiers were,
as hath been said, about 8000. foot, and 1200. horse. The Archdukes
resolution was, that being to march forth with the Armie, all the old
Militia should be drawn out, and so many of the new men as might
make up a Body of 18000. foot, and of 2400. horse, and that the rest
of the new men should remain to guard the Frontiers, and to supply
the Garrisons. <hi>Newburg</hi> was very solicitous that the Army should be
put together, for fear lest hee might bee driven out of <hi>Dosseldorp</hi> by
the <hi>Vnited Provinces.</hi> He also raised men, to do the which the Duke
of <hi>Bavaria</hi> assisted him with moneys, and in secret the Catholike League,
and after hee had declared himself to be a Catholike, the Pope had
likewise put on a resolution in <hi>Rome</hi> to assist him with moneys, which
were to be contributed as his part in generall to the same League in case
of warre; and to this purpose I used my best endeavors. The King of
<hi>England</hi> seemed at that time to be again desirous to interpose in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of the affairs of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and had destin'd to send over Sir
<hi>Henry Wotten</hi> extraordinary Embassadour into <hi>Holland</hi> to this purpose;
and before he sent, he made this proposition by him: That in the first
place <hi>Iuliers</hi> should be deposited into the hands of some that were New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
And for this he nominated three: <hi>Philip</hi> Prince of <hi>Orange, Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice</hi>
Lantsgrave of <hi>Hessen,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Hennault<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> The first a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike,
the last two Heretikes. The Archduke would have agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the first, but could not approve of the other two, because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
too much upon the Heretike faction of <hi>Germany.</hi> But in <hi>France,</hi>
were it either that they did not approve of the Proposition, or of the
choice of the Persons, or that they would not give this advantage in
the businesse to the King of <hi>England,</hi> no resolution at all was taken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
upon this way; onely the Queen continued to assure the Archduke,
that she would suddenly send some expresse into <hi>Holland,</hi> and that in
the mean while shee would not omit to use such means as were requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
by her Embassadour in Ordinary, to make the United Provinces
quit <hi>Iuliers.</hi> In fine, all that the Queen Regent, or the King of <hi>England</hi>
could effect by their Intercession, was no more but this; That the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Provinces did again declare, that they did not enter into <hi>Iuliers,</hi> to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:55461:72"/>
appropriate it to themselves, but to keep the two Princes from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth into more dangerous disorders, that they were ready to leave
it as soon as the two Princes should be agreed; not in the main cause,
(which might prove a businesse of too great length) but in the point
of possession, which might quickly be adjusted: that they beleeved this
their Declaration would be approved of both in <hi>France</hi> and in <hi>England;</hi>
and that they should be exceeding glad that by the means and Authority
of the two Crowns such an agreement might be the sooner made.</p>
               <p>This Declaration of the United Provinces seemed very justifiable to
the French Embassadour at <hi>Brussels;</hi> and that on the contrary the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
was too hot in his proceedings, and in his resolving with the
Spaniards to make so great a preparation of Arms. <q>They affirmed
that Businesses were not brought to a head or ripenesse by violence,
but by patience, that the United Provinces were naturally slow in their
resolutions, by reason of their form of Government, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
of multitudes, that some one was suddenly to come from
<hi>France</hi> for the accommodation of the affairs of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> which the
Queen would use all possible means to effect. On the contrary, that
Forces did provoke Forces; wherein Fortune did bear a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
sway then counsell; that it was to be beleeved that the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
would quickly be stirring with their Forces, when they should
see the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Archduke begin to move with theirs,
so as the one of them drawing up to hinder the others designes, what
could the successe prove, but that the Truce being broken through
the default of the Archduke, and the Spaniards, a new warre were to
be begun in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Hee afterwards treated with the Archduke about this Declaration of
the United Provinces, and did the best offices he could to suspend the
taking up of Arms; but the Archduke was no wayes satisfied with such
a Declaration; but rather grew the more jealous; he thought that the
United Provinces would spin out the businesse, that they might not quit
<hi>Iuliers;</hi> and that the agreement touching possession between the two
Princes, though severed from the principall cause, would be a businesse
of very great length. Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> had likewise the same suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
who was Camp-Master-Generall of the Catholike Army, and the
Chief Minister of State that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had in <hi>Flanders;</hi> he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
still egged on the Archduke to raise men, and to take to the Field as
soon as all necessaries could be had. So as the Archduke keeping con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
to his former resolution, would not listen to what the French
Embassadour could say, and to the English Agent (the Embassadour in
Ordinary for <hi>England</hi> not being then at <hi>Brussels</hi>) who strengthened his
reasons, by assuring him, that when the extraordinary Embassadour
should come from his King into <hi>Holland,</hi> the Affairs of <hi>Iuliers</hi> would
be accommodated; he answered in resolute terms, That he would not
suspend his resolutions the space of one hour, till the United Provinces
should have quitted <hi>Iuliers.</hi> The affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> were chiefely ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
(as hath been said) by Marquesse <hi>Spinola,</hi> and therefore he took
upon him the care of raising new men, and of providing for all other
things necessary. He was naturally very vigilant, and ever bent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
wholly to the affairs in hand, so as the new Foot and Horse were
quickly raised, and provision taken for what else was necessary to put
the Armie together. <hi>Mastrick</hi> was designed for the rendezvous of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:55461:73"/>
Army; a City situated with a stone bridge over the Mote towards the
confines of the Countrie of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and but eight hours good march di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
from the Town of <hi>Iuliers:</hi> it was now about the beginning of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust,</hi>
and without any longer delay, the Army began to march towards
<hi>Mastrick,</hi> with orders to be in that City by the twentieth of that moneth,
and twelve piece of Cannon were sent thither. This mean while the
United Provinces, when they saw these the Archdukes and King of
<hi>Spains</hi> proceedings, had brought in 3000 Foot into <hi>Iuliers,</hi> so as with
their men that were there before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>twas judged that they had 4000 Foot
in the Town and 300 Horse: they had likewise with great diligence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
the Town, and provided it with victuals and war-like Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
vvhich vvere all of them signs that they vvould maintain it gallantly,
in case the Catholick Army should draw up towards it: they had not as
yet moved any other men, but stood only narrowly observing, vvhich
vvay the Catholick Army vvould take, that they might assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
and bend vvhither it vvas most fitting: But as for vvhat enterprize
the Catholike Army was to fall upon; (the true design being then kept
very secret) the Governours of the United Provinces were not only
doubtful, and generally all the Hereticks, but even the very Court of
<hi>Flanders</hi> were uncertain; to besiege <hi>Iuliers,</hi> which was the cause of the
quarrel, twas thought it would be a difficult undertaking, the Town
being so well provided of all things; and 'twas no question, but that the
United Provinces would either indeavour to relieve it, or would make
some other diversion on the side of <hi>Flanders:</hi> to boot that to go against
the forces of those very Provinces, would be an absolute breach of
Truce; to which it was known that the Archduke was utterly averse:
and therefore there were but few that thought that the Army would
turn towards <hi>Iuliers:</hi> others guessed more narrowly at what did indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue;
that the Catholick Army was either to march against <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> &amp; to
take the government of that City from the Hereticks, who had with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
bereft the Catholicks of it; or else against the very Countries of
<hi>Iuliers</hi> and <hi>Cleves,</hi> to possesse themselves of some part thereof, and thus
to counterpoise the former invasion of the United Provinces. The two
last resolutions were both of them taken: and because the first was
against <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> it is requisit that taking my rise a little higher, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you briefly with the reason which moved the Archduke to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
that enterprize. The City of <hi>Aquisgrane</hi> is subject to the Empire;
and is numbred amongst one of the ancientest, and noblest of all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
The Catholick Religion did formerly flourish very much there,
till in these later times the greatest part of her inhabitants fell into <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
heresie, and many into that of <hi>Calvin.</hi> The government thereof
kept still notwithstanding in the hands of Catholicks; which according
to the custome of the Free Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> consists chiefly in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy,
whereof two Burgomasters are the Heads: but lately in the
year 1610. the Hereticks rising with greater violence then formerly
against the Catholicks, they tooke the Magistracy from them, giving
afterwards no respect to other new commands which came forth in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the Catholicks: they were manifestly favoured in these their
insolencies, particularly by the United Provinces, and by the Prince E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
Palatine: by the United Provinces, that they might have that
neighbouring City the more adherent to them; by the Prince Elector
Palatine out of the same reason: for in the vacancy of the Emperour
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:55461:73"/>
                  <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> he administring that part wherein <hi>Aquisgane</hi> is, had confirm'd
the new heretical Magistracie in possession, and desired to see it so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.
The Emperour had made the Archduke <hi>Albertus,</hi> and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector
of <hi>Cullen</hi> his Trustees to see these his last mandates executed;
which they would gladly have done in an amicable way, and not by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:
divers indeavours and divers diligences were had to this purpose,
but all in vain: for the hereticks would not listen to reason, and they
seemed not to fear Force: but growing every day more insolent, they
had under various pretences brought a Garrison of 600 Dutch Foot into
<hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> saying that they were <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> souldiers, when indeed
they belonged to the United Provinces as most men thought. This was
the condition of <hi>Aquisgrane</hi> at that time when the Catholick Army was
marching towards their Rendezvous; at which conjuncture of time
three Embassadours from the three Ecclesiastical Electors came to <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels</hi>
to treat upon divers things which concerned the Catholick league of
those parts. And because every one thought that they came chiefly for the
affairs of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> this common belief was of great advantage to what the
Catholick Army did afterwards undertake: as soon then as the Army was
ready to march into the field, it came to <hi>Mastrick</hi> at the time appointed.
The government thereof in the Archdukes absence belonged to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
<hi>Spinola,</hi> so he together with the other chief Commanders met on the
twentieth of <hi>August</hi> at the same place. I thought it might very well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
me, after having done what belonged to my charge in the former
negotiations, to be also upon this occasion in the camp, (and it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
of at <hi>Rome</hi> that I should do so) judging that it would be a greater
terrour to the hereticks, and more honourable for the Pope and the
Catholick cause if that the Popes Nuntio should be seen to be in that Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.
The Marquesse of <hi>Gualdalutz,</hi> who was Embassadour from the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> resolved to be there likewise, and therefore
both of us went together from <hi>Brussels,</hi> and accompanied <hi>Spinola</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
we were lodged all three together at <hi>Mastrick,</hi> where we staid two
days, till such time as the whole Army had past over the Mose; into our
lodging came usually all the chief commanders of the Army; amongst
which those of greatest esteem of the Spanish Nation, both for Nobility
of bloud and opinion of valour, were Don <hi>Luis de Velasco;</hi> Don <hi>Fernando
Girone,</hi> and Don <hi>Inego di Borgia,</hi> and of the Dutch; Count <hi>Bucquoi,</hi>
and Count <hi>Henry di Berg.</hi> Don <hi>Luis</hi> was General of the Horse, being
come to that degree from being General of the Artillery, and had been
for a long time Camp-master of the Infantry. Don <hi>Fernando</hi> had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
for many years discharged the place of Camp-master, together with
greater commands apart, and going afterwards into <hi>Spain,</hi> he was by
the King made one of the supream Councel of War, and was return'd
again from that Court with great honour to the Army in <hi>Flanders.</hi> Don
<hi>Inego di Borgia</hi> was then Camp-master also; and Governour of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which is the most important government, and of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
trust which is given in <hi>Flanders:</hi> But he was chiefly commended for
his singular skill in Fortification and Training, which are two so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
points in Militia. Count <hi>Eucquoi</hi> was then General of the Artillery,
who had first for many years been Camp-master of the <hi>Walloon</hi> Infantry;
but being by reason of his known experience called some few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be governour of the Emperours forces in <hi>Germany,</hi> he was not at
that time in the Army. Count <hi>Henry di Berg</hi> was then likewise highly
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:55461:74"/>
esteemed for his Souldiery, and specially for what concerned Horse,
wherein he had had sundry chief Commands, and had alwayes given
proofs of better deserts. The rest of the Colonels and Camp-Masters
of other Nations were all of them men of very good esteem in matter
of warre: But the Count <hi>Emden</hi> was in particular much valued amongst
them: He was a Dutch Colonell, come of one of the chiefest Houses
of that part of <hi>Germany</hi> which lies towards <hi>Flanders;</hi> and whose birth
was alwayes well accompanied with Valour. Divers were the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
as hath been said, concerning the motion of the Catholike Forces:
but it was not as yet known what resolution they would put on; so good
is secresie; and so religiously ought Princes to observe it. The unknown
resolutions being now to bee put in execution, and being to bee made
known by the very execution it self, <hi>Spinola</hi> thought it fitting to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
the whole, first to the chief Commanders, and others of best
respect, which he did thus by word of mouth.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>So many and so great (my most noble Companions) have the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solencies
of the Heretiques been, and the novelty of them in these parts,
as it hath at last been requisite to remedy them by Force; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
with this last of <hi>Iuliers;</hi> what other greater could there be, or
more rash? The United Provinces having had the boldnesse to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade
Newtrall Countries; and to do that now in time of Truce,
which was never done before in the heat of warre: the great zeal, that
is, the great care, which they shew to have to the Publike, hath made
them enter <hi>Iuliers.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ust such pretence as made them rebell against
their Prince, and still perfidiously maintain the same rebellion. The
King and Archduke are then justly incenst by such an action; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent
the which, they have recruited their Army with new Souldiers,
which Army is now met here at <hi>Mastrick;</hi> but before wee fall upon
the affairs of <hi>Iuliers, Aquisgrane</hi> being so neer, wee ought to turn our
Forces against it, so to chastise the Heretiques of that City, according
to the Deputation which the Archduke and Elector of <hi>Cullen</hi> have
thereof from the Emperour. It is sufficiently known to all men, how
affrontedly, and with how much scorn to the Imperiall Mandats, they
have dared to usurp the Magistracie of that City, which was first in
Catholique hands; so as in all reason, so unjust a violence must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest
by a just Force: And this is that which ought first to be done: we
will suddenly passe from thence to the throwing down of the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of <hi>Mulen,</hi> which ought also to be done by the Archduke in the
Emperours Name. Since <hi>Brandenburg</hi> would never obey the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
Mandat procured by the City of <hi>Cullen</hi> to this end, wee will at the
same time enter the Countrey of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and possesse our
selves of what wee can there, as the United Provinces have done in
the Town and Castle of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and as they would have done in other
parts, had they not been hindred by the marching of our Forces.
Though in the similitude of successe, the diversity of counsells will
appear. For theirs would bee, not to go any more out of <hi>Iuliers,</hi>
whereas wee shall be ready to restore all the places which we shall pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
our selves of, to necessitate the United Provinces to do the like,
and leave the Affairs of those Countries in their former condition.
These are for the present the Kings and the Archdukes resolutions,
which I have thought good thus briefly to acquaint you with; and
this the order which is therein to be observed. It now remains that
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:55461:74"/>
we see what the effects will be; and we may beleeve that there will be
no difficulty at all in them, onely this present Expedition may prove
displeasing unto us in this behalf, that we shall have the Keys of <hi>Aquis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grane</hi>
presented us before they be demanded; and that for our pastime
wee shall see the Fortification of <hi>Mulen</hi> slighted; and all the rest of
our endeavours follow. All which things will prove but sport and
pastime; wee having formerly been wont to march with the enemy
on our Flanck; and to place and finish our sieges with the enemie
in our face. We shall not now march with any Forces to withstand us;
and say that the United Provinces shall move after us, (as it may bee
beleeved they will) shall wee not have gained so much time, as our
principall designs shall not possibly meet with any disturbance? So as
having such advantage over our enemies, the United Provinces and
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> will be forc'd to suffer the controverted Countries to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
into their first condition. They will be inforc'd hereafter to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain
from Novelties and Usurpations: and lastly, the controversie
concerning that Countrey will of necessity (as it is just it should) be
ended by the ordinary way of the Empires Tribunall. Fraud is not
alwayes favoured by justice; but the perfidious are oft times punisht
by their own perfidiousnesse. Thus by securing our Catholike neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
we shall likewise render our own Princes safety the more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure;
and thus the world by this new occurrencie shall see, that the
King and Archduke do never move their Forces, but when necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
either by just defence to maintain their own, or to free others from
unjust oppression.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinola</hi> spoke thus; and his discourse was suddenly by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
spread abroad among the Souldiers, who were all very much
joyed thereat. <hi>Spinola</hi> went from <hi>Mastrick</hi> on the 22. of August, and
was the same day in the Army; wherein, in all were 2500. Spaniards
with 800. Irish, under three Camp-Masters, which were Don <hi>Inico di
Borgia, Simon Autanes,</hi> and Don <hi>Iohn di Menestis:</hi> 3000. Dutch, under
their Colonel, the Count of <hi>Embden:</hi> 1700. Burgonians under the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
of <hi>Balanson</hi> their Camp-Master: and 9000. Walloons under three
Camp-Masters, the Count <hi>Ostrat,</hi> the Signior <hi>della Moteria,</hi> and the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
<hi>di Golesin.</hi> These were all Foot, wherein was wanting a Brigado
of 2000. Italian Foot, under the Camp-Master <hi>Marcillo del Giadice,</hi> who
were lodged neer the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and who had orders not to stir, it being
intended that they should bee set on work in those parts. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
7. Companies of Horse were likewise left there abouts; and 18
other Companies came to <hi>Mastrick.</hi> The Camp then consisted of 18000
Foot, and 2500. Horse, with 12. pieces of Cannon, besides the Italiar
Foot, and 700. Horse, which came all to their rendezvous the said day in
a large field, between <hi>Mastrick</hi> and <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> where the Parado was
made. A stately sight in truth, and worthy to bee frequently seen, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Forces which Christians so often turn against themselves, were more
joyntly turned against the enemies to the Name of Christ. The Army
moved from the rendezvous in this order, towards <hi>Aquisgrane.</hi> Dor
<hi>Lewis di Falasco,</hi> Generall of the Horse, marched before the Foot with
600. Horse, the Foot followed after in four Bodies, one after another.
In the first were the Spanish Foot, with four piece of Artillery in their
Front. In the second, the Dutch and Burgonians joyntly. In the third
6000. Walloons with the rest of the Artillery; and in the last, the othe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

3000. Walloons; after which came 600. Horse, which closed up the
Army in the rear. The other 600. Horse were gone with <hi>Bartholomew
Sanchius,</hi> Lieutenant Generall of the Horse, before the Army moved,
to possesse a Passe whereby they might hinder the succour which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
might be sent from <hi>Iuliers</hi> to the Heretikes of <hi>Aquisgrane;</hi> which
City is not above four easie hours march from <hi>Iuliers;</hi> but no succour
was sent them neither from thence nor yet from any other part. There
was not above two hours march from the rendezvous to <hi>Aquisgrane;</hi> so
as the same day all the Army was quartered about it. <hi>Aquisgrane</hi> is a
City of a large circuit, and lies almost wholly in a plain, save that in
one part the earth rises. It is invironed with a Wall of ancient stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
not any wayes fortified. In the upper side it is commanded by
certain little Hills, within a musket shot of the Walls, so as the Cann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

may at pleasure play upon the houses. It was generally thought that there
being no more Souldiers there but those 600. Foot, which I spoke of
before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the people not being accustomed to Arms, the City Gates
would bee suddenly thrown open: But the Heretikes continuing their
contumacy, &amp; being fomented in particular by one of the Burgomasters,
who had been a chief Instrument of the violence used to the Catholikes;
they would first hear what Propositions should be made unto them, by the
Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and the Archdukes Deputies; who entring the next
morning into the City, they acquainted them with what Commission
their Princes had from the Emperour, and desired that it might be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
The Magistracie took time to Answer, and deferr'd to give their
Answer longer then they should have done. <hi>Spinola</hi> wondred at this
delay, so as hee sent Count <hi>Henry de Berg</hi> into the City, to exhort the
Magistracy presently to obey, for otherwise their Cannon should forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
make entrance for them; and to make his threats the more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
he gave present order for the planting of some pieces upon one of
those Hills which did most command the City. At last at three dayes
end the Heretikes were reduced to obedience, and sent forth the 600.
Foot which they had within, so as the government was quickly put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the hands of Catholikes. And to secure the Catholike party, which
was farre inferiour to the Hereticall, a Garison of 1200. Dutch, of the
Count <hi>Emdens</hi> Regiment were left in <hi>Aquisgrane.</hi> The Heretikes feared
lest the City should have been sackt by the Army: But <hi>Spinola</hi> had
strict command from the Arch-duke at his departure from <hi>Brussels,</hi> not
to suffer any such thing to be done. So as neither did the Souldiers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Town, nor did any other disorder insue. At this time, after so
long delay, it was at last resolved in <hi>France,</hi> that Monsieur <hi>di Rifugie</hi>
one of the chiefest Councellors of that Court should be sent into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi>
But upon the Armies meeting at the rendezvous. The English
Embassadour was already arrived in <hi>Holland,</hi> and by the English Agent
in <hi>Brussels,</hi> did forthwith very much presse the Arch-duke, that hee
would cause the further proceeding of Arms to cease, giving assured
hopes that the United Provinces would accept of the Proposition made
by his King of depositing <hi>Iuliers</hi> into Neutrall hands: To which the
Arch-duke would by no means consent. Soon after the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
declared that they did accept of the King of <hi>Englands</hi> Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and that for the manner of doing it, they would refer themselves
to the Embassadours of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> who were then with
them: the English Agent did therefore with much fervency urge his
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:55461:75"/>
former desire; and the French Embassadour joyned with him therein:
but the Archduke being incouraged by the successe at <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
them; that he desired the depositing might first be done; and
that he would then presently stop the further proceeding of the Army:
otherwise that he would never consent thereunto upon bare promises;
so as without any further losse of time, <hi>Spinola</hi> after he had reduced the
affairs of <hi>Aquisgrane</hi> according to his desire, entred presently into the
Country of <hi>Iuliers;</hi> and marched with his Army against the Town of
<hi>Duren,</hi> which is one of the chiefest of that Country: Those of the Town
received in a Garrison of 600 Dutch, without any contradiction, as did
some other Towns of small importance near <hi>Duren:</hi> at which time the
Italians had possest themselves of <hi>Orsoi;</hi> a place of important situation
upon the Rhine: and they had already begun to throw a bridge of boats
over the same River, at <hi>Remburg. Spinola</hi> marched that way, and in
few dayes march brought the Army thither; and whilest the Army
were upon their march, he went on the other side the Rhine to make
a visit to the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> (the Palatine was now called Duke, his
Father being just then dead) and his dutches, who were then at <hi>Dosseldorp:</hi>
at the same time, the fortification at <hi>Mulen</hi> was thrown down without
any obstacle, to the great joy of those of <hi>Cullen.</hi> The Catholick Army
past the River at <hi>Remburg,</hi> and turned suddenly upon <hi>Wessell,</hi> a Town
which lies a little lower upon the same River: in former times the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Wessell</hi> was comprized under the Dukedome of <hi>Cleves;</hi> but for
many years of late, licentiousnesse increasing with heresie, it became
almost wholly free, and was governed as are the Hans Towns of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi>
so as since then they have acknowledged the Dukes of <hi>Cleves</hi> rather
as their protectors then as their Princes. The Inhabitants are almost
all Calvinists, and therefore have chiefly combined with the hereticks
of those parts, who professe the same sect, and particularly with the
United Provinces: from whom they have received most incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
both by their Forces, and by the neighbourhood of their frontiers:
the seat of <hi>Wessell</hi> is exceeding considerable, for on the one side it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
the Rhine, and on the other the Lippa, a River which fals into
the Rhine: The Town is of a good circuit, and sufficiently fortified on
one side; full of Inhabitants, given much to traffique, and so abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all things as it furnishes the neighbouring parts with all necessaries.
The inhabitants of <hi>Wessell</hi> were much astonished, and affrighted when
they saw the Army draw near it; they did not expect that the <hi>Flanders</hi>
forces would reflect upon them, for they perswaded themselves, that
their Town should be dealt withall likewise as Newtral, and as one of
the Hans Towns of <hi>Germany.</hi> They had therefore formerly refused to
receive a garrison offered them by the United Provinces; who having
gathered many of their men together upon those frontieres, and when
the Catholick Army drew near unto it, had offered to succour <hi>Wessell,</hi>
yea, and if need should be, to take openly upon them their protection:
and doubtesly if <hi>Wessell</hi> had taken in any garrison of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
<hi>Spinola</hi> would never have accosted it: for his orders from the
Archduke were, not to wage war with any of the forces of the United
Provinces, nor to give no occasion of the breach of Truce. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
Army did soon begirt the Town on all sides, which seeming at first
to make some resistance, and having made many shot out of the Town
and killed some of the Catholick Army, forced <hi>Spinola</hi> to open his
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:55461:76"/>
Trenches, and plant his battery on the suburbs side: which when they
began to play, the inhabitants finding they were not able to defend
themselves, and that all succour was excluded from them, they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
at the end of four dayes to yield upon some conditions; the chief
article whereof was, that when the United Provinces should restore the
Town and Castle of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> the Town of <hi>Wessell</hi> should likewise be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to its former condition <hi>Spinola</hi> advanced no further with his Army:
his men were already too much diminished by reason of many garrisons
which he had placed in sundry parts, and was still placing on both sides
of the Rhine, so as he would not place any as he might have done in <hi>Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi>
and <hi>Res,</hi> two good Towns upon the Rhine, and near <hi>Wessell:</hi>
whereupon Count <hi>Maurice</hi> losing no opportunity, and having with him
14000 Foot and 3000 Horse in the neighbouring parts, suddenly possest
himself of those two Towns, and afterwards of many other lesser ones
in the same controverted Countries, on each side the Rhine: He had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
received strict commission from the United Provinces not to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with the King of <hi>Spains</hi> nor the Archdukes Forces, to the end that all
occasion of the breach of Truce might be likewise shunn'd on their sides;
so as it was very observable that in these movings or Forces, the Souldiers
of the one Army did not hinder the others proceedings, but oft times
met one with another and proceeded friendly together; and he who
came first took first possession without any manner of disturbance. <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi>
took up his quarters near <hi>Wessel,</hi> and Count <hi>Maurice</hi> his near <hi>Res,</hi>
within two hours march one of another; and the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> and
his men vvhich vvere 4000 Foot and 400 Horse, joyned with <hi>Spinola,</hi>
as did also seven hundred of <hi>Brandenburgs</hi> Horse, and a Regiment of Foot
of the Prince Elector Palatine vvith <hi>Maurice.</hi> It cannot be said what
commotion the taking of <hi>Wessell</hi> caused in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
and amongst all the hereticks; for fear lest the <hi>Spaniards</hi> out of
various pretences might appropriate unto themselves a purchase of such
concernment. Monsieur <hi>De Refuge</hi> vvas this mean vvhile come to <hi>Brus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
and going immediately vvith the Lieger French Embassadour to
<hi>Gaunt,</hi> vvhere the Archduke and the Infanta his Wife, then vvere; the
first proposition vvhich he made vvas, that a suspension of Arms might be
had on all sides, to the which the Archduke answered, that he might go
to <hi>Holland,</hi> and make the motion first there. <hi>Refuge</hi> before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would have had the Archduke promise to give way thereunto on his
side, but could not get him so to do: yet the Archduke shewed some
good inclinations thereunto, &amp; told <hi>Refuge,</hi> that he should be glad such a
Treaty for suspension of Arms might be had, as had already been moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
between <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Maurice;</hi> which did not take effect by reason of
divers difficulties that were therein met withall; nor was there any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
talke of suspension: wherefore as soon as <hi>Refuge</hi> was gone from
<hi>Gaunt</hi> and come to <hi>Holland,</hi> he and the English Embassadour were of
opinion, that the readiest way to reconcile the two Princes was, that they
two Embassadours should go to the Armies, and endeavour that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between deputies might be had in some fitting place there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts,
by whose means the desired accommodation might be had. To
this purpose <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Wotton</hi> went to the Armies, and having spoken
with <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi> with <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> they agreed
upon a conference in <hi>Santen,</hi> a Town within the Dukedome of <hi>Cleves,</hi>
near the Rhine, but on the contrary side, and almost equally distant
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:55461:76"/>
from the one and the other Camp, Here met <hi>Refuge</hi> on the behalf of the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and the French Embassadour who was resident in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
Wotton</hi> and the English Lieger Embassadour resident in <hi>Holland</hi>
likewise, on the behalf of the King of <hi>England; Pietro Pecquio</hi> Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and the Counsellor <hi>Wiscer</hi> for the Archduke; Three
Deputies for the Elector of <hi>Cullen;</hi> Seven for the seven United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces;
Two for the Elector Palatine; the which two did likewise repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
the Union of all the heretick League of <hi>Germany:</hi> Three for <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi>
and three for <hi>Newburg.</hi> The conference began in the beginning
of <hi>October:</hi> The chief drift of the French and English Embassadours,
and the hereticks Deputies was, that this new agreement should relate
to the former, which by procurement of the late King of <hi>France,</hi> of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> of the United Provinces, and of the other Princes of
the heretical League of <hi>Germany</hi> insued between the Duke of <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi>
and Duke of <hi>Newburg,</hi> as was shewn at first: and therefore those
Embassadours and Deputies began to proceed joyntly in the conference,
leaving out the Deputies of the Elector of <hi>Cullen,</hi> and of the Archduke:
yet <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Wotton</hi> acquainted these others with all that was done,
and indeavoured, in all other demenour to appear, as Mediators, not as
parties; their chiefest diffidence was notwithstanding in the Archdukes
deputies, out of the aim they had that when this new agreement should be
made, it might not be acknowledged as from the Authority of the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> and of the Archduke. These were the jealousies which were
had at the beginning of the conference: it was not doubted by any of the
Embassadours or Deputies, but that the too great communion in all
things to which the two Princes were necessitated by the former
agreement had been the chiefe cause of dissension between them;
therefore care was had in this new agreement which was in Treaty, to
make such a division as each of them should injoy severally half of the
pretended states; and that except it were their Titles and some other
things of common use, they should in all the rest be wholly divided
one from another: one of the chief difficulties lay in the Town of <hi>Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi>
because that being munited by a good Castle, 'twas thought that
Town might be advantagious to him to whose share it should fall: it was
therefore propounded that the Castle should be dismantled on the side
towards the Town; or else that <hi>Iuliers</hi> should remain in the hands of
the United Provinces, and <hi>Wessell</hi> in the Archdukes hand, and both of
these to be restored when the differences should be decided between the
two Princes: and as for the main division, it was propounded, that one
of the two Princes should divide, and the other should chuse; or else that
each of them should possesse his several half for six moneths, and then
change halves for other six moneths, and that this course should be
still continued: As concerning the dismantling of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> together with the Deputies of the United
Provinces, and other hereticks, inclined more to this proposal then to
leave that Town in possession of the United Provinces, to the end that
<hi>Wessell</hi> might not remain in the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Archdukes hands:
and for what concerned the main division, <hi>Newburg</hi> would have willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accepted of the first proposal, which certainly was the justest, and
likeliest to endure: but <hi>Brandenburg</hi> seemed to be more inclined to the
second, to which the Deputies of the United Provinces did likewise
stick very closely. To say truth, such a bargain appear'd very strange,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:55461:77"/>
for it might easily be foreseen, what confusion it would bring with it:
it was long disputed between the Embassadours and Deputies upon this
point; and the chiefest contention was between <hi>Refuge</hi> and <hi>Pecchi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi>
who because he had been Embassadour in ordinary from the Archduke, in
in <hi>France,</hi> and knew how much the French did favour the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
did therefore oppose <hi>Refuge</hi> stifly when occasion served: at last
the opiniatrecy of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and of the United Provinces was such, as
they drew over the Embassadours to prefer the second proposal of alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
possession, before the first of each Princes contenting himself with the
half of the state apart. <hi>Spinola</hi> did presently acquaint the Archduke
herewith, to whom for this purpose he sent the Count <hi>Octavio</hi> Viscount,
when being sent a little before into <hi>Spain,</hi> was now returned with a new
supply of 300000 crowns, and was come to the Army to treat with <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola.</hi>
The Archduke desired very much to see the two Princes accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that Arms should be laid down, and that all danger of breaking the
Truce might cease; the which was greatly likewise desired in <hi>Spain,</hi> as
Viscount related: but on the other side the Archduke was much averse
to the second proposal, thinking that by it the accommodation would
not last long; and that by this means the discord between the two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
would rather be deferr'd then ended. The Spanish ministers of state
were likewise very averse thereunto, and of all the rest the Embassadour
did much presse the Archduke, that the King might be fully advertised, &amp;
that his will might be known, before the businesses in treaty should be
fully concluded: The Archdukes resolution hereupon was, to send
Viscount back again to the Army with directions to <hi>Spinola,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
that the conference might be drawn out in length as long as possibly
he could, that he might have time to advise thereof first in <hi>Spain;</hi> which if
it could not be done, he then left it to him to do upon the place what time
and necessity should counsel: and because this was no better then to
leave him a large liberty to agree; the Spaniards storm'd cruelly, and
chiefly that <hi>Wessells</hi> should be restored, and so great a purchase be lost
which neither cost money, bloud, nor expence of time, without the
Kings knowledge: whereupon the Embassadour resolved to dispatch
away a messenger speedily to <hi>Spain,</hi> and writ thus by him to the King.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>How much the getting of <hi>Wessell</hi> concerns your Majesties affairs in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> the sorrow of your enemies do sufficiently manifest: they
are much displeased to see your Majesties Ensigns in the most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
seat of the whole Rhine; and that that should be your Majesties
magazine of Arms in <hi>Flanders,</hi> which you may at any time upon any
occurrence draw from thence and remove whither your Majesties own
occasions, or those of your Queens, which are never sever'd from
yours, shall most require in these parts: then since there cannot be a
greater purchase, great consideration ought to be had before your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie
deprive your self of it. The Archduke, and some other of your
Majesties ministers of state, fear that if <hi>Wessell</hi> be not suddenly resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the Truce with the United Provinces will break: and I and many
other of my opinion believe that they will rather the more willingly
continue it, out of hopes they may get <hi>Wessell</hi> from you by way of
Treaty; for they see 'tis vain to think of getting it by force, and that
then the Truce would be broken with much more advantage to your
Majesty then to them: But if <hi>Wessell</hi> be restored, and that be done
which is so much desired by the United Provinces, and by your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:55461:77"/>
greatest enemies; what security can there be had that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
themselves will not indeavour the same invasion? is not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of <hi>Iuliers</hi> fresh in memory? and of how much greater impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
will this be unto them then that? <hi>Iuliers</hi> is not seated upon their
Frontiers; whereas <hi>Wessell</hi> lies upon their principal Ports: Will your
Majestie know the true and right intentions of themselves, and of their
friends: They have imbraced (as your Majestie shall understand by
another Letter of mine) as the finall agreement between <hi>Brandenburg</hi>
and <hi>Newburg,</hi> an overture, whence confusion, and not quiet is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
between them; not peace in those parts, but greater troubles
then before: nor do they this with any other intention, but that the
United Provinces may have better opportunitie hereafter, to effect
that to their own advantage in the future troubles, which they have so
shamefully dared to do in the past troubles: yet for all this I am not
against the surrendering of <hi>Wessell,</hi> when it may stand with other more
important respects: but I would have it to be done, as also the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Santen</hi> to be concluded, when your Majestie shall be fully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the whole proceedings, and when they shall have your
consent thereunto, and not before. All times will serve for losses,
but not for acquisitions: nay, when occasion is not laid hold of, she
escapes, and oft times faces about and proves adverse: those happy
successes which have insued, are chiefly due to your Majesties most
glorious Forces. And now that Justice and Fortune seem to contend
which of them shall favour them most; your Majestie will certainly
so husband this propitiousnesse, as that your wonted wisdom may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
therein be admired.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These were the contents of the Letter; but before Viscounts return
to the Army, it being every day more clearly seen what disorders would
arise from the point of alternate possession, another way was found out,
and finally concluded, which was: that as equal a division as might be,
being made of the controverted states, and the lots being cast, he of the
two Princes should chuse first, whose Lot should be first drawn: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they had already agreed upon the other lesse considerable points,
they came at last to agree the whole capitulation; the substance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was this: <q>that the Souldiers which were introduced into whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
part of the said Countries should immediately be drawn from
thence: that the two Princes should ingage themselves, not to put any
Town of the said Countries into any whatsoever third hand; that all
Fortifications made by eitherside since May last should be demolished;
that al those who were either gone out, or driven out of those Countrys,
should be restored to their goods, offices and benefices: that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations
which had been made either in the Church or state, should
be reordered: that the two Princes should reside each of them severally
in the division that should fall unto him; provided that the said Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
should be thus divided: To wit, the Dukedome of <hi>Cleves,</hi> the
Countries of <hi>Marca,</hi> and of <hi>Ravensburg,</hi> the Lordship of <hi>Ravesten,</hi> and
some other Lordships and feudatories in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders,</hi> on the
one part; and on the other, the Dukedomes of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> and of <hi>Berg,</hi>
with all their dependencies. That each of the Princes should have
that part of those dominions, which should fall to his share by casting
lots: and that each of them should govern their proportion in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
name: that the offices and benefices of the said Countries should
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:55461:78"/>
be bestowed by those two Princes, being disposed of Alternately each
of them their moneth about, accordingly as they should fall; and that
the publique revenues should be equally divided between them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All which things the Princes were to ingage themselves by promise,
and in the word of a Prince to keep inviolably. These Articles were
subscribed by the Embassadours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> by the deputies
of the Elector Palatine of <hi>Rhine,</hi> and by those of the United Provinces;
all which bound their Kings, Princes, and Superiours to see the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
made good; and this was subscribed only by the Embassadours
and above said Deputies, because as I have said, they pretended that the
present agreement should have relation to the former, which was made
by the two Princes by the authoritie and intercession of the same
Crowns, and the prenominated Heretique Potentates. <hi>Brandenburg,</hi>
and <hi>Newburg</hi> did afterwards subscribe and ratifie the capitulation, and
obliged themselves to observe them: The agreement being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
the first Article which was to be put in execution, was to draw
the Armies out of those Countries: 'Twas thought necessary that the
removing them from thence should be done with such cautiousnesse, as
there should be no occasion of future leavying of Forces, through any
such novelties as had before hapned: Whereupon a treaty was had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Spinola</hi> and Count <hi>Maurice,</hi> whereby each of them should oblige
themselves expresly in writing to bring in no more forces in time to
come, nor to endeavour any invasion in those Countries; which writing
was afterwards to be ratified by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Archduke on
the one side, and by the United Provinces on the other side; but there
arose presently divers difficulties about the form of the words. <hi>Spinola</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
the declaration might be free and absolute; <hi>Maurice</hi> would have it
only refer to the agreement at <hi>Santen;</hi> which <hi>Spinola</hi> thought not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
because the Archdukes Deputies were not suffered to subscribe
unto the agreement: some dayes were spent about the form of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration:
and the Embassadours laboured very much to contrive it so
as it might satisfie all parties, but still the difficulties grew the greater,
the more they strove to overcome them. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>Twas now <hi>December,</hi> and the
Embassadours growing weary of these new delaies which arose in the
execution of the Agreement, resolved to be gone: when the messenger
who was sent to <hi>Madrid</hi> by the Spanish Embassadour who was at <hi>Brussels,</hi>
returned from thence to the Catholique Camp, who brought perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
commission that the agreement at <hi>Santen</hi> should not be fully conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
without the Kings privity, and that in the mean while <hi>VVessell</hi>
should not be restored, and that the state of affairs should continue in
their present condition; at this mans arrival there was a stay made of all
things. The Embassadours much incensed, would tarry no longer, but
departed suddenly for <hi>Holland:</hi> and the other Deputies returned to their
own homes. <hi>Maurice</hi> distributed his Army into divers parts; and <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola</hi>
did the like: leaving 3000 Foot in <hi>Wessell,</hi> part Spaniards, part
Walloons, and 300 Horse, with a Fort on their flank on the other side of
the Rhine. <hi>Spinola</hi> returned afterwards to <hi>Brussels,</hi> whither Duke
<hi>Newburg</hi> resolved likewise to come, to thanke the Archduke for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
he had received from him, and to speak with him at nearer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of his affairs: a little before the conclusion of the Treaty at <hi>Santen,</hi>
Count <hi>Zalleren</hi> was come to the Catholique Camp, who was sent from
the Emperour to the Archduke to endeavour that the agreement might
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:55461:78"/>
not be concluded any wayes to the prejudice of the Imperiall Authority
or Interest: <hi>Matthias</hi> would have had it ordered so, as that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
Countries of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> might rest in him by way of
sequestration, till the main cause should be decided: And hee likewise
desired that no agreement might in any means bee made between <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi>
and <hi>Newburg,</hi> to the prejudice of the Duke of <hi>Saxony.</hi> Count
<hi>Zoleren</hi> prest very much upon these two points. He came afterwards
to <hi>Brussels,</hi> at the same time that <hi>Newburg</hi> resolved to go thither, and
did in person renew his desires with the Arch-duke so much the more,
for that he had the fitter occasion to do so, by reason that the affairs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

<hi>Spinola</hi> were come to <hi>Brussels,</hi> the Arch-duke desirous fully to justifie in
<hi>Spain</hi> whatsoever had been done on his behalf, gave a particular account
unto the King of all that was treated on, and concluded at <hi>Santen,</hi> and
of the difficulties which arose afterwards between <hi>Maurice</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi>
about the withdrawing of their Forces, all that he added was rather to
shew his rescenting what the Embassadour had written, to justifie what
he himself had done.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Your Majesties (said hee) may then haply comprehend that it was
not possible to hinder the agreement, since the issue thereof depended
upon those who did subscribe it. The resolution of entring upon, and
of restoring, was at first taken, as your Majestie very well knows
by your knowledge and consent, nor can the particular promise bee
denied, which was made to restore <hi>Wessell</hi> when <hi>Iuliers</hi> should be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

publike evils beginning thus to creep, doth at last break forth into
high flames of Troubles. In brief, whether will your Majestie have
the Truce continue, and have <hi>Wessell</hi> restored; or will you have it
broken, which may easily bee done by keeping possession of <hi>Wessell?</hi>
I cannot think your Majestie can so farre undervalue those reasons
which induced you to lay down Arms, as that you will bee now in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>duced
to reassume them without apparent necessity. For what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us, I do not finde our affairs much bettered yet: nor do I esteem
the acquisition of <hi>Wessell</hi> to bee of so great Importance, as that for it
<hi>Flanders</hi> bee to be again involved in a more bitter warre then was the
former. This restitution is particularly due to the Tribunall of
publike Faith, and those actions may be esteemed very advantagious
which by the sole end of Justice, shall also compasse the end of profit
May your Majesty bee pleased to consider the good successe that wee
have had. How well are the affairs of <hi>Aquisgrane,</hi> and <hi>Mulen</hi> setled?
How well are the Duke of <hi>Newburgs</hi> affairs restablisht? and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike

The Arch-duke wrote concisely thus unto the King; and exhorted
him with much efficacie, that hee would give way to the things as they,
were agitated and concluded. It was two moneths before any answer
came from the King, who would well weigh the resolution which was
to bee taken in so important an affair. And at last his answer was this;
<q>That the agreement at <hi>Santen</hi> should be put in execution, that <hi>Wessell,</hi>
and all the other places possest should bee restored, when the United
Provinces should do the like; with such security, as there should be no
more cause of fear, of their making hereafter any new invasion in the
Countreys of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers.</hi>
                  </q> As soon as this answer was come,
the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> went from <hi>Brussels</hi> to <hi>Germany,</hi> to take possession
of his Patrimoniall estate: and as for the execution of what was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on in <hi>Santen</hi> he left the disposall thereof, and of his interest there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

freely to the Arch-duke. Hee had stayed about some two moneths in
<hi>Brussels,</hi> in which time hee oft-times discoursed at large, with me about
his affairs: and seemed to bee much bound to the Pope, who had so
affectionately assisted him; and in all other things shewed such wisdom
and piety, as the winning of such a Prince, at that time over to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike
cause, particularly in <hi>Germany,</hi> was to be really esteemed a great
purchase to the universall cause of the Church. Diverse negotiations
were at this time had between him and Count <hi>Zoleren; Zoleren</hi> would
have had him to have cast himself freely upon the Emperors Judgement
in the cause of the controverted states; and that hee should have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Electour of <hi>Saxony</hi> for his companion in the possession of those
Countreys, that so hee might the easier drive out <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who
openly declared his con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umacy against the Emperour. <hi>Newburg</hi> seemed
willing to submit himself to the Imperiall Judgement, but upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that his present affairs might not be impaired by the uncertainty
of future hopes. The Arch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>duke had received full Authority from the
Emperour to agree those motions made by <hi>Zoleren;</hi> but hee thought it
fitting to see first what the issue of the agreement at <hi>Santen</hi> would bee:
wherefore though <hi>Newburg</hi> went away, <hi>Zoleren</hi> stayed at <hi>Brussels;</hi> and
the Arch-duke began suddenly after the resolution was come from
<hi>Spain,</hi> to set on foot the endeavouring a promise of not introducing any
Forces for the future, under whatsoever pretence into the controverted
Countreys of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers,</hi> not between <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Maurice,</hi> but
between himself and the United Provinces. Many moneths were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
consumed with much prolixity; for the negotiation proceeded very
slowly, which was to bee mannaged by Letters, sometime<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> by the way of
<hi>France,</hi> sometimes by the way of <hi>England,</hi> sometimes by the way of
<hi>Holland.</hi> Many were the difficulties, none of which could ever bee
overcome. That which pleased one party, raised jealousie in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The United Provinces following Count <hi>Maurice</hi> his first sence,
would that this promise should have reference to the agreement at <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi>
and the Arch-duke seconded therein by <hi>Spinola,</hi> said that was not
fitting to be done. They discoursed of referring this promise to the two
Kings of <hi>France</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> without any mention of the agreement
at <hi>Santen,</hi> but hereunto did the Count <hi>Zoleren</hi> oppose himself, pretending
that they should first addresse themselves to the Emperour. Thus amidst
these contestations, and other pertinacious niceties of words, all Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
finally ceased; and Count <hi>Zoleren,</hi> after having tarried six moneths
at <hi>Brussels,</hi> returned likewise towards <hi>Germany:</hi> This mean while the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:55461:79"/>
Spanish Forces remain in the states of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers</hi> on the one side,
and on the other those of the United Provinces: and it is to be believed
they may tarry there a good while: as far as the exteriour Title goes,
<hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Newburg</hi> enjoy and do possesse the government: but in
states he who hath the power, hath the possession: and petty Princes
may learn by this new example, not easily to call in greater Potentates
to their assistance.</p>

in the latter years of the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the
fourth,<note place="margin">An. 1609.</note> one of the greatest and most memorable
Kings that that Kingdom ever had: when unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly
about the end of the year 1609. there
arose a sad accident, which presently disordered all
things, and ended at last in the Kings death. <hi>Henry</hi>
had won great glory in War so long, as being first
an Heretique, and then a Catholique, he was compelled to use his Forces
against his Domestick and Forrain Enemies, who withstood his accesse
to that Crown; which when he was arrived at, and had laid down his
arms both at home and abroad, he afterwards purchased no lesse glory
by making <hi>France</hi> flourish for many years in great peace and prosperitie;
so that his praise was noised over the whole world; and 'twas generally
held, that of a long time there had not been a King of a clearer renown
and who was better parted for government either in Peace or War: His
fame seemed only to be a little clouded by his having appear'd to be,
and by his being still too much given to the pleasures of love; so as he
might be said to be therein a rival to <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Caesar;</hi> as well as
he was to both of them in unvanquisht military valour: he was married
to <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Medicis,</hi> a Princesse very vertuous, beautiful, and fruitful:
yet this so strait a tie could not suffice to bridle this his domineering pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion:
but commonly glutted with that delight which he enjoyed without
contest, he did not forbear to contract new loves, and to passe from one
to another according as he met with new objects to kindle new desires.
A little before his death there appeared at Court a rare beauty, who had
drawn upon her all the eyes of the Court, and those of the King more then
all the rest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:55461:80"/>
This beautiful Lady was <hi>Margaret</hi> of <hi>Memerancy,</hi> daughter to the
Constable of <hi>France.</hi> The King from first likings grew so passionately
to love her, as not able to conceal his flame, it broke forth in many out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
demonstrations, till every body took notice of it. The Prince of
<hi>Conde</hi> was cousin to the King; who in his youth being born and bred up
an heretique, did afterwards embrace the Catholique Faith: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
none other of the bloud royal was so near a kin unto the King, al the
Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> had acknowledged <hi>Conde</hi> as lawful successour to
the Crown, before the King had married his second wife and had children
by her. The King having made sure his own succession, <hi>Conde</hi> remained
first Prince of the bloud: A place of great prerogative in <hi>France,</hi> and
which bore great consequences with it: they began already to think of
a wife for him, and the aforenamed <hi>Margaret,</hi> the Constables daughter
was judged to be fittest consort for him. <hi>Conde</hi> was then about 22 years
old, and he was not ignorant of the Kings new affection: but thinking
his marrying of <hi>Margaret</hi> would be a sufficient remedy to make the King
bridle his passion, the marriage proceeded, and the wedding was solemnly
celebrated; but he soon found he was deceived. The greater the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles
grew on <hi>Margarets</hi> behalf, the greater grew the Kings heat: He for
a while concealed his fire, which growing the more intense by being kept
in, it at last broke forth into high towring flames. Finding he was no
longer able to make resistance, he went about by divers means and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
to compasse his desires: <hi>Conde</hi> watched him; and being full of
thoughts, he at last imagined that the best means to save his honour was
to remove his wife from the Court; whereupon he carried her to a
house of his some leagues distant from <hi>Paris</hi> towards <hi>Picardy:</hi> when the
King knew this, he was highly moved; hatred was sodainly joyned unto
his love; so as first under colourable pretences, and afterwards by down
right threats he made <hi>Conde</hi> be told, who came often by starts to <hi>Paris,</hi>
that he should do well to bring his wife to Court: and in the mean time
not being able to bear with her absence any longer, he (as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
reported) disguised, &amp; accompanied but by a few, one day rid ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
leagues to see her in a certain place where she was to hunt, <hi>Conde</hi> feign'd
to be willing to do what the King desired, and to this end seemed as if he
went to fetch his wife, but with a firm resolution in secret, to carry her
out of <hi>France:</hi> nor was he long in doing it. All things necessary being
prepared for his flight rather then for his departure; he and his wife with
two of her women went into a Coach of eight horses, and being follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
only by three or four of his most trusty servants, and some pacing
horses he went unexpectedly towards the Frontiers of <hi>Flanders</hi> on the
side of <hi>Artoise,</hi> which was the nearest part of those Countries: when the
Coach-horses were tired; he and his wife got upon the pacing geldings.
The hazard of his honour did not only adde wings to <hi>Conde</hi>'s haste, but
even the hazard of his life, which the Kings anger called to his mind;
so as he never staied till he came to <hi>Landresie,</hi> a considerable Town on
the Frontiers of <hi>Artoise,</hi> where he thought he might with safety tarry a
while: he suddenly sent a Gentleman of his from thence, to acquaint
Archduke <hi>Albertus</hi> with what had befallen him, who was then for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation
at <hi>Marimonte,</hi> with the Infanta his wife: a place situated towards
the Frontiers of <hi>France;</hi> and desired that he might have leave to come
unto him himself in person. The Archduke feared lest the King of <hi>France</hi>
might be hereat offended, so as in civil terms he refused to receive him:
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:55461:80"/>
and also let him understand that he would not suffer him to tarry within
his territories, through the which he might notwithstanding freely pass, if
he would go unto any other part. <hi>Conde</hi> not being suffered to tarry in the
Archdukes states, went presently to <hi>Iuliers,</hi> where then the Archduke
<hi>Leopold</hi> was, being sent thither by the Emperour, about the differences
that hapned about the succession of the Dukedome of <hi>Cleves,</hi> the Duke
whereof was dead without children: from hence he past to <hi>Cullen,</hi> and
had from thence according to the ancient freedom of the Imperial
Towns, a safe conduct to bring him thither. This was the occasion, and
this the successe of the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s flight. But the King of <hi>France</hi>
understanding the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s resolution, and being very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
against him, gave forth many orders immediately that he should
be followed with all possible speed, and taken: he was not only mad to
see the Princesse so far removed from Court, but for that he knew
this action of the Prince, might occasion many dangerous novelties to his
Kingdom, his own great age considered, and the tender years of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
The King agitated by so fierce and potent passions, had used all
diligence that <hi>Conde</hi> might be overtaken, and detained: amongst others
he had dispatcht away Monsieur <hi>du Pralin,</hi> one of the Captains of his
guard, with orders, that if he could not reach him, he should forthwith
go to the Archduke, towards whose Frontiers 'twas imagined he was
gone: and that he should use all the means he could to make him be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.
<hi>Pralin,</hi> and all the others, failing in their hopes of overtaking
him; <hi>Pralin</hi> accompanied with the French Embassadour then at <hi>Brussels,</hi>
went to acquaint the Archduke with the Kings desires: they made many
complaints against the Prince, and spoke bitter things; they said:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That his suspitions of any danger to his wives honour, were false
and feigned; as were also all other fears by which he seemed to cloak
his flying from <hi>France;</hi> saying, how could he expect any violence from
the King? a Prince no ways given thereunto, and who was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to use it to his cousin: that it was rather his ambition and ligeretie,
instigated by bad advice, which had made him take so strange and so
unexpected a resolution: which could tend to nothing else but to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe
<hi>France</hi> with some novelty plotted to this end: that therefore
the King did promise unto himself out of his neighbourhood, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
profest friendship to the Archduke, that he would cause <hi>Conde</hi>
be detained, in case he should be in <hi>Flanders;</hi> and that he would by
all means facilitate his return to <hi>France:</hi> that they did both of them
intreat this favour from him in their Kings name with much earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
that he should consider what the event of this might be: and
lastly, that he should remember, that such incounters were never so ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated
to one only Prince, but that their example might reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
others.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Archdukes answer was, <q>That he conceived he had fulfilled
his part to the King, by his not receiving the Prince: that it had not
been just to deny a Prince of his condition, passage through his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey:
that he was already gone elsewhere; but that if by any intercession
of his he could perswade him to return for <hi>France,</hi> he was ready to do
it, and to shew how much he desired the Kings satisfaction in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
and the publique peace of his Kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> was at this time in his Town of <hi>Breda,</hi> not far
from <hi>Antwerp,</hi> with the Princesse his wife, who was sister to <hi>Conde:</hi>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:55461:81"/>
he therefore came with his wife presently to <hi>Brussels</hi> being by <hi>Conde</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
so to do; who that he might go the sooner to <hi>Cullen</hi> took a nearer
way, and had caused the Princesse his wife to come to <hi>Brussels,</hi> that she
might entertain her self there with her sister till some other resolution
were taken. The Princesse of <hi>Conde</hi> was then 16 years old; and
her beauty was judged by all men to be answerable to the fore-running
fame thereof: she was very fair; her eyes full of sweetnesse, very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
in her speech, and in all her gestures; she owed all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of her beautie naturally to its self, for she did not help it with
any womanly art: Soon after the Archduke and the Infanta returned to
<hi>Brussels;</hi> the Archduke did immediately visit her, and the Infanta made her
many curteous offers: in this interim of time, the chief state ministers
of <hi>Spain,</hi> who had not been with the Archduke at <hi>Merimonte,</hi> had heard
what had past between him and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> there. They thought
the Archduke had done ignobly in not suffering the Prince to tarry in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and in seeming so willing to satisfie the King of <hi>France:</hi> but
<hi>Spinola</hi> seemed chiefly to be hereat scandalized, who did manage the
Spanish affairs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> principally: He could not endure that the
Archduke should let slip so fair an occasion of making some advantage
of the King of <hi>France</hi> his troubles. He said:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Archduke had no reason to fear that the King of <hi>France</hi>
would have taken up Arms against him for permitting <hi>Conde</hi> to live in
safety in <hi>Flanders:</hi> that to fight in open field with armed Troops, was
no other matter then to fal on Stags in a Forrest, as that King knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
then all others. 'Twas therefore to be thought that rather then to
break into open war, he would have endeavoured to have regain'd
<hi>Conde</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and to have regained some hopes of his Mistrisse by
Treatie: nay, it was rather to be believed that if <hi>Conde</hi> had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the endeavour of his reconciliation might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
many advantagious effects, as wel in facilitating the interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
match between the two Crowns, whereof divers overtures had
already been made, as in many other respects which might concern
their good, and joyntly the good of all Christendome: that suspition
had its power even amongst Princes, and did oft times prevail with
them more then friendship; but that in whatsoever manner the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> should have been detained in the Catholique Kings and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes
hands, there could not have been a fairer nor a fitter occasion
wisht for whereby to bridle the King of <hi>France</hi> his immoderate desires:
that he had made himself Arbitrator of the Truce lately made in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
that the differences touching the succession of the House of <hi>Cleves</hi>
did at this time depend upon his Arbitrement; that he would take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him the title of being the general Arbitrator of <hi>Europe,</hi> and exercise
the Authoritie thereof: and what authoritie was lesse tolerable then
to impede so great and so just Princes as were the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the
Archduke from the just priviledge of protecting the oppressed? espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
such a one as the Prince of <hi>Conde?</hi> opprest by such a one as he?
whereas he, since the last peace made with the Catholique King, had
given Protection in <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Anthony Peres,</hi> an officer who had been
very unfaithful to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and had not only protected
him, but given him a stipend, and did him all possible honour even in
the face of his Court: of how different a quality was <hi>Conde?</hi> How
different his cause? and how could he better justifie his flying from
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:55461:81"/>
                     <hi>France?</hi> which (let the King say what he pleased) was occasioned
out of meer necessity of saving his honour, and of securing his very
life.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Marquesse <hi>Spinola,</hi> together with all the rest of the Spanish officers broke
forth into such like complaints as these; and not herewithall content, they
indeavoured by all means they could to imprint the same sence in the
Archduke, who was a very moderate Prince; and who having not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moneths before wrastled through many difficulties, in the Truce of
<hi>Flanders</hi> to purchase peace, would not give occasion of beginning a new
and more heavy war with the King of <hi>France:</hi> but on the other side the
Archdukes interest did so depend upon the King of <hi>Spains</hi> concernments,
as he at last suffered himself to be perswaded by the aforenamed reasons:
<hi>Conde</hi> was then invited to come to <hi>Brussels</hi> by an expresse messenger sent
by Marquesse <hi>Spinola,</hi> with letters from himself and from the Catholique
Embassadour; and the pretence was this: <hi>Villeroy,</hi> chief Secretary of state
to the King of <hi>France,</hi> had told the Embassadour of <hi>Flanders</hi> wo was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
at <hi>Paris,</hi> that the King was very much offended, that <hi>Pralin,</hi> and
his Embassadour resident at <hi>Brussels,</hi> could not be permitted to see <hi>Conde,</hi>
to give him such advice as was fitting, and whereby he mought perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
have been perswaded to have returned to <hi>France.</hi> The King
himself afterwards told the Embassadour as much, declaring that he
would have been very well pleased if <hi>Conde</hi> mought have been made to
return. The Archduke hereupon pretending to cause <hi>Conde</hi> to come,
to the end that the French ministers of State might speak with him, and
endeavour an accommodation between him and the King, offering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be ready to do the like, he gave way that <hi>Conde</hi> should be invited
to come to <hi>Brussels</hi> in manner aforesaid; where he arrived about the end
of December 1609. Hee lighted at the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> his house, and
was accompanied by the Catholike Embassadour, and by all the chief
Lords of the Court, when hee made his first addresse to the Arch-duke
and the Infanta, who received him with much civility, &amp; with such honor
as his quality required. This mean-while the Answer vvhich vvas ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
concerning his person, was come from <hi>Spain;</hi> which was this:
That he might be permitted to live safely in <hi>Flanders,</hi> that the King took
him into his protection, and that he should injoy it with all favourable
advantages. At his first coming to <hi>Brussels</hi> there was no discourse at all
had of his reconciliation with the King of <hi>France;</hi> for the Kings Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
had not as yet had any particular Commission concerning it, to
boot that it was thought the King would send an Extraordinary Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour
about it. But <hi>Conde</hi> encouraged by the Answer from <hi>Spain,</hi> sought
so much the more to justifie his coming from <hi>France,</hi> he gave two Letters
particularly to me; the one of which he writ to the Pope, the other to
Cardinall <hi>Burghese,</hi> the Popes Nephew. The contents of them were:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That moved thereunto out of the danger of his life and honour,
hee was inforced to flee from <hi>France,</hi> and that hee recommended his
affairs to the Popes protection, and the Cardinals Mediation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was thought that he really had just occasion to forgo <hi>France;</hi> but
for what he said touching the violence prepared to be used against him by
the King, and that his life was in danger, it was not generally credited.
For every one knew that the King never dealt in his love affairs, but by
usuall wayes: and amongst all his vertues he was famous for none more
then his clemency. I sent away the Letters; but I did not omit to tell
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:55461:82"/>
him what became me, both for his, and for the publike good. I had first
likewise done such offices with the Arch-duke, and the Spanish State
Ministers tending to concord and peace, as I thought fittest upon such an
occurrence; which I did afterwards oft reiterate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by particular orders
from the Pope. I found the Arch-duke much disposed to work an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
between the Prince and the King; and he seemed to hope
to effect it; Judging amongst other reasons, that <hi>Conde</hi> out of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
facility of the Truth, would bee as easily perswaded to return to
<hi>France,</hi> as he was to come from thence. The Spanish States-men seemed
likewise very desirous to accommodate <hi>Conde:</hi> But it was known that
neither they nor the Arch-duke would bee displeased, if the Treaty
might meet with some difficulty; in such a manner notwithstanding, as
that the King of <hi>France</hi> might thereby bee involved in some domestique
troubles, and that the affairs abroad might not break out into open war.
As for the form of the accommodation, <hi>Conde</hi> declared publikely that
hee would never trust himself integrally and freely in the Kings hands.
He propounded, that to the end his abode in <hi>France</hi> might be void of all
danger, the King might assigne unto him some particular Town in <hi>Guie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
(of which Province hee was Governour) vvhich might bee farthest
distant from <hi>Paris,</hi> and the nearest that might bee to the Frontiers of
<hi>Spain.</hi> Hee aftervvard altered his opinion, and vvas afraid of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
vvhich might oblige him to tarry in <hi>France.</hi> He spake of retiring
himself into some neutrall Tovvn of <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>Italy:</hi> he seemed as
if he vvould go into <hi>Spain;</hi> and finally he pitcht upon no certain course:
Such doubts and such confusions appeared to him in vvhatsoever set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.</p>
               <p>But the King of <hi>France</hi> his thoughts vvere much othervvise. Hee
vvould that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> should remit himself freely into his
hands: being first assured that he vvould forgive him all his faults. The
King resolved to send the Marquesse <hi>de la Coure,</hi> one of the valiantest
and most esteemed Subjects of all <hi>France,</hi> to the Arch-duke, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
this accommodation. When the Marquesse was come to <hi>Brussels,</hi>
he in his first Audience, exaggerated what good turns the King had done
unto the Prince and then fell mightily to blame <hi>Condees</hi> actions, and
largely to justifie those of the Kings. He told the Arch-duke.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the onely way to work <hi>Condees</hi> accommodation, was for him
to return into <hi>France,</hi> and to put himself wholly into the Kings hands;
who would not onely sincerely pardon him, but in all benigne man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
receive him, and restore him to his former favour: That hee
therefore desired the Arch-duke to perswade <hi>Conde</hi> thereunto; which
if hee should seem averse unto, the King would beleeve for certain,
that the Arch-duke had made him leave <hi>France;</hi> since he had suffered
him to return to <hi>Flanders,</hi> out of an intention onely of bringing him
by his means to an easier accommodation with the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This was the first passage between <hi>la Coure</hi> and the Arch-duke. To
which he at the first was answered but in generals; yet full of efficacious
offers, whereby the Arch-duke did again promise to do what hee could
to bring <hi>Conde</hi> to an accommodation. But <hi>la Coure</hi> said in more direct
termes to others, that the Prince was received into <hi>Flanders</hi> upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
condition, that in case his affairs should not bee agreed with the
King, hee was to be made to go from thence by the Arch-duke, and that
this was no more then what the Embassadour of <hi>Flanders</hi> had told the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:55461:82"/>
King at <hi>Paris.</hi> He afterwards spoke of this condition openly to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke;
who denied it, and said: that he had made <hi>Conde</hi> return into <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
meerly to afford the French ministers of State means to Treat with
him, and to endeavour his reconciliation with the King, as hee himself
would likewise have done without making any condition.</p>
               <p>The Arch-duke wondred to hear the French speak after this manner;
and thought it not lesse strange to bee desired by <hi>la Coure,</hi> in the Kings
name, that if <hi>Conde</hi> should bee made to quit <hi>Flanders,</hi> his wife should
notwithstanding be detained there, and should be sent back to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable
her Father, and to Madame <hi>d' Angulesme</hi> her Aunt, by whom the
Princesse was brought up after her Mothers death, who had left her very
young. But the meaning of this was soon discerned: Wherefore the
Arch-duke and the Infanta did constantly withstand it; answering that
they would never dispose of the Princesse otherwise then as the Prince
her Husband should please. During this time many overtures were
made touching <hi>Condees</hi> affairs, and the Prince of <hi>Orenge,</hi> his brother in
law laboured particularly therein. At last, <hi>Conde</hi> seemed to be content
to withdraw himself into some neutrall City either in <hi>Germany,</hi> or
<hi>Italy,</hi> provided he might enjoy the entertainment he received in <hi>France,</hi>
which was 40000 Crowns a year. But <hi>la Coure</hi> stood more firme then
ever to his former proposition, and said;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the King was not to capitulate with any of his Vassals, nor to
consent that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> should prescribe lawes unto him.
That therefore he should do well to return to <hi>France,</hi> and to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into the Kings hands, which if he would do, hee might be sure
never to hear of any thing that was past. Hee said moreover, that
<hi>Condees</hi> living in <hi>Germany</hi> or in <hi>Italy,</hi> were to leave him dependant
upon the <hi>Spaniard.</hi> What occasions would they thereby take to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
his unquietnesse? Would not this bee to leave him as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited
amongst them, whereby to trouble the King now, or <hi>France<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
when the King should be dead? That therefore the King would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
live with these suspitions, nor leave such occasion of trouble to
his Kingdom when he should be dead. That he was resolved to know,
and that suddenly what would become of <hi>Conde;</hi> and that if it should
appear the Spaniards would make use of him to those ends, the King
had determined to prevent those evils which should bee prepared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>France,</hi> by making <hi>Spain</hi> first sensible of the like, as much as
in him lay.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Marquesse <hi>de la Coure</hi> mixt these threats amongst his friendly
mediations: He was of himself highly spirited, and full of warlike
thoughts, which were mightily supplied in him, by the great height and
reputation which the King of <hi>France</hi> was then in. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut <hi>Conde</hi> would by
no means hear of returning into <hi>France.</hi> Hee thought not any whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
security safe for him to escape out of the Kings hands. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f hee should
once come within them. <hi>Orenge</hi> was likewise of the same opinion: who
to make the <hi>French</hi> perswade the King to bee content with the propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Prince his Brother in lawes, abiding in some neutrall Town
of <hi>Germany,</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> shewed that it would bee much better to do so,
then by making the Prince despair, necessitate him consequently to
throw himself wholly upon the Spaniards. But it was impossible to
make the French move any such thing to the King. They yeelded onely
that the Arch-duke might do it by his Embassadour; who found great
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:55461:83"/>
repugnancy in the King, and that he would never condescend thereunto,
nor ever accept of any thing, but the Prince his putting himself freely
into the Kings hands. The which the Prince was as resolute not to do.
This was the publike Negotiation: But the French laboured at the same
time, much more in another secret affair; which was, that they might
finde some means how to steal away the Princesse privately, and carry
her into <hi>France.</hi> A strange undertaking, and certainly very hard to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe:
but notwithstanding it was generally noised, and beleeved in
<hi>Flanders.</hi> And I, affirming nothing for certain, will onely say what the
publike fame in that point was; which proves notwithstanding a false
witnesse in humain affairs; and oft times fains malignant inventions,
and makes them be too easily beleeved by malignant hearers. There ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
but little love between the Prince and Princesse; were it either
by reason of the difference of their natures, or because she was not well
pleased to bee brought out of <hi>France:</hi> or that peradventure there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
not some who thinking to please the King, endeavoured to keep
them at odds. Wherefore without any delay, as soon as <hi>la Coure</hi> was
come to <hi>Brussels,</hi> the Princesse was secretly set upon in private, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
her self to bee conveyed away into France. Shee was much in sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,
to hear of such a proposall on the one side, she was not much sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with the Prince: shee abhor'd to be in the Spaniards hands; shee
was not well pleased with the Court of <hi>Flanders,</hi> as too much differing
from that of <hi>France:</hi> shee mightily desired to bee with her Father and
Aunt, who by very kind Letters appear'd to desire the like. But on
the other side, to part thus with her Husband; to suffer her self to bee
stolne away in secret; to go away with so much danger of being brought
back: and to expose the successe thereof to such variety of judgement
as would bee thereby soon occasioned, were all of them reasons which
might make her very unresolute what to do. After having a while wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
between these ambiguities; overcome at last by her still increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
desire of returning to <hi>France,</hi> shee consented to suffer her self to be
carried thither, out of her Fathers and her Aunts often instigations, and
pressing her to return to <hi>Paris.</hi> The designe of the French was, to steal
her by night privately out of <hi>Brussels,</hi> and to advance so farre towards
the neerest consines of <hi>France,</hi> as when they should bee discovered they
could not bee overtaken. But many things were to bee prepared before
they could execute this their designe. They must either scale the walls
of the City, or make holes thorow it: they must have pacing Horses in
<hi>Brussels,</hi> and in sundry stages between it and <hi>France,</hi> to set the Princesse
on; and at the same stages have horse-men who might oppose such as
should come from <hi>Brussels</hi> to stay her. There was therefore many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
in the businesse; and great foresight was to bee had to prevent
them; so as it was impossible it should be carried so secretly, but that it
must be smelt. Count <hi>Buckquoye</hi> was the first that discovered it, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
of the Artillery in <hi>Flanders,</hi> who suddenly acquainted the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke
and <hi>Spinola</hi> with it. And taking into consideration what course was
best to be taken to frustrate the designe; it was thought fittest, without
making of any noise, under some colour, or other to bring the Princesse
into the Palace to bee neer the Infanta. The Arch-duke and Spanish
Off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cers took their pretence from those dislikes which were observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
her and the Prince her Husband, and carried the businesse so, as
that the Prince himself should make the motion. To the which he was
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:55461:83"/>
easily perswaded; having a short promise both from the Arch-duke and
the Infanta, not to suffer his wife to depart from them without his
knowledge. It was thought the Princesse her self would be content to
be with the Infanta; as well out of the little satisfaction shee seemed to
receive in the Prince her Husbands company; as out of hope that when
her Husband should be gone, she might the easilier obtain her liberty,
and return to <hi>France.</hi> Out of these hopes she was content to be brought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
neer the Infanta, till shee saw what the event would bee of the Prince his
businesse. The Marquesse <hi>de la Coure</hi> was likewise herewith content;
but did not notwithstanding forgo his plot of stealing the Princesse out
of <hi>Flanders.</hi> He saw that if this businesse had been well handled, it might
soon have been done, and would have been a great shame to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,
and a lively resentment of that distaste which his King had taken
against them. Whereas it would be a hard matter to get the Princesse
out of the Palace when shee should once be there. This was the crafty
proceeding of the one and the other party, each hoping to delude the
other. The day was now at hand wherein the Princesse was to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
into the Palace, and the French were not yet in readinesse to effect
their design: So as to gain some delay of time they had recourse to this
remedy. They thought (though they were therein deceived) that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quesse
<hi>Spinola</hi> was in love with the Princesse: amongst other things she
danced admirably well, and took much delight therein, wherefore they
made her pray <hi>Spinola</hi> to prevail so far with the Archduke and the
Prince her husband, as that her coming to live in the Palace might be put
off for three or four dayes: feigning that she very much desired first to
see an intertainment and mask which was to be made in the Prince of
<hi>Orenge</hi> his house, and where <hi>Spinola</hi>'s self was to bring the musick, as the
custome of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> is: but <hi>Spinola</hi> perceived the concealed
cunning, and in as handsome terms as might be, made it so difficult a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse,
as the Princesse grew out of all hope of procuring the mentioned
delay. The French were troubled at this answer; but it with-held them
not from their design: it was on a Sabbath day the 13 of <hi>February,</hi> the
year 1610. and the next Lords day 'twas thought for certain that the
Princesse was to come to the Palace: whereupon the French ordering
their affairs the best they could, resolved however to venture upon the
businesse that very night: and lest the Prince by lying with her (though
he did so but very seldom) might disturbe the plot, they made her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
to be sick the night before. The French Embassadours Lady,
who was of the plot, kept still by her: <hi>La Coure</hi> likewise, and the French
Embassadour were not long absent from her; and all of them stood long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the day might passe over, which preceded the desired hour of
the succeeding night. This mean while Count <hi>Buckquoi</hi> advertised the
Archduke how all things passed: <hi>Conde</hi> knew not as yet of any thing that
hath been said; for the Archduke hoping that the plot would fall of
its self by the Princesse her coming to the Palace, had not acquainted
him with it, that he might not afford him any occasion of divulging it,
and consequently of irritating the King of <hi>France</hi> with further distastes:
but seeing affairs thus far advanced, he thought it good that <hi>Spinola</hi>
should communicate the whole businesse to <hi>Conde,</hi> as he did: and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled
him to desire the Archduke that he would set a certain number of
his own horse-guard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that night to guard the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> his house<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <hi>Conde</hi> was amazed to hear of this, and forthwith went to the Archduke,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:55461:84"/>
who gave speedy order for the desired guard: <hi>Conde</hi> entring hereupon
into new suspitions, it is not to be said how much he was troubled: and
not able to contain himself, he was not well come from the Archduke,
when he began to divulge it in the outer rooms; so as it was suddenly
known every where; he did not speak, he rather exclaimed against the
King; against <hi>la Coure,</hi> and the French Embassadour in ordinary; taking
on, and afflicting himself as if his wife had already been taken away; and
as if she were already at <hi>Paris.</hi> The news was by this time come to the
Princesse her chamber, where <hi>la Coure</hi> was together with the French
Embassadour, and divers other French-men; the trouble which they
were all in, to hear this, was no lesse then what appeared in <hi>Conde</hi> when
he was in the Palace; since they saw the plot was discovered; the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
advice was to deny it if need should be, and by complaining, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
complaints; wherewith <hi>la Coure</hi> and the Embassadour in ordinary
went instantly from the Prince of <hi>Orenge</hi> his house, leaving the Princesse
much perplext: to whom <hi>Conde</hi> being returned, and having laid aside
his former fear, he together with <hi>Orenge</hi> and the Spanish officers seemed
to lay all the blame upon the French, and that they had treacherously
plotted to convey away the Princesse by violence: it cannot be said what
concourse of people flockt presently to <hi>Orenge</hi> his house: and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
and noise there was that night in <hi>Brussels:</hi> the guard which the
Archduke had granted unto <hi>Conde,</hi> came armed into <hi>Orenge</hi> his house:
and 500 more armed Townsmen which <hi>Orenge</hi> had procured from the
supream Magistrate of the City; so as the horrour of so many arms in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by that of the night, together with the novelty of the businesse it
self, brought almost all the rest of the people thither, and bred one of
the greatest tumults that was ever known in <hi>Brussels:</hi> and 'twas given out
by a popular voice, and believed, that the King of <hi>France</hi> was himself in
person at the City gates to carry away the Princesse by force. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to <hi>la Coure,</hi> and the Embassadour in ordinary, as soon as they were
gone from <hi>Orenge</hi> his house, and saw so great a tumult, they resolved
to go immediately to the Archduke, and to complain mightily of
him concerning what was divulged, of the above said plot. They
said:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That all was invented by the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> the more still to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
his flying from <hi>France,</hi> and for other ambitious ends of his own:
that it might easily be conceived the Princesse could not be conveyed
away to <hi>France</hi> in the air; so as to effect her carrying away many hors<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
must of necessity have been laid by the way between <hi>Brussels</hi> and
the confines of <hi>France:</hi> she must necessarily be conveyed out of a
house, full of company: the wals of the City must either have been
scaled, or had holes made through them; and many other things must
have been provided for; and above all things impenetrable secresie;
which preparations if they should have been made, how should not the
news thereof been brought to <hi>Brussels,</hi> as well of the people that must
have been sent from <hi>France,</hi> as of some of the so many provisions which
must have been made? how was it to be believed that the Princesse, a
Lady of tender years, so tenderly brought up, could travel two long days
journey from <hi>Brussels,</hi> to the nearest parts of <hi>France,</hi> so speedily as
she should not be overtaken? that by all these reasons it did clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
that the business was not only not ever plotted, but never dreamed
of, which was to be imagined totally infeasable: that fraud abhors
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:55461:84"/>
the light; and that therefore this was compos'd by night, the better to
mask it over with darknesse: that <hi>Conde</hi> was the Architect thereof, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by some Officer of <hi>Flanders,</hi> ill-minded towards <hi>France:</hi> and
since by this calumnious invention, the Princesse was so much scandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
in her honour, and their Kings reputation so much at stake, they
desired the Arch-duke that the truth might bee made to appear, to the
end that proportionable resentment might be had. The Arch-dukes
answer was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he had thought such a plot to be very unlikely; but that on
the other side <hi>Conde</hi> was very confident in his affirming it to bee true;
that he had been so earnest in desiring to have a Guard in the Prince of
<hi>Orenge</hi> his house, as he could not deny it him; that he was sorry to see
businesses proceed to this height; that hee hoped the truth of the fact
would at last be made manifest; and that it would not prove any cause
of spot unto the Princesse, nor of offence unto the King.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Arch-duke, with such a fained answer dispatch'd away the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadors,
who continuing their complaints, disperst them every where
abroad; especially against Marquesse <hi>Spinola,</hi> upon whose advise they
saw <hi>Conde</hi> did very much rely in all things. The common opinion was,
that the French had really an intention to carry away the Princesse in
manner aforesaid; and though the doing it would have proved very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult,
yet was it not held to bee impossible. Her chamber lay upon a
garden neer the street; the City wall might easily have been bored tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
or else been scaled; and so they might have past over the ditch,
which was dry on that side, without any difficulty; so as the Princesse
being advanced 6. or 7. hours by night, on good and swift Horses, there
would have been but little hope of over-taking her: in which time one
Post being sent after another, such a number of Horse would have sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly
been sent forth from the neerest Frontiers of <hi>France,</hi> as might have
sufficed to withstand any Forces which might have come from <hi>Brussels</hi>
to stop the Princesse.</p>
               <p>These were the reasons which made for the Spaniards side, to prove
that she might bee stolne away. But whatsoever the truth was in a busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
which amidst such contrary passions could hardly be found out.
The Princesse was brought the very next day into the Palace, attended
by a very great many. As joyfull as this day appeared to the Spaniards,
it seemed as sad to the French; who thought that the Princesse was
brought as a Prisoner, and as in Triumph; and the King of <hi>France</hi> his
passions taken and led captive after her. Many Posts were forthwith
dispatched away to the King, to give him notice of all these proceedings:
vvhereat the King being strangely exasperated, thinking that no more
negotiations vvere novv to bee had in <hi>Condees</hi> affairs, but that it vvas
better to affright him vvith threats, he writ him a Letter of credence to
beleeve what <hi>la Coure</hi> should say unto him. The which as soon as <hi>la Coure</hi>
had given him, he told him in succinct and resolute terms.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the King to shew his goodnesse to him, did again propound
unto him his return to <hi>France,</hi> and the putting of himself freely into
his hands; that hee assured him again of a plenary pardon for all that
was past; if hee did not suddenly accept of this offer, the King did
from that time forward declare him guilty of High-Treason; for that
hee contrary to the lawes of <hi>France</hi> had dared to go out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
without the Kings permission, and had so many other wayes of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:55461:85"/>
the King, contrary to the lawes of consanguinity.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conde</hi> took time to answer, and his answer was:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That he had left <hi>France</hi> to save his honour and his life; and that
necessity quitted him of any fault: that he was ready to return if any
offer should be made him whereby he might live there in safety; that he
would live and dye faithfull to the King. But that when the King should
stray from all the wayes of justice, and should proceed against him by
the wayes of Violence, he took all such acts as should be done against
his person to be Null, and Invalid.</q>
               </p>
               <p>All things being thus much imbittered; the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more jealous of his life, if hee should stay in <hi>Brussels,</hi> a place much
frequented by Forreyners, and too neer <hi>France,</hi> resolved to quit <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>
Hee had his choice of two wayes to go; either towards <hi>Spain</hi> by
Sea, taking ship at <hi>Dunkerk,</hi> or towards <hi>Italy,</hi> by the way of <hi>Germany:</hi>
both these were full of difficulties. In that of the sea, he must relie upon
the windes, which might peradventure either throw his ship upon <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or <hi>England,</hi> or upon <hi>France</hi> it self: and it was no lesse dangerous to
give upon <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> by reason of the neer correspondency
that was between <hi>France</hi> and them. And in his passage by land, hee ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
many more dangers; being to passe thorow so many, and so differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
Countreys, in many whereof <hi>Conde</hi> could in no wayes be safe. All doubts
being weighed, it was at last resolved that he should go by <hi>Germany</hi> into
<hi>Italy,</hi> and should tarry at <hi>Millan,</hi> with Count <hi>Fuentes,</hi> who was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of that Town then, till some other course should be taken in <hi>Spain</hi>
touching his affairs. He took his journey about the end of <hi>February<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and
all care was had for his departure with what secresie might be; his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
succeeded so well, as in a few dayes he came to <hi>Millan,</hi> where he was
honourably received by Count <hi>Fuentes.</hi> Marquesse <hi>de la Coure</hi> tarried
not long after he was gone: <hi>La Cour's</hi> Embassie proving vain, and <hi>Conde</hi>
being absolutely past into the Spaniards hands, every bodies eyes were
upon what the King of <hi>France</hi> would do; no man doubted but that hee
was mightily vexed, and might think,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Was this the fruit of his past victories? that a young man, the next
of kin unto him, who ought to be at his beck, should in this manner, and
upon these pretences, forgo <hi>France,</hi> and put himself into the Spaniards
protection? become the means of disturbing his present quiet, and
the peace which he desired to leave his children to enjoy? What acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
could be a greater blemish to his honour, and more lessen his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
then this? Against which why should he not now think that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in <hi>France</hi> might to the like, and that his enemies abroad might
rise against him? that Kingdoms were preserved by reputation; which
was as well their strongest support in peace, as their chiefest safety in
time of war. When once they grow despised, they are either subject
to forraine Invasions, or home Troubles; and many times to both at
once. 'Twas therefore now no longer time to loyter; and since <hi>Conde</hi>
would not be intreated to return to <hi>France,</hi> he must now be forced to
do it; and bee made repent his having committed so great faults, and
the Spaniards their having assisted him therein.</q>
               </p>
               <p>These passions seemed to bee plainly read in the Kings countenance;
and no lesse visible was his desire of having the Princesse back again at
<hi>Paris.</hi> So as so great and potent an agitation of minde being considered,
many thought hee would maker war upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> and have the United
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:55461:85"/>
Provinces joyned with him; and that the Archduke and Spaniards,
would through fear be for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d at last to restore <hi>Conde</hi> &amp; the Princess unto
him, which they had denied to do by a friendly way. But on the other
side the graver and wiser sort of men could not be thus perswaded:
They judged that the King of <hi>France,</hi> being now 58 years old would first
very well weigh the dangers, which might insue by his making a War at
those years; and having so young children, the eldest of which was not
past nine years old.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>How sad times (said they) will those prove, wherein he himself
failing, shall leave his heir in so tender years, to inherit a War? un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the government of a woman? all things being doubtful abroad
and wavering at home? had not he been so forward in indeavouring
the Truce of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he might see his neighbours at peace when
he should die? vvhat piece of folly and of blindness vvould it then be,
to make the War now his own, vvhich he had strove to quench a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
others? 'twas not to be esteemed an easie matter to set upon, and
to indanger the Provinces of <hi>Flanders;</hi> Provinces provided of a veteran
Army; fortified on the Frontiers by strong Towns, and by Rivers:
inhabited by a war-like people, and naturally enemies to the very name
of <hi>France:</hi> that it was not so likely neither, as some would perswade
themselves, that the United Provinces would joyn in the same designs
with the King, since the same ends which made them desire the Truce,
vvould make them likewise desire the continuance of it: that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olentest
passions were commonly soonest over: 'twas therefore to be
believed, that when the King should be free of these his so ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
he vvould give ear to more circumspect advice, and indeavour
rather to work an accommodation in <hi>Conde</hi>'s affairs by way of good
correspondencie with the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> It would indeed be a gallant and
a memorable action, if the King violently gone in love now in his old
age, should set all <hi>France</hi> on fire, and put all <hi>Europe</hi> in commotion for a
vvoman.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus did men discourse of the King of <hi>France,</hi> when <hi>Conde</hi> was gone
from <hi>Flanders:</hi> and doubtlesly it vvas the common opinion that these
later reasons vvould have outweighed the former; but men find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
oft times deceived even when they think themselves vvisest. When
God hath once decreed in his secret wisdom, that some great alteration
shall happen amongst us here below for our punishment, he first of all
bereaves Princes of counsel; and suffering them to fall from the love of
the vveal publique, or common good, into the like of their own blind
private wils, he makes themselves the instruments as well of their own
peculiar ruine, as of the general misfortune of other men. Thus the
more ardent resolutions prevailing over the vvisest in the King of <hi>France,</hi>
he resolved to raise a new Armie, and took for his pretence, that he
vvould assist the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and the Pallatine of <hi>Newburg</hi> in
their possession of the states of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers.</hi> The Emperour <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus,</hi>
as I touched upon at the beginning, had sent the Archduke <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi>
the year before to <hi>Iuliers;</hi> to the end that he might take those states
into sequestration in the Emperours name, which as depending upon the
Empire, the Emperour judged that of right they should be deposited
in his hands, till the cause was juridically decided. <hi>Leopold</hi> staied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>Iuliers;</hi> a good Town and strengthened by a good Castle; and
for that he feared to be driven out from thence by the aforesaid two
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:55461:86"/>
Princes, who were openly favoured by the United Previnces, he had
raised some number of Souldiers from the time that he first entred into
the Town. He being a Prince of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> a gallant young
man, having begun to raise men, and his possibilitie of being favoured
by the forces of <hi>Flanders,</hi> vvere reasons which raised jealousies not only
in <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and in <hi>Newburg,</hi> but even in the United Provinces, and in
the King of <hi>France,</hi> that his comming thither vvas not without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and counsel of the Spaniards: They seemed to apprehend lest the
Spaniards under the Emperours name, might cover some of their own
designs vvhich might prove either to put <hi>Leopold</hi> in possession of the states
of the late Duke of <hi>Cleves,</hi> or under some pretence to enter thereinto
themselves: Whereupon the King and the United Provinces had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the next spring to assist <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi> and to drive <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold</hi>
not only out of <hi>Iuliers,</hi> but out of all those parts. The affairs of
<hi>Iuliers</hi> were at this passe vvhen the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> went from <hi>Flanders</hi> to
<hi>Italy:</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> thought better therefore to make use of this
pretence to raise an Army, then by openly intimating War to the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> and the Archduke, afford them opportunitie to provide by time,
and the easilier to resist his forces, which at that time were very great;
his large Kingdom was then in full peace, and therefore abounded won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
in all things; and the glory he had won in War, had got him
so great a power in peace, as tis not known that every any King had more.
The Nobilitie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parliaments, and all the other Orders strove who should
be most at his beck; and that which was most to be wondred at vvas, that
it vvas not vvell known vvhither he were more beloved or feared by his
subjects: and the French being by nature quick, and the Gentrie gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
given to Arms, it might be believed, that the King would find as
much readinesse in them to take up Arms as he could desire: he made no
delay; he sent forthwith many Commissions into divers Countries to raise
men, to provide Ammunition, victuals and what else was necessary to
make up a potent Army. <hi>France</hi> was in a short time full of armed men,
and all things were ready for motion: to boot with the souldiery which
vvere raised in <hi>France,</hi> the King gave order for raising a good number of
Swissers: And out of his Treasury, (which was thought to contain above
five Millions of gold, and was not as yet touched) great quantitie of
money was drawn to make the speedier provisions. But the Archduke
and <hi>Spinola</hi> held that the King of <hi>France</hi> had some other end in these his
preparations: they thought that by these threats the King would the more
inforce his practises, which he still continued in <hi>Brussels</hi> of re-having
the Princesse; and that losing all hope at last of regaining her, he would
reduce so great a preparation, to so many men only as should be needful
to send to the succour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and <hi>Newburg;</hi> in prosecution of
the aforesaid practise, Monsieur <hi>de Preau</hi> was newly come from <hi>France</hi>
in the name of the Constable, and Madam <hi>d' Angulesme:</hi> but he brought
with him likewise Letters from the King to the Archduke of such eager
contents, as he was rather taken to be sent from the King himself then
from the Constable and Madam <hi>d Angulesme:</hi> These were his desires to
the Archduke; That the Queen of <hi>France</hi> her Coronation being shortly
to be solemnized, the Constable and Madam <hi>d Angulesme</hi> desired that
the Princesse might be at it to serve the Queen upon this so solemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
her self in person; that they did both of them likewise desire to have
the Princesse with them to assist her in indeavouring a divorce between
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:55461:86"/>
her and her husband, who had carried her out of <hi>France</hi> against her will;
offended her highly at <hi>Brussels;</hi> placed her by force with the Infanta;
and deprived her of that libertie which by all laws was allowed to every
private woman, in case of divorce, much more to so eminent a Princesse.
These were the principal reasons alledged by <hi>Preau,</hi> to perswade the
Archduke and the Infanta to permit the Princesse to return to <hi>France.</hi>
Answer vvas made, that the Princesse came into their Palace of her own
accord; that the Prince her husband had placed her there, and <hi>la Coure</hi>
himself had agreed thereunto: That though she were with them, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce
and all things conducing thereunto might be treated of; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that they had engaged their word unto her husband not to deliver her
up into any ones hands but his own; so as it did not consist with their
honour to falsifie their promise. <hi>Preau</hi> replied, that the Archduke and
Infanta could not do it, because it was against all Laws of justice: that
the rule of all Laws and Tribunals vvas, that the vvife vvho vvas evilly
intreated by her husband, should have free liberty to be parted from
him, and to go whither she pleased to sue out her Divorce: that he did
believe the Princesse should not want this libertie though she tarried with
the Infanta; but that she her self did desire rather to be vvith her Father
and Aunt, and in her own friends hands, that so she might the better
govern her affairs; that this could not be denied her; and lastly, that the
King of <hi>France</hi> vvould never indure, as long as he had any Forces to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
that she should receive so open an outrage. The Archduke ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
himself chiefly upon his tie of Honour, and desired that some way
of accommodation might be thought on; that if any vvay could be
found out vvhereby with safetie to his and his vvives honor, the Princesse
might return to <hi>France,</hi> he vvould vvillingly accept of it; but the French
vvould admit of nothing, but that the Princesse should be freely restored
to her Father and her Aunt; and prest the Archduke the more hereunto,
for that they found him wavering: The Archduke vvas at last content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to make it be propounded to the French, that when it should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
by any competent way that the Princesse should be vvholly left
to her own liberty, he and the Infanta vvould be contented to let her go
whither she pleased; by these words, [competent vvay] the Archduke
seemed to understand the Pope: who should determin this point either by
himself at <hi>Rome,</hi> or by either of his Nuntios in <hi>France,</hi> or in <hi>Flanders:</hi> which
vvould suddenly be decided one way or other; since this was not to enter
upon the merits of the cause of Divorce, but only to resolve where the
Princesse should in the mean while be: yet would not the French admit
of this neither; they doubted the length of time; and they considered
the Archduke as one in a manner not at his own command, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
having too great an interest in all his affairs and counsels; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
the Marquesse <hi>Spinola,</hi> whom they did very much distrust.</p>
               <p>But it was now time for the Archduke and Spinolasts to thinke of
somewhat else then treaty by words; The Swissers began already to
fall down into <hi>France;</hi> and all provisions formerly spoken of with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
prepared. The flour of the Nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> could not be
more forward to take up Arms and follow the Kings person; who
though he sometimes varied in publishing the form of his going, was
still resolute to go. He told the Embassadours of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi>
that he would go himself in person to assist his friends, and to put them
into their due possession of the states of <hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers:</hi> upon other
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:55461:87"/>
occasions, he would let himself be freely understood, that he would go
himself to free the Princess out of Prison: and to revenge the wrong
which the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and Archduke had done him in taking the Prince
of <hi>Conde</hi> into their protection. The Archduke was advertised of all this,
by his own Embassadour resident at <hi>Paris,</hi> and by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour.
He therefore thought it no longer time to delay making
such provisions as was thought necessary to oppose the King of <hi>France,</hi> if
he should really resolve to turn his Forces upon <hi>Flanders.</hi> His Army
was at this time very much diminished; for presently after the Truce
all the Dutch were cashier'd, many of the Walloons, and a great part of
the Horse: which was done to lessen the expence, which had been so
excessive in so long a War: so as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Archduke had
not then above 10000 Foot and 1500 Horse; all of them notwithstanding
old and expert souldiers: The scarcity of money was likewise very great;
so as the Archduke and Spaniards were in a great streight, being of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie
to raise 12000 Foot, and 2000 Horse; and having no money to do
it. The Archdukes first resolution was to send Don <hi>Fernando Girone</hi>
into <hi>Spain,</hi> one of the chief Spanish Commanders in all the Armie, to
perswade the King to send 400000 Crowns immediately into <hi>Flanders,</hi>
whereby to raise the aforesaid Forces, and for other Provisions which
were to be made, against the King of <hi>France</hi> his preparations; and in
the mean while, with such moneys as could be come by, they began to
raisemen. 'Twas resolved that there should 6000 Dutch be raised, 6000
Walloons, and for the present only 600 Harquebuziers on Horseback,
which sort of Horse they wanted, all their other Horse being either
Launcers or Curaziers; the Archdukes intention was to make use of all
the old souldiers in the field, and to set the new men to guard the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers;
which because they required good Garrisons both towards <hi>France,</hi>
and towards the United Provinces; 'twas thought that the Spanish field
Army could not exceed 12 or 14 thousand Foot, and 2500 Horse; as
for the King of <hi>Fance</hi> his Army, 'twas esteemed to be, 30000 Foot, part
<hi>Swissers</hi> and part French, and 5000 Horse: The Royal Cornet being
therein comprehended, which in <hi>France</hi> is called the White Cornet,
which the flowre of the French Nobilitie use to bring up behind when
the King himself is in person in the Field: affairs were hastened every
day more and more on the Kings side, and great store of Victuals,
Ammunition for War and Artillerie began to be sent to those Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Campagnie</hi> and <hi>Piccardy</hi> which lay towards <hi>Flanders:</hi> and the
Town of <hi>Schallone</hi> was designed for the Rendezvous of the French Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.
This vvas the state of affairs in the end of <hi>April,</hi> 1610. at which
time the same King, to boot vvith the preparation of his own Forces, held
strait Intelligence with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and the United Provinces, to
make them likewise move against <hi>Flanders.</hi> Hee was of great Authority
with the United Provinces, and maintained at his own cost 4000. French
Foot, and 200. Horse in their Armie; so as hee thought to draw them
easily over to side with his designes; and to induce the King of <hi>England</hi>
thereunto also out of hopes of gaining something thereby himself. And
not content with these managements of affairs against <hi>Flanders,</hi> he stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
up others in <hi>Italy</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (who was then greatly alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
from the Spaniards) and the Common-wealth of <hi>Venice</hi> to make
some commotion on that side also against the State of <hi>Millan.</hi> But his
ends in <hi>Italy</hi> ended not here. Hee thought that the very occasion of so
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:55461:87"/>
many Forces on foot at once against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> might invite the
Pope to think upon the Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> and to incite also all others
on all sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were jealous of so great a power, to endeavour to bring
it lower. Neither did he despair of carrying his victorious Forces in this
conjuncture, into <hi>Germany,</hi> and to finde his name in so great renowne
there also, and such the correspondency of his Friends, as that hee might
take the Empire from the House of <hi>Austria.</hi> So was he set on at the same
time by hatred against the Prince, and love to the Princesse; but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
by the fiercest of Enemies, the too great Felicity which hee found
himself to be in. But his chiefest designe at this time was upon <hi>Flanders;</hi>
and the whole body of his Forces met upon the Frontiers: So as the
Archduke and the Spaniards began very much to fear the Affairs of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;</hi>
doubting lest by so many and so hotly pursued practises against
the Crown of Spain, the Forces of that Monarchy might bee diverted
elsewhere, so as not to bee able well to supply the particular needs of
<hi>Flanders.</hi> To which it was also to be added, that <hi>Spain</hi> was at this time
in great commotion, by reason of the expulsion of the Moors out of
all the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Kingdoms. The Archduke and the Spaniards did
notwithstanding hope, that the United Provinces (whose Forces were
very considerable) would not be brought, without any necessity of their
own, to break the Truce, but they would onely assist the King with
some of their men, which would notwithstanding be a reinforcement
of great Importance, by reason of the condition of their Souldiery,
which was very choice, and long Verst in Arms. As for the King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
they thought they needed not fear him at all, nor that hee was to
adhere unto the King of <hi>France</hi> his designes: as well by reason of his
naturall addiction to peace and quiet, as for the scarcity of money which
he was in, and that he would be jealous of the King of <hi>France</hi> his grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any greater. For the other practises in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in <hi>Germany,</hi> the
Archduke and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> did not much regard it. So as all the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
being reduced into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and it being cleerly seen that the tempest
of the French Forces was to fall there, the Archduke and the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
made what provision they could to withstand them. At this time, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
came very hot from <hi>Spain,</hi> which promised the desired moneys
should be suddenly sent, and all things else that was needfull, not onely
to withstand the King of <hi>France,</hi> but even to carry the warre home into
his own Kingdom: Whereupon the Archduke being incouraged, hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the raising of new men, and resolved to take into the <hi>Flanders</hi> Army
a thousand of Archduke <hi>Leopolds</hi> Horse, and 1500. of his Foot: which
<hi>Leopold</hi> for want of money could not maintain. He had appointed at the
same time <hi>Filippeville,</hi> a Town in the County <hi>Namure,</hi> towards the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
of <hi>Champaigne</hi> for his place of Muster; and resolved to go himself

                  </gap> The 17. day of <hi>May</hi>
was already appointed for the Archduke to be in the Town of <hi>Namures,</hi>

and openly called the Archdukes Palace her Prison. And she her
self in writing declared unto them, that shee ought by the way of right
and just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ce be set at liberty. Shee would be some whole dayes, and not
suffer her self to be seen by any one; and endeavoured by all possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:55461:88"/>
to shew how highly she was displeased to bee detained in
that manner in <hi>Brussels.</hi> But the King of <hi>France</hi> appearing more reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
then ever in his designe of warre; and declaring however, that hee
would in his own Person succour <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and <hi>Newburg,</hi> he had some
new discourse with the Embassadour of <hi>Flanders</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and moved
him that he might have leave to passe thorow <hi>Luxenburg:</hi> With which
motion the Embassadour suddenly acquainted the Archduke. The Kings
pretence was not unknown; and 'twas thought that the two Princes
themselves would be very jealous, to see so many French in Arms, and
the King himself in Person, in their Countrey; lest that by such a suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour,
they might become a prey to the succourer. So as the Archduke
esteeming that this was rather a first intimation of War, and that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the King should be permitted, or denied to passe, would be a point
of great importance: Hee thought much upon it,; whereupon severall
consultations were had between him and his chief Commanders, as well
concerning this point, as how the Warre against the King should bee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd.
There were at this time two men chiefly esteemed in the <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Army. The one a Spaniard, Don <hi>Luis di Valasco,</hi> Generall of
the Horse; and the other a Dutch man, Count <hi>Buckquoi,</hi> Generall of
the Artillery: both which had formerly past with much commendation
through all the inferiour Charges of the Militia. As they were one day
in Councel what to resolve in things of so high concernment, <hi>Valasco</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
that his opinion should bee clearly known, and that particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
might be taken thereof in <hi>Spain,</hi> spoke thus;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When I consider, (most powerfull Prince) our affairs in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
compared with those of the King of <hi>France,</hi> I finde ours so short
of his, as it is now more time then ever, to bee cautious and secure in
our Councels. Wee all agree in one supposition, that your Highnesse
cannot have above 12 or 14 thousand Foot, and 2500. Horse; an
Army which though it consist almost all of old Souldiers, yet in my
opinion it ought not to bee thought sufficient to Face the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Army, which will have twice our numbers in it. No doubt
his Foot will not compare with ours; but so great an advantage in
number is too considerable. And then if the French Horse be usually
better then those of all other Nations, how much better will they
prove now then our Cavallery? since to boot with their odds of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
theirs will be made up of the prime Nobility of <hi>France,</hi> who in
this present occasion will wait upon the Kings Person. And how much
will the Kings new men bee encouraged and strengthened by the old
Souldiers of the United Provinces, who certainly will assist his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
against ours, either by a Bravado, or in breaking the Truce with
us, in this so opportune conjuncture. It is therefore my opinion that
by all means that may bee wee should shun incountring the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and all occasions of giving him Battell: and consequently my
Vote shall go, that he be permitted to passe thorow <hi>Luxenburg,</hi> since
our affairs stand so now as wee cannot hinder him. And as for the
form of warring, since in my judgement we are to keep our selves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Defence, my counsell shall be, that our Army may move from
<hi>Filippeville,</hi> our place of Muster, towards that part as the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Army shall move, and that wee may alwayes coast him on
this side the Mause. Thus making use of the River, as of a large and
deep Ditch; and of her Banks as of a firm and invincible Rampiere,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:55461:88"/>
it shall not be in the Kings power to assault us: and on the other side, it will
be in our power to keep him from entring into the best and chiefest parts
of these Provinces. And if the King shall this mean while make himself
Master of the Field on that side the River, he will finde but few places on
that side to make himself Master of, and he shall find those few so united,
as in taking them hee shall lose much time, and many souldiers, which will
suffice to breake the first violence of his Army. Thus putting out selves in
this strong and secure posture of Defence, we shall fight without fighting,
and we shall without danger, overcome this first dangerous motion of the
King of <hi>France</hi> his Forces. The mean while powerfull Aids will come to
us from <hi>Spain</hi> both of men and money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and this mean-while also the
French Forces which shall be turned against these Provinces may be weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by many diversions, whilst wee may make ours descend from the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renean
mountains against <hi>France,</hi> and prejudice him by our Fleets in the
Mediterranean Sea, and in the Ocean; and may cause some inward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
in that Kingdom. The French (as all men know) are born to
Novelties; and seek out troubles no lesse then others shun them, which
they are ready to throw amongst Forreiners, but more amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
To this purpose, if easie matter might have been formerly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for out of their naturall unquietnesse, how much easilier will it bee
found now that the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> is gone from them, and is in our
hands? How great commotion of tumults will the sudden setting up of
this great ensigne there cause? nor can they bee more justly excited. Let
them make triall of fire at their own homes, who will kindle it in other
folks houses. And all the evil that over-hang the assailed, let it fall on the
heads of the assaylers. Lo, thus we are happily past from the Defence to
the Offence, so to make the King of <hi>France</hi> repent his rash undertaking of
so unjust a War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And unlesse he be more blinde in matter of Government,
then what he appears to be in his <hi>amours,</hi> we will make him aware of the
difference of overcoming weak Women, and working them to his desires,
and of taking up Arms against such Forces as are those of my King, and
Yours, which together do make so Formidable a Power. The King of
<hi>France</hi> might remember your Highnesse Victories, when clad in Purple,
and still a Cardinall, you made such important progresse against him in
his own Kingdom. I hope they vvill be no lesse that you shall make upon
this present occasion, after you shall have sustained the first brunts, at vvhich
the French are onely good. They vvill easily be vvithstood, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in the manner I have said; and all things turning afterwards to our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
nevv glory shall be added to your Highnesse, nevv reputation to
the affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> more safety to those of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and infinite honour
and satisfaction to us Souldiers, by such prosperous successe, as shall arise
from this War.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Buckquoy</hi> spoke thus to the contrary: <q>If those remedies (most illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Prince) which in these present necessities of <hi>Flanders</hi> ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from <hi>Spain,</hi> were as easily to be effected as 'tis easie to discourse of
them, I should likewise be of the same opinion of standing now upon the
defensive part with the King of <hi>France:</hi> but I cannot believe, that such aydes
as we at present stand in need of here, can come from <hi>Spain</hi> either in so
short a time, or in so great a measure as hath been supposed: So many
years experience may have taught us, that by reason of the great distance
of space, Counsel, and then succours much more, do most commonly come
from thence hither when tis too late; and that by reason likewise of the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:55461:89"/>
so immmense bulk of that so divided Monarchie, the provisions destin'd for
<hi>Flanders</hi> are alwayes very weak when they do come, being diverted by the
so many members whereof the body is composed: we may then fear that
upon this immergent occasion, provisions from those parts may meet with
the wonted obstructions; nay, with more then usual. The Indian Fleet
is not yet expected these many moneths: whole <hi>Spain,</hi> is now in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by reason of the expulsion of the Moors; and the taking up of Arms
which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> threatens in <hi>Malta,</hi> is likewise a businesse of great
consideration: so as these are all immediate diversions, and which undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
make for the King of <hi>France</hi> his advantage; whereas those which
have been thought upon for the affairs of <hi>Flanders</hi> are all of them doubtful,
and depend upon future successe: Wherefore I am of opinion, that it will
be hard to hope for such supplies from <hi>Spain,</hi> as will suffice to maintain the
new Forces which are by us now added to the old: It must therefore be
granted, that if your Highnes shall suffer the King of <hi>France</hi> his Armie to joyn
with the Veteran Souldiery of the United Provinces, the King must of a
suddain become so potent, as that he will be absolute master of the Field,
not only on that side, but even on this side the Mause. For why may not
he passe over the River either at the Bridge of the Town of <hi>Hue,</hi> in the
Neutral Countrey of <hi>Leige,</hi> or in some other part, without being hindred
by us? may he not then get in hither, go whither he pleaseth, and do what he
will? And though the United Provinces were not before inclined to break
into open War against these Countries, is it not to be feared, that invited
by so fair an occasion, they may do it now? will not our affairs be then
brought to the last point of despair? tis a known saying, That in extream
evils, we are to have recourse to extream remedies; the sword heals those
wounds which lenitives cannot do; and to despise dangers, proves some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the best way to escape them. I am then of opinion, that the present
condition of the affairs of <hi>Flanders</hi> being considered, it is necessary to put
on hazardous and bold resolutions, since without manifest losse of all these
Provinces, circumspect and cautious counsels cannot be admitted of. I think
you ought resolutely to deny the King of <hi>France,</hi> his passage through <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enburg;</hi>
that as he moves his Armie towards your Frontiers you shall move
yours towards his, and go to meet him, and hinder him from meeting with
the Veteran Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers of the United Provinces. I must confesse this reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
hath likewise its dangers; but the others me thinks are greater and
more apparent: The hazards of this, depend upon the event, which in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
is alwaies doubtful: nor can it be denied, but that the King of <hi>France</hi> is
a gallant Commander, and that he will have with him all the flowre of his
Nobilitie on Horseback; yet if on the otherside we shall consider our men,
bred up amongst Arms; so long and so well disciplined; accustomed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day to action and Battels: and who shall have your self in the head for
their Commander; why should we not hope that our Army should have
the better of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Army? my hopes are not a whit the
lesse for their being more in number: 'tis not numbers, but worth; not
confusion, but order: not the first onset, but the constant fighting, which
gets the victory: our squadrons of Foot will be satiated with bloud in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the Swissers, who will be they alone who will make any resistance:
they will easily put to flight the French Foot, and will so enhearten our
Horse as we may also hope to be victors on that side; so you shall see (as I
hope) the War begun and ended at the same time: and so you shall see a
new place made famous in these Countries, which peradventure may not
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:55461:89"/>
give place to that of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Quintaine, Gravelin,</hi> and <hi>Dorlan,</hi> all of them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
for the defeats which they in former times have given to the French,
thereby winning so much honour to our <hi>Flanders</hi> Armies. And it may so
fall out, that the King of <hi>France,</hi> when he shall see our men march so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
against his; may alter his mind from assailing these states, and may
be brought more patiently to endure those fiery onsets which he is cause of
unto himself by his so ill governed inward passions. Thus without any
danger you shall have ended a War, before it be well begun; and may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
put on such resolves as may be most convenient for your own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
for the affairs of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the publique service of Christendome,
and for the particular good of your people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reasons alledged by each of these great Commanders were certainly of
very great weight: on the one side, if the King of <hi>France</hi> should be suffered to
joyn with the Ancient Souldierie of the United Provinces, the affairs of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
would be in very great danger: and on the other side, to adventure that
Armie suddenly in a Battel, wherein the only hopes of supporting them laie,
was likewise a dangerous resolution. Marquesse <hi>Spinola</hi> seemed to lean to
the second proposition; were it either that <hi>Buckquois</hi> reasons prevailed more
with him; or that, that counsel, which was the bolder appear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to him the
most necessarie: he appear'd very desirous to be seen in so glorious a Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as that would be, where a Battle should be given to so great a Prince, and
so famous a Commander as was the King of <hi>France:</hi> to boot that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
many disastes from the French, in their practises concerning the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
of <hi>Conde;</hi> which peradventure moved a greater desire in him to fight
them. The Pope at this time laboured very much by Fatherly admonitions;
and earnest intreaties to induce the Princes interessed in this so great commotion,
to preserve their former friendship: and to this purpose he had parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
destined two Nuntios in extraordinary; the one the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Nazaret</hi> to be sent to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and the other the Arch-Bishop of
<hi>Chieri</hi> to be sent to the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When amidst so great perturbations, and ambiguitie of affairs, certain news
came to <hi>Brussels</hi> that the King of <hi>France</hi> was slain; the manner thus: Whilston
the 14 of <hi>May</hi> he was in his Coach in the streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> viewing the Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Arches which were prepared for the stately Coronation of his Queen;
he was murdered by the hand of a base mean Catiff, who making himself
master of the Kings life, by resolving desperately to lose his own, gave him
two deadly wounds in the flank with a long Knife. A miserable death indeed;
so great a King falling by so base hands, and in the nick of time when his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
was grown to that height, as <hi>France</hi> seemed not great enough to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
bounds thereunto: Which may serve for an instruction to Princes,
and amongst them, the most powerful, to let them know, that miseries are
mixt with their felicitie, and that on the Theater of Humane Tragedies, they
often make the most fatal and saddest Scenes.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> being dead, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> returned Post into
<hi>Flanders:</hi> and on a sudden the face of affairs was altered. The French-mens
heat was allaied; the Spaniards were very desirous to make use of this so
propitious occasion, and to march on with their Armie: But at last peaceable
counsels prevailed; and very good intelligence and correspondencie was held
between them, the Archduke, and the Queen Regent, Mother to the young
King. The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was still troubled with many cogitations: he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
as first Prince of the Bloud, the chief government of the Kingdom did
of right appertain to him, during the Kings minoritie: and pretended also
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:55461:90"/>
that after his Father in laws death, the office of Lord high Constable of <hi>France</hi>
did belong to him: But it would have caused great jealousies to have put
him into that office, and much more to have put the Kingdom into his hands;
so as he at last ceased from both these pretences, and satisfied himself with
other hopes, to have full contentment given him in other things at his return
to <hi>France.</hi> The Archdukes were then in <hi>Merimont,</hi> and with them the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
of <hi>Conde;</hi> who altering likewise with the alteration of affairs seemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
desirous to be reconciled to her Husband, and willing to return with
him into <hi>France: Conde</hi> went quickly to <hi>Merimont</hi> to do his respects to the
Archdukes, by whom he was received with like civilities as formerly; and
he on his side acknowledged his great obligations to them for their having
so greatly favoured his affairs. He did the like to the Spanish State ministers;
and these his first complements being over, he returned to <hi>Brussels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> where he
staied awhile with the Prince of <hi>Orenge;</hi> and then returned to <hi>Merimont,</hi> to
go for <hi>France:</hi> He did not as yet see his Wife; but their reconciliation vvas
soon after made in <hi>France:</hi> and she very vvell deserved his love, by her bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Chrildren to him, and no lesse by her vvorth. The Constable her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sent the Countesse of <hi>Overgne</hi> (a daughter of his also, but by another
Venter) to <hi>Merimont</hi> to bring the Princesse from <hi>Flanders,</hi> and to thank the
Archdukes for their having kept her with them. The Queen sent also Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur
<hi>de la Barre</hi> to the same place to visit the Prince, and to invite him to
come to <hi>Paris;</hi> and every day great many of the chief men of <hi>France</hi> came to
see him, and offer him their service. Three dayes after <hi>Conde</hi> went away, and
vvas met by his own Mother upon the Frontiers of <hi>France;</hi> and being every
vvhere incountred and imbraced by divers of the Nobilitie, he at last, being
followed by an infinite concourse of people, entred <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In which revolution of several affairs, fortune shewing how she is pleased
to sport her self daily vvith new spectacles of humane varieties; it may suffer
a dispute, vvhether the manner of the Prince his departure from <hi>France</hi> vvas
more unfortunate, or the like of his return fortunate: He departed a Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
in manifest danger of being taken, and living long in misery, and in the
horrour of Imprisonment: He returned not long after as in Triumph, with
such prerogatives of Honour and of Authoritie, as he might seem rather to be
King then First Prince of the Bloud Royal.</p>
