            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Having been lately preſented by a Friend with a Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>A further Diſcovery of the Plot, Dedicated to your ſelf Doctor, by</hi> Roger L'Eſtrange, <hi>and called the Second Edition:</hi> I have peruſed the ſame, and weighed it ſeriouſly, and conſidering the Conſequences thereof, as it is full of groſs Miſtakes, Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies, Equivocations and Ironies, both in the Title Page and Body of it; I have ſpent a few leiſure hours to make my Obſervations upon it, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to your better Judgment. In the Title Page is imployed new Fact to deceive the Reader, but the ſaid Author's Subject is only his own fallacious inferences of part of your Fact, as the Devil did by the Scriptures with our Saviour, for his own Ends. In the beginning of his Epiſtle to your ſelf, as a Theam to work upon, he ſets up a man of ſtraw, a ſpawn of his own brain by charging you with ſaying, <hi>That you told him he was a Papiſt, and that he reported you were a Fanatick,</hi> and upon this Foundation he frames his whole diſcourſe, good Gentleman, as he ſays, <hi>to diſcharge himſelf and you from thoſe two Calumnies</hi> (as he calls them) and as a proof of this aſſertion (if you will believe him) he tells you, <hi>It was improved by a couple of Nonſenſical and Seditious Libels,</hi> which he names in his Pamphlet, as alſo give you the ſtyle and character of the Author by hearſay, <hi>a ſmall thread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare Sollicitor in the Old Bayly, which,</hi> as he ſays, <hi>often uſes your name, and makes bolder with it than ſtands with the Dignity of your Figure in the Government.</hi> It ſeems he would monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the abuſing of you; but this I take to be a much more unequal coupling, than was by Doctor <hi>Wilde</hi> between <hi>Monſueir L'Eſtrange</hi> and <hi>Strange Lee:</hi> For whether or no there be any ſuch Sollicitor there, or if there be, that he was Author of ſuch things, or if he was, that it was with your privity or knowledge, which is thereby plainly and ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, but aſperſedly and groundleſly inſinuated, is altogether uncertain, and I am ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will hardly be found true by a packt Jury (to uſe his own Phraſe) upon that Evidence of his, and for the truth of it, I doubt he cannot find a Second.</p>
            <p>Then the Author proceeds to tell you, <hi>he is reviled by being called a Papiſt, a Leſſener of the Plot, a Diſparager of the King's Evidence, which he cannot bear, but reſolves either frankly to acquit himſelf, or ſinke under it,</hi> and I appeal to your ſelf and every impartial man, if by that Book he merits not the latter, and alſo the ſame reward he allows due to his fellow Scribler, though upon ſeveral Foundations, and I am ſure the unerring Rule is, <hi>he that is not with, is againſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I think the Author conceives he hath done you Doctor no ſmall honour, to <hi>make you his Ghoſtly Father,</hi> and indeed it's enforced very vigorouſly by an imprecation of <hi>his hopes of Heaven,</hi> and therefore he thinks you cannot without breach of the Rules of Charity, but believe <hi>he is a true Son of the Church of</hi> England. Indeed Doctor, I cannot foreſee why you ſhould doubt of the Veracity of this Aſſertion, ſeeing you have it from the mouth of one that never brake Faith with Man or Woman, nor ever betrayed any, unleſs you mean to have further and more demonſtrable Evidence before you lend him your belief; for in theſe Caſes I know you generally direct your Judgment by the infallible Rule of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, that <hi>Trees muſt be known beſt by their Fruit (not their Leaves;)</hi> if ſo, then give me your patience further to acquaint you with my Sentiments of this his ſecond Elaborate Work, and ſee what I can find how he hath made good his Title Page or his Aſſertion, and how good a Son Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> hath proved himſelf thereby, to his Mother the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſays, <hi>he is not without Bowels of humanity to men of other perſwaſions,</hi> but I am perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one that dares not take upon himſelf to affirm he deſerves ſuch a Title with that Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thite he challenges, yet would àlſo allow them Bowels of Chriſtianity; but I know there are various degrees of Members in a true Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as Babes, and others of a ſtronger con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but I ſhall not determine by his expreſſions which of them I take, the Author
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45206:3"/>
but leave that to more diſcerning Judgments. He pretends to be mighty plain and open hearted to you, for he tells <hi>you as a Friend,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>he hath moxe Charity for a Moral Pagan than twenty Hypocritical Chriſtians.</hi> I ſhall not give you any trouble of my thoughts, who this worthy Author means, either by Pagan or Chriſtian, but only aſſure you, if it were true, this is one of the main parts of his Diſcovery in that Pamphlet, eſpecially as to me, for indeed I have not learned that diſtinction of a Chriſtian afore, but always from the Woes pronounced in Scripture againſt Hypocrites, I took them not to be Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>This kind Author ſays, <hi>he hath a natural Veneration for the Government, and all that love it, the King's Loyal Witneſſes, and Preſervers of his Life, he believes the Plot, as much of it as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Subject ought, nay, and pawns his Conſcience</hi> (which doubtleſs is large) <hi>you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more of it,</hi> for all this give me leave to tell you Doctor, I am of a quite contrary o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for I know you are of a ſharper ſight than to have your Judgment eclipſed with a Fogg; yet truly upon the whole Scope and Matter of his Diſcourſe in that Pamphlet, I am ſatisfied he could not (though I know others do and would, and know they ought) have afforded more than a natural veneration for all thoſe things; but I may tell you Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, though not the Author (leſt I ſhould be offenſive to hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> natural Judgment;) That things of God (as I take this in a great meaſure to be) are not to be rightly underſtood by meer natural men, and in that capacity only he muſt herein be certainly apprehended, as may more fully be deduced from his following Words, <hi>that he cannot believe what he does not, nor cannot, as that</hi> Bedingfield <hi>is alive again,</hi> and what is this to you, and what can ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally be deduced from it, but that a Crack-fart of the Nation having ſtuffed it into his Fardel, without any privity of yours, for ought appears, it muſt be made uſe of as a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon you, and truly this as ſtrongly Seconded by a Learned Inſtance <hi>of buttered Turnips,</hi> but it's a very ſlippery one, and indeed as ſaucy as all the reſt, and of as little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with men of ſound underſtanding, becauſe it plainly intimates your Evidence is as little to be credited as that Aſſertion, but perchance his opinion may have ſome influence upon thoſe two ſorts of Perſons he appropriates to his Party by theſe Words <hi>(our crafty Knaves and our fooliſh)</hi> but I hope of no other. But when I came to conſider of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Paragraph <hi>(That where Authority had paſſed a Sentence, there is no longer any place for Heſitation or Demurr)</hi> and an hand of remark upon it by Capital Letters; I had been amazed, but that I did awaken and rouſe my ſelf by calling to mind ſome Proverbial Sayings, that there is none ſo blind as he that will not ſee, and that ſome ſort of Perſons had need have good Memories, and the like; for this made me conclude, that either the Author of that Pamphlet did not underſtand what he had uttered in his unworthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon you Doctor, or elſe he did not conſider that by this his Concluſion (which all ſober men muſt agree to be true) he had produced and publiſhed a full and ſufficient proof againſt himſelf, how he had thereby (I mean his Reflections) put an Affront not to be forgiven or forgotten, not upon you alone, but upon His Sacred Majeſty, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Juſtice and Reputation of the Nation; In regard His Majeſty publickly in His Gracious Speech to both Houſes of Parliament had ſo far owned yours and others diſcovery of this damnable and helliſh Plot, That He was graciouſly pleaſed therein to declare His real ſatisfaction in it, and gave them His Royal Aſſent and Direction to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the ſame, which was followed with an Eloquent one of the Right Honourable the Lord Chancellor, and preſſed and forced with Cogent Arguments and Reaſons, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the Houſe of Peers had owned the ſame by their Votes, their Committing of Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals therein, and other their Proceedings thereupon, as alſo the Houſe of Commons by their Votes, their Addreſſes, their Impeachments, their Committings of Criminals there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and other their Proceedings thereupon; the Lord Chief Juſtice his joyning with the opinion of the then Houſe of Commons, and his ready and chearful committing of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons accuſed thereof upon your ſingle Oath, his and other the Learned Judges and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Peace in a Judicial manner proceeding againſt ſeveral of the ſaid Criminals, and the Verdicts of many Juries, conſiſting of many Loyal Perſons given upon yours and others Teſtimony, with much more of this kind, which is ſo well and generally known, that I need not give my ſelf the trouble of writing, nor you of reading them, and truly Doctor, the conſideration of theſe things have given me ample ſatisfaction, and ſo I doubt not but it will do every really true Chriſtian Engliſh-man, or elſe to me it ſeems only ſtrange.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:45206:3"/>
But before this Author comes to his full Vindication, he muſt have another fling at you Doctor, for he ſays <hi>he hath a great value for your Function, Imployment and Charracter;</hi> what theſe are in his Equivocal meaning, no body certainly can tell but himſelf, and you need not doubt but he well underſtands himſelf, or at leaſt he would have you and the world to believe ſo by his Publiſhng it, for he ſtill keeps the Staff in his own hands for to make himſelf Judge; For he believes you as far as he ought, which according to true enterpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is, that he dares not ſpeak plain Engliſh, and hath what ever the Author ſays, too much of the French droll in him. I muſt confeſs I muſt declare my ſelf, not to have ſo much Chriſtian Charity, as to belive all thoſe Characters the Author gives of himſelf; that is, I do not believe <hi>he is Friend to down-right dealing,</hi> but I can without Heſitation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he is <hi>a great Friend to Liberty of Speech; to an eaſie Gloſs an eaſie Companion,</hi> as much as any man, or elſe he is much wronged: but then he tells you Doctor of your calling him Rogue twenty times, for which he thanks you and forgives you; but this is but a Copy of his Countenance, and uſed as a meer Shooing-horn to draw on the like likewiſe of calling you Rogue I know its a Word you often uſe, and its twenty to one you were right nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the twenty if not all, but its not to be taken in the Common ſenſe of the Vulgar uſage, to a man of vile and baſe Actions; but as a differing Character of an Adverſary to the truth of your's and other's Evidence, in the great matter in queſtion; and in that ſenſe only you ſo frequently uſe it, eſpecially when your Zeal is too much provoked with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and I fear his hopes will fail him in your better acquaintance; for I know if ever it may be it muſt be upon his amendment, and what hopes there is of it that I ſee not.</p>
            <p>For in his next Paragraph, he tells you barefacedly and ſhews it in plain terms, how much he is your Friend, <hi>for he ſlights your Favour, and ſets you at Defiance,</hi> and all he hath to ground it upon is, <hi>that Currs</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>Hunt him</hi> and therefore he muſt Snarl at you, as if you Doctor were Confederate with men, of whom and their Extravagant Actions, there is not one tittle of Demonſtration you were any way ſo much as Privy to: Indeed this Diſcovering Mounſieur is very hardly put to it, to find a way to beſpatter you; but I am ſure the Foundation is ſo inviſible, that the Spots will never be ſeen, for he would make the World believe, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as he ſays, <hi>Another of his fellow-Pamphleteers hath Injured him, therefore you are blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; and to Vindicate himſelf,</hi> as he calls it, he hath the Confidence upon Search and Examination, of his fellow-Scriblers works to try the truth of that to reflect upon you, but in which it doth not appear in the leaſt you are any way Concerned; But I think you have more wit than to meddle with ſuch matters, and know how to ſpend your time to better advantage, both to the Publique and your ſelf, than to be lead by a <hi>Will in the Wiſp.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the Author leaves you Doctor, and invites his Reader; and here he begins ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to unvail: For he tells him <hi>nothing ſo difficult as the Myſtery of this Deteſtable Plot, a Judgment of our ſins, Augmented by our Follies; then he ſhews him, how by the Difference between Believers, and Vnbelievers, That truth and Chriſtianity are in Danger to be loſt; then he Quarrels with his fellow-Scriblers, and Compares it to the late times, and bids us have a care of the ſame incantation over again; he tells him nothing was more Narrowly Sifted, or more Vigorouſly diſcouraged than this Conſpiracy. Reformation is the buſineſs of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but if begun at the wrong end its Tumult. An Effectual proviſion againſt the danger of the Romiſh Practices, will not ſerve their turn, whoſe Quarrel is barely to the Name of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: If they cannot find Popery, they will make it; For it is now new thing in a popular Out-cry in the matter of Religion, to have a State-Faction in the belly of it; and then again compares it with the late times,</hi> and ſo Concludes that Paragraph. What an Hotch-Potch Chimera is this, and as Forreign to the Caſe in hand, as the Eaſt is from the Weſt? What is the Scribling of Pamphleteers, now there is no Licenſer (when it was altogether as bad, when there was one) or what is the babling at Coffe-houſes to be regarded, or be thought to have any ſhare in the Proſecution of this Diſcovery? It's bare mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and not at all Myſterious to men of underſtanding; and although as the truth of the Evidence is, It doth ſolely and Principally Centre in the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Party, yet I cannot with all the skill I have, with this learned Authors Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to boot, underſtand wherein Religion is concerned in the leaſt, eſpecially, the differences between the Church of England, and the Diſſenters from it, as he aims
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45206:4"/>
to inforce it. Nor is the queſtion the ſame as to the Plot, you have Diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor the Tranſactions thereupon, nor in any Poſſibility can be Paralelled with thoſe of the late times; Nay I know ſome of the Roman Catholick Religion, take it quite otherwiſe, for a perſon of Honour of that perſwaſion, lately told me; <hi>That he believed, neither the King nor the Nation, would be happy or ſafe until they were well rid of the Jeſuites, and their King-killing Doctrine,</hi> and I think with Mr. <hi>Strange</hi> his favour, it was not mannerly done of him, to arraign the Judgments of the Repreſentatives of the Nation in Parliament, to ſay nothing was more narrowly Sifted, nor more Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly diſcouraged (I conceive that was intended (incouraged) but miſtaken by the Printer) than this Conſpiracy; for certainly had it been ſo, they would never have made the neglect of it, a Conſiderable part of their Impeachment againſt the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,</hi> and doubtleſs they did not make that without due Conſideration of ſuch authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick proofs as they had before them, to make it good.</p>
            <p>And the Author of that Pamphlet, having thus by ſtating a Caſe, that is not in the leaſt the Caſe you Doctor have in hand, he draws a Concluſion Suitable to it; <hi>That it might be uſeful, and find Credit upon its own Account;</hi> and then giving an <hi>Encomium of himſelf, he caſts</hi> off the Reader, and enters into the Liſts, with you again. In the beginning of his Book, the Author gave you the allowance, of <hi>a Figure in the Government;</hi> But now he'l make you as little as a Cipher; he thinks you of ſo little underſtanding, that you by his Incoherent Arguments are now perſwaded out of your Senſes, and of the realli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and truth, of that Caſe you have with ſo much danger avowed and juſtifed, by, and with a fictitious Caſe of his own making, and proved it by Fallacious Arguments: and it is ſo far unlike yours Doctor, as inſtead of four feet, it doth not go upon one of them; and upon the Credence the Author hath, of this ſuppoſed Conqueſt over you in a great part, he proceeds to make it compleat, and is reſolved in another Point, right or wrong, <hi>to ſtand fair in your Opinion, and</hi> that is; <hi>That he is free from the Itch of Scribling unleſs where his Genius tells him his Pen may be of Publique uſe, and where he is Prompted on by ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continence of a publick Spirit as you find in your ſelf, and he</hi> (Injured Gentleman) <hi>never was but upon the Defenſive part, and received no reply but reproaches</hi> (as he terms them) <hi>of Popiſhly affected, or a Villifier of the Kings Evidence.</hi> Indeed this Compariſon of his is of the ſame Stamp, with the other, but Doctor you may well pardon him, becauſe he Pardoned you for calling him Rogue, and this is only out of a great deſire he hath, to be eſteemed like you in publick Spiritedneſs, but I am afraid his temper is more like <hi>Baals,</hi> that was only Sollicitous to die the death of the Righteous, but I do not remember one Word of his living their life. I think as to the matter in hand, I have had as much Experience of your Actions, and as Seriouſly, and Impartially and Duely weighed them, as another; but its very Probable the Eyes of Mr. <hi>L' Eſtrange,</hi> and my Underſtanding differ, which may occaſion from us, Various Inferences and Concluſions. Its true I have obſerved you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be earneſtly Zealous for truth in the Fact that you have Diſcovered, and againſt all Oppoſers of it, under what Circumſtances ſoever; but that you have in the leaſt Promoted it, either for this or the other Party, or againſt this or that Party, but only againſt particular Perſons guilty, Sparing none of what perſwaſion ſoever, that are within your knowledge, not in the leaſt by any overt Act yet occurrs to my knowledge, that you have any wayes made it your buſineſs, either to ſet up or pull down, or to make diviſion amongſt Parties of differing Perſwaſions. I am ſure it hath not yet appeared to be your buſineſs, but rather of an healing Temper, but how much it is that learned Authors is Manifeſtly apparent, and he that runs may read it, beſides do but obſerve the different Foundations between you and him; For, Doctor, you go upon occular and auricular Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and he upon Coffee-houſes diſcourſes, only ſeconded by a Report of the ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous affirmation of a Lady, and that by hearſay too, and then how naturally it follows that theſe malicious Rumors (as he calls them) put upon himſelf, muſt needs promote and ſtir up him to Vindicate you, that was not in the leaſt concerned or named in it, nor either wanted or craved his aid to defend you, however with Cauſe or without Cauſe, he hath no mind to part with you yet; not out of love to prove you no Fanatick, but to other more Siniſter Ends and Purpoſes, That is, to get a ſmall reward for his Pamphlet, and Vindicate the Papiſts, and cruſh the Phanaticks (as he calls them) as I hope I ſhall plainly and Evidently demonſtrate.</p>
            <p>

But now warmly clad with theſe wonderfully Erroneous Conſiderations that incumbred his diſturbed Brains, <hi>with the help of taking your Works to pieces;</hi> he had now fallen under ſuch a Conception from which the World might expectſuch a product, as was expected from the Mountain; But you know that proved a Mouſe.</p>
            <p>Now the Author <hi>Glories in his Acquiſition of Materials to defend you, and now Magnifies his thoughts of his being armed to Suppreſs Popery;</hi> and is as ſure of his way as any blind man in Town, for he will as certainly hit it, as he that takes the way to <hi>Oxford,</hi> to be the right and ſtrait way to go to <hi>Canterbury.</hi> When this Author hath pleaſed himſelf with theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible thoughts, <hi>by your Clue</hi> as he ſays, <hi>he enters into the almoſt Inextricable Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth of the Plot, till he found out ſome Prieſts you pointed at, lurking in Holes like Foxs, and then he could not forbear Publiſhing it to the Nation in his firſt Edition of this Pamphlet,</hi> and all this <hi>upon your Credit,</hi> as he tells you. But if this Author ſhould fall under this misfortune that neither you Doctor, nor any ſober Wiſe man, ſhould approve of his abortive births from his falſe Conceptions, how can he make the Nation a Compenſation for theſe abuſes; as without all Peradventure, the Caſe will appear to every one that conſiders impartially the Plot it ſelf, that it is not an Inextricable Labyrinth, but in truth is pure and eaſie Matter of Fact, and the Eſſence thereof lies not at all in any of thoſe by-Circumſtantials Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> hath made uſe of (and as he ſays) <hi>For his own ends,</hi> which is certainly true, for they are not in the leaſt to the Advantage of the Nation, the Governors or Government, the Proteſtant Religion. nor the Kings witneſſes, but in apparent and great diſhonour to all.</p>
            <p>In his next Paragraph, he cries out, <hi>what Innocence can Warrant againſt Envy or Authority? protect when</hi> Le Strange <hi>comes to be arraigned as a Papiſt, for ſhewing the likelieſt was to Extirpate Popery, and yourname cannot Protect him in it?</hi> nay he tells you <hi>it is well if you can uphold your ſelf, if this goes on,</hi> and concludes, <hi>that none can fall foul upon that Diſcovery without Wounding your Evidence.</hi> Now certainly had this Author as well believed the truth of this reaſon, as he cannot but imagine others do, he would never under this Diſguiſe of Friendſhip to you Doctor, have undertaken thus publickly to Villifie you. Alas he talks of Innocence, that is begging the queſtion: I know not of any that can be allowed him by any one in his right Wits, nor do I know nor never heard, but from himſelf, that ever he did or could ſhew any way that is likely to extirpate Popery. I admire at his Confidence to adventure upon ſuch a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the people, which only and ſingly appertains to the Magiſtracy, and I think he hath cauſe to rejoyce that he is not queſtioned for a Seditious Pamphletteer, for that his Work in ſuch a time as this is, which calls. for our Union not diviſion. He ſays, <hi>ſome call his book Jeſuitical;</hi> for my part. I think there is no man in his right Wits, that can Judge leſs of his Book, than call the Scope and Drift of it, of a Jeſuitical Stamp: but what is that to you Doctor, does it therefore follow that becauſe he hath written a book deſerves that Cenſure, you muſt be accounted a Papiſt that was no way Privy to it? but this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is like the reſt, but upon hard Pumping he has indeavoured to bring you in by Head and Shoulders; for he ſays <hi>he hath your Word and Oath for it, for you ſwear the Prieſts and Jeſuites herd themſelves amongſt the Non-Conformiſts; they denie it, and yet prove themſelves in the Plot and diſcredit the Kings Evidence.</hi> What Hocus Pocus is here? I am ſure in no part of your Evidence is it Sworn, they herd with Non-Conformiſts, nor have I yet ever ſeen or heard any proof, that any Non-Conformiſts have proved themſelves to be in the Plot; or that any of them whatſoever, diſcredited any of the Kings Evidence, but this muſt be accepted upon his Veracity, or elſe his ſtrain of Wit, by his Subſequent Querie; for thus the Author argues, <hi>if they Shelter not themſelves in Conventicles, and field-Meetings, to ſtir up Broyls in the Government, What becomes of your Teſtimony? and none but Papiſts would oppoſe the Ferretting them out.</hi> What he means, or what he would be at, If you know Doctor, its well, but for my part I underſtand not the Sence of it; but becauſe you have proved there were ſome Jeſuites, or their Agents ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> to Facilitate their deſign, amongſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented Scots, if they could, therefore all the Deſſenters from the Church of England in England, are guilty of the Plot; I am very Confident the meaneſt of Grammarian School-Maſters in England, would have whipped the dulleſt Boy he had under his tuition, for uſing ſuch a Nonſenſical Argument.</p>
            <p>In Confirmation of this, the Author further tells you, <hi>nothing can be clearer according to your Evidence of</hi> Wright <hi>and others ſent amongſt the Scots, with other Evidence, to that Purpoſe,</hi> and then ſays, <hi>all this will not ſerve to Convince ſome of the Prieſts mingled with Fanaticks, till</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45206:5"/>
               <hi>the Pilgrims and the Forty Thouſand black Bills come to open their Eyes.</hi> This Author is in much wrath, that every body does not wear his Spectacles; for I am fully aſſured there is not a ſober Engliſh Chriſtian of what perſwaſion ſoever; except ſuch Sons of the Church of England, as he and God-dam-me Sons (that ſee no further than the Church-yard) but do believe your Evidence in that particular, as fully as your Words, or intention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by extended. Then he concludes that Paragraph, with a Clamorous acclamation. <hi>If theſe Infidels</hi> (I preſume he means the Deſſenters from the Church of England) <hi>Have any Priviledg for the Defaming publick Juſtice, and blaſting the Kings Evidence, above other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they ſhould, do well to produce it.</hi> But I am ſure it would have been better done of him, to have produced ſome Proof of the Slander, before he had aſperſed the Parties with it; I never heard of their guilt of the one, nor the other, but from his Pen which I take to be as little Slander as his mouth. Then he proceeds to tell you, <hi>he hath read, conſidered and ſtudied you, and what wonderfull things you have done for him in the Dark, and at length brought him into the light;</hi> and when he hathlent you theſe Ironical Expreſſions, he comends you in the ſame Dialect, and further tells you of <hi>his Senſibility of the roundneſs of your Periods, the Luxuriancy of your Invention (where there is Scope for it) the Frankneſs of your Stile, and the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ceptions.</hi> Indeed had it been your deſign Doctor, to have made your trade, of Living and getting Dinners by Scribling, or had thoſe things which you have publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in Print, been otherwiſe than pure matter of Fact, to ſatisfie the Governors, Government and People of the Nation; and limitted and bounded to the nature and quality of the thing in queſtion, and in a great part in the nature of a report; Its morally Poſſible you might as well have obſerved your Periods as the Fault-finder; nay I can ſay it with ſome Aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, It is ſo in all Impartial mens Judgments, all things duely conſidered; which anſwers may alſo ſerve you for your Inventions, and Conceptions, for I know not of any ſuch in all your works; and doubtleſs thoſe that do as well know you Doctor, and underſtand you as Mr. <hi>Le Strange,</hi> are clearly of opinion, that had you Imployed your Genius that way, if it had been but in making a Play againſt your own Mother, you might and would have come off with as much Reputation, made as good Syllogiſmes, and had as pertinent Coheren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as any that have undertaken or performed the like; and for the Frankneſs of your Style, it being in the purſuite of truth, Its very well known your Zeal for that, makes you no more ſpare any one guilty, than you did the Author when you called him Rogue, which he agrees, you did well in, as your apprehended him.</p>
            <p>Then he tells you, <hi>This Epiſtle had been monſtrous in any other age;</hi> but why not in this (when its twice the length of the reſt of his Pamphlet) is not Diſcernable by any body but himſelf; then he tells you <hi>Knavery and Hipocriſie were in Faſhion, Thirty or Forty years ago.</hi> but ſpares the telling with whom, therefore I cannot give it any particular anſwer, but muſt leave it with him and his Acquaintance in thoſe times; he ſays <hi>now the preſent Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of</hi> France <hi>runs upon Poyſoning, the Enemies of our Government, altogether upon the Vein of Plotting.</hi> Indeed that's too true, and the Plotters, as the Caſe is are of ſeveral ſorts, ſome have the Helliſh and audacious Impudence to contrive his Majeſties death by violence, his Magiſtrates, his Witneſſes, the overthrow of our Government, the extirpating of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant and Introducing the Romiſh Religion (ſo called;) and there are another ſort which I apprehend, little inferior to the other in the Conſequence of it, who by their Poyſonous Principles and frothy Strains of wit, with their Paper-Squibs audaciouſly traduce and fly in the Faces of the Governors and Government; and make nothing of turning the Juſtice of the Nation into Ridicule both at home and abroad, and inſtead of healings broach diviſions amongſt the diſſenters from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thereby to give all advantage imaginable (according to your Evidence, to weaken the Parties) to our profeſſed Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, without the leaſt juſt occaſion, or any other Rationally than to do that for our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, they themſelves could not effect, but by making us Fools, or Knaves, to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>
            <p>Then this Author takes it Poſitively upon him to tell you Doctor, <hi>that he hath acquitted himſelf; That he is no Papiſt, and now he reſolvedly undertakes ſo to acquit himſelf of the charge upon him by you, and your Father, of his Reporting you for a Fanatick.</hi> In my Opinion, if he doth the one no more than he hath done the other, he might have ſpared his Labour; I fear if the matter had been true, he will not give you any cauſe to thank him, for I do not remember one authentick Proof, nor any other rational Argument yet produced by him,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45206:5"/>
that he is not a Papiſt unleſs ſuch an Argument which he uſed that took upon him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute <hi>Bellermine,</hi> by telling him it was not ſo: Is it out of pure kindneſs, or at your requeſt he takes this pains for you? Truly, I think both alike, for I verily believe, if the thing be true that he ſaid, you do not eſteem it ſuch a Scandal as you need to be vindicated from it, either by him or any one elſe; but he ſays, <hi>your exhortation to Indulgence opened the mouths of ſome ignorant people to that effect;</hi> I doubt not in this but you may take Mr. <hi>L'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Eſtrange</hi> at his Word, and keeping to <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Rule, not to anſwer him in his own way, let it paſs as it is, and although you went no further than as an exhortation, Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> hath the Confidence to take upon him to inſtruct and to give Judgment too. Then he <hi>exclaims againſt a perſecuting Spirit,</hi> how this Coheres with the precedent matter, it's a Riddle to me, and ſeriouſly I cannot fancy who or what he means by it; certainly he dares not be guilty of ſo much Confidence, as rather than he would not beſpatter and traduce you, he will arraign the whole Juſtice of the Nation, for if that ſhould be his meaning (which to me ſeems very obvious) I believe not ignorant but wiſe people would think he did not lie under any aſperſion, but rather take that Character already given him to be far ſhort of his true demerit; but I am ſure the whole drift of his Pamphlet is for cauſeleſs perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but bleſſed be God our Governours are of a more healing ſpirit,</p>
            <p>Now he tells you, <hi>that by this time you ſee what a Church of</hi> England <hi>man is to truſt to, when he (the true Son of the Church) is boxed on both ſides,</hi> and then he concludes that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph with this Queſtion, <hi>With what face ſhall any man dare to charge him for a Papiſt, that hath done ſo much for the Proteſtant Religion, or a Fanatick, that hath done ſo much for the Church of</hi> England? I think it may be thus reſolved, that if it be without cauſe, it muſt be with a brazen face; but if the Party he means be one that can tell what the Church-yard Wall is made of and not the Church, he may then lie open to all ſorts of Cenſures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he hath acted on all ſides, as he puts the Caſe.</p>
            <p>The Plot indeed is repreſented to be triplicite, <hi>viz.</hi> againſt the King, Government and Religion; but what queſtion or diſtinction this Author will make, we ſhall ſee anon, for there is his <hi>Diana;</hi> but that you Doctor, or any other of the King's Witneſſes in this caſe have in the leaſt occaſioned ſuch a queſtion, is not in my apprehenſion to be deduced from any of your Evidences, and I believe that no man that hath ever heard, read of, or ſeen the Arts of thoſe Perſons charged with that horrid Plot in any of their Maſſacres, either at home or abroad, that ever they made any diſtinction of Perſons that were Diſſenters from themſelves in Doctrine or Practice: From what can it be imagined they would have done it by, or in this Plot, or that they did ſo intend by it, only to cut off the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and leave the Diſſenters from them, or only cut off the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, and leave the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> there is no ſhadow of colour for it, and it's fully proved by you to be intended general to all Diſſentets from the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now like a knowing Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> acquaints you how far he underſtands, and <hi>what is Religion,</hi> he fixes it in the Word <hi>Government, in which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is comprehended Regiment, Eccleſiaſtical and Civil, and incluſively the Order of Biſhops, and Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church,</hi> and then concludes poſitively, <hi>that that and no other is the Proteſtant Religion deſigned in the Plot;</hi> and he thinks in his ſecond Poſition he makes it good, for he ſays, <hi>they</hi> (meaning the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England) are Religious and their name is Legion;</hi> and his third is as good as that, for therein this Author affirms, <hi>they</hi> (the ſaid Diſſenters) <hi>are Chriſtian Arbbs;</hi> but the fourth goes beyond all, <hi>That it ſtands not with Common Senſe for Papiſts to plot the ruine of their own Auxiliaries,</hi> and this he lays at your door, <hi>that it's againſt the Reaſon of your Depoſitions that they ſhould contrive their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when at that time they are making uſe of them to deſtroy us,</hi> and then moſt abhominably Chriſtian-like he briskly lets fly at the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> with a moſt Diſmal Judgment, <hi>that Heaven and Hell is as eaſie to be brought together, as to reconcile thoſe People to any terms of Piety or Civil Order, that corruptly ſtyle themſelves Proteſtants.</hi> I muſt confeſs here perchance the Author may apprehend he hath the whip hand of any one that will undertake to anſwer, in reſpect of the Law; but I think, without offence, I may put you in mind of the Words of the Biſhop of <hi>Donn</hi> in his Preface to his Grand Exemplar, which are, <hi>That when it appears a Kingdom is converted to Chriſtianity, the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is made a Church, Gentile Prieſts are Chriſtian Biſhops, the Subjects Servants of Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:45206:6"/>
               <hi>the Religion turned Chriſtian, and the Laws of the Nation made part of the Religion, there is no change of Government, but Chriſt is King and the Temporal Power his Subſtitute, and is to promote obedience to him.</hi> Now I muſt confeſs I am, and I doubt not but every really true Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> will be much more inclinable to take Doctor <hi>Tayler</hi> for an Authentick Author in this Point of Religion than Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> (though he does not uſe the word Proteſtant) and without all peradventure his Judgment is upon Truth, I mean the word of God, which Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> altogether omits (to the great proof of his Sonſhip) and only grounds himſelf in that caſe in my apprehenſion upon ſeveral and Vulgar Errors; as firſt, I take it to be an undeniable Truth from our Saviour and his Apoſtles, that there is but one Religion, and not Legions, and that under two Heads; 1. <hi>Loving God with all your heart;</hi> 2. <hi>Love our Neighbours as our ſelves;</hi> unleſs it may be ſaid that every <hi>Chimera</hi> of mens brains, or every Notion (as the Author calls Religion) or every Form is a Religion. I am of opinion it's Nonſence, and I cannot but concur with Dr. <hi>Tayler,</hi> that the Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian or Chriſtian Religion is the Religion, <hi>Catexochene,</hi> and what ever Forms in true and due order to that are framed, doubtleſs they are praiſe-worthy, and ought to be obſerved by all that Love the Kingdom of Chriſt (but yet I take it the Form is improperly called a Religion) but for this Author that hath the Confidence to ſtyle himſelf the true Son, and would fain be eſteemed the Champion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to leave out the only Eſſential part of a true Church, whoſe Foundation ought to be upon the Rock of Ages, and to place it only in humane Laws, which as Dr. <hi>Tayler</hi> ſays, are but part, and only in Subſtitution to that which is really true, is as I ſaid before, to take the Church-Yard and all for the Church, or inſtead of commending the Vine to praiſe the Hedge or Fence about it; for as Dr, <hi>Tayler</hi>'s opinion is, the Temporal Power is to be uſed primarily and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to promote obedience to Chriſt, not to its ſelf, or any thing contrary to Chriſt's Doctrine, Practices or Precepts; therefore to me it ſeems apparent that the Author hath not done right to his Mother, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which makes me fear in regard the Fathers of the Church ſeem to be of opinion againſt him in diſcription of a Church: I conceive it may without ſtraining be rationally conjectured he was not ſuckled by his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers milk, but by a Foſter Nurſe, otherwiſe certainly he would not have omitted ſo Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiala Worth of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the rather, for that he might with eaſe have proved, That when the Body of this Kingdom began to ſhake off that Spiritual Slavery impoſed on our Anceſtors by the Romiſh Yoke they then lay under, the alteration that then was made by the Governours and Government of this Nation, was the neareſt and moſt agreeable by the Articles, Cannons and Injunctions then agreed and eſtabliſhed to the Apoſtolical Rule, and purſuant to Dr. <hi>Tayler</hi>'s Judgment therein, as they could; For that our Religion ſhould ſolely depend upon humane Law, it muſt be and may be as changeable as that of which I am ſure we and our Anceſtors have had woful Experience, as by Repeals of Statutes for that purpoſe in the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> witneſs. Another Vulgar Errour, I conceive him with ſome clearneſs gullty of, is, in calling the Church of <hi>England</hi> the only Proteſtant Religion aimed at in this Caſe by the Papiſts. Indeed I have heard once the Queſtion was debated amongſt Perſons of an higher Sphere than Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> what the Proteſtant Religion was, and it was thought fit to be left undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and doubtleſs not imprudently, for if we ſhould make that the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the Religion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it would give our Adverſaries the Papiſts a vaſt and inevitable Advantage; for if Hiſtory be in that Caſe to be depended upon, the Lutherans, the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were before the Church of <hi>England,</hi> under the denomination of Proteſtants, and I do doubt it will appear if it ſhould be brought into diſpute, they differ in many and main Points; but then the Conſequence would inevitably follow, that we muſt be put to prove which is the true one, another advantage the Papiſts would have (and which I have heard often made uſe of;) That they (I mean the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> are the Mother Church, and of many hundreds of years before the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and doubtleſs they may be too hard for us in that Point, if our Foundation begun only in Proteſtantiſm, but in truth the Foundation of our Apoſtolical Britiſh Church, which is fully, clearly and elegantly proved and made out (by the Learned and Judicious Author of the Book intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>of the Heart and its right Sovereign)</hi> to be ancienter than <hi>Rome</hi>'s, eſpecially here in this Nation by many Centuries of Years, and for his ſaying, <hi>by your Evidence it appears the Fanaticks</hi> (as he calls them) <hi>are to be Papiſts Auxiliaries, and therefore its not rational they</hi>

               <hi>(the Papiſts) would work their Ruine:</hi> It's true according to the Common and Vulgar term, you in your Depoſitions call it the Proteſtant Religion indefinitely; but why this muſt not concern all manner of Diſſenters from the Romiſh Church, I am ſure does not in the leaſt appear, nor can any other thing rationally be expected, but the extirpation of all Diſſenters from them of <hi>Rome</hi> without diſtinction, nor is it proved by you Doctor, the Jeſuitical Party endeavoured to make any other uſe of them, but as all Conquerors do, to divide their Diſſenters to facilitate their intended Enterprize; if ſo, then his unchriſtian like Cenſure muſt of neceſſity be unwarrantable and groundleſs. Dear Doctor, I muſt beg your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for my prolixity upon this Paragraph, but finding this the Author's Corner-Stone, I could not paſs it over ſlightly, being ſo really zealous for the ancient Britiſh Apoſtolical Religion, that as God was heretofore pleaſed to honour this Iſland to have the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King, and a Britiſh Woman to be Mother of the firſt Chriſtian Emperour in the World, ſo to me the finger of God ſeems plainly to point at, and ſhew that in this latter Age he intends further to honour this Nation with a King and Government, that will be his true and real Subſtitutes to promote ſincere obedience to his Son, and to bring us with healing under one Shepherd, and all to be of one Sheepfold.</p>
            <p>Then taking that forgranted, which is denied him; <hi>That the Proteſtant Religion aymed at in the Plot, is the Eſtabliſhed Religion of the Church of</hi> England; the Author tells you, <hi>that you cannot be a Friend to the State without being one to the Church too.</hi> This as I have ſaid before, is but a begging of the Queſtion, and then he concludes from thence, <hi>that he that phancies you Doctor not Canonical and Orthodox, ſuppoſes you build with one hand, and pluck down with the other;</hi> here is begging Queſtion upon Queſtion to bring ſomething out that is no way applicable to you; for your buſineſs Doctor, hath been ſolely and only to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the King and his Councils with matters of Fact, and leave the building and pulling down to their Wiſdoms, and not therein in the leaſt to concern your ſelf as the Author hath done in that Pamphlet too much.</p>
            <p>Then he puts the Caſe the general way, and ſays, <hi>the Diſſenters from the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>cannot any way be ayding in a Reformation, but by their Prayers and good Wiſhes upon pain of Sedition.</hi> It's much ſuch a man as Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> who takes himſelf to be of ſuch profound Parts and Knowledge, ſhould ſo much miſtake himſelf, for certainly as men and Subjects under his Majeſtie's Obeyſance, they are as capable and legally of ſerving his Majeſty in any ſuch Commands, as any other men or Subjects whatſoever.</p>
            <p>I think his Caſe put, <hi>whether or no, and how far Proteſtants may unite,</hi> is fully anſwered in the Solution to the laſt Paragraph, but <hi>what the Diſſenters</hi> to the Church of <hi>England, meeting and aſſembling as to Religious Worſhips,</hi> is any way material to the Defence of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie's Perſon or Government, or what it ſignifies to the Plot I am to ſeek for, and what offence it is againſt Law, I ſhall not preſume to meddle with it, and I am aſſuredly ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all ſober mens Judgments he would not have loſt Reputation, if he had not ſhot his bolt thereat ſo ſuddenly; but indeed much better fruit cannot well be expected from one that hath ſucked in an Opinion, that he dares tell you Doctor, that <hi>Religion is a Spiritual Notion;</hi> I think no man in his right wits will conceive he knows what he ſays, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly Doctor, this Author will be extreamly Fortunate, if ſuch Notions as he hath utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that Pamphlet make not him reputed and legally judged Seditious.</p>
            <p>In the Concluſion of this large Epiſtle, in a Jeer and Scoff he tells you, <hi>They are Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things you have done,</hi> and would fain have you condeſcend to believe, that <hi>he is perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you are yet reſerved for more Wonderful things;</hi> but on the other hand, I am perſwaded he did not believe himſelf when he wrote it, nor deſigned any body elſe ſhould, if he could prevent it; but to his ſhame, if he had any, his betters have done it, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his flurts of your Name, <hi>being as famous to Poſterity as your Vertue hath rendred you to the preſent Generation:</hi> It may be true that you have not that Stock of Confidence he hath, and to conceit your ſelf without Perſonal Infirmities, and I dare ſay, that in Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his Innocence in that particular, he will not be ſo hardy or bold as to adventure to throw the firſt ſtone at you.</p>
            <p>But he tells you Doctor again, <hi>that none in his right Wits ſhould take you for no Friend to the Church of</hi> England. I concur with him in it, and certainly had he been in his, he durſt not have taken the Confidence to have reflected ſo much upon you, in regard by ſo doing he hath much wounded and unworthily traduced the Wiſdom and Juſtice of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45206:7"/>
and Government of this Nation, for which he ſays, <hi>he hath a Natural Veneration,</hi> by turning all their Tranſactions in this Affair to mere Sophiſtical ridicule, then he tells <hi>you of the Evidence you have made of the Intrigues in the late times, and now by the Prieſts and Jeſuits with Schiſmaticks, and that you have given the Sectaries a great blow, ſo that they have nothing to ſay why they ſhould not be ſifted with all exactneſs imaginable.</hi> Doubtleſs it's as great a miſtake of, and as forreign and remote from the Scope and Drift of your Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, as is poſſible to be ſuppoſed: For although the Jeſuits and their Legates are for leaving no ſtone unturned that may advance their Deſign in every or any particular of it, and to that purpoſe, as much as in them lies, do endeavour to creep into Societies, and all ſorts of men: Yet muſt it therefore needs follow, that ſuch Societies or men are Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? It's a remote and forreign Suppoſition, it's a meer <hi>non-ſequitur.</hi> Nevertheleſs, though I have not asked any of them the Queſtion, nor ſhall make it my buſineſs to open my lips to them further, or other than truth will clearly warrant me; I dare be bold to ſay ſo much for them, that there is not one Society or Sect whatſoever (called Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England)</hi> but will with all true Zeal earneſtly lend their helping hands to find out and be purged from any ſuch corrupt Member that may lurk amongſt them, and if that Author, or any other can further them, will well reward them.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> in his jeering and flouting manner, ſays, <hi>that after gleaning up about</hi> 35 <hi>Prieſts in the whole, it was you that informed the Government where they were to be had by Sholes.</hi> It ſeems he is very exact in keeping the Account of their ſuffering Members, but whether out of pity or friendſhip to them, or for Publick Service, I leave the Doctor upon the whole matter to judge, but he was too exact in charging you with that Information, for I am ſure he neither hath or can prove to whom, nor when given, unleſs it muſt be taken for granted, becauſe he hath ſaid it, which really I cannot do, nor have any grounds to perſwade you, or any other to it. Then he asks ſome Queſtions, <hi>if it be not true that the Plot goes on ſtill?</hi> I am juſtified by the opinion of the Governours and and Magiſtrates in the Nation to anſwer the Queſtion in the affirmative; his next is, <hi>if it be not true that we are all undone if it be not diſappointed?</hi> I muſt anſwer that affirmatively in part and negatively in the reſt, That is, all honeſt and loyal men and true Diſſenting Chriſtians from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are but Papiſts and popiſhly affected, are not, but he making the Anſwer and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Queſtions otherwiſe, and without colour of a true cauſe upon them, he draws this Inference, <hi>That it's a matter of abſolute neceſſity to fetch theſe Plotters out of their Holds:</hi> That is (to uſe his own expreſſion) he that winks may perceive Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> his meaning, and of what ſpirit he is of; <hi>That all ſuch</hi> (guilty or not guilty) <hi>that are</hi> under the notion of <hi>Diſſenters from the Church of</hi> England <hi>muſt be deſtroyed as Plotters;</hi> but not one word in all that his Pamphlet againſt any one Papiſt, Prieſt or Jeſuit elſewhere, for he ſeems to be ſatisfied their Number as to Sufferers is full: Then his laſt Queſtion is, <hi>If it be not true that whoever doubts of the truth of this matter of Fact, or of the neceſſity of this way of proceeding, is undeniably a Blaſter of the King's Evidence, and a favourer of the Conſpiracy?</hi> I think I have fully demonſtrated to you Doctor, why the Fact as he ſtates it, and would have it taken for granted, is not true, but altogether fallacious, and ſhored up with untrue Gloſſes and Inferences for the by-end he drives at, and therefore cannot in the leaſt be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended to be any ground to judge him that doubts it a Blaſter of the King's Evidence, a Favourer of the Conſpiracy; but if Doctor you will take my opinion, and that with ſome clearneſs, I rather judge the Author of that Pamphlet to be ſuch an one, by wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſtruction of your Evidence contrary to the words and meaning thereof. Then he cloſes his long Epiſtle with <hi>deſiring you</hi> Doctor <hi>to lay to heart what he hath writ,</hi> but I am glad to ſee you do not concern your ſelf thereat ſo far as it concerns you alone; then he <hi>deſires you to caſt your eye upon what follows,</hi> which indeed is the Second Part to the ſame Tune, and then <hi>prays Heaven and Earth to reward you, and that you may be as happy as he wiſhes you;</hi> I doubt not but that you are happier already, and if you expect any further happineſs by others prayers it muſt not be by ſuch ſort of people of whom it's ſaid their prayers will not prevail.</p>
            <p>He ſtiles what follows, <hi>A further Diſcovery of the Plot drawn,</hi> he ſays, <hi>from your Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Depoſitions:</hi> It is certainly drawn out, but it's by violence enough, and that by Forreign and remote Inferences and Concluſions: But what ever there is further in that Pamphlet, but in truth it's no further Diſcovery of your Diſcovered Plot, but of his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45206:7"/>
own it is, and what that is, what I have by my obſervations already made, to that of which part of this is in matter but repetition, and of that of which I ſhall make to that which is new; I doubt not, Doctor, but will give you full and Evident ſatisfaction. The Author tells you, <hi>It muſt not be denied, the Kings Witneſſes have done as much as men could do to make out the truth of this Plot; ſo muſt it not be denied that the Juſtice and Wiſdom of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hath improved all the Diſcoveries, by the ſtricteſt Inquiſition and Scrutinie imaginable, and done all Poſſible to ſuppreſs it, yet it goes on with Confidence and vigour; as we have it from thoſe that wrought in the ſame Myre, till better light brought them to other Meaſures</hi> (but to lay a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for his next Fallacie) he tells you <hi>the Fact lies in the Dark,</hi> and truly, Doctor, in my opinion it muſt and will do ſo, unleſs we have better light to ſee it by than a Meteor. I do not Doctor at all doubt of what the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Witneſſes have done, and as little of what hath been done by the Juſtice and Wiſdom of this Nation, for the finding out and ſuppreſſing this helliſh Plot. But I have before told you as in the caſe of the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> all was not done, that might and ought to have been done, or elſe the Commons Houſe of Parliament, did miſtake in their Charge againſt him, which I think becomes no man to preſume.</p>
            <p>But, Doctor, Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> tells you <hi>that after all this Havock made of the Papiſts, the Coffee-Houſe Diſcourſe is the Plot goes on, as they that muſt be preſumed that know beſt ſay, but thoſe on the Negative ask, if it will work without hands, where are the Papiſts, in the Air, or under ground, or are they Inviſible? for as they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e diſperſed, beſides the Terrour that over awes them, there are three Thouſand Proteſtants to one Papiſt.</hi> Indeed, Doctor, I am in admiration of his Confidence to call the juſt Proceedings of the Authority of the Nation, an Havock, he ſhews much of his natural Veneration to the Government, and his true Sonſhip to the Church of England by it; and then he lays a mighty ſtreſs upon the tatling at Coffee-houſes; and indeed he hath ſome reaſon, for I perceive he hath been much beholden to them, for matter and Evidence, or otherwiſe he had been exceeding barren in both, and in all Probability, I am apt to conjecture and not without ground, either he hath loſt ſome Intimate (in the Havock as he Scandalouſly terms it) or his Bowels of Compaſſion, are ſtrongly towards that Party, becauſe he always expreſſes their ſuffering with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy, and his Negative Arguments which are for them, are the ſtrongeſt.</p>
            <p>But now the Author again begins to lay his meaning more open, for (he ſays <hi>they</hi> (meaning the Popiſh party) <hi>may be any where,</hi> and his reaſon is, he ſays, <hi>Perſons of great quality have told him they will indure all ſhapes, exerciſe all Proſeſſions; they ſpeak of one Jeſuit cried</hi> work for a Cooper, <hi>another a Shoe-maker, others Read Coats. 'Its obſerved upon bringing the Plot to light all the little French men with their Marionetts, and Puppit-Showes, vaniſhed, which gave Suſpicion, they were Agents for the Faction.</hi> I do now, Doctor, plainly preceive why he is ſo angry with you, for now it appears, much of his loſs this Diſcovery of this Helliſh Plot hath brought upon him, for it ſeems theſe Perſons were of his acquaintance, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could not have been ſo well knowing of their hard Condition: and truly I think he may cry <hi>work for a Tinker,</hi> for inſtead of ſtopping one Hole he hath made many, but for the matter, he not charging it upon you, I need not give you the trouble of anſwering it, only let me obſerve this to you, that although at moſt the Author can and does make no more of theſe Aſſertions but hear-ſays, and no body knows from whom nor can well gueſs, for its not to be preſumed that any Perſons of quality (but ſuch as are in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the Plot) uſe ſuch Company, yet he takes it for a granted truth and makes uſe of it to be a ground-Work for <hi>what follows,</hi> which he tells you, Doctor, <hi>Shall be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported upon your Authority</hi> (for you ſtill muſt come in to help the Lame Dog over the Stile) <hi>With reſpect to the validity of your Teſtimony, and weight of your Obſervations, you having dived Deeper into it than any other.</hi> Alas, poor Gentleman he is forced to ſpeak truth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times againſt his will, but his truths and Fallacies do not make good Muſick, in wiſe mens Eares, no more than his Muſick did in <hi>Olivers,</hi> and I am ſure he hath not; and believe he cannot make any further Diſcovery of this Plot by any thing by you publiſhed; nay, its without all Contradiction, abſolute Nonſenſe, that a Diſcovery can be made out of a Diſcovery, for without all Peradventure a Diſcovery muſt and doth imply new Fact, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its no Diſcovery.</p>
            <p>Then the Author tells you, <hi>That that part of the Deſign againſt his Majeſties life broke to all Intents and Purpoſes; but we are beholden to you, for the Diſcovery of other and further</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:45206:8"/>
               <hi>Plots in defaming the King and Government, Subverſion of our Eſtabliſhed Religion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance of the Peace, ſo that our Deliverance is but half done.</hi> I ſtand amazed with what conſidence he dares write ſuch things, but as the Proverb <hi>there is,</hi> is <hi>none ſo bold as blind Bayard,</hi> for his <hi>ſo that our Deliverance is but half done,</hi> is his and none of your's, and what you have done is meerly making known matter of Fact, and that long ſince and only as to one Plot. And beſides, Doctor, had he conſidered the whole truth of the Fact, as to that part of this Helliſh Plot; That the ſame hands attempted his Sacred Majeſties life Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond-Sea; That's its ſtrongly to be preſumed Mr. <hi>Killigrues</hi> man that was Murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Windſor</hi> on his Majeſties Couch, was by the ſame hands, and intended his Majeſty; That although the Gun is taken that <hi>Pickering</hi> ſhould have made uſe of for that purpoſe, yet neither <hi>Coniers,</hi> nor his Dagger, nor the Ruffians, nor many others you have in your Depoſitions charged, are, that the Contrivance was as well Beyond-Sea as at home, and that ſince your Diſcovery of, Mr. <hi>Dugdale,</hi> Mr. <hi>Balldron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jenniſon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Danger-field,</hi> and others (which daily come in) have ſeverally depoſed that at ſeveral places and times, and by divers Perſons they have been accoſted to be hired to undertake to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. Methinks the Conſideration of theſe things which have undeniable truths ſhould make him Bluſh, for that by broaching ſuch Falſities amongſt the Subjects to delude them, he may make them neglectful and careleſs in the Preſervation of his Majeſties life, in which they have ſo much and great an Intereſt; but I only mention this, Doctor, as it is to me a clear Demonſtration of the Contrivance, and often repetition of the Jeſuites and their Parties; indeavouring to put in Execution, their helliſh Deſign a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Majeſties perſon whom God preſerve. Then he repeats part of your Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, wherein you, Doctor, as he ſays, mention ſome Circumſtantial Actions the Jeuites do, in order to the Facilitating this their impious Deſign; which is, <hi>by making and Promoting differences between the King and his People, and the King and Forraign Princes, and the like; and amongſt the people in caſe their Deſign as to his Majeſties life, took effect, that they might be ready to riſe up in Arms againſt one another;</hi> and then in a glorying manner the Author tells you, <hi>We have found your Obſervations in theſe Particulars, ſo Punctually true, that every Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable is the matter now in Agitation</hi> (as thus,) <hi>not a Day without a Libel upon his Majeſties Authority, belieing the Condition of his Affairs, Indeavouring to create Diſtruſts and Jealouſies amongſt Forraign Princes and States by falſe Intelligence, Animating and exciting turbulent Factions, Anticipating Confederacies, Involving us in Blood upon a remote and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndutiful ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Kings Death, Sedition preached as well as Written, our Conventicles both Inſtructed themſelves, and Inſtructing others in the Methods and Principles of Rebellion; this,</hi> he ſays, <hi>may Suffice for your Judgment upon theſe things, which look liker a Revelation than a Conjecture.</hi> I know not, Doctor, who the Author means by <hi>we;</hi> for my part, I think no man in his right Senſes can cloſe with him in his finding, for as I ſaid before, yours are not obſervations but only matters of Fact, and thoſe charged upon the Jeſuites and their Party. But if there are any ſuch Libells holding forth thoſe particulars he mentions, but as much as his own, from any man or, from any Society of men, I am very clear in my opinion with all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Submiſſion to the Governors and Government, the Authors may well be ſuſpected to promote the Deſign, and may deſerve to be called in queſtion and puniſhed for them, according to their Demerits. And the rather as to him becauſe he hath the boldneſs in Capital Letters, and of remark to call it,</p>
            <p>A REMOTE AND UNDUTIFUL SUPPOSITION OF HIS MAJESTIES DEATH.</p>
            <p>If this be not a giving the lie to the Repreſentatives of the Commons of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affirming their Credit of your's and other's Evidence in that particular, by their Vote; That if his Majeſty (which God forbid) ſhould dye a violent Death, they would revenge it on the Papiſts, and this Concurred with by the Houſe of Peers; but theſe are ſuch ſmall and minute things in Mr. <hi>Le Strange</hi>'s Conſideration, he can eaſily paſs them by, as an Evident and undeniable proof of his natural Veneration of the Government, and his true Son-ſhip to the Church of England. But as to the Preachings he talkes of; (if amongſt thoſe he means under the term Fanaticks) when he can name the Perſons, I hope I may without offence ſay, the Perſons charged or ſome body for them, will give an anſwer, Satisfactory to the Governours, Government, and the world; in the mean time I believe no man of underſtanding will Credit it upon his bare and general Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:45206:8"/>
And becauſe Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> as may be ſuppoſed, did apprehend theſe things had not been ſufficient to finiſh his intended Fabrick, and that his Pamphlet, he makes ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repetition of part of your Preface to your Narrative, in reference to the late Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: as, <hi>That the Jeſuitical Party were the Contrivers of the laſt War, by their known Diabolical Art of inſlaming Parties and Paſſions againſt each other, and addreſſing to the King; of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Royal Fathers unſpeakable Sufferings, and barbarous uſage: it was thoſe brought him to his end, ſtouriſhed Swords and Trumpets over his dead Body; the</hi> Putney <hi>Projectors were in moſt, if not all the Councils that contrived his ruine. What broke the</hi> Uxbridge <hi>Treaty, but the</hi> Romiſh <hi>Intereſt and Policy? who contrived to baffle all deſigns of Peace and Settlement to this Nation, Proſperity to his Majeſties Family, but them?</hi> Milton <hi>was a known Frequenter of a Popiſh Club. Who more forward to ſet up</hi> Cromwel, <hi>and crown him with the King's Crown than Papiſts? his Government was contrived by a Prieſt, and</hi> Lambert, <hi>a Papiſt, for above thirty years.</hi> From whence he concludes in this Point, he ſays, <hi>a man may without loſs of Honour believe you to be in a miſtake.</hi> I could wiſh he Would have given ſome reaſon for it, that he might have received a more full Anſwer, than otherwiſe can be given to it; for although this is not, nor cannot be ſaid or depoſed by you, as an immediate part of your Diſcovery of the preſent damnable Plot, nor as any thing of your own knowledge, becauſe all, or moſt of it was done before you were born, or at leaſt, able to judge of things, yet by the acceſs you had to the Jeſuits Memoirs, when admitted amongſt them, you found thoſe things (except the Addreſſes to the King) which made good thoſe Aſſertions; and you report it only as ſuch, and yet with ſuch demonſtrable Circumſtances as might eaſily gain a credit, as to the truth of them, with any man that is a Diſſenter from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is not ſuch a Son of the Church, as <hi>Dives</hi> and his Brethren were (as they were lately proved by a Learned and Reverend Doctor) who were not to be convinced but by an Angel, or ſome immediate Revelation from Heaven; but as that was denied them, ſo I believe, it will be theſe, ſince they will not believe that, which in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, comes very near it: but in truth, to me it ſeems obvious and plain, that the Author hath made a very ample and full Diſcovery of himſelf in his ſaid Pamphlet, but not of you, Doctor, nor of any further Diſcovery of your revealed Plot; for by his own ſhewing, and as the truth is, you charge all our miſeries, mediately or immediately, upon the Papiſts, and he affirms you are miſtaken. Now on which ſide can it rationally be judged he is?</p>
            <p>The next thing he chargeth in Fact, is in <hi>your Page</hi> 8. <hi>touching</hi> Blundel<hi>'s teaching of Youth Treaſonable Doctrines againſt His Majeſty: Page</hi> 25. Aſhby<hi>'s ſending new Meſſengers into</hi> Scotland <hi>to promote Commotions there, and inform them of the Tyranny they lay under, by being denied Liberty of Conſcience, not to be procured without the Sword, by which means they ſhould Weaken the Presbyterian and Epiſcopal Faction, and you heard the Words, and two Meſſengers were ſent into</hi> Scotland <hi>with Inſtructions to carry themſelves like Nonconformiſt Miniſters, to preach neceſſity of taking up the Sword, which you ſaw diſpatched.</hi> Now obſerve his ſeveral Inferences from hence; firſt ſays he, <hi>take notice here is a Deſign for the Deſtruction of the King, and Embroyling of the Government.</hi> I admit it him in terms and literally, but if he hath any equivocal or fallacious meaning I cannot. Secondly, he ſays, <hi>the pretence of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel is matter of Liberty and Conſcience;</hi> That is an abſolute miſtake for it's but a circumſtantial Engine ſo prepared and wrought by the Jeſuits to carry on their grand Deſign by dividing and weakning their oppoſing Party. Thirdly, he ſays, <hi>it's to be promoted by Popiſh Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries in the Councils of the Non-Conformiſts:</hi> It is the firſt time, and I believe cannot be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded, that ever the Non-Conformiſts had any Councils, and as to their being in the Conventicles, as to the charge it's only by you ſaid to be in <hi>Scotland;</hi> but admit it in <hi>England</hi> too, It is not nor cannot be charged originally upon them, but meerly accidentally and contingently as the Jeſuites and their Agents could prevail, whereof I am ſatisfied if the Author could have found but half an inſtance to make it good, it's not to be doubted with his Ingenuity he would have ſtretched it to an whole one, if not more for the good of the Cauſe he hath ſo viſibly by his Pamphlet eſpouſed. Fourthly, he ſays, <hi>by making Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts with the Separatiſts under Diſguiſe of Teachers;</hi> This is anſwered in the laſt. But fifthly, laſtly, and remarkably, he ſays, <hi>That you charge none of the Church of</hi> England. What yet more blindneſs? Was it poſſible for the Jeſuits and their party to carry on their ſeveral Deſigns in the late times, without ſome of the Church of <hi>England-</hi>Members being
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45206:9"/>
concerned in it; he, nor any man can ſay, that there was not Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> on both ſides in thoſe unhappy Wars. But by this you may plainly ſee what he drove at by ſaying, <hi>You were miſtaken as to thoſe times:</hi> for he could not have otherwiſe come off from his Aſſertion, that you charged not the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though he aſſumes to ſay, <hi>He hath peruſed and conſidered all your Works, as to that particular;</hi> yet he hath not rightly judged of them; and although it be apparently the deſign of the Author to put a variance and diviſion between thoſe that are Diſſenters from, and thoſe who are Members of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> I know its none of yours, nor ſhall be mine; for I take the healing way in that caſe beſt, and therefore ſhall not give any further Inſtances therein than may ſerve to diſprove him.</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> taking his miſtaken Inference from thence for granted, he draws as er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous a Concluſion, yet very poſitively, <hi>That you have altogether cleared the Church of</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland <hi>and her Sons, from the Calumny of being either mediately, or immediately guilty of this horrid Plot.</hi> But as I ſaid before, Doctor, you have not in the leaſt in the whole ſcope of your Diſcovery ſhewed your ſelf partial, by charging, or ſparing this, or that man, that is within your knowledge guilty, becauſe he is of this or that Party, or Faction, as may plainly appear by what is aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Then Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> ſays, <hi>It muſt not be any longer a ſuppoſition, which you have given Oath for: So that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>taking it for granted, there is ſuch a project on foot, the Papiſts are in the bottom of it, and its promoted by the Sectaries; the queſtion is, how the Government may diſcriminate the Proteſtants from the Papiſts, being blended in their Intereſts, as well as in their Councils, and not eaſily diſtinguiſhed: but the legal Expedient is the Oaths of Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Supremacy; yet that will not do, for many Papiſts will take them, and many that call themſelves Proteſtants, will abſolutely refuſe them.</hi> I agree it to be true, that what is judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially proved ought not, nor cannot be eſteemed a Suppoſition; but then it muſt, and ought to be taken litterally, and not with a ſtrained or remote conſtruction, contrary to the Deponents words, intent, or meaning; for though it may be taken for granted there is ſuch a project on foot, and the Papiſts in the bottom of it, yet is it not to be ſo, that the Sectaries promote it from any thing you have ſworn, but that the Jeſuitical Party have endeavoured to blow up Sectaries (ſo called) into a diviſion amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and with others the diſſenting Party from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> thereby to leſſen and abate the ſtrength of them, is litterally agreeable with the words of your Depoſitions afore-cited by him, that thereby they might weaken both the Presbyterian and Epiſcopal Faction, it's not in the leaſt to be queſtioned, or doubted, but that the Jeſuites, or their Party, are knowingly and willingly the Contrivers and Carriers on of this horrid Plot.</p>
            <p>But that the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> are in any part of it, is both to be queſtioned and doubted, and the rather, for that neither by yours, nor any others Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies is it ſo proved, nor from thence can be inferred, without a violent, or at leaſt, ſtrange Conſtruction: and for my part, I do not at all know, or ſuſpect that any one true Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is, or will in the leaſt joyn with the Jeſuitical Party in it; but do hope both they and the Diſſenters from them will unite to defend his Sacred Majeſty, and the Government from it. Then he tells you, <hi>The Law is general in that caſe, there is no relaxation, the Law takes not notice of Honeſty, but Obedience: and this Rule,</hi> he ſays, <hi>holds in common as well to the Papiſts, as to the Proteſtant Recuſants:</hi> With ſomething more to the ſame purpoſe; but truly, I think, to very little purpoſe; for, as I take it, thoſe Statutes he cites, are by their Title, Preamble and Body, only and litterally againſt the Popiſh Recuſants. For the Diſſenters he talks of, or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of them were not then publickly in being, nor in the leaſt mentioned in any of them, and if ſo, I think they cannot be concerned. But that being under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a power above me, I ſhall not be poſitive in it, or determine it.</p>
            <p>Then he rivets this, he thinks, by ſaying, <hi>But what if it be ſaid, that it is not the thing ſworn, but the Oath it ſelf that is ſcrupled at?</hi> This he tells you, Doctor, <hi>is nice, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy to thoſe that are ſo ſtrait-laced,</hi> and from thence he infers, <hi>its dangerous to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, for it lets in all the Prieſts and Jeſuits in nature under that colour; for they will all flow in thither,</hi> (that is, amongſt the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England) for ſhelter, and carry on their Deſigns without trial or danger.</hi> Is not this moſt incomparable Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? he can blow hot and cold at his pleaſure, an excellent Artiſt; for obſerve, when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45206:9"/>
he had ſome trouble of Spirit upon him for the Papiſts Sufferings upon this Helliſh Plot, and to take off the edge of the Magiſtrate, and the opinion of the People, as to the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſevere proſecuting of it, that there might not be any more havock made with them, then there was not a Papiſt to be ſeen, they were inviſible; but now when the Tables muſt be turned upon the Diſſenters to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> then becauſe of ſome of the Diſſenters ſcrupleſomeneſs in Swearing, his Opinion is changed; for now there is a great deal of danger he ſays; but if you will believe the Author before, it muſt be of no body, or at leaſt, ſo few, that they are not worth the looking after, but one to three thouſand, if ſo much; ſo here is Mr. <hi>Roger</hi> againſt Mr. <hi>L' Eſtrange:</hi> and indeed I take the Author's Inference from hence to be altogether foreign and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from your words or meaning in your Depoſition, or the truth of the caſe; for though your Depoſition in fact is true, and common experience joyns with you in it, that the Jeſuits and their Party are ſo active, that they will, if poſſible, thruſt themſelves into any Society of Men, to try their skill in diſturbance of Governments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carry on their Deſign, yea, even as well where there are Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as where there are none; and according to what he ſaid, equally ſafe to themſelves. Now to conclude all, he tells you, Doctor, <hi>It muſt be granted, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Papiſts have a deſign upon the King, Religion and Government, and advance it by acting the parts of Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Presbyterians and other Sectaries, or not; and admitting your Depoſition to be true, there can be no ſecurity to this Government, without either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving all ſeperate meetings, or bringing in all Diſſenters to this Legal Teſt, otherwiſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts have all ſorts of liberty and ſecurity in herding themſelves amongſt Conventiclers; where upon the beating of a Buſh, it will be an even wager whether you ſtart a Jeſuit, or a Fanatick; and in this caſe there is not much difference between them, where the Jeſuit plays the Fanatick, or the Fanatick the Jeſuit:</hi> and then ſays, <hi>if this main Aſſertion be true, there is no way of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Papiſts but by this Teſt; and Diſſenters cannot chuſe but incourage the Propoſition, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have Prieſts amongſt them, or not; if they have, why do they not the beſt they can to find them out; if not, why do they ſay they have? Either they are influenced by the Jeſuits, or not; if they be, why do not they purge their Congregations? If not, why do they pretend they are, and ſo ſet the Saddle on the wrong Horſe? Either its poſſible to clear their Conventicles of this dangerous mixture, or not; If ſo, why do they ſtill complain, and do nothing in it? If not, then there is no way to extirpate Popery, but by rooting out Fanaticiſm;</hi> and then he <hi>calls to the world to judge with what injuſtice the Orders and Rituals of the Church of</hi> England <hi>are charged with a tincture of Superſtition and Popery, when the Calumniators are tainted with this Leaven:</hi> and then concludes, <hi>he is come to the bottom of the Popiſh Plot.</hi> I am ſure a blind man would be glad to ſee it; for I, that have both my eyes, can neither ſee top, middle, nor bottom of what he promiſed, of a further Diſcovery of your diſcovered Plot: and all he hath ſaid I take to be but a meer groundleſs Phantaſm; for in the beginning of his Pamphlet he undertook a further Diſcovery of the Plot than you diſcovered; and could you, or any other rational man have from thence expected, or looked for any thing elſe but ſome new matter, and clearly made out, and evinced either by authentick Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or undeniable Arguments? but inſtead thereof he hath ſpoiled three or four Sheets of Paper, by ſtuffing them full of ſtrained and wreſted Conſtructions of, and inferences from ſome part of your Depoſitions and Obſervations, many manifeſt contradictions, and apparent miſtaken Concluſions thereupon. Nevertheleſs, to do him what right I can, perchance if you take not his litteral expreſſion, but his myſtical meaning, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded you will go nigh to judge, he hath made, or really intended to make a further Diſcovery of a Plot, but not the Plot you have diſcovered: for if you well and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly obſerve the ſubject matter of his Diſcourſe and Arguments, and to what they tend, and add to it the time when this Learned Piece came forth, and compare it with the invented Plots of the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Powis, John Gadbury,</hi> Mrs. <hi>Celier,</hi> &amp;c. I may eaſily ſuppoſe, Doctor, you may without any great ſtreſs readlly conjecture with whom he converſed, for what Meridian this elaborate Piece of his was calculated, and for whoſe uſe by its Image and Superſcription, but the All-mighty Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence having taken them in their own Snares, both in thoſe and other things hath there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by plainly proved to the world the manifeſt untruth of his Aſſertions; for although is be undeniably true what you have depoſed, that the Jeſuits and their Agents endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45206:10"/>
to Work amongſt all Parties whatſoever, nay, and by his own ſhewing, as he puts the caſe, they may be as ſecure amongſt the members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> nay and more than the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for, although he ſays, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Diſſenters will not take Oaths, therefore there the Jeſuites <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; ſo alſo he ſays many of the Jeſuites and Papiſts, will take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and ſo will the members of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> if ſo, then what can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Jeſuites <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to herd and hide there? Into what Confuſion hath this Author brought us, if all his Suppoſitions be true, but certainly had the Earl of <hi>Caſtlemain,</hi> the Counteſs of <hi>Powis,</hi> John <hi>Gadbury,</hi> Mris. <hi>Celier</hi> and their accomplices been of Opinion that their Security had lain amongſt the Diſſenters to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they would not have been ſo injurious to them, as to have endeavoured to have turned the Plot upon them, and beſides its to all rational men a ſtrange Proof againſt this Authors Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that particular; for if the Jeſuites, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> herd only amongſt Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and they had been their fellow-Conſpirators or Agents in the Plot; It could not be unknown to them, and then certainly there had not been ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity as they conceived, to go about by deſperate and falſe Oaths, to make them either Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Abetters or Contrivers of the Plot; and doth it not evidently and plainly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Contrary? for had thoſe Aſſertions been true this Author would have you, Doctor, and the world believe in that particular, ſurely there had not needed a Sham-Plot, to bring the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> into the real Plot, for had it been true it might have been proved by other means, but yet to this day there is not one man of the diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> come to my knowledge, that is either charged with, or detected of any ſuch thing; (unleſs the Authors bare word be to be taken for granted) ſo that though the Jeſuites and Prieſts have according to your Depoſitions endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to draw them in, yet have they not prevailed, for what appears; ſo that for ought I can preceive its undeniable that the Saddle was, and is upon the right Horſe, and then all his Queries of <hi>if's</hi> or <hi>not's</hi> fall to the ground, and needs not any anſwer but what is before up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the like queſtions. But that the Diſſenters from the Church of <hi>England</hi> have Jeſuites and Prieſts actually amongſt them, doth not by your's or any other depoſition, proof or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience whatſoever appear, there is any, or if there be, that they have not wrought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Influence at all upon them, or at leaſt ſuch an one as may from the Government, merit a total Extirpation, which the Author ſtrongly preſſes for, but I preſume an healing Plaiſter is better.</p>
            <p>But he having been heretofore accuſtomed to Write new's-Books, thought his book would not appear authentick or at leaſt would not be vendable without an advertiſment annexed to it; which Advertiſment is indeed as much to the purpoſe, and Coherent to the Subſequent matter of his Pamphlet as comes juſt to nothing, and truly he is ſo Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious as to tell you ſo, for he ſays in the cloſe of it <hi>that its Forraign to the Subject of his Pamphlet, but more Accomodate to the Seaſon.</hi> But for my part I think its Forraign to both, for it is, <hi>that the Subjects right of Petitioning, hath been of late in ſuch manner aſſerted, as if his Majeſty had no right of refuſing;</hi> and then anſwers it with ſome Inſtances, <hi>from</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>the Third, to</hi> Henry <hi>the Eight, of Granting and Refuſing;</hi> I know not his Author nor I believe he did not, for that Aſſertion, for if he had certainly he would have named him. But if any one did ſo he was to blame, and was I ſuppoſe as much under a miſtake as the Author is in his Pamphlet, and the Subject matter of it; for I take it to be undoubred, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Power that may be petitioned to, hath a power of granting and denying: as for inſtance; if a Party of his friends ſhould in a petition to his Majeſty ſet forth accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their apprehenſion, his merits by his Pamphlet and pray a reward for him, his Majeſty might refuſe it, and on the other hand if you, Doctor, and others by petition to his Majeſty, ſhould ſet forth how he hath traduced his Majeſty, the Government and the Kings Witneſſes in his ſaid Pamphlet, and pray that the ſame, and he, might be left to the Law to be puniſhed according to their demerits, the ſame might and would be granted; but in regard he could not, or at leaſt would not make a further Diſcovery of that Damnable and helliſh Plot Diſcovered by you; give me leave to tell you, if he could have been convinced by any other Evidence, or Teſtimony, than <hi>Dives</hi> and his brethren, how he might have done it, by publiſhing to the world, as the truth is, that the ſinger of God hath been in this Diſcovery of your's throughout; for it cannot proved, be that you,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45206:10"/>
Doctor, had the leaſt advice or aſſiſtance of any one man, to guide or help you to contrive the way you took, and was to take, (and that with eminent danger and vaſt hazard, and great difficulty) for the making your ſelf Maſter of this Diſcovery in leſs than a year.</p>
            <p>That you had not the leaſt advice or aſſiſtance of any one man to help you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive the time, the way, and method how to publiſh this Diſcovery to Authority, but came barely and nakedly to it; yea, and with a proof in your mouth, from thoſe you were to diſcover, you nor any one elſe ſhould be credited.</p>
            <p>That when many of the material meaſures you had propoſed to your ſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon to make good, and for the manifeſtation of your Diſcovery (as <hi>Coleman</hi>'s latter Papers, <hi>Langhorne</hi>'s Papers, the foreign Pacquets) were removed, and you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of them, and by reaſon thereof barely ſtood as a ſingle Witneſs, and inevitable ruine and deſtruction ghaſtly and grimly ſtaring in your face, yet your Spirits were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and you not at all diſcouraged from ſticking to the truth. But then the Jeſuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Party being infatuated, and raging with madneſs, muſt needs, to hide their Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as all notorious Sinners commonly do, by committing another Sin; ſo did they by committing that barbarous and inhumane Murther of Sir <hi>Edmundbury Godfrey,</hi> which proved otherwiſe than they deſigned it; for inſtead of ſuppreſſing the Diſcovery of the Plot, it did, as it were give a new life to what you had delivered. Then doubtleſs, moved by the ſame ſpirit you were, did not the then Repreſentatives of the Nation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly by their Votes teſtifie their credit of your Evidence? Then by the ſame hand apparently were ſent in, to your aſſiſtance and confirmation, Mr. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> and many others, who have proved many other particulars, and concurred in the general to a tittle with you.</p>
            <p>That until you, and the reſt of the Witneſſes in this Helliſh and Damnable Plot, had been made uſe of at a publick Trial, you did not converſe, or aſſociate with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as can be proved by a multitude of authentick Witneſſes, ſo far as is provable in a negative; and I am confident cannot be proved in the affirmative.</p>
            <p>That not any two of you that are the King's Witneſſes in that Plot, or any part of it; were of any Familiarity or acquaintance, before your being ingaged in that buſineſs, and you all lived remote from one another; and although you do not all ſwear to the ſame particulars, yet do concurr in the whole, as to the generality of the Plot.</p>
            <p>That not any one of them but your ſelf (who for ſome ſhort time was under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to counterfeit your ſelf a Papiſt.) Theſe things, Doctor, I only mention to put you in mind by what hand, you, as I conceive, have been ſupported in this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, and to ſhew you according to my apprehenſion, what improbability, nay, I may ſay, impoſſibility, there is, that this Diſcovery of yours, of this Helliſh Plot, is in the leaſt any thing of an invention, or contrived Deſign by you, but is pure mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact, and of undeniable verity, and not to be ſo ſlighted, as that invention of <hi>Beddingfields,</hi> being alive again. All which I was prompted to, as I conceived as a Duty incumbent upon me, upon and by the obligation of the Loyalty I truly owe to my natural Prince, the real veneration I have for the Government and true Chriſtian Religion, and Juſtice of the Nation, the Cordial Love I have to my faithful fellow-Subjects, and my profeſs'd and faithful Friendſhip to your ſelf; and therefore keep up your Spirits, and be not diſmayed, or in the leaſt diſcouraged; for it is my opinion, and I hope not without good grounds, and preſume I may with reverence, and without offence ſay it (unleſs to the tender ears of ſome captious Maſquerade and ſtrange Sons of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> that God will neither forſake you, nor this Cauſe, but in deſpite of all oppoſition will therein glorifie himſelf, and in truth ſet up the Kingdom of his Son.</p>
            <p>But give me leave to tell you my Judgment, that if this Author's Aſſertions and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments</p>
