            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Having the opportunity, I would not omit giving you a true Narrative of our Fight with the <hi>French.</hi> The <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> we being cruiſing at <hi>Kingſale</hi> at nine at night, our Scouts made the ſignal of the Enemy, about 13 Sail; but the night coming on, and we not knowing which way they lay, we kept the Wind all night. On the <hi>30th.</hi> in the Morning, our Scouts made the Signal, as before<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> 8 in the morning we bore up Weſtward; our Scouts chaſing that way, at three in the afternoon one of our Scouts brought a ſmall <hi>Baſtabes</hi> Veſſel into our Fleet, come from <hi>Virginia,</hi> who gave us an account, That he had been with the <hi>French</hi> Fleet the night before of the Cape, conſiſting of 30 Sail ſmall and great. Upon which Advice, we gave chaſe at 6, and we came in ſight of Ten Sail going head of <hi>Meinhead,</hi> but we doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main Body had got into <hi>Crouck haven,</hi> we brought to, and ſtood off all the Night. <hi>May</hi> the <hi>1ſt.</hi> we finding they had not gone in there, we bare away to <hi>Loeward</hi> of the <hi>Meinhead,</hi> where we ſaw ſome of them at Anchor in the <hi>Bantry;</hi> at 7 we found them to be 27 Sail of great Ships, and we but 18; the Wind at <hi>E. N. E.</hi> a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Gale. Upon ſight of us, they got under Sail; and inſtead of coming out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Wind to us, they gave us the trouble to run in a great way to them, which we could not do before 12 at Noon: At which time Captain <hi>Aſhei</hi> leading the Van of our Fleet, came up within Shot; upon whom they fired ſome Guns, but he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately anſwer'd with what he could, and they all anſwer'd with what they could, being to the Windward, and would not come near. The moſt of them firing at the Arſe; but at laſt moſt of our Ships got up, but could not draw in a line as we intended, by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the place. And thus we continued till ſix at night; we thinking to draw them out to fire, though notwithſtanding they had ninety <hi>per Cent,</hi> the advantage, they tackt, and ſtood into the Bay. I do aſſure, if they had but had Courage, as they had Number and Strength, they might have ſpoil'd moſt of us; but I do proteſt, I never ſaw ſo much Cowardize by Men. I do believe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all hands, put their hands to the Plough, they will hardly be put out of <hi>Ireland.</hi> I ſuppoſe we have not loſt aboveOne hundred Men kill'd in the Fleet; our rigging ſuffer'd the moſt. In fine, the Admiral did what could be expected.
