            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>O'er all your Cheeks, a lively pleaſing red.</l>
            <l>Our Naval Glory warms you, flaming joys</l>
            <l>Kindle illuminations in your Eyes.</l>
            <l>The Monſieurs thought our men by Sea and Land</l>
            <l>Wou'd run, and nothing but the women stand;</l>
            <l>They knew they'd charge again, ſo their intent</l>
            <l>Was on the Fair to make a fierce Deſcent.</l>
            <l>Now we once more ſhall have the full contoul</l>
            <l>Of our own Seas, the <hi>French</hi> ne're won, but ſtole.</l>
            <l>More goods will fall from <hi>France</hi>'s wounded hand,</l>
            <l>This Shock at Sea, will ſettle many a Land.</l>
            <l>Ev'n <hi>France</hi> may quit her Chains, and more enjoy</l>
            <l>Than a vain brag, <hi>Nous avous un Grand Roy;</hi>

            <l>For that's their all, it ſerves the Great inſtead</l>
            <l>Of Manly Freedom, and the Poor for Bread.</l>
            <l>Y'ave a Great King indeed, poor harraſs'd Slave,</l>
            <l>And that Great King has you, and all you have.</l>

            <l>I fly not for Religion, and the Laws,</l>

            <l>Therefore our Author chiefly doubts to day,</l>
            <l>His Hero's Part, the Pillar of his Play.</l>
            <l>He leaves a Beauty, all the World would prize,</l>
            <l>To preſerve Faith, too many now deſpiſe.</l>
            <l>Knavery's ſo lov'd, rather than not be Knaves,</l>
            <l>Some cheat themſelves, plot to be wretched Slaves,</l>
            <l>We Women do not find one Lover true,</l>
            <l>You are as falſe to us, as we to you.</l>
            <l>When young, untouch'd, a Woman comes in Print,</l>
            <l>Into the World, like Money from the <hi>Mint.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>She's ſought by all, but ſoon ſhe's made a Scoff,</l>
            <l>A falſe Knave clips her, and then puts her off.</l>
            <l>The Knaves and doting Women in the Play,</l>
            <l>Are natural parts, you meet 'em every day.</l>
            <l>But by ſome men our Hero will be damn'd,</l>
            <l>Good reaſon, for by Heroes Knaves are ſhamm'd.</l>
            <l>The <hi>French,</hi> ay and ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> I'm afraid,</l>

                     <p>We are a couple o' pure Rogues. We ſell Arms to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to cut the Throats of our own Countrymen, the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>

                     <p>Ay, but we ſell our Arms ſo dear, we cut the Throats o' the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> too. What News of <hi>Italian</hi> Wine? Could you meet with a Bargain?</p>

                     <speaker>Spy.</speaker>
                     <p>A rare Bargain. You muſt know <hi>Regulus</hi> is a ſevere man; he won't ſuffer any man in his Army to drink VVine, unleſs he be ſick. So, Sir, there came the other day a Ship from <hi>Italy,</hi> loaden with VVine, and thought to come to a great Market here, becauſe all the Vineyards here are cut down and ſpoil'd. E'gad, <hi>Regulus</hi> having Wine enough to ſerve ſick men on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, would not ſuffer a drop of it to be ſold to his Army, ſo I bought it for a Song.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Bat.</speaker>
                     <p>That's well; it comes in rare ſeaſon; Wine is very ſcarce among us, and our Countrymen will have Wine. Drunkenneſs is an honorable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity amongſt us. VVine they will have, and have no ſtoppage of VVine here, give my Trade the Strangury. In what Condition did you find the <hi>Roman</hi> Army?</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Bat,</speaker>
                     <p>I am glad of it. Then the Blockade will continue, and ſo Corn muſt riſe. 'Tis true, thanks be to the Gods, there is a pretty good conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Famine amongſt us, which makes Corn a good Commodity; and I have a large ſtock. But I'll keep my Corn a while longer, and make the beſt o' the Famine.</p>
