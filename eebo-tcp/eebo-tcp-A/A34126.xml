            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

either from the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> or the East-India Company of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,
otherwise to be refunded to your Petitioner.</p>
            <p>That in persuance thereof Sr. <hi>Iohn Wolstenholme</hi> and your Petitioner in
the yeare 1663 deposited the Summe of 300. pound into the hands of
Mr. <hi>Woodrofe,</hi> Sr. <hi>George Downings</hi> Clerke, in the Tellors Office, by direction
of Sr. <hi>George Downing,</hi> who promised that he would place the said money
in <hi>Holland,</hi> to some <hi>Duch Minister of State,</hi> for the purposes aforesaid, and
the other 200 pound your Petitioner placed with Mr. <hi>Thomas Hughes</hi> of
<hi>Amsterdam,</hi> who returned the same, in the yeare following, in regard he
could not prevaile with the Directors of the East-India Companie, to give
satisfaction accordingly; but Sr. <hi>George Downing</hi> refuseth to returne the
300 pound with Interest for the same, although no satisfaction or repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was gotten for the said Ships, but the money made use of to his own
account, and notwithstanding he was allowed, a plentifull Salary <hi>by the
King,</hi> for obeying those orders and commands, he had from his <hi>Majesty</hi>
concerning those Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:97390:2"/>
That in your Petitioners absence in <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> Sr. <hi>Nicholas
Crispe</hi> got fifty thousand pounds of the 200000 pound into his hands, out
of the Customs, in persuance of his Majesties grant, and refused all his life
time to pay the Equitable proportion thereof, to your Petitioner, and since
his death, <hi>Iohn Crispe,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Crispe,</hi> his Sons, and Executors, do also deny
the payment thereof, and likewise Sr. <hi>Nicholas Crispe</hi> his Grandson and
Heire; Pretending they are not responsible for the same. Although it is
well known unto them, and the rest of the Partners, that your Petitioner
never received one penny of the Kings money, but the 10000 pound afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
which Sr. <hi>Edmond Turnor</hi> paid away towards satisfaction of the Fine
debts, and that Sr. <hi>Nicholas Crispe</hi> raised himself upon the ruines of Sr. <hi>Paul Pyndars</hi> Estate.</p>
            <p>Now for as much, as your Petitioner hath no Remedy at Law against
Sr. <hi>George Downing,</hi> who stands upon his Priviledge, as a Member of
Parliament, nor against the Heires and Executors of Sr. <hi>Nicholas
Crispe,</hi> who made such settlements of his Estate before his death,
that the Effects thereof (without the Justice of a <hi>Parliament</hi>) will
remaine out of your Petitioners reach, and avoyde his <hi>Majesties</hi>
