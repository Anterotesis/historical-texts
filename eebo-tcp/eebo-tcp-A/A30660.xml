            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His ſtrange Text cannot be more impertinent to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this ſad day, then that which occaſioned it.</p>
            <p>The words immediately foregoing tell us that <hi>David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his ſon,</hi> as we do now over <hi>a greater King</hi> then <hi>Saul</hi> and a <hi>kinder man</hi> than <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To beleive the Jewiſh interpretation, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> took warning from the wounds which <hi>Saul</hi> received from the <hi>Philiſtian</hi> Archers: to teach <hi>the children of Juda</hi> that military art, were to confeſſe an unpardonable ignorance: it was their uſuall weapon.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerving the lamentation to be muſicall, came ſo far towards the diſcovery of the truth as to ſay, <hi>David</hi> would have them taught to uſe Muſick in their Wars. But what Muſick with <hi>a bow?</hi> Were the <hi>Jewes</hi> taught (that practice which the ancient <hi>Germans</hi> uſed in their wars) to encourage themſelves with the,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62984:3"/>
ſprightly twang of their beaten Bow-ſtrings, as we do by beat of Drum? What harmony will that interpretation keep with the <hi>lamentation,</hi> thus harſhly interrupted?</p>
            <p>The omiſſion of the LXX. and the <hi>Vulgar Latin</hi> give us a fair hint for a ſmooth interpretation, for they omitting all mention of the <hi>Bow</hi> read the words thus. <hi>And David lamented—Alſo he bad them teach it the Children of Juda.</hi> Good ſenſe, but no good fidelity! Our <hi>Tindal</hi> approving the ſenſe but not the infidelity, retaineth the word, but tranſlateth it with new infidelity. Reading thus, <hi>He bad them teach the Children of Juda the ſtaves thereof,</hi> a good Paraphraſe; but a bad tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe hints our excellent <hi>Gregory</hi> cleareth all difficulties.</p>
            <p>He obſerveth it uſuall for Poets to beſtow upon their Odes ſome Title ſuitable to their Subject. Thus our Pſalmiſt titleth ſome of his Pſalms. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſhith, Soſannim, Mahaloth.</hi> And now having compoſed a <hi>threne</hi> in memory of <hi>Saul wounded</hi> by the Bowmen, and of <hi>Jonathan</hi> that dear Archer, who ſhot his <hi>Arrow beyond the Lad</hi> and thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed <hi>a love exceeding the love of Women,</hi> honored the memory of ſo dear a friend with a paſſionate threne, and that threne with a name moſt endearing the inſtrument of ſo rare a kindneſſe And now the ſenſe is ſmooth and Muſical. <hi>David</hi> compoſed this epicedium in memory of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan,</hi> and <hi>cauſed them to teach it the Children of Juda</hi> calling it <hi>the Bow,</hi> in memory of the fatal wounds which <hi>Saul</hi> received from the Bowmen of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62984:3"/>
the enemy, and the rare kindneſſe which himſelf received from the <hi>Bow of Jonathan</hi> at that paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate parting, when <hi>they kiſſed one another and wept</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Sam. 20.</note> 
               <hi>one with another, untill David exceeded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to this clear ſenſe doth the Hebrew not only invite us, by leaving out the word <hi>uſe,</hi> but force us too, by the neceſſary concord of the participle <hi>written</hi> with the ſubſtantive <hi>Bow,</hi> both of them feminines.</p>
            <p>The demonſtration being Grammatical: The word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Bow:</hi> therefore the <hi>Bow</hi> it ſelf (not the ſtory of it) was <hi>written:</hi> therefore it was writable: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a form of words: therefore this very form of <hi>lamentation,</hi> commanded to be <hi>taught the Children of Juda</hi> and recorded <hi>in the book of Jaſher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What <hi>the book of Jaſher</hi> was, is as needleſſe to enquire as impoſſible to find, we find but one mention more of it, and that Poetical. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10. 13. your margins tell you the word ſignifieth an <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man:</hi> and haply it may be an abbreviation of the word <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the book a Poetical regiſter of the publick occurrences of that Nation.</p>
            <p>Whatever that book were, it is loſt, and ſo is the ſtory of it. But this we have found, that in that book was written this <hi>Lamentation,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> made and called <hi>The Bow</hi> and commanded to be <hi>taught the Children of Juda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus found the <hi>Bow</hi> we ſhall view it a little and then exerciſe with it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Obſerv. <hi>That under the Law it ſelf Kings had power (as they ſaw occaſion) to make additions and alterations in the form of publick Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62984:4"/>
For <hi>David bad them</hi> to whom he directed his Odes, the chief Muſicians, <hi>to teach the Children of Juda this Bow,</hi> that they might uſe it with other of his Pſalms in the publick ſervice of God.</p>
            <p>That this was uſual, witneſſe the many other Pſalms which are ſuperſcribed <hi>To the chief Muſician</hi> and ſometimes by name <hi>To Aſaph:</hi> which were publickly ſung as occaſion required: as appeareth by their praiſing God in the words of the 136. Pſalm, when the ark was brought into the oracle in <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple.</p>
            <p>Was it a ſmall alteration to change the ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Tabernacle to a ſtanding Temple: contrary to the pattern ſhewed in the Mount, and without any command of God? Yet God commendeth and bleſſeth <hi>David</hi> for that intention though he ſuſpendeth the performance.</p>
            <p>The <note n="a" place="margin">Num. 4. 3.</note> law required <hi>thirty</hi> years of age to qualify the children of <hi>Levi</hi> for <hi>the ſervice of the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Yet <note n="b" place="margin">1 Chro. 23. 27,</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> commanded <hi>them to be numbred from twenty years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The law forbad any unclean perſon to eat the paſſover. Lev. 7. 10. and 22. yet <hi>Ezekia</hi> diſpenſed with it, as alſo with the Levites performing the Prieſts office in killing the Sacrifices. 2. Chro. 30. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>Now if under the law (where every punctilio was ſo exactly preſcribed) the Kings, the beſt of the Kings, made ſuch alterations: How much more under the Goſpel (where there is only this generally directory injoyned, <hi>Let all things be done decently and in order;</hi> and the particulars left to the wiſdome of the governours of the Church) ſhall
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62984:4"/>
it be in the power of Kings to preſcribe ſuch forms as they ſhall judge moſt decent?</p>
            <p>Is it a bleſſing to the Church to have <hi>Kings her nurſing fathers,</hi> and ſhall it not be her duty to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to their government?</p>
            <p>Was there ever any Religion which queſtioned the power of their rulers in things acknowledged to be indifferent? And ſhall the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> onely which of all others doth moſt earneſtly and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently injoyn <hi>obedience,</hi> ſhall that onely diſpenſe with it; and that without any colour of neceſſity, but under pretence of freedome from any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>Well; but grant the Chriſtian Kings the onely Cyphers of Religion, not able to bind the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by any direct obligation: will not that love of peace which is ſo earneſtly recommended to us, require (though by accident onely) to obey all their innocent injunctions? Doth it become a peaceable and humble Chriſtian thus to diſpute with his King? <hi>You have no power to command me and therefore I will not obey.</hi> And not rather thus? <hi>Though you have no power to command me yet for peace ſake I will obey?</hi> Becauſe <hi>as much as in me lieth if it be poſſible I will live peaceably with all men.</hi> Admit we did not owe the King obedience to ſuch commands as are only innocent, not neceſſary by the Word of God; do we not owe ſo much obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the great commandment of Chriſt, <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> as to ſubmit a little priviledge for the purchaſe of charity?</p>
            <p>That Chriſtian humility may be baniſhed with obedience we have the moſt ridiculous device,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62984:5"/>
that ever adventured to cheat a people: a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that in ſuch a caſe obedience is not onely needleſs, but ſinfull: The conſcience (take heed) cannot be bound to obedience, but it is to diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience: To conform to the commands of the King in matters of Worſhip, however otherwiſe indifferent becometh ſinfull, by a ſecret venome drawn from obedience.</p>
            <p>Strange ſword of juſtice, which hath an edge in the handle, and none in the blade! Strange power of the magiſtrate which ſo taketh away the indifference of things, as to forbid by commanding and command by forbidding!</p>
            <p>What? muſt the Scripture be reformed too <hi>according to the example of the beſt reformed Churches?</hi> Muſt thoſe texts be <hi>ſequeſtred</hi> from the Word of God which teach thoſe <hi>malignant</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, <hi>obedience, conformity, charity?</hi> They muſt! they muſt! or this new <hi>goſpel</hi> can never be <hi>propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.</hi> A little change of a trifling ſyllable or two will make Saint Paul a <hi>non-conformiſt,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let no ſoul be ſubject to the higher power:</hi> and Saint Peter too, will as eaſily be brought to teach to <hi>ſubmit to no ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And will not ſuch a Reformation make a rare Goſpel? will not the Church be rarely provided <hi>for the edifying of it ſelf in love?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we cannot ſtay to admire this rare platform of the new modell: which denyeth Chriſtian Kings that power which David exerciſed here, in <hi>commanding them to teach the Children of Juda the Bow.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It was that bleſſed Kings fate, to bear the jeers of <hi>Michal</hi> for his chearfull dancing, and his ſons bear the jeers of her Children for ſinging; her Children; for though her wit made her childleſſe to the day of her death: yet ſince her death ſhe hath a multitude of children, who imitate her ſloutings, and jeer our Church-muſick for ſinging ſad Anthems: upon this pitifull miſtake, they think <hi>all Muſick muſt expreſſe mirth.</hi>

            <p>But what wonder if they be no friends to Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, whoſe principles are all diſcords? whoſe harſh untunable ſpirits can by no means be brought to an uniſon? how can they ſing their lamentations, whoſe very praiſes are expreſſed by howlings and groans?</p>
            <p>But ſay; you that think all Muſick to be fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: what think you of <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s minſtrell, which from rage reduced him to ſuch a temper, as qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified him for the entertainment of the Prophetick ſpirit; was that a Jigg, think you? What think you of that <hi>Hymn</hi> wherein our Saviour breathed out the reſentments of his approching paſſion? was that a <hi>Coranto,</hi> think you?</p>
            <p>And let not the 137 Pſal. deceive you: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Pſalmiſt perſonateth a captive refuſing to ſing: for that refuſal is it ſelf a ſong: nor doth it refuſe ſinging indefinitely, but thoſe merry ſongs, which the enemy required <hi>Verſ.</hi> 3. <hi>the ſongs of Sion,</hi> the chearful praiſes of God: Theſe he refuſeth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62984:6"/>
with this execration, <hi>If I forget thee O Hieruſalêm, let my right hand forget her cunning: If I do not remember thee let my toung cleave to the roof of my mouth; i. e.</hi> let me forget both to play and ſing. A cold curſe to forget that which muſt never more be uſed!</p>
            <p>The meaning therefore of the Pſalmiſt is not to give himſelf the lye, by ſinging that he will not ſing: but to anſwer the enemy that required chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Muſick in a time of ſadneſſe. The captive will ſing, not the <hi>ſongs of Sion,</hi> praiſing God with the <hi>voice of Joy:</hi> but ſuch <hi>mournfull ſongs,</hi> as ſuited the ſad ruine of their Temple: So that this Pſalm is ſo far from denying Muſick: that indeed it profeſſeth ſome ſorts of Muſick to be ſuitable to the moſt diſmal calamities.</p>
            <p>If then this very complaint were a Song, if all the crying and penitential Pſalms were ſo many ſongs, if our Saviours laſt Hymn were a ſong, if this ſad <hi>Bow</hi> were a ſong; then certainly <hi>David</hi> and the greater ſon of <hi>David</hi> muſt bear their parts in thoſe ſcoffes which are made the portion of our Church, only for this, becauſe ſhe uſeth mournful Anthems.</p>
            <p>But whoſoever hath any skill, I do not ſay in Muſick, but Philoſophy, or Hiſtory, or any kind of literature, knoweth that Muſick can ſuit as well the <hi>Melancholy</hi> as the <hi>Sanguine</hi> temper, and carry the ſoul into all kinds of paſſions, ſo forcibly that ſome Philoſophers thought the ſoul it ſelf to be nothing but harmony.</p>
            <p>This we are ſure, that the animal ſpirits are exact dancers, keeping juſt meaſures with good
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62984:6"/>
Muſick: and harmoniouſly moving the paſſions.</p>
            <p>For whether the <hi>praiſes of God</hi> be ſung <hi>with the voice of joy,</hi> they are quickened by the ſhorter ſervice into ſuch a ſprightly dance as <hi>David</hi> uſed <hi>before the Ark:</hi> Or whether the ſins or miſeries of a people be lamented with dolefull ſtrains, the ſlow-paced Pavin with tender flats and ſharps mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them down to ſuch a lumpiſh heavineſſe, that they dance <hi>Ahab</hi>'s mournful meaſures when he <hi>humbled himſelf and walked ſoftly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed, whatever eloquence can do, the ſame can Muſick: Muſick being but an eloquent ſound as eloquence is a Muſical voice: <hi>Orpheus</hi> his Harp-ſtrings draw as ſtrongly as <hi>Hercules</hi>'s golden chain.</p>
            <p>There was a contention between <hi>Cicero</hi> the beſt Orator, and <hi>Roſcius</hi> the beſt Actor, which of them could expreſſe a paſſion with greateſt life and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, the one by phraſe, or the other by geſture: The like wager might well lye between a good Orator, and a good Muſician: It is not eaſily determined which way this <hi>Bow</hi> would pierce deepeſt, whether ſet to a <hi>mournfull Anthem,</hi> or to an <hi>eloquent Oration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this therefore we muſt confeſſe the harſh principles of the enemies of Church-Muſick have ſomething of harmony: They will baniſh both <hi>Muſick and Eloquence</hi> out of the publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, upon this miſtake: they think them both wanton. God is not pleaſed ſaith one of them with <hi>wanton words of Rhetorick,</hi> therefore no ſet form of prayer: God is not pleaſed with wanton Muſick therefore no Organ. But however theſe principles
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62984:7"/>
ſute well enough with one and another, and with the untunable ſpirits of their patrons: yet they are very diſagreeing both with <hi>David</hi>'s Pen and his harp, and his command; for he compoſed this lamenting <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>bad them teach it the Children of Juda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3 Obſerv. <hi>It is proper to celebrate the memory of eminent loſſes as well as of eminent deliverances:</hi> This <hi>Epicedion</hi> upon the <hi>death of Saul</hi> was written in the book of <hi>Jaſher</hi> as well as that <hi>Epinikion</hi> upon <hi>the victory of Joſhua.</hi> The <hi>daughters</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did as conſtantly <hi>lament the daughter of Jeptha</hi> as they celebrated the feaſt of the paſſover: And we do as ſolemnly obſerve the 30. of <hi>Jan.</hi> as the 5. of <hi>Novemb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is conſiderable, though perhaps incredible, to ſome men: that this publick and ſetled way of preaching, wherein they think the whole ſervice of God to conſiſt, deriveth from the obſervation of <hi>Holy dayes</hi> kept in honour of the firſt <hi>Martyrs:</hi> at whoſe burying places the people ſolemnly aſſembling were entertained by the eloquent Fathers with funeral Orations, in memory of thoſe <hi>Martyrs:</hi> from which uſe our Church-yards are ſtill called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the word <hi>Panegyrick</hi> which grammatically ſignifieth any publick ſpeech, was by the frequent uſe of ſuch aſſemblies contracted to a more patticular ſenſe; ſignifying ſuch ſpeeches only as were publickly made to the praiſe of ſome eminent perſon.</p>
            <p>But the pious Fathers of the Church finding it more advantagous to godlineſſe, changed thoſe Panegyricks to Sermons; and cauſed Churches
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62984:7"/>
to be built for the greater convenience of ſuch aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>And this I thought neceſſary to obſerve, that I might not ſeem to abuſe this place by imploying it to a Panegyrick rather then a Sermon: The buſineſs of this anniverſary calling us back to that primitive practice; that by embalming the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of this royall Martyr, our name may be reskued from that infamy which hath ſo long made us ſtink in the noſtrils of our neighbours: and his reputation from that obſcurity wherein it hath ſo long been buried: ſo fulfilling that his confident propheſy: that <hi>His reputation ſhould like the Sun (after Owls and Bats had had the freedome of the night and darker times) riſe and recover it ſelf to ſuch a degree of ſplendor, as thoſe Feral birds ſhould be grieved to behold and unable to bear. For never were any Princes more glorious than thoſe, whom God hath ſuffered to be tried in the Furnace of afflictions by their injurious Subjects.</hi> A long, long night it was, wherein thoſe Feral Birds triumphed; a hot Furnace was that wherein God ſuffered this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Prince to lye under a tedious trial; Bleſſed be his name that hath reſtored us to a power of honouring this Martyred Prophet, in a meaſure ſutable to his ſufferings. For as his injurious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects paſſed all examples in the cruelty of their perſecutions, ſo do his loving ſubjects outvy all the honours that ever were paid to the memory of the moſt glorious King, by this anniverſary reskuing his honour from their ſlanderous abuſes, as the valiant men of <hi>Jabeſh Gilead</hi> did the bodies of <hi>Saul</hi> and his ſons from the Walls of <hi>Bethſhan:</hi> and by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62984:8"/>
this Solemn lamentation which we thus practice in imitation of this <hi>Bow</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> which <hi>he bad them teach the Children of Juda.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us then paſs from viewing this <hi>Bow</hi> to hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it; and that in a ſutable panegyrical way: A ſutable way? No, that is a task for one of our <hi>Davids:</hi> him that made it, or him that we celebrate with it: Were <hi>my toung as the Pen</hi> of either of thoſe <hi>ready Writers,</hi> I would pierce the hardeſt heart among you, and in this ſenſe <hi>from the fat of the mighty, from the blood of the ſlain this Bow of</hi> Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than <hi>ſhould not return empty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, I will manage it as I can; upon this hope, that what is wanting in my feeble Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ſhall be ſupplyed by your loyall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

1 Grief, ver. 19. 2 Shame, verſ. 20. 3 Deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, verſ. 21.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Grief</hi> is exerciſed upon conſideration of the <hi>perſon</hi> ſlain. The onely conſiderable quality in <hi>Saul</hi> was his greatneſſe: which therefore maketh the burden of the Song, <hi>How are the mighty fallen!</hi> Thus is <hi>Abner</hi> lamented, though no otherwiſe conſiderable. <hi>Know you not that there is a Prince and a great man fallen this day in Iſrael?</hi> Thus did <hi>Jeremy</hi> lament <hi>Zedekia,</hi> who had nothing kingly but his power. <hi>The breath of our Noſtrils, the annointed of the Lord is taken in their pits.</hi> Yet I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould have been honoured with <hi>lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> if <hi>Jonathan</hi> had not fallen with him.</p>
            <p>They both met in our <hi>Martyred King,</hi> whoſe <hi>might</hi> was the leaſt part of his <hi>praiſe:</hi> his <hi>vertues</hi> were more <hi>glorious</hi> then his <hi>Crown.</hi>

            <p>If you deſire a more particular and lively chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, you ſhall find it in that rare <hi>Pourtraiture</hi> drawn by his own Pen, with ſuch exactneſſe of art, that it appeared ſome conſiderable recompenſe for the multitude of his heavy afflictions: which he

            <p>How is <hi>heighth of fancy</hi> married with <hi>depth of judgment!

            <p>What <hi>invincible patience outliving the witherings of his gourd without diſcontent or peeviſhneſſe;</hi> or the leaſt <hi>complaint to theſe who wanted nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete their mirth, but onely ſuch Muſick,</hi> or any other ſhrinking from that <hi>Majeſty</hi> which graced him moſt in his loweſt ebbs.</p>

Nay he is ready to reward them too. <hi>I do not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>more willingly forgive their ſeductions, then I am ambitious by all princely merits to redeem from their unjuſt ſuſpicions, and reward them for their good intentions.</hi> Theſe were the <hi>paſſions,</hi> theſe were the <hi>revenges,</hi> which that intolerable load of calumnies, affronts, priſons, and all kind of perſecutions, begat in the breaſt of that excellent King: the <hi>ſweetneſſe</hi> of whoſe <hi>temper</hi> could not receive any <hi>tincture of brackiſhneſſe</hi> though it ran a long, long courſe through a briniſh ſea of troubles.</p>
            <p>And if ſuch were his <hi>tenderneſſe</hi> to his <hi>enemies,</hi> Oh how dear where his <hi>affections</hi> to his <hi>friends and loving Subjects!</hi> which he teſtified, while he had power, by ſuch gracious conceſſions, that all poſterity will ſtand aſtoniſhed, both at the <hi>goodneſs</hi> which <hi>granted</hi> them and the <hi>baſeneſſe</hi> which <hi>abuſed</hi> them: and when he had no power but of his Pen, by his laſt declaration, wherein he <hi>proteſted before the face of Heaven that his own afflictions afflicted him not ſo much as his peoples ſufferings.</hi> Thus were <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> united in one perſon, <hi>wiſdome and eloquence, greatneſs and goodneſſe, magnanimity and patience, piety and charity were lovely in his life and in his writings they were not divided.</hi>

               <hi>He fell a King, by the hands of his own Subjects, a violent, ſudden, and barbarous death, in the ſtrength of his years, in the midſt of his Kingdom; his friends and loving Subjects being helpleſſe ſpectators, his enemies inſolent revilers and triumphers over him, living, dying, and dead.</hi>

            <p>Surely as <hi>David</hi> lamented <hi>Abner,</hi> ſo may we him. <hi>As a man falleth before wicked men, ſo felleſt thou.</hi> Thy vineyard made thee a blaſphemer, a faſt is proclaimed, a High Court of Juſtice eſtabliſhed, witneſſes prepared, an unjuſt ſentence procured and executed, that thy vineyard might be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed; <hi>As</hi> Naboth <hi>fell before</hi> Jezabell, <hi>ſo felleſt thou.</hi>

            <p>But <hi>Naboth</hi> was perhaps <hi>rich</hi> enough by the inheritance of his fathers, not <hi>mighty</hi> by the power of the Sword: <hi>Abner</hi> had the <hi>Sword</hi> too, yet fell

by the Sword of <hi>Joab,</hi> who got within him under pretence of kindneſſe: Great complements are uſed, they are his <hi>faithfull and loyall Subjects, his great counſel, will make him a great and glorious King. As</hi> Abner <hi>fell before</hi> Joab, <hi>ſo felleſt thou.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Joab</hi> was <hi>Abner's</hi> enemy, not only upon the publick quarrel, but a private grudge: And it is the heavy complaint of this afflicted King, <hi>If they had been mine open and forain enemies, I could have born it, but they muſt be mine own Subjects, who are next mine own Children, dear to me, and for the reſtoring of whoſe tranquillity I could willingly be the</hi> Jonah.

            <p>Yea, for which of them did <hi>not</hi> kill him? which of his perfections was there, that did not furniſh them with a tentation or advantage to deſtroy him? <hi>His Greatneſſe?</hi> That made him an enemy, becauſe it would reward them with ſpoils. <hi>His Goodneſs?</hi> That weakened him by ſuch a multitude of <hi>diſarming conceſſions.

            <p>I muſt be more particular.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62984:20"/>
and if that muſt have been their option twenty years ſince; they would rather have delivered themſelves up to the fire, then to that factious diſobedience which is now called the <hi>power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe:</hi> Yet being once ingaged, have been skrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by their inſinuating Leaders, to ſuch a height of unnatural Rebellion, as themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on clearer thoughts, would have abhorred with the moſt vehement deteſtation: Nor can any ſuch <hi>ſecond,</hi> and cooler thoughts, as ſo long a time of diſmal confuſion might have begotten in them, unmuſſell them from thoſe black errors which brought them firſt into diſobedience, and thence into hideous confuſions.</p>
            <p>How ſhall we undeceive theſe good men? Shall we urge the frequent and earneſt importunity of <hi>Scripture</hi> injoyning obedience?

            </p>
            <p>Shall we appeal for this to the Laws of the Land? There are hidden fundamental Laws which muſt firſt be heard, notwithſtanding a clear Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute making it Treaſon ſo to oppoſe fundamental againſt known Laws.</p>
            <p>Shall we vindicate the innocency of thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular injunctions which they ſcruple to obey? They believe it ſinful to obey all Eccleſiaſtical Injunctions, which bring no poſitive particular Warrant from the Word of God.</p>
            <p>How ſhall we convince theſe men? We will cite them to a new Topick, whoſe authority and

            <p>If they have renounced their own <hi>principles.</hi> If they have broken their own <hi>proteſtations.</hi> If they have confuted their own <hi>pretences:</hi> how can it be but men of ſuch tender conſciences, finding themſelves ſelf condemned, ſhould think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to repent of thoſe actions, which they cannot juſtifie: and ſeeing they muſt needs take ſhame to themſelves; bluſh rather at their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitances then their Sobriety.</p>

now a moſt manifeſt <hi>rebellion,</hi> not only againſt the <hi>Laws of God and the Land,</hi> but againſt their own <hi>proteſtation</hi> and their publick <hi>remonſtrances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>godly party</hi> being once ingaged, muſt needs go on, and are unawares grown to be <hi>Fresbyterians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They go on, and after forty meſſages from the King, importuning them for peace (partly ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, partly denyed, partly yielded too, but upon unreaſonable terms) at laſt they gain a complete victory and make the Kings moſt ſecret papers their Priſoners.</p>
            <p>It might be expected from ſuch <hi>faithful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> as they profeſs themſelves, that they ſhew him as much civility as <hi>Pompey</hi> did to his <hi>enemy Sertorius,</hi> whoſe Letters he <hi>hurnt,</hi> or as the <hi>Emp.</hi> ſhewed his <hi>enemy the Queen of Bohemia,</hi> whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted Letters he conveyed according to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. No, theſe Letters diſcover ſo many <hi>horrid plots</hi> againſt our <hi>Kingdome</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> that they ſhould be very <hi>unfaithful</hi> to the <hi>cauſe,</hi> if they ſhould conceal them.</p>
            <p>They are publiſhed, and what do they diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver but this? that the Kings intentions were moſt <hi>righteous,</hi> his deſires of peace moſt <hi>ardent,</hi> his wiſdome moſt <hi>eminent,</hi> his affections to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple moſt <hi>tender,</hi> and all their own pretences moſt <hi>falſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What invention could have deviſed a way more convincingly to <hi>juſtifie</hi> the <hi>King</hi> and to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themſelves?</hi> They had declared the King a <hi>good,</hi> but an <hi>eaſie</hi> Prince, led away by <hi>evil coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors,</hi> and needing the guardianſhip of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               </hi>liament:
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62984:22"/>
this they confute by publiſhing thoſe letters which demonſtrate his excellent <hi>wiſdome, and care.</hi> They had declared the war on their own parts to be meerly <hi>defenſive;</hi> and now they publiſh thoſe letters which make it apparent that the King is moſt <hi>deſirous of peace.</hi> They had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the King intended to <hi>bring</hi> in <hi>Popery,</hi> and now they publiſh thoſe letters wherein his <hi>firmneſs</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> is moſt apparent. They had declared his intentions to be foul, and confute themſelves by publiſhing the ſecreteſt intentions of his very heart to be fair and innocent. Was not this to give their <hi>cauſe</hi> a greater <hi>rout</hi> then they had given the Kings <hi>forces?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet the Presbyterians are Godly men: but being ſo far ingaged they muſt go on though</hi> Abſalon <hi>be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo impudent.</hi> The cauſe is grown ſo ſtrong as to defend it ſelf not only againſt the <hi>Laws of God</hi> and man, but againſt all its own <hi>pretences,</hi> and all appearance of <hi>modeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For now all fairer pretences are laid aſide, and <hi>Providence</hi> ſhall bear them out, even againſt their own principles. They will do whatever ſhall ſeem moſt advantagious, and no <hi>law</hi> nor <hi>religion</hi> ſhall withold them, for <hi>Providence</hi> leads them. That is, they have gotten power, and as long as they proſper; their ſword ſhall juſtifie what the ballance condemns.</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed <hi>King,</hi> no longer able to defend himſelf, applieth himſelf to the natives of his <hi>perſon</hi> and his <hi>troubles;</hi> upon their engagement to <hi>aſſiſt</hi> him and his <hi>party</hi> with their <hi>Armies and Forces:</hi> and accordingly at firſt they publiſh a glorious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſto,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62984:23"/>
declaring it an <hi>odious baſeneſſe</hi> if they ſhould deliver him up to thoſe <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> who were ſent for him.</p>
            <p>But having thus inhanced the price, they plainly make ſale of him for a ſum of money: with a <hi>proviſo</hi> notwithſtanding <hi>for his honour and ſafety:</hi> (in purſuance doubtleſſe of their National cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant (ſir reverence) which taught them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order the Kings defence to the defence of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: which they (the Goſpels life guard) could no longer ſerve without pay. What proviſo <hi>for the ſafety and honour of the King</hi> is no other way made good, but by a fair <hi>impriſonment,</hi> and a perpetual refuſall of his repeated importunities for a <hi>Perſonal treaty.</hi> And is not this a plain giving themſelves the <hi>Lye,</hi> who pretended to fight only to <hi>bring the King</hi> to <hi>his Parliament,</hi> and now will not ſuffer him to <hi>come?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet the Presbyterians are godly men, but being ingaged are now carried on by Providence to higher actions then at firſt appeared lawfull:</hi> and they muſt be excuſed if they <hi>change their principles with their condition, Providence</hi> thus calling them to it.</p>
            <p>At laſt the perpetual importunities of the <hi>King and Kingdom</hi> extort their conſent to a <hi>treaty,</hi> which they grant, but with this condition, that the King firſt <hi>depoſe</hi> himſelf by ſigning <hi>four Bills,</hi> yeilding up <hi>himſelf, religion, laws, friends, people</hi> and <hi>all</hi> to their <hi>Arbitrary power</hi> which becauſe he cannot but refuſe to do, they fairly <hi>depoſe and excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> him, by voting againſt <hi>all addreſſes</hi> to him or from him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:62984:23"/>
And is not this an accompliſhment of the greateſt ſelf conviction in the world; thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, whoſe lawfull authority they had ſo often ſworn to defend?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Yet ſtill the Presbyterians are godly men, but being engaged are led on by Providence,</hi> to ſuch actions as themſelves had often declared ſinfull, but now appear <hi>godly:</hi> becauſe <hi>providence,</hi> calleth upon them to <hi>change their principles with their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what invention ſhall we find out to juſtifie us againſt this laſt pretence? <hi>providence</hi> it ſelf fiighting alſo in its courſe againſt our laſt actions as well as againſt all our firſt pretences (and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring us to return where we firſt ſet out by <hi>changing thoſe principles too with our condition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not, I profeſſe I do not, thus uncover their nakedneſſe to <hi>upbraid</hi> but to <hi>convince</hi> them, who are hardened againſt all other evidences. We appeal to <hi>themſelves,</hi> to their own publick <hi>prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations,</hi> to thoſe very <hi>principles,</hi> into which their <hi>holy cauſe</hi> was firſt <hi>baptized.</hi> If they have not as peremptorily <hi>reſiſted every one</hi> of them as the <hi>King</hi> himſelf, we ſhall yield them the honour of being the <hi>only godly party.</hi> They profeſſed to <hi>make him a great and glorious King.</hi> How did they perform this? by illuſtrating his magnamity patience and other ſuffering vertues?</p>
            <p>They profeſſed <hi>to bring him to his Parliament.</hi> How did they perform this? By bringing his <hi>power</hi> thither and keeping away his <hi>perſon?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They promiſed to <hi>remove him from his evil Counſellours.</hi> How did they perform this? by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62984:24"/>
keeping him from that his great Councell?</p>
            <p>They promiſed to <hi>defend the Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in England.</hi> How did they perform this? By comparing the Loyalty of its principles, with thoſe of the new diſcipline?</p>
            <p>At laſt, they made <hi>providence</hi> their rule. Let them do ſo now, and joyn with us in deteſting thoſe principles, which <hi>providence</hi> it ſelf hath ſo manifeſtly blaſted: and which do ſo manifeſtly confeſſe themſelves not fit to be truſted, as having skrewed up ſuch Godly men to ſuch a heigth of impiety.</p>
            <p>But what is this to the Presbyterians? <hi>They did not kill the King:</hi> Grant it, are they therefore the godly party becauſe they did not come up to the very top of wickedneſſe? When they boaſt what they did not, they might do well to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what they did. They put the King, though not to death, yet upon the certain expectations of death, as knowing <hi>there are but few ſteps between the priſons and graves of Princes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>They did not kill the King,</hi> 'tis true. But 'tis as true they <hi>could not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They <hi>would</hi> not if they <hi>could.</hi> How ſhall we know that? By their <hi>proteſtations?</hi> let them ſhew us how they made good any one proteſtation, and we will believe them: How can they expect belief from us? how can they believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, whoſe principles run through ſo many changes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They voted the Kings conceſſions a ground for peace.</hi> But when? when it was too late; when they had no other way to oppoſe the Army: the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62984:24"/>
Army, who firſt pretended to reſtore the King, and then were oppoſed by the Parliament, as they are now when they declare to deſtroy him.</p>
            <p>They voted his conceſſions only a <hi>ground for a treaty:</hi> that they might engage his friends to help them, and not engage themſelves to reſtore the King.</p>
            <p>But theſe things are paſt and pardoned. <hi>They are now his beſt Subjects. They reſtored the King.</hi> Yes. As <hi>Marcus Livius</hi> was the cauſe of the taking of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> becauſe if he had not firſt loſt it, it could not have been taken: So were they cauſe of reſtoring the King, becauſe if they had not driven him from his Kingdome, he could not have been reſtored. But <hi>they reſtored him.</hi> They reſtore him? Why then are they ſo mad that he was reſtored ſo freely without <hi>articles?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> ſhew us the way of <hi>Presbyterians</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>Kings.</hi> They declare him their undoubted rightfull King; but withall he muſt not exerciſe any power untill he have ſubmitted to ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions as they think good to preſcribe. Then they beſtow a Crown upon him, but a thorny one; and make his Kingdome worſe then his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Presbyterians are the Kings faithfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</hi> If they will be believed, let them make it credible by ſome evidence. Let them follow the ingenuity of their brethren of <hi>Aberdeen.</hi> Let them ſhew their <hi>affections</hi> to the <hi>Son</hi> by their <hi>deteſtation</hi> of thoſe <hi>principles</hi> which ruined the <hi>Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How jealous would a juſt reſentment make them of every <hi>principle</hi> that hath <hi>the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62984:25"/>
               <hi>of evil?</hi> of <hi>every garment ſpotted with the fleſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When <hi>Adonijab</hi> petitioned for <hi>Abiſhag</hi> (the warming-pan rather then) the <hi>Concubine</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> what a ſtorm of jealouſie doth this raiſe in <hi>Solomon</hi> to the ruine of <hi>Adonijah,</hi> and his party? one ſlain, another degraded, another confined! How would that jealouſly become every affectionate heart, towards all thoſe principles, which do though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, glance toward diſobedience? How ſhould we ſuſpect every queſtioning of the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any royall command? How ſhould we curſe <hi>The mountains of Gilboa,</hi> every thing that contributed (though never ſo little) to the ruine of that <hi>Beauty of Iſrael!</hi> How ſhould we be jealous of our ſelves, how ſhould we fear the jealouſies of our Superiours, while we foſter thoſe opinions of whoſe creeping venome we have had ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience!</p>
            <p>But why ſo much fondneſs for <hi>Abſalom?</hi> Why muſt we be tempted to ſay like <hi>Joab,</hi> you <hi>declare that</hi> you <hi>regard neither Prince nor People. For we perceive that if your covenant had been brought in and the King kept out, it had pleaſed you well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſo great neceſſity of <hi>eſtabliſhing</hi> the <hi>new</hi> and <hi>deſtroying</hi> the <hi>old</hi> Government? What do you fear? <hi>Popery?</hi> This is that we crave, that you would renounce thoſe principles which are no leſſe propetly <hi>Popiſh,</hi> then perniciouſly <hi>Anti-chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What age, what Nation, not onely of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but <hi>univerſall</hi> world ever denied the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62984:25"/>
               <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical affairs,</hi> untill the ambition or the <hi>Popes</hi> wreſted it from the <hi>Emperors?</hi> who were they that refuſed the doctrine and <hi>Oath of Supremacy,</hi> when firſt impoſed in <hi>England,</hi> and ever ſince?</p>
            <p>Is it thus that you make your ſelves <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> that you may carry your faces oppoſite wayes, and dwell in the ſame <hi>longitude and latitude</hi> from <hi>truth and charity?</hi> Is it thus you run from one another, only as <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s <hi>foxes</hi> did, with <hi>countenances</hi> ſeperate, and <hi>tayls</hi> united in thoſe <hi>fiery</hi> doctrines, to which the Church of Chriſt oweth all her combuſtions?</p>
            <p>Believe it, thoſe Plebaeian doctrines of <hi>purgatory, Indulgences, Dirges,</hi> &amp;c. which onely pick Purſes, are not ſo properly and fundamentally <hi>Popiſh,</hi> as thoſe <hi>Jeſuitiſh</hi> principles which deſtroy whole Nations, by teaching it a pious devotion to <hi>turn Bankrupt in allegiance in hope to drive a quicker trade in Religion:</hi> A <hi>French Catholique</hi> who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the Kings Supremacy, is not half ſo dangerouſly Popiſh, as an <hi>Engliſh Schiſmatick</hi> which denieth it.</p>
            <p>This then, this, is that <hi>Thorough Reformation</hi> which the truly <hi>Godly party</hi> longeth for. Theſe are the <hi>Popiſh doctrines,</hi> upon which the <hi>Pope</hi> firſt built, and ſtill maintaineth his greatneſſe: Theſe are the <hi>Anti-chriſtian doctrines,</hi> which do ſo dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſe that <hi>Great and Dear command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and legacy</hi> which Chriſt gave his Church: <hi>Peace and Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And why muſt this great duty and happineſſe be thruſt out of the Church? What do you fear?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62984:26"/>
               <hi>ſhame?</hi> Will your reputation grow cheap with the people, if you <hi>build again the things you deſtroyed? Pacem contemnentes, &amp; gloriam quarentes, pacem perdunt &amp; gloriam: He that thus ſaveth his credit ſhall loſe it, but he that loſeth it ſhall ſave it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What more glorious victory then to overcome our ſelves? What greater honour in the ſight of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>wiſe,</hi> and <hi>good</hi> men, then ſuch a magnanimous embracing of <hi>ſhame?</hi> Did St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> get more honour by any one, yea, or by all his other books, then by his <hi>Retractations?</hi> Did <hi>Aberdeen</hi> ever perform an Exerciſe ſo worthy the wiſedome and piety of a Chriſtian Accademy, as this to which we invite you?</p>
            <p>But if you will needs be covering your <hi>naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> with <hi>fig-leaves;</hi> you cannot thereby hide, but proclaim your ſhame; your own firſt <hi>doctrines</hi> and publick <hi>proteſtations</hi> will tear thoſe <hi>aprons,</hi> and convince you not only of <hi>error</hi> but <hi>obſtinacy.</hi> And the meaneſt underſtanding, will (when a little calm hath ſetled our troubled waters) plainly, perceive, how unfit they are to be truſted who are at the ſame time <hi>ſelf-condemned and ſelf-juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what if this were not? what if the common people could be perpetually muffeled? Is the <hi>breath</hi> of the <hi>multitude</hi> the onely ſweet and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <hi>ayre?</hi> are not the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>learned</hi> not onely of this <hi>Nation,</hi> but of the whole Chriſtian <hi>world,</hi> worthy to be regarded! Is not the <hi>King</hi> worthy to be conſidered! Are not the two great <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives</hi> of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> worthy to be thought on? Nay is not <hi>God</hi> himſelf fit to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62984:26"/>
be remembred? and all the inhabitants of heaven who <hi>rejoyce at the repentance of every ſinner?</hi> Is not the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> fit to be feared? whoſe ſword you tempt, by giving ſuch manifeſt ombrages of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, while you juſtifie thoſe doctrines which we all are ſadly convinced to be pernicious.</p>
            <p>If then you truly lament that <hi>inhumane murther</hi> which we thus ſolemnly deplore; If you have any ſenſe of thoſe <hi>Long</hi> and <hi>Many,</hi> and <hi>Great miſeries</hi> under which we all groaned: If you really thirſt for a <hi>Thorough Reformation</hi> from the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> doctrines of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you deſire that <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>love</hi> may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on earth, and an <hi>Act of Oblivion</hi> in heaven. If you will not perpetuate <hi>Jealouſies</hi> in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and <hi>troubles</hi> in the Church:</p>
            <p>Then joyn with us in ſinging this ſtrayn of <hi>David</hi>'s lamentation, by curſing thoſe <hi>Philiſtian</hi> doctrines which were, not the place, but the cauſe of our wofull Tragedies.</p>
            <p>You inhumane, you unchriſtian, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Oh you bloudy and Anti-chriſtian doctrines, may every pretender to Loyalty and Chriſtianity for ever deteſt you.</p>
            <p>Whoever ſaith it becometh a Subject to queſtion the fitneſſe of the Kings commands, when they are not warranted by a particular Word of Scripture; Let him be <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
