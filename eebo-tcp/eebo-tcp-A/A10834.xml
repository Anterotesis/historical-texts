         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cause: For whereas in other accusations, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a mans goods, or good name, or bodily life,
at the most, is indaungered; in this, the life of the
soul (which fayth is) commeth in question.</p>
            <p>But well it is for the servants of Iesus Christ,
that they have him (their gratious Lord, and Saviour) for their
Iudg: by whose alone judgment (notwithstanding all mens pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices)
they shall stand, or fall for ever. And, if any others any
where, surely I, and they with me, have need to get this divine
comfort deeplie printed in our hearts; whose profession giues oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
to many, as doth our condition liberty unto all, to spare
no severitie of censure upon us.</p>
            <p>Four sorts of heavie freinds we have found, and felt in sorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
experience wheresoever we have become. The first whereof
is the unhallowed multitude, who living without God in the
world;<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.</note> and walking themselvs perversly, and in the workes of
darknes, cannot but hate, as the light it self, so all those, who
haue receaved grace of God, to walke therein with good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And as the Apostles in their dayes were everie where most
vexed with the hatred of the unbeleeving Iewes, their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen;
so are we by the like of ours like mynded. Of whom
whilst the most do want their countrie for causes so unlike unto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3102:3"/>
ours, no marvayl though there be no better concurrance of eyther
affection, or action between us.</p>
            <p>The second is of them, who are enamoured on that Romish
Hierarchie, as on a stately, and potent Ladie. Against which, and
for the holy presbyteriall government, as Christs institution by his
Apostles, whilst we doe in word and deed, give a free, &amp; full testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie;
alasse, with how many, and how great waves of affliction
are we overwhelmed by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>atred, and power? Dem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

enough, &amp; enough advantageable unto hers) be abhominable
unto this kinde of people, aboue all others, even Atheists, Papists
and most flagitious persons not excepted, whom they haue devout
enough, and over, unto that Goddesse.</p>
            <p>A third kinde is of those, who so servily inbondage themselues,
and their consciences, either to the edicts of Princes, or to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of certaine doctors, or to both these jointly, as that
they think nothing well done in case of R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ligion, which eyther
these teach not, or they commaund not: and on the other side,
almost any thing warrantable, which is commended by the one of
them, or commaunded by the other. And as of these some are so
transported with wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pish zeale, as they can scarcely without a fit of
an ague, eyther speak to, or think of him, who a litle steps out of
their troad; so others of them are so cunning, and wote so well
how to make their market, that though they be indeed almost like
mynded with us in all things, yet do they vehemently affect unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
emnitie with us: not because they themselues judge us so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving;
but others, whom therein they think it a poynt of their
wisdom to gratify.</p>
            <p>The fourth, and last sorte are they, who through credulitie, and
lightnes of beleif haue their ears open to the false, and feigned sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions
of slaunderous tongues. These men whilst they are over
good, and easie towards the evill, and injurious, unto whom they
give credence; become injurious themselus to the good, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent:
though in truth it be hard to say, unto which of three they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3102:3"/>
doe the greatest wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether to their brethren, of whom they
causelesly conceaue amisse, whilst either they greedily devour, or
easily receave such false reports, &amp; vituperies, as venemous tongues
spit out against them: or to their own souls, which they thereby
make accessorie to others mallice: or to the calumniators them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selus,
whom they put in heart to go bouldly on in reproaching the
innocent, whilst they know, where to finde receavers for their
slaunders, as do theeues for their stoln goods.</p>
            <p>Now, alasse, what sufficient bulwark of defence haue we (poore
people) to oppose unto the violence of so many, and mightie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries?

art ignorant: then which nothing</hi> in Tertullians judgment, <hi>is more

we do earnestly crave, that (as thou safely mayst, so) thou wilst inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously
passe sentence upon us, and our profession and not by the
unsavourie reportes eyther in word, or writing, of our adversaries
whomsoever: who do most commonly take libertie to suggest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us (underlings,) not what in truth &amp; conscience they should;
but what eyther fame reporteth, or ignorance suspecteth, or mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
inventeth, or proud contempt deems suiteing with our mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
and simplicitie.</p>
            <p>Two opprobries (amongst others infinite) haue beene of late by
our adversaries cast upon us; by which we are not onely occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
but after a sorte necessitated to the publishing of this our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie:
<hi>lest by not resuting such criminations</hi> (so great,<note place="margin">Cypr. tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </note> and greivous)
<hi>we should seeme to acknowledg a cryme,</hi> as Cyprian speaketh. The
former, by some of those, who in our owne countrie, are reputed
the cheif Masters and Patrons both of Religion &amp; truth: by whom
there hath been, not a flying bruit spread amongst the multitude;
but a solemn accusation to them in speciall authoritie, framed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us: First, that we (lewd Brownists) do refuse, and reject one
of the Sacraments: secondly, that we haue amongst us no ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3102:4"/>
ministrie, but doe giue libertie to everie mechanicall person
to preach publiquely in the church. Thirdly, that we are in errour
about the verie Trinitie. Fourthly, and lastly, that being become
so odious to the magistrates here, as that we are by violence to be
driven the countrie, we are now constreyned to seek some other,
and farr parte of the world to settle in.</p>
            <p>The other contumelie is in a Duch Rhime without name, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
it may be, (and as commonly it comes to passe) between the
cup and the wall, as sayth the proverb. This balad-maker compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the receaved religion in the Dutch churches to a tree: the Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries
in the countrie (of which he nameth not a few) to certayn
beasts endeavouring this trees ruine, and overthrow, likens the
Brownists to a litle worme, gnawing at the root thereof; and not
having lesse will, but lesse power to hurte, then the residue. Wee
are indeed <hi>wormes and not men,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 22, 9.</note>

people,</hi> whom high and low, and all that will, may without daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
tread, and trample under foot.</p>
            <p>But to giue thee satisfaction (Christian and indifferent Reader)
whosoever thou art, that chusest rather to take knowledg of mens
innocencie, then to condemn the same unknown; and that it may
appear unto thee, how alike unhonest our adversaries are in their
accusations, though of unlike condition in themselus, We do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
before God and men, that such is our accord in the case of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
with the Duch reformed churches, as that we are ready to
subscribe to all, and everie article of faith in the same church, as
they are layd down in the <hi>Harmonie of Confessions of fayth,</hi> published
in their name: one onely particle (and the same not of the greatest
weight) in the sixth Article, <hi>touching the Scriptures,</hi> being conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently

            <p>The scope of the Article is, (as appears in the margent) to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
between <hi>the books Canonicall, and Apocriphall, as they are
called.</hi> Touching which Apocryphall notwithstanding it is judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and affirmed, that <hi>they may be read in the Church.</hi> Which if it
be meant of their private reading by the members of the church, we
willingly assent: if of publique, pastorall, and ecclesiasticall read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we are indeed otherwise mynded: neither admit we any other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3102:4"/>
books to that dignitie in the church, then such as were penned by
the <hi>Holy men of God, moved by the Holy Ghost.</hi> 2 Pet. 1, 21. And as
the Apostle Iames testified of the Iewes,<note place="margin">Act. 15. 21.</note> that <hi>they had Moses read in
the Synagogue everie Sabbath day:</hi> so we think it sufficient for the
Christian assemblyes, that with Moses Christ, that is, the books of
the new testament be joyned with the old, and they alone be read.</p>
            <p>Neither need we seek further, or for other Arguments to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
our opinion, then the Article it self affoardeth us. The words
thereof are these:</p>
            <p>Moreover, we put a difference between the Holy writings,<note place="margin">Harmonie of Confess. Of the script. Art. 6, Conf. Belg.</note> and those
which they call Apocryphal, to wit, so as the Apocryphall may indeed
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> read in the church, &amp; that it may be lawfull to take instructions from
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hem, so far sorth, as they agree with the canonicall books: but such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>
hand is their authoritie, or firmnes, that upon their testimonie any
doctrine of faith, and Christian Religion may be founded, much lesse that
they haue force to infringe, or weaken the others authoritie.</p>
            <p>And first, if the Apocriphall books be publiquely read in the
Church, as well as the Canonicall, the difference which in word is
professed, seems indeed by this so reading them, to be taken away:
since the selfe same religious act (viz. publique reading) is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
about the one and other, although not altogether to the same
end. And if publique reading of the Canonicall Scriptures be
commanded of God in his worship, either the reading of these
Apocripha books is a parte of Gods worship also, (which the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick
Churches do not beleiv) or els they must be unlawfull to be
read publiquely in the Church, especially comming together for
that onely end of worshipping God. Publiquely, I say; for the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
reading of them, as of other books, comes not under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of worship properly, but of an act, and exercise <hi>preparati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi>
unto worship, as both Law<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ers, and Divines speak.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in this verie Article, the Canonicall bookes, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the Apocriphall, are called <hi>holy writeings.</hi> The Apocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall
then are not holy, as not being hallowed to this end, that is
not commaunded of God in the holy writeings of the Prophets,
and Apostles. Now what haue the holy assemblies to do, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convening, and meeting together for the solemn worship of
God, and exercising themselus in the same, with books not holy,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3102:5"/>
that is, not hallowed, or injoyned of God, for his most holy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, seeing these books are <hi>Apocriphall,</hi> that is, hidden, and
concealed, their verie name may put them in minde of their duetie
in concealing themselvs within the vaile of privacie. And surely no
small immodestie it is in them, which ought to conteyn themselus
in private use, and interteynment, thus bouldly to presse into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
assemblie. They must therefore change either their names,
or their manners; as women by their sex, so they by their name,
well expressing their nature, are inhibited all libertie of speaking in
the church.</p>
            <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, and conclude out of our countrie-man M. Broughton,
that those Apocriphall books are so stuffed with trifles, fables, lyes
and superstitions of all sorts; that the midle place between the ould
and new Testament, as ill becomes them, as it would do a Turkish
slaue, and leaper, between two the noblest Princes of all Europe.</p>
            <p>But to return whence I dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>essed. Seing that (as appears in the

and take knowledg of that most near conjunction which they haue
with the sacred, and truely Catholique church of God, and all the holy and
sound members thereof:</hi> by what tight, or rather injurie could we be
excluded from the followship of the same churches, who do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
better accorde, and have greater congruitie with them in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

they do publi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to the veiw of all men, as the congnissance,
and badges of their Christian consociation? And with what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of a Christian, or rather licentiousnes of a Rhymer, could
that adversarie traduce us to the world, as endeavoring the ruine of
the reformed churches?</p>
            <p>But perhaps, that which may be, is suspected to be by some,
(which also the false accuser doth insinuate in his libell against us)
and that, what in word we professe, we denye in deed; and what
we would seem to build with our tongues, we do, as it were, with
our hands pull down. If so it be, and that in deed we be found
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3102:5"/>
to be such, I doe freely confesse, that no censure upon us can be
too severe, no hatred more greivous then we do deserv.</p>
            <p>Now the guilt of this evill must cleav unto our fingers, if at all,
one of these two wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, either in regard of our selvs, or of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches. For our selvs, and our course of life, (for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie
compelleth, as it were foolishly to bable out that, wherein
modestie perswadeth silence) and how we converse with God, and
men, whether publiquely in the Church, or privately in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
we refuse not, by the grace of God bestowed upon frayl crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
labouring of the same humain infirmities with other men,
the search and censure of our most bitter adversaries, if not desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of all, both honestie, and wisdom.</p>
            <p>Touching the reformed Churches, what more shall I say? We
account them the true Churches of Iesus Christ, and both professe,
&amp; practise communion with them in the holy things of God, what
in us lyeth; their sermons such of ours frequent, as understand the
Dutch tongue; the sacraments we do administer unto their known
members, if by occasion any of them be present with us; their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
and other evils we do seriously bewayl, and do desire
from the Lord their holy, and firm peace.</p>
            <p>But happily, it wil be objected, that we are not like-mynded
with them in all things, nor do approve of sundry practises in use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, if not by publique institution (which it seems they
want) yet by almost universall consent, and uniform custome. I
graunt it; neither doubt I, but that there are many godly, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
men in the same churches, who also dislike in effect the things
which we doe: and amongst other things, this mal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>part, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled
bouldnes of unskilfull men, who make it a very May-game
to passe most rash censure upon the fayth, and so by consequence,
upon the eternall salvation of their brethren, and to impeach their
credit, whom they neither do, nor perhaps willingly would know:
lest that which they lust to condemn unknown, they should be
constreyned to allow, if they once knew it: and withall to disallow
that, into which they themselvs haue been led formerly by common
errour of the times. Which maladie is also so frequent, and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,
as that it may truely be said of many, that they then think
themselus most acceptable unto God, when they can make their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3102:6"/>
brethren (differing from them in some smaller matters) most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
unto men. This rageing plague except the Lord God in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie

either in the choice of the same officer, or censuring of the
same offender, no man admitting a due thought of things, can make
doubt of.</p>
               <p>3. We have the Apostle Paul giving it in charge to the Elders of
everie particular Church (as was that of Ephesus) <hi>that they take heed
unto al the flock, whereof the holy ghost made them Bishops,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 20, 17, 28.</note> or overseers,
<hi>to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</hi>
But surely, as that flock is verie inordinate, if not monstrous, which
for the largenes thereof, neither ever doth, nor possibly can feed
together; so that sheepheard of the Lords flock seemeth not aright,
and as he ought, to fulfill his charge, which doth not at the least,
everie Lords day, minister unto the same, the wholesom food of
Gods word. Ad hereunto, that in these huge and vast flocks, the
governers cannot take knowledg of the manners of the people
private, or publick; no nor so much, as of their presence at, or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
from the church assemblies: whereby what domage cometh

that the kindes intelligible have their existence in nature,</hi> that is in
the Individuals.</p>
               <p>2. The Catholick church, with due reverence unto learned
ned men be it spoken, is verie unskilfully said to be one, as the sea
is one. For, first, it is expressedly said Gen. 1, 9, 10. that <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
which were under the heauens, were gathered into one place,</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle,
which God called Sea, or <hi>seas.</hi> But the Catholick church,
which is said to comprehend al particular congregations in her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
is not gathered together into one place, nor ever shall be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the glorious coming of Christ. 2. The Ocean is a body so
continued, as that all, and everie part thereof is continually fluent,
so as the self same waters, which in their flux do make one sea, do
in their reflux by contrarie windes, make another, and so contrarie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.
But thus to affirm of particular churches, and their materiall
constitutive cause, were most absurd. 3. If some one particular
sea were drawn drie, or should fail his course, a disturbance of all
the rest would necessarily follow; But and if the sea should in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3102:7"/>
places at once happen to be exhausted, or drawn drie, there
would then be a fayling of the Ocean: neither were the waters
now gathered into one place, neither made they one sea, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of water, either continued, or conjoyned. But now, on the
other side, upon the defection, or dissipation of this or that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
church, no such impediment should come in the way, but
that the rest might hould their full course, as before. Yea, I adde
moreover, if all, and everie particular assembly in the world should
languish, and fall away, (one onely excepted) that (onely) one did
still remain the true, &amp; entire Church of Christ, without any either
subordination, or coordination, or dependencie spirituall, save un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Christ alone. The reason is plain, because this singular, and
sole assembly may under Christ the head, use, and enjoy everie one
of his institutions: the communion of Saints combyned together
in solemn, and sacred covenant, the word of God, Sacraments,
Censures, and ministrations whatsoever by Christ appointed, and
therewith the same Christs most gratious presence.</p>
               <p>And upon this ground it is, that the Apostle Paul doth intitle
the particular congregation, which was at Corinth, and which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,

was the church at Rome in the Apostles dayes, more one with the

Paul more one, whole, intire, and perfit man (consisting of their
parts essentiall, and integrall) without relation unto other men;
then is a particular congregation (rightly instituted, and

And if we be not to insist in the next, and immediate parent, why in
the grand-father, or great-grand-father, and so for the rest, till
we climbe up, as high, as to No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

follow, that not the Infants of Iewes, nor of Turks, no nor of

grace of Christ must needs be universall, and wherein all have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
if the seal thereof apperteyn unto all. Neither should the
Church (amongst whose sacred furniture Baptism is) by this rule
be any more the house of God, peculiar to his children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3102:9"/>
but more like a common In, whose doore stands wide
open to all that passe by the high way.</p>
               <p>2. The Apostle 1 Corinth. 7, 14. upon this ground, that the
one parent is a beleever, avoweth the childe <hi>holy:</hi> which otherwise
he pronounceth <hi>impure,</hi> in respect of the Covenant, and holynes
thereof (leaving unto God his secret judgments). Now what have
the impure, and unhallowed to do with the holy things of God?
And what hath the Pastour, and sheepheard in holy things to do
with them, who are no portion of the Lords flock? <hi>What have
I to doe</hi> (sayth the Apostle) <hi>to judg them that are without? Do not ye
judg them that are within?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5, 12.</note> So (reverend brethren) what have you
to do, to baptize them that are without? do you not baptize them
that are within, and them alone? In the number of whom yet you
reckon not those infants (though baptized by you) nor belonging
to your charge. Whence also (God knoweth) it cometh to passe,
for the most part, that they who are thus by you baptized into the
name of the Lord, are by their godlesse parents education made the
servants of Sathan.</p>
               <p>3. The Baptism of Infants, in all soundnes of judgment, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,
and that immediately for the comfort of their godly parents;
whose hearts it filleth with no small joy, whilst they behould the

confirmed by this seal: even as of ould the circumcision of Isaak
was granted, and injoyned by God unto Abraham his, and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
first and immediately, for the confirmation of his fayth.
Whence I conclude, that the seal of the righteousnes of faith (which
baptism is) doth no more belong to the seed of godlesse parents,
then doth the comfort flowing from the righteousnes of fayth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the parents themselvs. Whom as it would effectually move to

               <p>Three things especially are objected, which must here be clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
The first is, that David, and other Prophets penned the
book of Psalmes for the mother Church of Israell. The second,
that Christ himself delivered to his disciples a certain form of
prayer, commonly called, <hi>The Lords prayer.</hi> The third, that Moses
from the Lord Numb. 6. gave direction to Aa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on, and his sonnes,
in what form of words they should <hi>blesse the children of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer first generally, that the consequence followeth not from
the authoritie of Christ, and of Moses, and of the Apostles, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyning
these, and these forms of divine worship, for the like au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie
in ordinance Bishops, and Pastours, to ordeyn other, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
forms, for the same end. What can be spoken more insolent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly?
Christ the Lord, Moses, the Prophets, and Apostles being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and infallibly guided by the spirit of Christ, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
certain set formes of Gods worship; therefore others
though not immediately and infallibly guided by the same spirit,
may also prescribe them. Why may they not by this argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as well frame us a new Canon of holy Scriptures, considering
that even th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>se verie formes, wherewith also they equalize their
own, are parts, and portions of the same Scriptures. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.
And first for Psalms. I deny that there is th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> same reason of
a prayer, and of a Psalm; or (whereupon the difference hangeth)
that singing, and praying are all one. For the question is not,
which I desire the Reader once for all to bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

the internall affection of him which singeth, or prayeth, or of the
subject matter of the song or prayer: but of the externall act, and
exercise of praying and singing. Now these two exercises both the
holy Scriptures, and common sence in everie man, that pleaseth
but to open his eyes, and look upon them, do plainly difference.</p>
               <p>For first, if to sing be to pray, then whosoever singeth prayeth:
but how far from truth this is, the Psalmes of David, 1, 2, and
many others in which not the least parcell of prayer is to be found,
do plainly evince.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Is any man sad amongst you,</hi>

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3102:10"/>
nor which do agree (to wit primarily) with the same constitution
of the minde.</p>
               <p>3. In prayer the Pastours voyce is onely heard, unto which the

but in praying, neither to our selvs, nor to our brethren,
but unto God alone. And the reason hereof is evident. When as
we read or sing the Psalms of David (for what other thing is it to
sing out of a book,<note place="margin">Scalig. po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

voice? of which Harmonie singing is a kinde): these self same
Psalms in this verie use do still remain, and so are read or sung, as a
part of the word of God in the holy Scriptures: and in which
God speaketh unto us: whereas on the other side, we do speak
unto God, in all our prayers, whether mentall onely, or vocall
withall.</p>
               <p>5. Even these verie Psalmes, whose matter is prayer, and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving,
were framed, and composed by the prophets into Psalms,
and spirituall songs, for this verie end, that the men of God might
in them teach us, as in the written word of God, whereof they are
parts, both what petitions they in their distresses put up to the Lord,
and also what thanksgiving they returned upon their deliverance,
that so we in reading &amp; singing them, might instruct and admonish
ourselvs both publiquely, &amp; privatly, whether by way of doctrine,
or admonition, or consolation, for the promoteing of the glorie
of God in our hearts.</p>
               <p>Lastly, that I may discend unto them, who are onely taught by
experience; If any going out of the temple, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:3102:11"/>
of one that met him, what the church were then doing, should an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
that it were at prayer; would he not be judged by all men to
tell a ly? But altogether without cause, if to sing be to pray, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
imagine.</p>
               <p>Touching <hi>the Lords prayer.</hi> We deny it to be the meaning of
Christ, teaching his dise ples, when they pray to say, <hi>Our father,</hi> &amp;c.
to binde them, and the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> in them, by which they ought
to pray, to a certain form of words,<note place="margin">Iude 21.</note> &amp; sillables, which they should
repeat by heart, or (which is our question,) read out of a book.
Because, 1. the two Euangelists Matthew, and Luke of whom both
the one and other did aright both understand, and expresse the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Christ, do not precisely keep the same words. 2. By these
words, <hi>when you pray,</hi> is meant, whensoever you pray: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it should follow, that we were tyed to this stint of words alone,
and alwaies: and so might lawfully use none other, except it be
lawfull for us sometimes to pray raither by the levell of our own
dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>To pray otherwise then Christ hath taught,
is not onely ignorance, but guilt, seeing he himself hath sayd, you reject the
precept of God, that you may observ your own tradition.</hi> 3. Amongst
the manie, and manifould prayers of the Apostles to be seen in the
holy scriptures, this form of words is not found: and yet can it not
be denyed, but they alwaies prayed as they were taught in this place
by their Master Christ: whose meaning therefore it could not be
to tye them necessarily to anie such certain of words. 4. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the context, that the purpose of Christ is to speak of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,
or raither secret prayer, and such as everie Christian apart from
others, and <hi>in his closet,</hi> with <hi>the doore shut unto him,</hi> should pour
out unto the Lord. Now that one alone, and by himself should
say, <hi>Our father,</hi> seems not verie congtuous. Lastly, seeing of the
like there is the like consideration, If the Apostle Iames in these
words, <hi>Go to now, ye that say, to day or to morrow we will goe into such
a cittie</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Iam. 4, 13.</note> and vers. 15. <hi>For that ye ought to say, if the Lord will,

                  </gap>kilfull men cease not still to sing unto us, euen to loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somnes,
the song, <hi>when you pray say,</hi> as the Papists do theirs, <hi>This is
my bodie:</hi> as though the controversie were about the words, and
not raither about the meaning of them.</p>
               <p>But for that we are verie odiously traduced by divers, as abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
from this form, and that we will not (as they use to speak) say
the Lords prayer, I will in few, and plain terms set down what our
judgment is about it.</p>
               <p>1. And seeing that, as the Poet hath it, <hi>the names do commonly
suit with the things,</hi> we may see, and sorrow withall, in the phrases
in common use about this most Christian duetie of prayer, what it
is with the unhallowed multitude of Christians to pray, namely <hi>to
say prayer, to read prayer, to hear prayer,</hi> and raither any thing then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
to pray, that is, then to pour out the conceptions of a godly
and devout minde unto God, from faith and feeling of our wants,
by the holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>2. We do affirm, that this form of words is unproperly, how
commonly soever, called <hi>the Lords prayer:</hi> as neither being a prayer
as it is the Lords, nor the Lords as it is a prayer. As it is of the
Lord Christ, and so the Lords (whether by himself uttered in
words, or committed to writing by his Euangel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sts) it hath the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration,
and respect of a sermon, and of Euangelicall doctrine,
in which Christ taught his disciples; and not of a prayer put up to
his Father: as on the contrarie it neither was, nor could be used
prayer wise by Christ, in so manie words; with whose most persit
sanctimonie it did not agree for him to say, <hi>forgive us our trespasses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. We do firmly beleiv, that all, and everie both Church and
person is bound alwayes to pray, as Christ hath there taught: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we respect the matter there propounded, or the affections
there injoyned, or the commodious, and compend<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous simplicitie,
which Christ our Saviour, and onely mayster, there opposeth, both
to the vain bablings, and oft repetitions of the heathens: and that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3102:12"/>
in these things, and them alone, the commandement of Christ doth
consist, we both firmly beleiv, and confidently avow.</p>
               <p>4. And lastly, we doubt not but that this verie form of words
may be, and is rightly used in prayer unto God, provided there be
neither opinion of necessitie, by which superstitious persons think
themselvs stinted by the Lord to words, and sillables, nor of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
by which many are of minde, that they have then at the last,
and not before prayed per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itly, when they have repeated this form
of words. And it is well, if some spot of this myre cleav not to
the fingers of many ministers; which make it a matter of great
conscience not to conclude their, and the churches prayers apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
specially to the present state of things, with this number, and
measure of words. Which custom as it is used verie commonly, so
in my judgment, with no great reason, for these two causes.</p>
               <p>First, it seems to crosse all good order, and method, by which
men should d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>scend from the more generall unto that which is
more speciall: and not go the clean contrarie way, as in this they
do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Since the rule, according to Phylosophie, and good
reason, is alwaies before the thing ruled, and that this form is by
Christ inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tuted, for this purpose, that it might be the rule, and
squire of all our prayers,<note place="margin">Tertull lib. de Ora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>It remayneth that in a few words I answer that, which is by some
objected touching those solemn blessings, at the first imparted by
the Patriarks to their first born, and after by the Preists to <hi>Israel the

in Calvins words, viz. that <hi>these blessings were not ordinarie prayers,
but a lawfull author<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tie divinely interposed to testifie the grace of election:</hi>
which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> also confirms by divers reasons. Neither can anie man
who considers the words of the text make question, but that the
Priests in <hi>blessing (Israel,</hi> not God) do direct their speach unto Israel
by way of promise, and not unto God by way of prayer. <hi>So blesse
you</hi> (saith Moses) <hi>the children of Israel, saying unto them, The Lord blesse
thee,</hi> &amp;c. The same is to be judged of the salutations of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
in their Epistles, (whereof they are a part, and so a part of the
holy Scriptures): albeit yet they in them, as the Preists in their
blessings, desired to have their truly loving affection taken know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of by them to whom they wrote: and what good things they
both desired at the hands of the Lord for them, and also promised
them in his name.</p>
               <p>2. We dislike all reading of prayer in the act of praying, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient,
yea directly contrarie unto that act? In prayer we do
pour out matter, to wit the holy conceptions of the minde, from
within to without; that is, from the heart to God: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
in reading, we do receav and admit matter from without to
within; that is from the book, into the heart. Let him that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
do that which he doth, not another thing, not a divers thing.
Let the whole man, and all that he is, both in soul and bodie, be

are lifted to God in prayer; and why not the eyes of the bodie also?

                  </gap>e that prayeth, by intending them upon a book, both
depresseth, &amp; averteth from God. The Apostle exhorteth, that <hi>the
men pray, lifting up pure hands to God in everie place.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2, 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> In like manner,
(besides the reason of the thing, we have the Patriarks, Prophets,
Christ himself, with his Apostles, and disciples, for insample of
lifting up the eyes to heaven in prayer. Not this gesture of body
is simply necessarie but most convenient, (save in some great temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,

which may be read, and that with no small benefit both by Pastour
and people; but privately, and for better preparation unto prayer.
Now the preparation unto prayer is verie unseasonable at the self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same
time of the solemn performance thereof; and unreasonable
in, and by the self same act.</p>
               <p>3. Seeing that <hi>publique prayer</hi> (as Bucanus saith) <hi>is a second part
of the ministrie;</hi>

wherewith the Pastor is indued from above, that is not small, not to
be despised, by which he is able conveniently both for matter, and
form, to conceav a prayer according to the churches present occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion;,
and necessities; by the reading of this prescript form that
(truly excellent) gift giuen of God for this end is made void, and
of none use, and <hi>the spirit</hi> (contrarie to that which ought to be) <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished.</hi>

                  <hi>The manifestation of the spirit</hi> (saith the Apostle) <hi>is given
to everie one</hi> (especially to everie Pastour) <hi>to profit withall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12, 7.</note> But he
who reads a form of prayer conceaved, and consigned by another,
doth not manifest the pastorall gift, (for of the internall affection
our question is not) of the spirit given to him to profit withall, but
to that other by whom the form of prayer was ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ted.</p>
               <p>4. If to read such a form of prayer be to pray aright, and pastour
like no probable reason can be rendred, wherefore to read a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or homilie, is not as well to preach aright, and as is required
of the Pastour of the Church. Which so being, small reason had
the Apostle,<note place="margin">Act. 6.</note> treating of the ecclesiasticall ministerie, which princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally

               <p>5. <hi>The spirit</hi> (saith the same Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8, 26.</note> speaking of all Christians)

shortly be expired, and were perhaps to follow the Apostles depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

               <p>3. It was sacriledg for the Levites being consecrated to the

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3102:14"/>
for that verie cause he forbids mariage it self, otherwise permitted
to all, and to some injoyned. How much lesse lawfull is it for the
Elders, or Deacons of the church (whose both condition, and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie
is far more excellent) for far lighter causes, to look back,
and relinquish their vocation, wherein Christ hath in such sort pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
them?</p>
               <p>A third thing there is, and that of most moment, viz. that the
Elders do not administer their publique office publiquely, as they
should, but onely in their private consistorie. And first, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strat
on of everie office doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n right follow the nature of the same;
whether domesticall in the familie, or civill in the common wealth,
or spirituall in the Church: the Elders office then being publique,
requires answerable, and publique administrat on. Not that it is
unlawfull for the Elders to convene, and meet apart from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
and to deliberate of such things as concerns the same, and so to
do sundrie things by vertue of their office, but because that is not
sufficient,<note place="margin">Colos. 4, 17.</note> neither do they indeed <hi>fulfill</hi> their publique, and church-<hi>office,
office, which in the Lord they have receaved,</hi> except as privately, and and in
their consistorie, so also (and that specially) publiquely, and in the
face of the congregation they exequute the same.</p>
               <p>2. The Apostle <hi>beseecheth</hi> them of Thessalonica <hi>that they would
in love highly esteem for their works sake,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Thes 5, 12, 13.</note> not onely <hi>them which labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
among them,</hi> to wit, <hi>in doctrine;</hi> but them also, which were <hi>over
them in the Lord, and admonished them.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 5, 17.</note> But of the work of their
Elders which govern, the Reformed churches must needs be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant;
neither doe, or can they know, whether they be good, or
bad. Their pastours they do prosequute with due love, &amp; honour,
out of their own certain knowledg of them and their work, but
their Elders onely by hearsay.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Act. 20, 17, 28.</note> the same Apostle warneth <hi>the Elders of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>phesus,</hi> that they
<hi>attend &amp; take heed to the whole flock, in which they were made Bishops.</hi>
But it cannot be, that he should ministerially, as he ought, feed the
whole church, whose voice the greatest part thereof never so much
as once heareth. To lead, or receav a she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>p now and then into the
sheepfould, to confirm one that is weak, or correct one that stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and that apart from the flock, is in no wise to feed the whole
flock, as the Apostle requireth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:3102:15"/>
And that this point may be made the more plain, let us discend
unto some such particulars, as in which the Elders office seemeth
specially to consist. And they are, the admitting of members into
the church, upon profession of faith made, and the reproving and
censuring of obstinate offenders, whether sinning publiquely, or
privately with scandall. As we willingly leave the exequut on, and
administration of these things to the Elders alone in the setled, and
well ordered state of the church, so do we deny plainly, that they
are, or can be rightly, and orderly done, but with the peoples pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e
and consent.</p>
               <p>For the first, Christ the Lord gave in charge to his Apostles to
preach in his name remission of sins, and therewith life eternall:
and that such Iewes, or Gentiles, as should beleiv, and repent, viz.
professe holily faith and repentance, (for to judg of the heart is
Gods prerogative) they should receav into the fellowship of the
Church, and baptize. And that these all, and everie of them were
publiquely, and in the face of the congregation to be administred,
the <hi>Acts of the Apostles</hi> do plent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ously make known. And if Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,
the consequent of the confession of faith, in them baptized,
and the badg of our consociation with Christ and his Church, be
to be celebrated publiquely, why is not the profession of saith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
(although by the formerly baptized through a kinde
of unorderly anticipation) to be made publiquely also, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall
the consociation ecclesiasticall, as the former? The cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

               <p>I further add, that since persons admitted into the Church, are

                  <note place="margin">Act. 2, 44, 45.</note> it seemeth most equall, that not onely the Presbyters
(the churches servants under Christ) but the whole commonaltie
also should take knowledg in their persons, both of their holy
profession of faith, and voluntarie submission made as unto Christ
himself, so to his most holy institutions in his Church.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Beza in ann. on the place.</note>
as Beza rightly observeth. And that not for this cause alone, that
when the punishment comes to one, the fear might reach unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

               <p>2. With this also it well conforteth, that Christ the onely Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>teyns unto the people, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the people primarily, and originally (under Christ) to rule and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3102:16"/>
govern the church, that is, themselvs. But who will so say of a
government not personall, but publique, and instituted, as the
churches is?</p>
               <p>2. If the Elders in their consistorie represent the church, then
whatsoever they either decree, or do agreeing to the word of God
whether respecting faith or manners, that also the church decreeth
and doth, though absent, though ignorant both what the thing is,
which is done, and upon what grounds it is done by the Elders:
this being the nature of representations, that what the representing
doth within the bounds of his commission, that the represented
doth primarily, and much more, as but using the other for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument.
Now how dissonant this is to true faith and pietie, how
consonant unto the Papists implicit faith, no man can be ignorant:
and I had raither wise men should consider, then I aggravate.</p>
               <p>3. The constant, and universall practise of the Apostles &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
churches do quite crosse this consistorian course. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
Paul, well acquainted with the meaning of Christ, doth 1 Cor.

                  </gap>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,
and others do graunt. But we will annex certain reasons for
the further clearing of the thing.</p>
               <p>1. They <hi>among whom the fornicatour was,</hi> who <hi>were puffed up,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ver. 1, 2, 4, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 13.</note>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3102:17"/>
to be put, who had done that thing;</hi> they were to be <hi>gathered together
in one,</hi> and to <hi>judg</hi> and excommunicate that incestuous person. But
the fornicatour was not amongst the Elders alone, neither were
they alone puffed up when they should have sorrowed, neither was
that wicked man to be taken out of the midst of them, and still left
in the midst of the people; and therefore not to be judged by
them alone, but by the church with them, though governed by
them.</p>
               <p>2. It did not of ould apperteyn onely to the Levites and Elders
in Israel,<note place="margin">v. 1. 7.</note> to <hi>purge out</hi> of their houses the materiall <hi>leven,</hi> but to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
father of familie also: so by proportion to the whole church
now to purge out the leven spirituall there spoken of: which also
could not <hi>leven the whole lump,</hi> or church, in the Apostles meaning,
except it had concerned the whole church to purge it out.</p>
               <p>3. The Apostle wrote not to the Elders onely, but with them
to the whole bodie,<note place="margin">i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as the other,<note place="margin">11.</note> to cast their stone at the incestuous man, for <hi>the taking
him away from the Lords people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Manie more Arguments, and the same verie clear, might be
drawn to this end, out of the text it self; but for brevitie sake I will
omit them, and annex this onely one which followeth, from the
second chapter of the second Epistle. The same Apostle writing to
these same Corinthians about the same incestuous person, but now
penitent, as before delinquent, seriously exhorts them, that look
what severitie they had formerly shewed in censuring him for his
sin, the like compassion they would now shew, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eceaving him
again upon his repentance: therein plainly insinuateing, that this
busines was not in the hands of the Elders alone, except we will
say, that they alone were <hi>made sad</hi> by the Apostles reproof, that they
alone by their <hi>studie, defence, indignation, zeal,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ch. 7, 9, 11. and 2, 7, 8.</note> &amp;c. <hi>testified,</hi> that they
<hi>were pure in the thing,</hi> and except it belonged to them alone to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and <hi>comfort</hi> the repentant sinner, and <hi>to confirm their love unto
him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas some would inclose this whole power within the
Apostles circuit; as if he alone, Bishop-like, had passed sentence
judicia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

it not lost labour breifly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hew how erroneous this opinion is of
externall monarchicall government, yea power also, which is more,
in the church of Christ.</p>
               <p>And, first, one alone, how great soever, cannot suffice to make
the Church,<note place="margin">See the Bishop of Church, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Tertus p. 41, 42.</note> or a congregation, which Christ hath furnished with
power of <hi>binding, and loosing</hi> Math. 18, 17, 18. both reason, and

D. Whitakers against Stapleton, going about to prove that <hi>the name
of the church belongs to the Pastours, or Byshops, or Pope alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It is expresly affirmed 2 Cor. 2, 6. that the incestuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was <hi>censured by many:</hi> which <hi>many</hi> or more, the Apostle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
to himself alone, as appeareth by the context; and not <hi>to all,</hi>
as some erroneously think.</p>
               <p>3. The Apostle plainly, and sharply reproveth the Corinthians
for that before his writing they had not voyded that sinfull man,
their holy fellowship, and so prevented the reporte by which such
a crime, and the same unpunished came to his ears. This their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
then the man of God doth not seaze into his own hands as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyt

ought <hi>in the judging, purging out, and taking from among themselvs that
wicked man,</hi> and so any other <hi>within,</hi> or called <hi>a brother,</hi> sinning in
the like manner.</p>
               <p>4. If the Apostle Paul being absent from Corinth had excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
this sinner, then had he judicially condemned,<note place="margin">See <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

small, as before, but (which I wish may be marked to stop the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
which some think lyes open for escape through smaller as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies)
now become great, and populous. In this busines the
Apostles informe the church what kinde of men they ought to
chuse: the multitude chuseth whom they judg fit, and meet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly;
and the same present to the Apostles: upon whom so cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by the people, the said Apostles impose hands as a solemn sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole
of their consecration, joyning therewith common prayer.
Now if the Deacons onely betrusted with the churches monie were
not to be made but by the peoples suffrage, and election, much
lesse Pastors &amp; Elders, unto whose fidelitie under Christ the same
Church doth commit the incomparable treasure of their souls.</p>
               <p>To the same purpose (in regarde of the matter in hand) serveth
that,<note place="margin">Act. 14.</note> which we read Act. 14, 23. where <hi>Paul and Barnabas do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyn
Elders in everie Church, by suffrages</hi> (not their own as some fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
unto whom <hi>to lift up, &amp; to lay on hands</hi> is all one) but the peoples;
or <hi>by the lifting up of hands,</hi> by which signe, the Grecians, as appears
in Demosthenes, and others, the peoples vote or voyce-giving in
their popular assemblies was wonte to be made. I ad (which is espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
to be observed) that the Apostles in doing their part in the
ordination of Elders, did what they did, as it were, by the way:
staying onely, most like, two or three daies in a place: so as they
could not possibly by their own experience take sufficient know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3102:18"/>
what persons in the church were <hi>apt to teach or govern:</hi> who
<hi>able to exhort with sound doctrine,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> &amp;c.
and with these, how mannered wives, and children they had. These
things onely the bretheren which conversed with them publiquely,
and privately, could sufficiently take knowledg, and experience of.
Vpon their electing them did the ordination conferred by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,
as the hands of the Church, depend. By election the persons
elected have right to their offices; into the actuall possession where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

and to be administred by some certain choice men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

to the people freely to vote in elections and judgments

the <hi>Elders</hi> to <hi>govern</hi> the people even in their voting in just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 28 1 Tim. 5, 17 Heb. 13, 17.</note>
given by Christ whatsoever. Let the Elders publiquely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
and order all things in the church, &amp; so give their sentence
on them; let them reprove them that sin, convince the gain-sayers,
comfort the repentant, and so administer all things according to the
prescript of Gods word: Let the people of faith, give their assent
to their Elders holy and lawfull administration: that so the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
elections, and censures may be ratified, and put into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

2. We doubt not but that the Elders both lawfully may, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
ought, and that by vertue of their office,<note place="margin">Act. 20, 18.</note> to meet apart at
times from the bodie of the Church, to deliberate of such things as

so as publiquely, and before the people, they may be prosequuted

avow, and stand for; in matters truly publique and ecclesiasticall,
we do not understand (as it hath pleased some contumeliously to

grown, and of discretion: making account,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14, 34, 35. 1 Tim. 2, 12.</note> that as children by their

               <p>If any now shal object, that there are yet other things beside these,
in which we consort not so well with them, nor they with us; as for
example, 1. In the sanctification of the Lords day, in which we
seem even superstitiously rigid. 2. In a certain popular exercise of

and sundry other indifferent things, as they are termed; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,

and one of ten; by which it should come to passe, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
now were not to count of ten commandements of the moral
law, but of nyne onely.</p>
               <p>If reply be made that the fourth commandement is so ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall,
that notwithstanding it hath this morall in it, that some tyme
be assigned, and taken for the publique ministerie, and exercises of
religion, I answer:</p>
               <p>1. That the same may be said in generall, of the Mosaicall cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
whatsoever: all, and everie one whereof affoardeth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:3102:22"/>
morall. For instance, The Mosaicall Temple, or Tabernacle
had this morall in it, and perteyning to us, as well as to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,
that it was a fit and convenient place for the Church assembly.
Is therefore the precept for the tabernacle as well morall,<note place="margin">Exod. 25, &amp; 26. Exod. 20.</note> as that for
the Sabboth? Is it alike a part of the decalogue, and morall law?
Is it alike one of the ten Commandements?</p>
               <p>2. If the morall sanctification of the Sabboth stand in this, that
sometime be assigned to the publique ministerie, then were the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,
especially the preists, and Levites, bound to an everie day
sabboth and sanctification morall,<note place="margin">Num. 29, 38</note> being bound everie day <hi>to offer</hi>

               </p>
               <p>3. If the second precept of the Decalogue do in the affirmative
part injoyn all outward instituted worship of God; then also by
consequence it requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n then is the fourth commandement,
and to no purpose, if it injoyn nothing at all, but that which was
injoyned before, namely in the second.</p>
               <p>4. The verie essence of the fourth commaundment consists in
this, that a day of seaven be kept holy, that is separated from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                  </gap>ch as in a holy day the
works of divine worship, and such as serve for the spirituall man
ought to be exercised, as appears plainly by the reason taken from
Gods example, upon which the commandement is founded. Take
this away, and the life of the precept seemeth to suffer violence.
The truly godly take some tyme for the exercises of Gods worship
not onely publique, and Ecclesiasticall, but private also, and dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall:

<hi>the Lords day</hi> a day certain, and known especially unto Christians,

               <p>The second reason is, because the sanctification of the Sabboth
(the circumstantiall change notwithstanding) doth as well belong
to us in our times, as to the Israelites in theirs; whether we respect
the Reason of the commandement, or the end. The reason is taken
from the example of God himself, who rested the seventh day from
the works of creation. The ends are, 1, that we framing our selvs
to Gods example, after six daies spent in servile works, or works
of acquisition, might rest the seaventh. 2. That we might recount

Where as on the contrarie, no man doth or can neglect the same
without apparent prejudice and wrong to pietie, and goodnes both
in himself, and those under him. To let passe other things, how
easily doth this thought steal into the heart not thoroughly perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of the holynes of this day? what now! There is in the day no
holynes by Gods appointment, save onely, as in it, the publique
sermons of the church with prayer, and thanksgiving are to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented,
and performed: for me to be present at everie sermon,
speciallie made in the cittie, both on the Lords day, and everie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
day of the week, my speciall calling, and worldly affairs will
not permit: Besides, it were verie commodious for me on this
Lords day, to make an end of such or such a work which I have in
hand, to deal in such a busines, to undertake such a journey; And
what should hinder me from so doing? But provided alwaies, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this condition, that look what this day wants, the morrow, or
next day shall plentifully supply: or, if it so fall out, thorough
mine importunate bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>sines, that I bee something more behinde
this week in these things, I will certainly, and at the furthest, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:3102:24"/>
next week be so much the more frequent in them, and so make
God, and my soul amends. And why (as is the guise of ill debters)
will not men desire, and take longer day, even to months, and years
also? considering how on the one side the heart of man is dayly
faster taken &amp; held by the bait of worldly profit, and pleasure; and
on the other, lesse affectioned to Gods holy word, by the lesse fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
hearing of it. And hence, alasse, cometh it to passe, that
true pietie languisheth so much in the most, and with it such other
christian vertues as use to accompanie it. Hence flow those tears
of sorrow, and lamenting, which no true christian casting his eyes
upon the reformed churches can forbear.</p>
               <p>The third Reason is taken from that Apostolicall determination
(wrested by many to a contrarie meaning) Coloss. 2, 16, 17.<note place="margin">Colos. 2, 16. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Let
no man therefore judg you in meat, or drink, or in respect of a feast or
new moone, or sabbaths; which are the shadow of good things to come,
but the bodie is Christ.</hi> Whence it appeareth more then plainly,
that onely those sabboths are abolished by Christs comeing in the
flesh, which were types and figures of Christ to come, of which
sort as there were not a few instituted of God by Moses, so doth
this Apostle here, and elswhere sufficiently declare the abrogateing,
and abolishing of the same by Christ. But that the Sabboth, of
which we now speak comes in that reckoning we plainly deny.</p>
               <p>For, 1. In its primary institution Gen. 2. there can nothing be
found not wholy morall. Let a man haveing many e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ush, if he think to find in it any either shadow of Christ, or
shadow of shadow. If any shall except, that God by Moses did
enjoyn unto the Israelites the sanctification of this day, <hi>that it might
be a signe between him, and Israel throughout their generations,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 31, 13.</note> 
                  <hi>that
they might know, that he is the Lord that doth sanctifie them,</hi> I do an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,

                     </gap>v. p. 186, 187.</note> that <hi>the Reason upon which
God did afterwards commend unto his people, the sanctification of the
sabboth because it was a signe between God and his people, that it was
Iehovah that sanctified them, may be applyed to the times of the new
testament, &amp; further with them also the sabboths sanctification.</hi> 2. Admit
that this use were ceremoniall, and typicall in the fourth comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement,
yet were there no force in the consequence from one end
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3102:25"/>
&amp; use typicall, and ceremoniall, superinduced, and brought in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the precept, to prove the precept it self ceremoniall, and ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall
in the institution. By the same reason it may be affirmed,
that both the Covenant of God made with Abraham, <hi>I will be thy
God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 49, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>and the God of thy seed,</hi> as also <hi>the right of the first born,</hi> for a
double port on, &amp; manie things more of like consideration, were
merely ceremoniall, and typicall, seeing that even unto them also,
were annexed, and that by Gods appointment, divers typicall,
and temporall respects:<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 8, 16, 17.</note> of which notwithstanding none soundly
minded will deny, that the one is euangelicall, and the other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall.
3. Considering that the observation of this sabboth was
either injoyned (as I perswade my self it was from Gen. 2, 1, 2, 3.
&amp; Exod. 16, 26, 30.) to Adam, in innocency and not yet needing
Christ; or at least, that the reason of the institution did fit the
state of innocencie as well, as it did the Israelites afterward I doe
undoubtedly conclude, that the same Sabboth in the primarie,
and essentiall institution thereof is not to come upon their file,
which as <hi>the shadows of future things</hi> had <hi>Christ for the body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, I argue from that premonition of Christ Math. 24, 20.
<hi>Pray that your flight be not in winter nor on the Sabboth.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 24, 20</note> I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
how the most divines both ancient, and later do under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

                     </gap> Mat. 24.</note> as the same authour hath it, <hi>neither the Apostles did observ
the Sabboth day, neither yet were they in Iudea when these things were
done of the Romans: many of them having departed this life, and the
rest (if anie survived) having bestowed themselvs in other places.</hi> But
(with due reverence to them all be it spoken) it seemeth by the
text to be otherwise. For 1. Christ made not this sermon to the
Iewes,<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>. 3.</note> as Iewes, but to his <hi>disciples,</hi> and those alone, and the
same <hi>comming unto him secretly to be taught by him:</hi> whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned
in the same place how that first at the hands of the Iewes in
Iudea, and after, of the Gentiles every where, they should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
intreated for his names sake. v. 3, 4, 9. 25, 26. with Luke 21.
12. Secondly, our Saviour in saying <hi>Pray ye,</hi> makes it plain, that
that he speaks of them, and their associates unto whom he
speakes, to wit, Christians. Lastly how could it be that Christ,
who by his death (now drawing so neare as that there was but a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3102:25"/>
step unto it) was to abrogate, and abolish all Iewish ceremonies,
and shadowes, should to carefully provide for the so religious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of a shadowish, and ceremoniall sabboth: and that not for
a day or two, but for so many yeares after the same his death;
Could anie thing more weightie be spoken by Christ, or which
could more deeply imprint in the hearts of men a religious regard
of the Sabboth, then that it behooved them to obte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

although permitted them of God in case of urgent necessitie,
which might violate and interrupt the publique, and solemn sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification
thereof; It is true then which Chrisostome saith, that
<hi>the Apostles did not observ the Sabboth,</hi> to wit, Iewish: but the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian

               <p>VVE do so repute manie things as indifferent, or mean in

that <hi>all things be done decently, in order,</hi> and <hi>to edification.</hi> The
things then thus accounted indifferent, when they once come into

much more in the things, which appertein to religion, and Gods

Now all things whatsoever in use, either in, or about Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

also for the administring of Baptism, either a fonte or other vessell
to hould water: and so for other adjoints absolutely necessarie for
the administring of the holy things of the Church: or secondly,
they are things civill, and comely: as for example, A convenient

               <p>THere remains <hi>one,</hi> and that <hi>a great matter</hi> of exception against
us, and the same the fountain well nigh of all our calamitie:
to wit, that we seem evill-affected towards the church of England,
and so averse from the same, as that we do no lesse then make a
plain secession, and separation from it.</p>
               <p>I answer, First, that our fayth is not negative: as Papists use to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to the Euangelicall churches, nor which consists in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
of others, and wipeing their names out of the bead-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of churches, but in the edifying of our selvs: neither require we
of anie of ours in the confession of their fayth, that they either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce,
or in one word contest with the church of England,
whatsoever the world clamours of us this way. Our faith is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon the writings of the prophets, and Apostles, in which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o
mention of the church of England is made. We deem it our dutie
what is found in them to <hi>beleev with the heart to righteousnes, and to
confesse with the tongue to salvation.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 10, 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, we accord (as far as the Belgick, and other Reformed
churches) with the Church of England in <hi>the Articles of faith,</hi> and
heads of Christian religion published in the name of that church,
and to be found <hi>in the Harmonie of the Confessions of fayth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, if by the Church be understood the Catholick Church
dispersed upon the face of the whole earth, we do willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that a singular part thereof, and the same visible, and
conspicuous is to be found in the land, and with it, do professe and
practise what in us layes, communion in all things in themselvs law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and done in right order.</p>
               <p>But and if by the word Church be understood a spirituall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

Government, and ministerie ecclesiasticall, with other sacred
institutions of Christ; I cannot but confesse, and professe (though
with great greif) that it is to us matter of scruple, which we cannot
overcome, to give that honour unto it, which is due from the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants

               <p>And, that there may be place left in the eyes of the prudent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
for our defence in this case, so far forth as equitie and reason
will permit, he must once, and again be intreated by me, seriously
to weigh with himself, and in his heart, this one advertizement
following.</p>
               <p>That a man may do a thing truely pleasing, and acceptable to
God, it sufficeth not, that both the door in his person be accepted
of God, the thing done commaunded by God, and that he do it
with good, and holy affection before God, except withall, and first
he be possessed of that state, &amp; condition of life, which may affoard
him a lawfull calling to that work. That a man, though never so
good, with never so good a minde, should exercise the office, or
do (though the best) works of a Magistrate, father of famillie, hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
steward, citizen, or messenger, except he were first lawfully
called, and preferred to the state of a Magistrate, maister of sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for so doing, as on the contrarie he most justly incur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed the censure
of great rashnes, and violation of all order in familie and common
wealth; as <hi>taking unto himself that honour, unto which he was not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

which is the specially state of mans life: so as if anie either as
a Pastour dispence the holy things of the ministeriall Church, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a lawfull pastorall calling going before; or participate in the
same, out of a just, and lawfull Church-state; neither that dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
nor this participation can be warranted, but both the one,
and other are usurpations, and in which is seen not the use, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
of holy things, and confusion of order. And as it behoveth
everie person first to beleev, and know, that he is truly a Christian,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3102:31"/>
and partaker of the grace of Christ, before he can hope to please
God in the performance of this or that particular Christian work;
so doth it also concern everie Christian to provide, that he be first
possessed of a just, and lawfull Church-order, before he so much
as touch with his least finger the holy things of the Church there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
proper, and peculiar. Proper, I say, &amp; peculiar, amongst
which I do not simpl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

both lawfullie may, and necessarily ought to be done, not onely of
Christians though members of no particular church, but even of
Infidels, prophane persons, excommunicates, and any others: as
being that in which no communion spirituall passeth, either eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall,
or personall, between the teacher, &amp; heater, but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to some union ecclesiasticall or personall going before: seeing
that Christian saith comes by hearing the gospell, by faith union, &amp;
from union communion.</p>
               <p>This thus prem sed, I will speak a few things of the Church of
England; not by way of accusation of it, but for our own purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

the greater number, I would to God it could with anie reason be

seveere lawes civill &amp; ecclesiasticall, into the bodie of that church.
And of this confused heap (a few, compared with the rest, godly
persons mingled among) is that nationall church, commonly called
the Church of England, collected, and framed. And such is the
materiall constitution of that church. But if now you demaund of
me, how it is formally constituted; &amp; whether upon profession of
fayth, and repentance (in word at least) made by them of years,
any combynation, and consociation of the members into particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
congregations, (which consociation doth formally constitute
the ministeriall Church, and members thereof, as both the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

and Antichristian apostasie and defection in poperie? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
lesse; but onely by their parrish perambulation, as they call
it, and standing of the houses in which they dwell. Everie subject
of the kingdom dwelling in this or that parrish, whether in cittie,
or countrie, whether in his own or other mans house, is thereby,
<hi>ipso facto,</hi> made legally a member of the same parrish in which that
house is situated: and bound, will he, nill he, fit, or unfit, as with
iron bonds, and all his with him, to participate in all holy things,
&amp; some unholy also in that same parrish church.</p>
               <p>If any object, that yet the minister of the parish may suspend

which may and ought to be said touching the Church of Israel, &amp; its
condition compared with the christian churches seems to deserve the
first place. And touching it; first, the constitution of the Church of
Israel is not to be considered in that whole, much lesse apostaticall, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

               </p>
               <p>I answer; first, that this axiom is not simply true: for if in the church,
or any other convention popular, or in which things passe by voyces,
the greater part hap to exceed the better, the denominat on of that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,

               <p>2. The chaf in that wheat is either of the same wheat, or of other,

the name of an heap of wheat, but of chaf; nor he that sels it for

               <p>4. The things objected from the Apostolicall Churches are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
personall, &amp; accidentall; from which that the churches gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

of the ministeriall church, together with the essentiall admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration
of the Church-policie. And how different these things are,

               <p>Lastly, it is objected, that in the Ch. of England lively faith, &amp; true
