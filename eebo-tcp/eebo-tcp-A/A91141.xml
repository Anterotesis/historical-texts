            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q> Now therefore hearken unto their voice, howbeit yet proteſt ſolemnly unto
them, and ſhew them the judgement of the KING that ſhall reigne over them. And SAMUEL told all the words of the Lord to the people that asked of him a KING.

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>dgement</hi> is a Word of divers ſignifications, and which to take
in this place hath exerciſed Divines, and ſome to flatter Kings
have told them from this place that they have an abſolute right to
their Kingdomes; and for advantage have tranſlated the word
<hi>jus Regis,</hi> the right of the <hi>King,</hi> and juſtified, that no man hath
any property in his goods but as the King pleaſeth: no owner
of ought he hath, but his King by the right God hath given him,
may take from him all hee hath, and diſpoſe of it for his owne uſe; and <hi>Samuel</hi>
hath yeelded ſo much to the King in this word, as children, ſervants goods lands, &amp;c.
we will therefore inveſtigate and diligently ſearch out the multiplicitie of ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
for there is not a word in Scripture of a larger ſignification; for as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
which is the largeſt facultie extends to all things reall, intellectuall, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
ſo judgement which is a part of it hath the ſame extenſion.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in Scripture it is often taken for the act of the mind to judge thoſe things
that Reaſon hath invented. Secondly, for the rule of Reaſon by the which thoſe
things are judged. Thirdly, for the examples that come under thoſe rules. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for the knowledge of cauſes, controverſies, queſtions, doubts, or whatſoever may
be determined by reaſon. Fiftly, for the power to end and quiet whatſoever may
be ſo controverted. Sixtly, it is taken for the office adminiſtration, function or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination
wherein ſuch a power may be executed, Seventhly, for the judgement that
paſſeth from ſuch an Office, as when <hi>Salomon</hi> had judged that intricate cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
two women for a living child, it is ſaid <hi>all Iſrael heard the judgement which
the King judged, and they feared the King, for they ſaw that the wiſedome of God was
in him to doe iudgement,</hi> 1 Kings, 3. 28. Eighthly, for the guilt that deſerves judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Luke 24. 20. crima, iudgement,</hi> is put for the guilt, and ſo <hi>Pilate</hi> teſtifieth,
<hi>Luke 23. 22. Action,</hi> I finde no cauſe to juſtifie my ſentence of death. Ninth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is uſed for the puniſhment it ſelfe, 1 <hi>King. 20. 40. So ſhall thy judgement be,
thy ſelfe hath decided it.</hi> Tenthly, it is taken for the manner or cuſtome that is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by any man. If in this place we take judgement for an act of underſtanding,
and ſo referre it either to God or the King, it may have this ſenſe, a ſinfull people
have asked a King to judge them; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8. 5. and they ſhall have their requeſt with
a witneſſe, I will give over my care to judge them, and leave them to ſuch a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as they would have, the King ſhall deale with them as a Tyrant; for ſo doe
the Kings of the Nations, that they deſire to be like unto. If we take it for an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
appointed of God, then the judgement of God is this, that his ordinance muſt
be obeyed; and ſo he ties them from rebellion and reſiſtance of the King he ſhall
ſett over them; for Kings conſented unto and anoynted of God, may not be reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
at the pleaſure of the People, I meane their perſons, as for their Lawes, being
the judgements of their owne braines againſt God and truth may be deſpiſed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158278:2"/>
as they are no rules to live by, or be followed by any that loves the peace
of his owne concience, or the common peace of the Kingdome, and therfore where
God hath given power of better Iudgment to be followed, wee muſt maintaine it
and ſtand by it, againſt the private Iudgment of the King himſelfe, and it is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
to maintaine the Lawes of the Kingdome againſt all ſuch judgements as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
them, and the diſtinction betweene the perſon of the King and his power
is plaine enough in this judgement; for further then hee is the ordinance of
God I am not to obey him, except you will make all his errors Gods ordinances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and flatter him as BELLARMINE does the Pope, that abſolute obedience is
due unto him. <hi>If the Pope ſhould command vices and prohibit vertues, the Church is
bound to believe that vices are good, and vertues bad, unleſſe ſhe will ſinne againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
de Roman. Pont. l. 4. cap. 5. and theſe elevate this infallible Iudge in his
judgement, that they bring him into the abſolute perfections of <hi>Chriſt. Wee muſt
ſay that in the high Prieſt, the Pope, there is the fulneſſe of all graces; becauſe he alone
giveth a full indulgence of all ſinnes; that this may agree to him, which we ſay of the
chiefe Prince our Lord, that of his fulneſſe all we have received.</hi> de Regimine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipum,
<hi>lib. 3. cap.</hi> 10. and ſo if we will be drunke with the drunken, we muſt reſt
upon the <hi>Kings</hi> judgement, and to oppoſe it is as mortall a ſinne as to reject the
judgement of Antichriſt. But as wee know more obedience is due to his Majeſty
than the Man of ſinne; yet we ſhall be men of ſinne if we adore the judgement in
the Text to be rule enough to yeeld the King all we have, and that he can doe us no
injuſtice in any thing he commands us, or takes from us. If we make it a power,
and that to be his judgement, he ſheweth it in all his actions, for we muſt hold that
juſt which he doth, and complaine of nothing. If we tranſlate it manner and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,
he hath too long beene adviſed by this Text to continue his cuſtomes and ill
Counſels, to keepe us ſtill in ſuch a thraldome of oppreſſion and miſery, and this
Text would no longer be thought of for the purpoſe, but that other that <hi>Samuel</hi> left
in writing, 1 <hi>Sam. 10. 25. And</hi> Samuel <hi>told the people the judgement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

            <p>This judgement of the Kingdome in our bookes of Lawes and Parliaments that
made them, is all we requeſt, and deſire no better proofe of his Majeſties iudgement
than the common judgement of our Kingdome, which two wayes he abandons:
Firſt, in taking the Lawes made in the ſenſe of his owne judgement. Secondly, in
oppoſing all Lawes to be made, except his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ote</hi> muſt be accepted for more than it
is. And we may admire ſeeing his conſent is neceſſary, that his diſſent is more than
neceſſary. His conſent to the making of a Law is neceſſary, and if it make it not for
his purpoſe, he hath another helpe that it ſhall not be made at all, and ſo whatſoever
Law diſpleaſeth him, ſhall never be; and conſequently all Lawes depend abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon the King, and when we ſay the Legiſlative power is in the Parliament, we
doe but mock the judgement of it; for the whole power is in the King, and that
of the Imperiall <hi>Code</hi> is true, <hi>Legum conditor, &amp; interpres ſolus Rex juſtè exiſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur,</hi>
the maker and interpreter of Lawes the King alone is juſtly to be accounted
and reputed. He will not ſay his <hi>Vote</hi> alone can make a Law, or give the ſenſe of
it, and I would gladly know the reaſon what diſinables him. Hee hath ſaid many
things for himſelfe that will prove it. The <hi>Parliament</hi> is meerely admitted to
counſell the King, and that in ſome points, and may not make a tranſition to any
without his grant, and for the tranſgreſſion are liable to impriſonment, as long as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158278:3"/>
the King pleaſeth: and what is his reaſon? becauſe they may not command, as if
there were nothing in the power of the <hi>Parliament</hi> but either counſell or command.
His Majeſtie had need to looke for better Logicians and Philoſophers too, than thus
to miſtake; there is betweene the underſtanding and power to command, the will
to conſent, and the eſſence of the Law lies wholly in the conſent: Counſell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
the matter of the Law in truth, Iuſtice and wiſedome. Lawes ſhould be moſt
true, moſt juſt, moſt wiſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 8. and ſo are all Lawes made by God, and ſuch
ſhould be the Laws of men: but their underſtandings come ſhort of the knowledge
of the Higheſt; yet muſt the counſell thereof be for the Acts, as well as all mens
actions, and <hi>Salomon</hi> commends it from the Councellors when they are many.
3. When they are uſed in all matters of Peace and War. 3. That they eſtabliſh
the Kingdom by Laws. 4. Bring ſafety unto it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 14, &amp; 15. 22 &amp; 20. 18.
&amp; 24. 6. Command no way makes a Law, it is but the effect of it. The whole
Eſſence lies in the conſent of the will, which comes between counſell, and power
to command. He that commands either the thing he knows not, or wills not, is
an egregious fool: firſt, Becauſe he commands obedience to ignorance; ſecondly,
To the thing he wills not. His Majeſty may underſtand that the Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no more, but that He muſt grant them, Their publike counſell, and their
common conſent; and ſeeing the firſt is in the multitude of Counſellors, and the
ſecond in the freedom of many; and where the moſt goes in counſell and conſent,
there is the Law: for one mans counſell and conſent cannot have a greater power
than the moſt, and if it have, it is more than counſell and conſent; which is that
the King calls Command, and by it proves himſelfe the violater of Laws; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they be made, no man may command them, and to command the making and
votes, is violence. There is indeed a Royall confirmation when the Law is made,
to encreaſe the Authority of it, but to the Law is not eſſentiall, but accidentall, as
we ſhall ſhew in another place.</p>

that God had appointed him not to ſeeke aſſes but men, 1. Sam. 9. 20. He in his
ſimplicitie or hypocriſie excuſeth himſelfe by three arguments, <hi>v.</hi> 21. Firſt that
his Tribe was the ſmalleſt in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> having not yet recovered that loſſe and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of their men, which they received in the battell with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which was enough
to make the Tribe infamous, and all the Tribes to remember an old injurie, (and
ſcorne, as ſome did, to receive any Ruler from them.) Secondly, his fathers houſe
was of ſmall account in that Tribe. Thirdly, himſelfe the leaſt in his fathers houſe.
<hi>Modeſtè regna recuſavit,</hi>—he modeſtly refuſed the Kingdome, as Biſhops do,
(viz) <hi>Epiſcopare nolo</hi>—I will not be a Biſhop. But it may be ſaid of them, as it

<hi>Veracitèr ſe excuſavit de honore Regni,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iunius,</hi>—hee did in good
earneſt excuſe himſelfe of the honour of the Kingdome. And truely his reaſons
of refuſall are pithie and well heaped together, and his concluſion an earneſt and
vehement interrogation, <hi>Wherefore then ſpeakeſt thou ſo unto me? David</hi> was
alſo anointed by <hi>Samuel</hi> not long after <hi>Sauls</hi> creation, and yet lived many yeers
under <hi>Saul</hi> as a ſon and ſervant. He was anointed at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> 1. Sam. 16. 4. and
many yeers after that crowned at <hi>Hebron.</hi> Firſt by his owne Tribe, 12. Sam. 2. 4.
Secondly, by all <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſeaven yeers after, 2. Sam. 5. 3. And heere <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to
be anointed againe, as an happy ſigne that God and man joyfully conſpired together
to make him King, and that he was as carefull to receive the conſent of the people,
as the Unction of God, and it is moſt certaine to be the minde of God, that Kings
muſt neither lay hold of their crownes, nor make lawes nor uſe Armes, but by the
free conſent of their people. He that writ the obſervations taxeth the King that
with the originall grant of heaven, he makes no mention of the conſent of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and in truth it is the errour of our King to think he holds all from God, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
from his Subjects: with God he joyns the Law, and that is his ſecond errour,
if he underſtand it of the Laws of the Kingdom, for they are made by common
conſent; and if he have his Royalty by them, then the people give it him: and
the Obſervator ſayes truely, That the Law by the which Kings raigne, is the pacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and agreement that any Politicall Corporation or Society of men make with
him, even of thoſe that are pricked by God, and declared from heaven to be his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
as <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> are; His Prophet anoints them both, and then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
being certified of Gods will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are not forced to follow their guide, but have their
freedom to contract and covenant with him. <hi>Abner</hi> in his Meſſage to <hi>David;</hi>
ſpeaks of both rights, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 12. Firſt, That God had by his anointing, given
him the Kingdom. Secondly, That he could not take it by that right, without a
league, and he requires <hi>David</hi> to make ir with him, and is confident to bring him
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158278:4"/>
in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> upon the ſame condition, and does it, who firſt acknowledge Gods
grant, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 1. 2. Secondly, Require their own right. <hi>v. 3. Saul</hi> had done <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
wrong in taking from him his wife, and therefore juſtly requires to have her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored,

though ſhe had an husband, yet he had no right in her againſt the lawfull owner.
<hi>David</hi> owns not the Kingdom and <hi>Michal</hi> alike, which may teach the King ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
errour, that will have all our Nation to be his without conſent, as his own wife
is his, and the Parliament ſhould do him wrong to take her from him, or the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers
to hold her where ſhe is; but they may as lawfully keep his Kingdom from
him, as <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, without his league, and compact with them: If he
ſay he hath made it with them, then let him ſo hold it, or not complain of them for
holding it as he doth. The Obſervator hath done him no wrong; but they that
would make him hold his Monarchy by an abſolute right, which in true love they
cannot perſwade him unto, but in extreme hatred to our Realm and Religion,
knowing our Parliament ſo faſt ſet againſt them, and yet for him in his due right,
which is the way to make him the moſt honourable Monarch in the world, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
was; and the other is to make him like <hi>Saul,</hi> a Tyrant. He meddles no further
with the Obſervations as good for him, but onely in this, That the beginning of his
book deſtroyes Monarchy, which at the firſt reading I thought he did; and ſome
words are da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous, to make the <hi>King</hi> wholly dependant upon the people; but I deal
plainly (as my title is) That he is Gods anomted, and ſo <hi>iure perſonae,</hi> in the right of
his perſon, exempt from all men; but he is the peoples appointed, &amp; ſo <hi>iure Coronae,</hi>
in the right of his crown, can do nothing without them; and this is our preſent caſe.
The Parliament would ſecure the perſon of the King, and yet maintain his Lawes
which good intention of theirs if he cannot ſee it, they muſt ſorrow for him, but not
ſacrifice the whole Kingdom to his will. It is a wholſom Maxime in the Law, That
<hi>the King may do onely that which is iuſt;</hi> and a falſe Aphoriſm, <hi>That all is iuſt he
doth.</hi> A King may abhorre to do evill, and as much abhor to be limited to do good,
It is not diſhonourable to a Prince to do his duty, but he counts it moſt ignoble to be
under any Law or Obligation: <hi>David</hi> is bound not to touch the Lords Anointed,
and was not <hi>Saul</hi> by the ſame reaſon obliged not to hurt <hi>David? David</hi> arms him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his men to defend themſelves, but not to kill <hi>Saul;</hi> was it not a ſin for
<hi>Saul</hi> to take up Arms to kill his ſubject? <hi>David</hi> gives way to the people to crown
him, and pleads not his Coronation by any other Right; and ſhall men that are
more weakly declared to be Kings, preſume they have it becauſe they are heirs? It
were injuſtice to deny him his Coronation, that hath it by divine Unction and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation,
and yet by violence of the peoples Right, he ſhall offend as much on the
other hand. Votes in Parliament have the moſt vigorous power in them to make
Laws; and here alſo the Maxime is, That <hi>ſumma poteſtas fundata eſt in voluntate,</hi>
The chiefe power is placed in the will, yea, all power that is free; as for coactive
power, that is over mens bodies, and may be found in beaſts that can bear down
one another. Now I demand what power His Majeſty would have in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
coercive or directive, violent or voluntary, by counſell or command, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
or compulſion? There is no power to force men to Laws; but in the Forreſt,
as among Beaſts, the Lion will be their King, and the Fox is the freeſt, and wiſely
fore-ſees that all foot-ſteps that go forward finde no return, and therefore wiſely
keeps himſelf out of the Lions Den. Will His Majeſty make his Parliament the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158278:4"/>

that hath as much power to conſent as the King himſelf? will you ſay power? I muſt aske

man in Parliament is as free, as the King to give his Vote, and no Law can be made without
conſent ſo qualified, and he that will command the making of a Law, is to his Subjects as

               </gap>ore the whole power of the Law is in the King, and the Parliament men are but
Cypners, or if they be to counſell the King, they may not conſent, to the Law, or if they may,
it muſt not be to the making of it, or if to that, it muſt be to the Kings conſent, not as conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
with the reſt, but coactive to all, for one may conſent to another, as in the Raigne
of Edw. the third, the Commons deſired they might not give counſell in a commotion, but that
the King with his Counſell would give it, as the more knowing men, and at the laſt they
gave both counſell and conſent, and the King would ſuffer nothing to be done without them,
and he ſays, Lex notiſſima, et provida circumſpectione ſtabilita, &amp;c. It is a Law well known
and by the moſt provident circumſpection eſtabliſhed, that all men ſhould conſent to that
which concerned them, now if the Kings conſent be mandatory in the Law to them that make
it, as well as they which obey it, they are not free but muſt be obſervant to do as the King
commands them, a thing never heard of in Iſrael, as I ſhall ſhew in the ſequell in all their
Court. As the Parliament ſuffers ſo does the whole Kingdom with them, and that for a
Militia denyed to them and granted to Oppreſſors. The Parliament hath made it plain to
us that the Commiſſion of Array is not warranted by any Act of Parliament, and I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to reaſon from the ſame as the King does, that the Ordinance of Parliament is not onely
without any one warrantable Preſident of former times, as he believeth, but as he is well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
void in Law, His Majeſtie hath loſt by his Argument in all the parts of it. Firſt we
know no preſident warrantable that are alledged againſt the Parliament, for it hath power
to repeale Laws, which His Majeſty hath not, and his Commiſſion of Array being repealed
he cannot revive it, and to walke by preſidents as he doth, is againſt Law, and to carry them
to the conqueſt, is againſt his contract, and to ſhew he means to rule by the ſword and not
by his Laws. Secondly, he ſays an Ordinance in Parliament is void in Law, and of this He
is well aſſured, and I ſuppoſe his reaſon is becauſe it wants his conſent; To this I can anſwer
ſtrongly, that his conſent is no ſufficient reaſon either to make it void or of force and value<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Not void in Law becauſe it hath the conſent of the moſt, and in that conſiſts the be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng of
the Law; for if his conſent cannot make it a Law, when the moſt are againſt it, his diſſent
cannot make it void when moſt are for it, for contrariorum contraria eſt ratio, for if his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative
Vote prevaile not againſt the moſt to make a Law, his negative Vote cannot make
it void when moſt have conſented to it, and if His Majeſty deſire to learn from the wiſeſt,
even God himſelf, he ſhall ſoon be inſtructed, that the Almightie granted no ſuch negative
Vote to any King in Iſrael, or any other judge in any Conſultation or Counſell, but the
Votes alwayes went with the moſt, even from the Counſell of 3 Iudges to ſeventy one or
ſeventy three.</p>
            <p>The Notation of a Counſell is witty, Conſilium dictum a communi intentione, eo quod in

them, Novel. 131. cap. 1. and to might his Majeſty, if ill counſell did not perſwade him,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>elf, what arguments they be. The Parliament is Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum,
the whole entire body of the Kingdom repreſentative: and it is moſt lively in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
of which the King being no part yet ſhould love it as his own Body.</p>
            <p>The Lords are a part too of the Parliament; and I would not be ſo nice as ſome are, to ſay
the Repreſentative body is onely of the people, and not at all of the King and Lords, as if
the counſell were more vulgar and baſe than great and honourable, as many take occaſion to
reproach it; but ill tongues in time may be taught better language: I ſhall think of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
in the parts, and they make but one whole body. Now we have a Rule, That Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grum
in majus membris, totum partibus. Hereupon is that rule of the King and his Kingdom,
That the King is major ſingulis, minor univerſis, and therefore the ſupremacy of the King, is
not above the ſupremacy of the Parliament: What then have we two ſupremacies, and one
above another? I anſwer, we have no ſupreme King but one, neither have we any ſupreme
Councell but one; and as his Majeſty hath no ſubject above him, ſo let him ſuffer no Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
to be above this, or take counſell from any other. Secondly, let him think himſelf to be
leſſe than his whole Councell, and that his ſubjection unto it, is not to be the ſubject of his
ſubjects, but a ſervant with them for our good: It is no ill ſtill that God gives him to be his
Miniſter for good. Thirdly, the falling away of the parts of the Parliament, as long as the
whole is not diſſolved, ſtill it retains the name and nature of the whole, and therefore the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
removed have left their power in the whole, and we are obliged to maintain that, though
the deſertors of it periſh; I except none but your Majeſty, and that not in flattery, but good
reaſon, as I ſhall ſhew before I leave my Diſcourſe of the preſent Affaires. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the parts one with another, as the King with the Lords and Commons, and them
as Subjects, and I muſt ſay Rex eſt Major ſingulis ſubditis: but put them into a Body that
may truly be called a Parliament, though many parts depart, yet as long as the Body is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſolved
we muſt hold it for our greateſt Counſell, follow the directions of it; which to kill
their King they have to, not ever will conſent unto but to kill them that would deſtroy all,
and have begun to do it: I hope he that loves his King, his Parliament, himſelf, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
to be valiant to the death.</p>
