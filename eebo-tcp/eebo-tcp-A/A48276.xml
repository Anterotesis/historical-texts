            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce our last to your Lordship, the Condition of our affaires is not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle changed, for on Munday last, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice of Prince <hi>Ruperts</hi> Marching from <hi>Knaresbrough</hi> towards us: we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and acordingly drew out the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to have met him, and for that end did march that same night to Long <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston-Moor,</hi> about 4. miles of the west side of <hi>York,</hi> but he having notice thereof, did passe with his Armie at <hi>Borrough Bridge,</hi> and so put the River of <hi>Ouse</hi> between him and us: whereby we were disena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to oppose his passage into <hi>Yorke,</hi> the Bridge we built on the west side of the Towne being so weake, that we durst not adventure to transport our Armies upon it: This made us resolve, the next morning to March to <hi>Tadcaster,</hi> for stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61015:3"/>
of his passage Southward: and the Armies being so far on their way, as the van was within a mile of it, notice was sent to us by our Horsemen, who were upon our Rear, that the Prince his Armie, Horse and Foote, were advanced the length of <hi>Long Marston Moore,</hi> and was ready to fall upon them; Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we recalled the Armie, and drew them up on a Corne-Hill, upon the South-side of the Moore, in the best way we could, so far as the straitnesse of the fields, and other disadvantages of the place could permit; before both armies were in a readinesse it was seven a clocke at night, about which Time they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced the one to the other: Whereupon followed a very hot Encounter, for the space of three hours, wherof (by the great blessing and good providence of God) the issue was the totall Routing of the Enemies armie, the losse of all their Ordnance, to the Number of 20. Their ammunition and Baggage, about 100. Colours, and ten thousand armes, there
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61015:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were killed upon the place about 3000. of them, whereof many are chief Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and 1500 prisoners taken, amongst whom there are above 100. Officers, in which number, is sir <hi>Charls Lucas,</hi> Lieut: Generall to the Marquesse of <hi>Newcastles</hi> Horse, <hi>Porter</hi> Major Generall, and Major Gen: <hi>Tillier,</hi> besides diverse Colonells, Lieutenant Colonells, and Majors; Our losse, God be praised, is not very great, being only of one Leiutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell, some few Captaines; and about two or three hundred common Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The Prince in a great distraction, with a few Horsemen, and almost no foote, marched the next morning from <hi>Yorke</hi> Northwards: We are now lying down again in our old Leaguer before <hi>Yorke,</hi> which we are in hopes in a few dayes to gaine; and are resolved to send a great part of our Cavalrie after prince <hi>Rupert</hi>: we having nothing to adde, but as the glory of all the Successe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto God, and the benefit wee hope, shall redound to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61015:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
we have appointed this next Sabbath for a day of publike thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thorowout the Armies; So your Lordships would appoint a day for the same to be kept throughout the kingdom, and Notice sent to us thereof, that wee may altogether joyne in it, and we shall continue,</p>
