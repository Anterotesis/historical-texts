            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Position of Dr. <hi>Preston,</hi> Master of <hi>Emanuel</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> Concerning the Irresistiblenesse of Converting Grace.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is often professed by <hi>Arminius,</hi> that he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes as much unto Grace as ever any other, that there is nothing said by others concerning the efficacy of Grace, which is not also affirmed by himselfe; yea, that he acknowledges whatsoever that be thought or imagined for the opening and setting forth of the power of Grace, and that therefore he is mis-reported by those that render him injurious to the grace of God, and one that attributes too much to free-will. You will finde in <hi>Augustine,</hi> that <hi>Pelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> professes as much concerning himselfe. And yet in the mean time, This is true, that, if <hi>Arminius</hi> his opinion stand good, all this Efficacy of Grace, which he so much magnifies and amplifies in words, depends on the will of man, in regard that by vertue of its native liberty, it may receive or reject this grace, use it or not use it, render it effectuall or vain. Neither can it be otherwise, unlesse we abolish the liberty of the Will, and destroy those properties, which are inseparable from the Nature of it.</p>
            <p>Lest that any should suspect that I fasten upon him an opinion, which is not his, let his words be read, which may be found in a Treatise intituled <hi>Decl. sent. Arm.</hi> pag. 181. and they are these, <hi>Grace</hi> (saith Arm.) <hi>is so described in Scripture, as that it may be
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57361:4"/>
resisted, received in vaine, that man may hinder his assent unto it, deny to co-operate with it, and therefore an irresistible power, and working, is not to be attributed unto Grace.</hi> Now, if <hi>Arminius</hi> in these words do not pull downe what he seemed to build in the former, let others judge.</p>
            <p>I know the <hi>Arminians</hi> cavill about the word <hi>Irresistible,</hi> used by <hi>Calvin,</hi> and other of our Divines, and cry out, That by this opinion of ours, men are turned into stocks, acting not at all in the work of Conversion, but, as stones, are acted and moved by another; yea, that men doe not believe, but God in man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and believes.</p>
            <p>But you shall easily see how falsly these things are charged upon us, and how truly we say that <hi>Arminius</hi> derogates more from the grace of God, than the Jesuites; If you will give me leave faithfully to set downe their opinions, and briefly to compare them together: For in these foure things shall my Discourse consist. First, I will repeat the Opinion of our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries. 2. I will explain our own Opinion. 3. I will adde Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for the confirmation of our Opinion. 4. I will answer the Objections, at least, one or two of the chief of them, whereby our opinion is opposed.</p>
            <p>As to the first, Some <hi>Iesuites</hi> affirme, That Sufficient grace, as to means is given to all, even to Reprobates; but Effectuall grace, which shall certainly and infallibly attaine its end, is given onely to the Elect. If we aske wherein they place the efficacy of this Grace; they answer, Not in a physicall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Will, but in a morall perswasion, and that not of any kinde, but congruous (as they call it) that is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion offered with such circumstances of Place, Person, and Time, as to which, God (who from everlasting knowes all the inclinations of the Will) foresees the will shall certainely and infallibly yeild unto. They distinguish therefore between Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and Effectuall grace, that is, those whom God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen unto life, by vertue of that absolute Decree he intends to offer unto them, not onely sufficient perswasion, but at a fit time, when he knowes that the person so called, will undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obey the call of God: but those whom he hath not chosen, to them also he offers perswasion sufficient, but not at a time so
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57361:4"/>
fit, and when he certainly foresees that they will not obey the divine calling.</p>
            <p>From whence we gather, that this is the opinion of the <hi>Iesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That effectuall vocation doth follow, and not precede the decree of election, and consequently, that the decree is absolute, not conditionall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the same and equall grace is not granted to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and unconverted; but that which is given to the elect is alwayes more effectuall, although not in respect of it felfe, yet in respect of the suitablenesse, which it hath unto the will of the man to be converted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That all to be converted, shall be certainly and infallibly converted, and that onely by the power of <hi>Converting Grace;</hi> but others certainely also, and infallibly, shall not be converted, not onely because they will not, but in regard of the defect of congruity in the grace offered. Which Grace, although as to the substance of it (as they say) is sufficient, so that by the help of it men might be converted (if they would) yet as to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances it is not sufficient, because it is not offered at a suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time. For thus <hi>Suarez:</hi> Morall perswasion, though abundant, is not sufficient. A physicall or reall determination is too much, for it taketh away liberty, but the whole efficacy of grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a Certainty, Congruity, or Conveniency.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Arminians,</hi> although they seem to assert, that the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, progresse, and perfection of every good work, is to be attributed unto Grace, so that no man (without preventing, accompanying, and following Grace) is able to think, will, or act any thing that is good: yet when they plead, that all this is done after a manner resistible, so as to leave it in the power of the Will, to use or not to use that grace unto conversion. It is apparent, that they do onely in pretence, and not heartily and really attribute these things unto grace. This will easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by a distinct opening of the opinion of the <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. First they grant, That the Understanding is irresistibly illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated by Divine Grace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the Affections also are excited and renewed by the same Grace irresistibly.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57361:5"/>
3. That the Will is also so stirred up by assisting Grace, that it is now disintangled, whereas before it was incumbred; now freed, whereas it was before bound; now awakened, whereas before it was asleepe. But that the Will is renewed, and by a reall operation inclined unto good, by God; or that any quality, or habit of holinesse is infused into the Will, by vertue of which it is inclined more to good works than to evill, the <hi>Arminians</hi> utterly deny. Because, that if any of this were granted, the naturall liberty of the Will (as they suppose) were destroyed; unto which liberty they hold it essentiall that the Will be free to act, or not to act, when all things required unto its acting are in being. Let their very words be seene, <hi>The Confer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at Hague,</hi> pag. 298. Into the Minde (say they) is infused a habit of knowledge, into the Affections holinesse is infused, as Hope, or Feare, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But such an infusion cannot be made into the Will, because of its nature, freedome to will good or evil. Hence (as they say) First there is a morall perswasion stirred up in the Understanding, but by the help of Preventing Grace: Secondly, To this perswasion the Will may assent, but by the help of Concomitant Grace: And thirdly, This assent may be produced into act, but by vertue of Subsequent Grace. But to all this they diligently annex this caution, although the Will can do none of these things without the help of Grace, yet it is in the power of the Will to resist this Grace, to put it by, to neglect it or cast it away, if it please. Neither can it be otherwise, if the naturall properties of the Will be preserved. Thus is the state of the question explained by <hi>Ioannes Arnoldus,</hi> against <hi>Bogerman,</hi> p. 263. allowing all those which God useth in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king our conversion; yet conversion it selfe doth so far remaine in our power, that we may not be converted.</p>
            <p>This opinion being asserted, the <hi>Arminians</hi> are constrained to defend these Positions more false than those of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They defend a conditionall Decree grounded on the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of Faith, for if the Will, supposing all the actions of God toward it, may convert or not, believe or not; it is necessary that God first foresee who will believe, and who not, before he can choose some to life, and appoint others to wrath. But the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57361:5"/>
Jesuites hold the Decree to be absolute, and Faith to be an effect or fruit following thereupon.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Jesuites grant that more grace, as to the manner of dispensing it, is bestowed upon those who are converted, than upon those who are not. The Arminians contrariwise, that more grace (as to the manner) is often conferred upon the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted than the converted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence also the Arminians do ordinarily cast the principle of Conversion in part, upon the will of man (whatsoever they professe in words to the contrary) whereas the Jesuites attribute it wholly to the good pleasure and will of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence also the Arminians hold, That converting and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace is not peculiar to converted and chosen Ones, but to be common also unto others. But the Jesuites confesse, That congruous or suitable vocation (in which they place the efficacy of Grace) is peculiar unto the Elect.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Jesuites judge, That all those, whom the Holy-Ghost intended to convert, are certainely and infallibly converted. The Arminians utterly deny it; whence they are commonly bold to say, That the Holy-Ghost may be resisted, even then when it works upon a man with intention of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
            <p>These things being premised, I will now briefly lay downe what our opinion is: But that our judgement may be throughly understood; we must know that the conversion of a man is perfected in these four degrees:</p>
            <p n="1">1. God infuseth into the whole Soule, and so into the Will, a habit or quality of holinesse, renewing it, and making it, of evill good, of unwilling willing; by which meanes, that which belongs to the nature of the Will, is preserved entire, but that which was corrupt is rectified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From this quality so infused, presently there arise in the Will, certaine imperfect inclinations, preventing the notice of reason, like unto those which the School-men call the very first Motions of the heart: For by these the will doth not compleatly, and effectually will that which is good, but is onely initially, and incompleatly inclined to those good workes which please God, from whence such acts may be called, not so much willings, as wishings and wouldings.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:57361:6"/>
3. Those inclinations are presented as an object to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which weighs them, debates them, takes counsel about them; and at length, when it hath by its ultimate, and conclusive dictates, confirmed them, propounds them to the will as to be chosen.</p>
            <p n="4">4. After those initiall inclinations, arising from infused Grace, have passed the censure of the understanding, and are allowed by the preceding judgement thereof; then at length doth the Will put forth a compleat and effectual willingnesse, from which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version immediately doth follow, or rather that very willing is the conversion of a man unto God. In these four things is the conversion of man accomplished:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Here first the reception of the habit of Grace infused is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed irresistible, but neither free nor voluntary, for the Will is meerly passive in the receiving, and therefore exercises not its freedome.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, The inclination arising or flowing from Grace is irresistible, for it proceedes from the Will, formed and endued with Grace, not in a moral, but physicall way: that is, not in a way of perswasion, but reall operation: But it is voluntary, for it is produced by the Will in an active way; yet it is not free, because one of the requisites to freedom, which is the foregoing judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the understanding, is yet wanting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, The judgement of the understanding, concerning this initial and imperfect Inclination, is irresistible, For the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing being enlightened by Divine Grace, doth irresistibly and infallibly approve this Inclination, and it is so far free as the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is capable of freedom.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, When the Understanding hath put forth its last and conclusive dictate, then the Will (as I said) puts forth a compleat and executive willing, which is actuall Conversion unto God: And this Willing is both irresistible and free, and so Conversion it selfe is both free and irresistible. 1. It is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible, because it necessarily followes the reall Inclination of the Will preceding, and the last dictate of the Understanding ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and confirming it. It is also most properly free, for it hath those things which are required unto liberty, seeing the Will therein is not passive, but active. 2. It is not brought forth,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57361:6"/>
but in the way of morall perswasion, that is, not without the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding judgement of the understanding, weighing on each part what is best to be done; for every active and compleat Willing, which hath had such a deliberation and determination of the Understanding, concerning an object offered, going before it, must be called truly and properly free. And for that definition of freedome whereby that is said to be free, which supposing all things requisite to action, may either act or not; t is a definition setled only in the brains of the Jesuits; and neither hath foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the Fathers, nor the antient Philosophers, nor yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the more ancient School-men, whom yet <hi>Suarez</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to wrest to the maintenance of his opinion.</p>
            <p>So have you our opinion; according to which, a man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted irresistibly, and yet freely, which that you may yet more fully understand, these Axiomes follow from it, which are contrary to those of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> and <hi>Arminians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. We do not say, that Free-will, or the faculty of the Will, as to spirituall things, is half alive and half dead, as the <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> would have it, <hi>Confer. Hag.</hi> p. 300. or that it is like the power of moving in one who is bound in fetters; or as the faculty of seeing in one who is shut up in a dark place, as the Papists say: But we hold, That the faculty of the Will, as it respects a truly spirituall good, is wholly extinct, as the power of life in a dead man of motion in a slaine man, of sight in him whose eyes are put out.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They also defend, That the Will is onely stirred up by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or assisting Grace, knocking at the doore of it, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing it, not that it is changed by habituall Grace, healing and renewing it: For these are their words, <hi>There is no reason why morall Grace, that is morally perswading, may not make a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man spirituall.</hi> But we suppose, that the will is quickned and renewed by the infusion of habituall Grace, that is of a new quality imprinted on the Will, which is as an inward principle enlivening and changing the Will, from whence all good incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and operations do proceed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They hold, That the Will is otherwise concerned in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, than in an active way, We maintain, that the Will in the first act of Conversion is partly passive, and partly active, that is,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57361:7"/>
first Passive, then Active, and so it worketh together with God, not partly by a naturall ability, and partly by a supernaturall strength, received from grace, passing by, but by vertue of a power wholly supernaturall, which is conferred by infused and quickning grace, according to that of <hi>Augustine,</hi> To will, is of our selves, but to will well, both partly and wholly, is of grace.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Arminians think, That the quickening grace of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and whatsoever else on Gods part is required to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of a man, is communicated as well to the Reprobate, as to the Elect, and that with intention of their salvation, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God should deale deceitfully and hypocritically with them when he offers the Word unto them. Let their own words be read, <hi>Coll. Hag.</hi> p. 308. But we hold, That the quickning grace of God, which is fit for the healing and renewing of the Will, is peculiar to the Elect, and is imparted to them by vertue of the divine Decree, to the end they might be saved: But 'tis denyed to others, and that our God hath not determined to save them</p>
            <p n="5">5. They say, That the Will stirred up by quickning grace, may act or not act, turne to God or not; but otherwise it were not free: for they hold liberty to stand in this, That granting all things required, or all the actings of God, the Will may act or not, whence is that of <hi>Corvinus</hi> against <hi>Tilenus,</hi> pag. 337. Grace doth not so furnish the Will with strength, but that it alwayes remaines in the power of the Will to use it or not use it. We, on the contrary, say, That the VVill cannot resist or withstand the reall motion proceeding from Grace, nor the divine perswasion offered to it by an enlightened understanding, but doth necessarily follow the guidance of God, according to that of S. <hi>Augustine, Free-will cannot resist God in the work of salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. They say, That the Will excited by Grace doth properly work together with God, is a co-ordinate joynt-cause, a partial Concomitant-cause, and hath such an influence into the effect, that if it be withheld, the effect in no wise can follow. We, on the contrary, say, That the Will, indeed, doth co-operate, but as a cause every way subordinate and wholly subject to the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57361:7"/>
of God as the principall agent, insomuch that it cannot properly be called a co-worker; but rather it acts as it is acted, move as it is moved, and being first turned into God, it turnes it selfe unto God.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They deferd, That God cannot convert us in an irresistible way, unless w ebe turned into stocks and blocks, and so being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a continuall motion, we act nothing, but God all in us. On the other side, we say, that stocks and stones have no power to act, being acted; but that men are free A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, and therefore have a power by vertue of which they act, being acted by God, and therefore may be said truly to act, and turne themselves; for the will being changed from evill unto good, and of unwilling made willing, hath in it selfe an inward principle of willing well; from whence the dominion of its owne act, whereby it turnes unto God, may properly be given unto it; for although the grace of God is the principle by which, yet the will of man is the principle which worketh all. In like manner, although God be the first and totall efficient cause of conversion, yet the Will is the next efficient cause, and totall also in the kinde of second causes; therefore, as the effects are wont to be attributed unto second and created causes, although they act by vertue of the first cause, so conversion is most properly to be attributed unto the Will, although it act wholly in the strength of God and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Lastly, They deny, That the unresistibleness of divine Grace, and the liberty of mans Will, can stand together. But we say, That Conversion is irresistible, and yet free. But we distinguish concerning the irresistiblenesse of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is one kinde of Irresistiblenesse, whereby regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace infused from God, is received by the Will; and this irresistiblenesse of reception, we confesse, cannot stand with liberty</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another kind, whereby the inclination putting on to spiritual good doth flow from, after a physicall or reall manner, from the Will fashioned by Grace: and this motion (we say) comes from the Will irresistibly and voluntarily, but not freely.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:57361:8"/>
3. There is an Irresistiblenesse, whereby the Will assents unto this Physicall motion proceeding from Grace, as also to the perswasion of the Understanding, approving of it, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily or certainely: And this kinde of Irresistiblenesse, we say, may very well stand with Liberty, because it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in it selfe those two things in which Liberty stands.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the Will in putting forth this last act of willing, is active, and not passive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Because the morall perswasion, or judgement of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, thinking that the conversion propounded, that is, either the taking or refusing the object offered, is in the power of man, hath gone before. For we hold, That whatsoever is done in the act of Conversion, either by a meere Reception, or by a physicall (or powerfull) Determination, is not free. But that every willing is only so far free as it is produced in an active way, and flowes from a reasonable perswasion; and that upon this ground, that reason lies indifferent to things opposite, that is, Reason onely is the root and foundation of all Liberty; from whence it followes, that every act of the Will, into which Reason hath its influence, is most free.</p>
            <p>You see now what our opinon is, which we have beene the longer in opening, because the explication of it is its chiefe confirmation, and the confutation of the contrary. Besides, it is a very difficult thing to expresse what the <hi>Arminians</hi> hold in this dispute, because they cover and wrap up their opinion in so doubtfull and specious words.</p>
            <p>There yet remaine the Arguments, by which our opinion is so to be confirmed, which I shall be brief in: Two things are to be proved:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That qualityes or habits may be infused into the Will, which they deny, because they suppose, that such an infusion doth utterly destroy and take away the nature and liberty of the Will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That this habituall and quickning Grace, being thus infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we are converted by God in a certaine way, and by us irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> I That there is such an infusion of Grace renewing
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57361:8"/>
and healing the Will, inclining and determining it to one of the two opposites in the act of Conversion, appears by this, That all Divines hold, that there is in the Will an habituall aversion from God, and an habituall turning to sensible and carnall things: But this habituall corruption of nature cannot be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the sole help of Grace, meerely exciting: For, as corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, so spirituall diseases are not cured, but by contraries; and therefore habituall corruption cannot be changed but by an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual quality, imprinted on the Will. <hi>Prosp.</hi> therefore saith right, <hi>The inward sense is not opened to doe spirituall things, untill the foundation of Faith, and fervour of Love is planted in the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Unlesse it be granted, That such an habituall Grace is infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into the Will, by which it is inclined to good after a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall manner; there will be found no formall principle in man, from whence good acts may be produced: for as in corporall things no man fees, unlesse he first have eyes; nor heares, unless he hath eares: so in spirituall things, no man sees unlesse God hath first given him eyes to see; nor hears, unlesse he hath given him eares to heare. By the same reason no man can turne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to God, unlesse he have a new Heart; that is, a new Will to turne and love God: For what meanes that Scripture, <hi>An evil Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit, a good Tree bringeth forth good Fruit?</hi> But that we should thereby understand, that the Will must first be made good, before it can performe any spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall work, which must necessarily be done, not by exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or perswading Grace, but by Grace healing and regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Let it be supposed, that the Will deformed by habituall corruption, could, by the meere help of exciting Grace, be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the putting forth of spirituall acts: Yet would this be contrary to that sweetnesse of Divine Providence, which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all Divines. For God should not sweetly put forward the Will so disposed, but in a forced way hurry it on to its work, which its own inclination is yet averse from. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more meet, to place in the Will a certaine habituall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension unto spirituall good, which it may performe, not by vertue of exciting grace, but from the infusion of habitual grace.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57361:9"/>
4. It is confessed by all, that the Will unrenewed hath no principle in it truly spirituall; and yet they will not deny, that this act of turning unto God, is truly spirituall and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall, but how the Will, onely excited by motioning Grace, and not changed by Grace regenerating, should be placed in the rank of supernaturall agents, I understand not.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I will aske what is that which makes a man truly holy and Godly, not simply acts good and godly; for (as the Philosopher sayes) <hi>Acts doe not denominate the subject to be such:</hi> it must therefore be some habit, by vertue of which a man is called godly and holy: But that habit is not placed in the irrationall part of the soule, for that is not properly capable of Vertue or Vice, but onely by Participation: to wit, so farre as the rationall part of the soule redounds upon it. But if it must be placed in the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall part, it must not be in the understanding; for no man is good or evill, onely because he understandeth good and evill things (as <hi>Aquinas</hi> very well observes) but therefore is one called a good or evill man, because he wills those things which are good and evill. It remaineth therefore, that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of holinesse cannot be placed any where but in the will, as being the subject most properly capable, both of habituall holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as also of habituall corruption and rebellion, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereunto.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the Will be indifferent in it selfe, and equally inclined unto either part; whence is that facility and promptitude in working? for as by evil actions the Will contracts a stain where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is habitually disposed unto evill; so by good actions the soule is touched with a better tincture, whereby it is habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually inclined unto good, and that setting aside the operation of moving and exciting Grace.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All Divines of better note acknowledge, That charity, or the love of God, is not a meere act, but a permanent habit; but that habit hath no place in the understanding, because it is an affection; nor in the sensitive appetite, which cannot be raised to spirituall love. It remaineth therefore, that it be peculiar to the Will, and so the Will to be most properly capable of habits, and of habituall Grace.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57361:9"/>
8. Lastly, How absurd is it to grant the whole man to be dead in sinne, so that it can no way reach unto any good truly spirituall: and yet to defend, that the Will, which is the very leader of the soule, the driver of all faculties, the Lady and Queene of humane acts, and that principle, which impaireth spirituall good or evill, unto all actions which men performe. How absurd (I say) is it, to hold that this faculty was neither spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall before the Fall, nor carnall after the Fall, but to be utterly void, both of the corruption brought in by the first fault, and of spirituall gifts infused in the regeneration of man.</p>
            <p>It were easie to overwhelme this Opinion with more absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; but these shall suffice. By all these things it is apparent enough, that a new quality or habit of grace is infused into, or impressed upon the Will, which is earnestly denyed by the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as hath been before proved by their own words.</p>
            <p>But who so yet doubts whether this be their Opinion, let him read the <hi>Hague Conference,</hi> pag. 298. of <hi>Bertius</hi> Translation; where they do industriously and purposely defend, that in spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall death, spiritual gifts are not separated from the will of man, neither were implanted in it before that death in the state of Innocency, because if by these kinde of gifts the will were incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto either part, the liberty of it were taken away, which (they say) consists in this, That it can equally bend it self to either part, when all requisites unto action are afforded.</p>
            <p>It remaines now briefly to be proved, that God, whether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately or mediately, both by infused grace and morall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, turneth sinners unto himselfe after an irresistible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But this caution is to be premised, that by the word <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistibly</hi> we doe not understand any force offered to the Will, which is repugnant to its nature, but onely an insuperable effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Divine Grace, which inclines the Will sweetly and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to its owne nature, but so certainely and necessarily (we understand that Necessity, which even now we called Certainty) that it cannot be put off by the Will.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The truth of this Opinion is manifest from hence, That every where in Scripture the conversion and regeneration of a sinner is attributed to God alone, and to his good will and pleasure; but every, even the least co-operation is taken away
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57361:10"/>
from man himselfe. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy. Hee hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth: which could not be truly said, if a man at his owne freedome and pleasure, allowing all the actions of God requisite to conversion, might receive the quickning grace of God in vaine, and make it void (as <hi>Arminius</hi> speaks.) And let it be observed from these words, <hi>That this mans repenting, and that mans hardening, is not only attributed to God alone, but the will and endeavours of man, is utterly excluded from having any part in this businesse.</hi> It is not (saith the Apostle) <hi>of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth,</hi> &amp;c. As the wheele doth not run well, that it may be round; but because it is first round: so a man doth not therefore will or run that God might have mercy on him, and regenerate him by the quickning grace of the spirit: but because God first hath mercy, therefore he willeth and runneth in the way of righteousnesse.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The second reason is taken from the infallible connexion of the Effect, with the Cause; that is, of Conversion, with conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and quickning Grace: For if this quickning Grace alwayes attaine its effect, neither is offered to any, but those in whom it is effectuall, to the healing and regenerating of their soule: we must necessarily attribute unto it a certaine, prevalent and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible working. But it appeares by many places of Scripture, that this grace doth alwayes attain its end in those to whom it is communicated. <hi>Iohn 6. 37. Whatsoever my Father giveth me cometh unto me.</hi> Jer. 31. 23. <hi>Turn thou me and I shall be turned.</hi> From whence it is gathered, That into whomsoever grace, fit for the conversion of a man, is infused, that man is certainly and infallibly converted; otherwise a man could not thus addresse to God. <hi>Turne me;</hi> that is, doe what thou art wont to doe by the help of thy Spirit, and the infusion of thy Grace, and I shall be converted, for perhaps the will, in whose power it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject grace, may make it void. The same is evident from <hi>Iohn 6. 45. Whosoever hath heard and learned of the Father cometh unto me;</hi> that is, whosoever hath so <hi>heard</hi> and beene <hi>taught of God,</hi> that he hath also received and drunk in the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Grace of the Spirit, he hath certainly come unto mee.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57361:10"/>
Whence it appeares, That Grace fit for the conversion of a man is never frustrated, but it attaines its effect after an insupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable manner, so that it can never be put off by the will of man: Which is further confirmed from the nature of Grace, and that powerfull manner, whereby God infuseth it into the heart of man: For if Grace be the effect of infinite power (as it is) and that man be regenerated by the same power wherewith Christ was raised from the dead; then God in the implanting of it in the will of man, puts forth that almighty power, which no created faculty is able to withstand or resist.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Argument may also be added, The grace of God is so the efficient cause of Conversion, that it admits no joyn'd and co-ordinate cause, although it hath a subordinate cause; to wit, the will of man adjoyned to it: But if the Will, when it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by assisting grace (as they call it) can resist it, then it may also assist it; if it may withstand it, then it may also joyn endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with it, to produce the same effect; if it can make it void, it may also make it effectuall, and so may be a cause co-ordinate with the grace of God, in bringing forth the first act of its conversion. But that God doth convert or regenerate men by his owne and onely work, excluding all co-ordinate causes, is so cleare, that it need not be proved; for it is frequently found in Scripture, The Lord converteth, the Lord gives repentance; that God circumciseth, and takes away the stony heart, and gives a heart of flesh.</p>
            <p>Lastly, That God doth regenerate, and by his owne power raise from the death of sin.</p>
            <p>I let passe the force of the similitude, as no man can contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute any thing to his owne generation or resurrection; so neither to his spirituall regeneration or resurrection. God (I say) doth all these things; but they could not be attributed to him alone, if he had any cause so co-operating with him, as that if it refused, no such effect could follow.</p>
            <p>I adde, that of the Schoole-men is most true, That God is the cause of the whole Being; that is, although God be not the efficient cause of sinne (which is not a being, but rather a defect of what should be in a faculty or act) but rather a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> deficient will <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but of every good work (of which kinde our first conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57361:11"/>
is a chiefe one) if it be most full of Being, or if it be a whole Being, as it is, of such a whole work; I say, it is necessary that God should be the cause; for God alone is the cause of the whole Being wheresoever it is found: Yea, all Divines acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that so farre as Sinne it selfe is a Being, God is the cause of it: Wherefore, although the Will be the secondary and subordinate efficient cause of conversion; from whence it is that the Scriptures doe exhort us to turne our selves, and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcise our hearts, and so forth. Yet, as a co-ordinate cause, it no way can resist the quickning grace of God, and receive it in vaine (as <hi>Arminius</hi> speaks.) I adde, although God would admit of a Partner in this work, yet the will, which is wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and dead in sinne, can no more co-operate with exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and moving grace, than a carkasse prepared and disposed by rubbing can revive it selfe, and put forth vitall acts. But, that I may conclude this reason, Let it be supposed, that the Will may work together with the grace of God, or not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its liberty: yet, if this opinion stand, how much more than is meet will bee arrogated unto man, and derogated from the glory of God? Man may well boast that his will contributed so much to regeneration, that if he had<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not willed, it had never been produced. For as he, who being admonished by another, gives an almes, doth attribute the work more to himselfe, than to him that perswaded him, or stirred him up to it; so he, whose will being onely moved or admonished by assisting grace, turnes it selfe unto God; doth more, or, at least, equally ascribes his conversion to himselfe than to Divine Grace, which had never produced that effect, unlesse he himselfe had consented unto it, and made its perswasions effectuall, whereas it was in his power to have rendred them frustrate.</p>
            <p>The fourth reason is taken from hence, That the Decree of Election (by which God determined with himselfe to save some persons selected from the common Masse) is absolute, and therefore doth necessarily and in<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>libly attaine its effect, That the Decree of Election is absolute, so that the Lord looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing foreseen in the persons chosen, but absolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to work in them all conditions required to salvation, is so clearel<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> manifest from many places of Scripture, that it scarce
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57361:11"/>
needes any proof; for if we chuse not God, but he us, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. if we are chosen that we might be holy, not holy that we might be chosen: If he chose <hi>Iacob</hi> rather than <hi>Esau,</hi> when both were of like and equall condition. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. If effectuall vocation and justifying faith are the fruits and effects of predestination, not the foregoing conditions. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Lastly, If Gods meer good pleasure be the onely reason of the Decree [He hath mercy on whom he will, and hardeneth whom he will.] It necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that God hath absolutely decreed to save some: and to that purpose to bestow upon them Grace, Faith, and Holinesse. Granting these things, it appeares, that God converts all the Elect after a manner, by them irresistible on this manner, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if they could resist that Grace, which is fit to convert them, being also given to this end, that they might be converted; then this absolute and peremptory Decree of God might be disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the creature, which must not be imagined: Neither is there ground that they should now object, that by the same reason those whom God hath rejected, do sinne irresistibly. For we deny that there is the same reason of both: for although Faith be the effect of predestination, yet infidelity is not the proper effect of Reprobation. Whereas Faith requires a cause of it selfe efficient, which hath a true and proper influence into its effect. But there is no efficient cause required to unbeliefe: but deficient (because it followes upon the meere defect and absence of that cause by which Faith should be wrought.) As to the illumination of the aire; there is required the Sun or some other efficient cause, having influence into that effect; but the absence of the Sunne is enough to cause darknesse. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, although the sinnes of Reprobates do infallibly follow from the determinate counsell of God, who hath decreed their event; yet Conversion and Faith doe follow the absolute Decree of God after a much different manner; sinnes do follow infallibly indeed, but onely by a necessity of consequence; that is, God not at all causing or effecting, but onely permitting: but Faith and good Works follow by a necessity of the consequent, as of which God must most properly be called the Author, according to all Divines: For no man ever said that men did believe, were segenerate, and turned to God; did good works (God onely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57361:12"/>
permitting, but causing and working. But if this be granted to us (as needs it must) that Faith and Conversion do follow the absolute decree of God by a necessity of the consequent; that is, a necessity causing and co-working: I see not how it can be denyed, that it is wrought in us after an irresistble manner. For when any Agent so worketh upon the patient, that it necessarily overcomes it, it is properly said to work irresistibly. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God, if he so convert a sinner, that he is necessarily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, by a necessity of the consequent then he converts it irresistibly, that is after such a manner, as the patient must needs yeld; from whence I wonder, that those who deny election, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on foreseen faith, doe yet defend that conversion is wrought after a resistible manner, and so as it may be frustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
            <p>Let this be the fist and last reason. If conversion be wrought after that resistible manner, as is described by them who follow <hi>Arminius,</hi> then Divine election cannot be certaine according to their principles, because it dependeth on the mutable will of man, which as it is described by <hi>Arminius,</hi> I dare say, could not be foreseene by God himselfe; for let it be supposed (which they lay) as the foundation of that <hi>praevision</hi> that God doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly foresee all the wayes whereby the will may be turned aside, or inclined unto good: Let it also be supposed that God fore-knowes all objects, or circumstances, which may any way be offered or proposed to the will. Lastly, let it also be supposed, that God doth perfectly know how every object or circumstance is fit to move the will, and drive it this way, or that way, by perswasion. Yet if this be the condition of the will, that allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any objects, yea further, allowing any fitnesse in these ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or circumstances, to incline the will this way, or that way; it may yet, by vertue of its intrinsecall liberty act, or not act, I see not how God can foresee what the will certainly and infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly will doe, that is, whether it will turne to God or not. Not that God, by reason of any impotency is not able to search out what the will shall endeavour, but because the thing it selfe is not knowable. For there cannot be greater certainty in the knowledge than in the object, from whence I thus reason. If it be certaine that the will shall assent unto grace offered, then it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57361:12"/>
is falsly said, that the Will supposing all the actions of God that are requisite, may turne it selfe, or not? On the other side, if it be uncertaine, whether the will shall resist this grace, or not, then that foreknowledge which God hath of it, cannot be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, for that which is to be knowne is the measure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and therefore it is a contradiction to say, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is true, and yet there is more certainty in the knowledge than in the thing knowne. As it implyes a contradiction to say, that the thing measured is greater or lesse then the measure, and yet to be equall to it; I adde, although it be true, that God knowes all the wayes, according to which, the will may be well or ill inclined. Yet if the will be altogether undetermined, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting nothing to determine it, neither within it selfe, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, whether created, or uncreated, as they defend, implyes a contradiction, that any certaine way, whereby it should fall out that the will should be ordered or disordered, can be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by God himselfe. Out of all these things it is gathered, that if converting grace move the will after a manner, that may be resisted by it, God cannot infallibly foreknow, who shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and who not; and consequently, all election should be utterly taken away. Therefore it remaines,</p>
            <p>That converting grace is both imparted by God, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, after a manner Irresistible.</p>
