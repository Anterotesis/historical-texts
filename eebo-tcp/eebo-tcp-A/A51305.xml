         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Honoured SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PRAISE given to the Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendants of Hero's, is due more to the <hi>Spring,</hi> (gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly speaking) than to the <hi>Stream,</hi> whilst Personal Merits chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it as their own Right: But 'tis your Due, Sir, on both Accounts, for the Honour of your Family, and your own Glory in the Republic of Letters, is known to the whole World. The small REMAINS therefore of the Learned Dr. <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:44343:3"/>
               <hi>More,</hi> cannot meet with a fitter Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, than the Learned Sir <hi>Thomas Pope Blunt.</hi> The Brave and the Learned Sympathize with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, so that you cannot be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be the Living Protector of our Dead Hero. 'Tis confess'd, that these Letters of his are not so Accurate and Excellent as his more Elaborate Works; but then it must be remember'd, that they are Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and Familiar Letters to his Friend, the Reverend Mr. <hi>Elys,</hi> and therefore only design'd easily to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press his Thoughts upon such Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences as occasion'd their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; his Love for the Reverend Divine they are directed to, and a Vein of Piety runs through 'em: and 'tis not improbable that the Doctor did not think they wou'd ever have been Publish'd. But his Friend, being highly sensible of the
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:44343:3"/>
public Merit of the Doctor, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably suppos'd that any thing of so great a Man wou'd be acceptable to his Friends and Admirers; that is, to all the Learn'd, who cannot but admire him with <hi>Descartes;</hi> who in one of his Letters to him, declares, he never Converst with any Man with greater Satisfaction. If we cut all away from the Letters of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> and <hi>Pliny,</hi> that is not extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, their number wou'd be much lessen'd: by which we find how well satisfy'd the World is with any Thought or Word of a Great Man. But I'm sensible, Sir, this Apology for Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s LETTERS will be judg'd very superfluous; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I'll not enlarge the Imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence on the account of the other Familiar Letters of this small Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, the Names of the Great Men who wrote 'em, will more than justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:44343:4"/>
'em. And as for those Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versial Letters, written by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Mr. <hi>Elys,</hi> you'll grant, I'm sure, that they prove their Author both a Learned and a Pious Man; Qualities that will recommend his Performances better to your Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than what I can say, who have no share in the Present I make you, but the Propriety in the Copy, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by my Friend Mr. <hi>Elys;</hi> and the Value I have for the Author's concern'd in it, because I cou'd not hope any thing of my own wou'd be so worthy of your Patronage, who are so Celebrated and so Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Critic, as your Works de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate.

You'll excuse my so long delay of returning you thanks for that undeserved respect you have done me in them both: For my hands being so full of business, and being of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they might require a longer and more ample Answer than I find now fit to under take, made me defer my writing till now. For
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:44343:5"/>
as for your <hi>Thesis,</hi> truly I think that you have hit the mark therein, and have as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuously as briefly coined the Truth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; tho it may be, I may be thought no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent Judge, who my self have publickly declar'd, That besides the <hi>Elect in a Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistical sense,</hi> there be others also in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Salvation, of whom, some I believe, obtain it, others fall short of it, through their own fault. As for my part, I think you have made a judicious choice of the Character of such, <hi>viz.</hi> They that believe that the Gospel of Christ is true. For God has put into their hands such a Talent, and is so ready to assist his own design, if they be not wanting to themselves, that I do not doubt but the work of Salvation may go on in them also, and take effect, tho they be not absolutely, and irresistibly determin'd thereto.</p>

do you any service or pleasure, and most of all that those that tend to the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Soul in the Body. If we hold that such a Soul when she is out of the Body, or that Body is dead, is in a state of Happiness, and Joy; it is very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to me what people think of the Modes and Circumstances thereof. That you keep so sincere a Conscience as you describe; it is a constant Feast in the midst of any bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternesses from without. Your free and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere acknowledging of whatever Good you meet with, is a right Dove-like temper in you, but your defying of the contrary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may needlesly provoke, may have less of the Serpent in it, than is lawful, or, it may be than commanded. Our Saviour joyns both. And it's pity that so kind a heart should expose it self to any needless troubles: I am heartily sorry to hear you are subject to <hi>Apoplectical Distempers.</hi> Observe a constant care in Diet for Meats and Drinks, as to quantity and quality, that they be moderate, and a guard upon your self, That you be not too much transported in mind, which inflames the Spirits, and spends them, and so makes Nature subject to flag, and makes the Principles of Life vapid: This caution I conceive, is as material as can come from one that is no Physitian. There was a good generous Christian Strain in the Verses at the end of your Letter; and there was another such chain of Verses, which Mr. <hi>D.—</hi>sent to me as from you, which

               <p>SINCE I receiv'd yours, I have been so unexpectedly busy, that I have not had the opportunity before now to write an Answer. And I am even now upon a Journy, and something streighten'd in-time; but so much I must take, as to signifie to you, how sensible I am of your Affection to my self; tho I have had no occasion to oblige

you, but that which is the main, to congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate you, for that Grace of God which he has shew'd you, in bringing you into so lively a sense of the best things. There is nothing better than what you drive at in both your <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>English</hi> Poetry. Love or Charity, joyned with Humility, is the most heavenly Disposition that the Soul of Man is capable of: and the second, as it will ballast the first well, and prevent all the danger of over-much Rapturousness, so it will direct the efficacy thereof to all useful services towards Mankind, and especially such as are incumbent upon any Duty of Place, or Calling. <hi>Peter, lovest thou me? feed my Sheep,</hi> &amp;c. Which makes me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Flock happy, that have for their Pastor so excellent a Soul, so invigorated with that which must needs stir up all men to do their utmost for the Salvation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to serve them in whatever good they can. I am abruptly taken off by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and have only time enough to tell you, That it is thought that one Mr. <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lywell,</hi> once Fellow of our Colledge, is the Author of <hi>Deus Justificatus.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>I receiv'd yours a week or two ago, tho I have had no time till now, to signifie so much to you. The last time I wrote to you, I wrote also to Mr. <hi>D.—</hi>but I have heard nothing since from him: I wish he be well. I superscrib'd my Letter as heretofore. It's pretty you should light on a <hi>Tetrastick</hi> in <hi>Greg. Nazianzen,</hi> so like my <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, without Translating that, I one morning turn'd into <hi>English</hi> thus, as near as I could.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Nor whence, nor who I am, poor wretch, know I:</l>
                  <l>Nor, O the blindness! whither I shall go;</l>
                  <l>But in the crooked Claws of Grief I lye,</l>
                  <l>And live (I think) thus tugged to, and fro.</l>
                  <l>Waking, and Dreams all one. O Father! I own</l>
                  <l>Tis rare, we Mortals live i'th Clouds like Thee.</l>
                  <l>Lyes, Toyes, or some hid Fate us fix, or move:</l>
                  <l>All else being dark what's Life, I only see.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Your Youthful Poetical Fire, you see, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses a little warmth into my old Blood. Your Translation, both <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> is very well; and indeed, your divine Solitude is Excellent. These Expressions, as they are the Emanations, and transient Effluxes of a living Fountain in a man, are both the effects and evidence of that divine happiness the Soul is capable of, even in this Life. I am some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing solicitous that I hear nothing from Mr. <hi>D.—</hi>that he should not be well. When

you write to him, I pray you tell him, That I writ to him the last time I wrote to you, and send me word of his Health. I am</p>

               <p>SInce my last to you, I have receiv'd four Letters, and a Book from you———————The other next to this, mentions the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dialogues,</hi> and takes occasion from those plain <hi>Hymns</hi> at the end of the <hi>Dialogues</hi> to fly aloft into an higher strain of Poetry. I wish that Book may have so good effect as your <hi>Muse</hi> Prognosticates. Your kind Letter dated in <hi>December,</hi> again mentions the <hi>Divine Dialogues,</hi> and does more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently challenge me for the Author of them, than the former. And indeed, I am so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally suspected, that I am fain to let it be so. I am glad they have so much gratified you in the reading; the three first Dialogues are more universally accepted, but the two last bear too much upon Prophecies, which are not according to the gust and mode of this present Age. Whereas notwithstanding, they that complain of the uncertainty and obscurity of that Subject, are too ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn to give assent to such things as
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44343:10"/>
have not any thing near the like coherence or evidence. But every Creature will go in its own Tract. Your Reflections upon Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Rapture, are very useful and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. And he that improves his sincerity to the utmost will find his way through all without a Monitor. I am glad you are so well satisfied with the Discourse of the grounds of Faith. I must confess, it seems to my self firm, and solid.————I suppose you receiv'd mine, wherein I gave you an account of the Author of <hi>Deus Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatus.</hi> No more for the present, but that I am,</p>

               <p>I Receiv'd yours of <hi>Ian.</hi> 9. a pretty while ago, but had not leasure to return An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer till now—————————in such cases it is most rational to rest in the determination of Providence, and to keep a mans Affections free from all things, and knit them only to that ONE, whose due they are, That what a mans Arm is to his Body, that his whole Soul and all the Powers thereof may be to the Sovereign Good, inseparably united thereto by a kind of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Arm is to the Body, that not enduring to be disjoyned from the Body, will let its hold go from
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44343:10"/>
any thing rather than endure that Peril and Pain. So whatever we lay hold on by our Affections in the things of this World, we are ever to be free in that grasp, and not let them grow to the Object, but be in a readiness to let go, and keep our own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty entire for the only service of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Good: And in good earnest to endeavour to die to all things of this world, and the allurements thereof, and to seek our satisfaction in that One that is above all, and affords more pleasure than all the things of this world. But if a man be not fully Master of his Body and Complexion, it is impossible but it will shew him many a slim Trick: For so far forth as we are subject to the suggestions of the Body, we are captivated in Fate and Ignorance, and must be exposed to the Impostures and Mockeries of this vain World, and fall so far short of the desirable liberty of the Sons of God. Wherefore discreet Devotion, and accurate and continued Temperance is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to all such as have a desire to avoid these Snares. I am glad the <hi>Divine Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues</hi> prov'd so seasonable and serviceable to you. It was a pretty Curiosity betwixt you and Mr. <hi>Baxter;</hi> but I think you would do best not to trouble your mind with such Notions, as, though true, are not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But I on the other side, much wonder at those that are so loath to admit, that the administration of Gods Providence is accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to what is best, unless they choose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reproach God than acknowledge
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44343:11"/>
their Ignorance in the Excellencies of his Providence; but measure things according to the shallowness and narrowness of our own Light or Thoughts. You intimate some Exceptions of men against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick part of the <hi>Dialogues,</hi> which I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not at; many having neither a Spirit nor competent patience to consider such things: but if you think good in your next to send me their most considerable Objections, and from what sort of men they are, it will not be unacceptable. That you are so much concerned in the Doctrine of the Power to become holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I am glad to hear it from you: Belief is but the first step; and if men will not so much as embrace that, nothing will succeed. <hi>According to thy Faith, so be it unto thee,</hi> saith our Saviour. It is the Hypocrisy of the World, that they are loath to have the blame lay'd at their own doors, that they are not so good as they should be. But they that have this Belief with Sincerity, it is a great Cordial unto them, and will assuredly carry them very effectually to perfect Holiness in the fear of God. In which Noble pursuit, I wish you and all Men good Success, and abruptly take leave, and rest</p>

               <p>I Suppose yours of <hi>August</hi> 16. was the last you wrote to me, which therefore being above two months ago, and you hearing nothing from me all this time, you may easily surmise your Letter miscarried, or that it is a miscarriage in me, that I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44343:12"/>
have been so long silent: But I have been so hurried from one thing to another, that I knew not how the time went, and scarce believ'd this to be your last Letter (when I sought it ought amongst many others) by reason of the oldness of the Date. But having perus'd it again, I found it was the Letter I had not yet answer'd. And it will not be easie to make an answer proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to the kindness and seriousness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: That you find so much satisfaction and pleasure in the reading my Writings, is no ungrateful News to me, it being the only end (so far as I know) of writing them, to gratifie others for their good. All that I have writ being reducible to those grand <hi>Queries</hi> of the Wise man: <hi>What is Man, and whereto serveth he? What is his Good, and what is his Evil?</hi> As I have particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly shewn in my <hi>Proefatio Generalissima.</hi> And so few concern themselves in this kind of Knowledge, that I cannot hope to have many perusers of my Writings in haste. You shew your Sincerity as well as Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in giving a due value to that useful point, touching Faith in the Power of Christ's Spirit. There is nothing of more conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than to be firmly fixt in that Belief, that all sin, and corruption is conquerable through the might of the Spirit of Christ; till one be persuaded of that, No man will set himself to resist his Lusts to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And according to the weakness and smallness of their Faith, such is their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress: As for what is past, and the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44343:12"/>
of Men, I think it most advisable not to trouble your self with them, but to press on toward the mark of the high Calling, whereunto we are called: Nor to affect high Raptures, or over-bearing inward Sensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which may happen from too great an inflamation of the Spirits, but to examine our ardour of Love to Christ by what we do to his Members, according as Christ has signified to <hi>Peter, Lovest thou me more than the rest? feed my sheep,</hi> &amp;c. Which I do not question, but you do perform in a good measure by what you intimate of the poor Girl you often visited in her Sickness; and continuance in your seriousness will carry your further, and further on in such good Offices. As for that Book you mention, I cannot do any thing but <hi>pro re natâ,</hi> and it's likely it will fall in course to me to do that, or some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it e're long. But there are many good Books in the world already, if men would with sincerity make good use of them. I am glad you are setled in your weighty Employment, to be Guide of Souls to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: In which, wishing you all good Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, I commit you to God's gracious Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rest</p>

               <p>I Have receiv'd your melancholly Letter, and am heartily sorry that there should be that occasion thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Young Lady should be so irrecoverably ill, and that her death should be so hazardous to her Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Mother. But as for your desiring of me to suggest to you what I conceive best for you to say to the Young Lady in your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, to confirm her in her willingness to die: I do not believe I can suggest to you any thing but what either has, or will easily occur to your own mind. One thing is, she dying of a <hi>Consumption,</hi> her Passage will be in all likelyhood, very easy to her, which ordinarily makes Death more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to the dying Party, and the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standers. When she is once got into the other World, she being an innocent vertuous Young Lady, you may remind her, that there is nothing pleasing to her in this life, but the enjoyment will be incomparably more in the other. The Friendship and Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of amiable persons for feature and converse, the beauty of persons of the other World insinitely excelling that in this, as much as the purest Star does a durty clod of Earth: And these, whose Persons and Aspects are so
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44343:14"/>

               <p>YOurs of <hi>Feb. 29th.</hi> I have receiv'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There is no pleasure comparable to the not being captivated by any external thing whatsoever, but to reserve himself en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire for the service of God, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Your Judgment touching the drinking of Wine is true, and will stick with you the better, since it is built upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. Amongst your other Verses, I more particularly like that Distich:
<q>
                     <l>I do but think my Friends are Good, but know</l>
                     <l>My Love is good which I on them bestow.</l>
                  </q>
That Faith and Belief in the Power of God to become holy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it is the great Gift of God to you, that you are to acknowledge with all Humility and Thankfulness; for it is of main importance for the making a man good, and it is a sign of a great measure of simplicity of Spirit, that a man will own such a Doctrine; for it is a sign he seeks no
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44343:16"/>
Excuses for the Evil he commits, but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lays the fault at his own door, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses himself to the more severe and envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Censures of other men. But here a man must be sure to attribute all to the Power of God, and that not only <hi>rationally and verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but <hi>feelingly and sincerely,</hi> and to confirm the truth of his Profession by a most profound and exemplary Humility of mind and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation. Whether it be in the Power of all men to believe this so important Doctrine, is a Question more uncertain; but the Belief theréof being of that great importance for holiness of Life, it is very ill done of any Man to oppose it. I wrote to our Friend Mr. <hi>D.—</hi>the last time I wrote to you, and superscrib'd it according to his direction, but I know not whether it carry'd my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to him; if you know whether he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd it or no, and would give your self the trouble of sending me word thereof in your next, you would thereby oblige</p>

Your Citations out of <hi>Savanorola</hi> are perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and pious; and certainly he was a ve-Holy Man: But <hi>Picus Mirandulanus</hi> has dress'd up his Life, so that it looks like one of the rest of the <hi>Roman Legends.</hi> He knew more than those Times would bear, and 'twas his honesty and courage, that he would die in what he knew to be true. I am glad you find so much benefit in being persuaded of that main point of Faith, in the assistance of Christ's Spirit for the subduing our Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. There is little hope of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in the ways of true Holiness without it. And they that have it possess a Jewel, if they make right use of it, and not enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it as a true Notion only, but as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Principle of Life, that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind us perpetually, That it is long of our selves if we be not as we should be; for as much as we are assur'd, there is in readiness so powerful a supply of Strength and Grace from Christ, if we will sincerely set our selves to resist our Spiritual Enemies. As for the <hi>Query</hi> you put to me, I think you are a little too early in forecasting about such things: Let us speak what is true, and do what is just and righteous, and make it our business to kill, and consume all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders of Corruption in our Souls and Bodies in that condition we are, and God will give us Wisdom when the time of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering comes, to do what is most behooffal.

No man can give Advice at such a distance either to himself or any one else (I am sure I cannot) what he is to resolve of.

The same party that you say declared to that <hi>French Gentleman,</hi> that <hi>I</hi> wrote not <hi>satis terse, I</hi> have heard from other hands, that he has much commended my <hi>Latine</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44343:20"/>
Style: So that these things are as mens Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours take them, and searce one of a thousand that can make shift to understand <hi>Latine</hi> are competent Judges of a Style, but measure things by the scantness of their own skill in the Tongue: As <hi>Theophrastus</hi> his Character of a Country man, in his <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, because he had not the skill to discern what was current and what not. But for any little fidling <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, where any such occur, I leave the Reader to mend, as I declare after the <hi>Syllabus Scriptorum,</hi> &amp;c. to all the World. The Employment you hug your self in, is a very noble and weighty Employment; and if you see your Labour succeed in your hand, you need envy no man's Happiness, that fancy themselves in an higher or more splendid Condition; besides that, our stay here upon Earth is but for a moment: so that if men were not intoxicated with the unwholesome Fumes of the World, they would be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their so much stickling to get the most <hi>Counters,</hi> and <hi>Cherry-Cobs.</hi> These be <hi>Seneca</hi>'s <hi>Pueri Barbati:</hi> And to avoid that <hi>Sarcasm,</hi> one would think it were the humour of the Age so universally to cut off their <hi>Beards,</hi> that such <hi>Stoics</hi> may not pull them by them. How one should be Affected in Divine Worship, your intimations are sound and right so far as I see; and your Study of condescending to the capacity of meaner people, highly laudable. And if you can engage Sir <hi>S.—</hi>to read over with you
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44343:20"/>
that <hi>Manual</hi> you mention, and seriously to consider it, I hope with God's Blessing, it may do him much good. Your <hi>Poetry</hi> is handsome upon the <hi>Anagram</hi> of the Name of the Gentleman's Father: But still I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you to heat your self no more than needs must.

               </opener>
               <p>I Receiv'd yours (and that enclosed) by the last Post, and this comes (with my love and respects) to return my Thanks. Though I know well enough that I have many Accusers; it was in you the part of a Friend to let me know what Crimes they lay to my charge. For my not visiting my Diocess, I have this to say: My great Age and many Infirmities disable me personally to do it, being now (within a few months) 82 years old. When I came to the Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, I appointed a Visitation, printed Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44343:22"/>
and sent them to the Arch-Deacons; but when I should have set upon that work, I found that I was not able to take such large Journies, and do the business which should have been done in them; so that upon the sense of my own Disability and my Friends Advice, I appointed my Chancellor and Commissioners to Visit for me that time, and writ a long Letter to my Brethren the Clergy, containing Directions for their Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Conversation, such, as (had I been able to have gone in person) I should have deliver'd to them by word of mouth, in the Speeches I was to make in several places. I did afterwards Visit by my Chancellour and Commissioners once or twice. Then my Arch-Deacons (of which I have 6 in my Diocess) Visiting twice a Year; I gave them a charge, and directions diligently to do it; and if any dubious or difficult busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness happen'd, which they could not so really reform: I requir'd them to bring it to me, that I might <hi>Auxiliis &amp; consiliis,</hi> assist them: And on this Account I have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally determin'd more Causes (especially Cases of Conscience) than any of my Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers ever did, or (may be) ever could. But Innocence is no fence against a false Tongue; far better Men have been calumniated; and I have no reason to expect freedom from what (all good Men endure) Calumnies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I hope (by God's Blessing) to have so much Religion and Christian Charity, as to pardon, and pray for my Enemies,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44343:22"/>
and never (though it were in my power) do, nor wish them any harm.———————————</p>
               <p>I thank you for your <hi>Animadversions</hi> upon Dr. <hi>S.—</hi>How he will be able to justifie those Propositions, or give any probable sense of them to free them from Heresie (if not Blasphemy) I know not, <hi>Ipse viderit.</hi>

What you Transcribe out of St. <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> is as comfortable, as it is true. God deals with us, as we with our little ones sometimes, let's us fall gently, that we must cry to him for help, and perfects us by Sufferings as well as the Captain of our Salvation; afflicts, because he loves us, and fits us for himself by both.</p>

My <hi>Latine</hi> Book you will have from Mr. <hi>Davis</hi> (whom I hope you have written to for it) you will find as full of Typogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Errors as any Book of that bulk, tho such as will not hinder a Man of your skill in the perusal. The main thing you are to mark, is, Whether the Book does not justifie the Title in reconciling the Points, the most knotty, and least agreed on by Learned Christians.</p>
               <p>If a Copy of one or two Leases of Title <hi>Congres</hi> is necessary, as you say, 'tis sufficient, it shall be sent.

I acknowledge the great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties you alledge for the practice and use of Poetry, and 'tis laudable in all, who are so much above their proper Business, as to suffice both for That, and their Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Such were <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Grotius;</hi> but the most excellent Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and Bishop <hi>Sanderson,</hi> were none of that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, much less am I: That you can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

all the Duties of your Priest-hood; to write in Prose against the Errors of <hi>Ian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senius;</hi> and to write Verses at the same time, and the hardest of the kind too; a <hi>Latine Translation</hi> of arrant <hi>English</hi> gives me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to say with <hi>Aristotle,</hi>

The <hi>Thesis</hi> you held at <hi>Oxford</hi> was very modest, and very safe. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> does go much farther, who yet (you know) was too Primitive to be a <hi>Pelagian.</hi> St. <hi>Augustin</hi> is cited by the Remonstrants and Antiremonstrants, as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron of both those ways into which he was betray'd by the usual <gap reason="foreign">

I think you will do well to consider Mr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> (a stranger to me) before you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him, because I perceive, he has the best Men's Approbation, and may be taken by the wrong handle, as many Orthodox Men have been. They that quarrel Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> Letters to Dr. <hi>Sanderson</hi> (whose longest Letter was to me, altho I sent it Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> in whose Friendship we long had met,) are hardly worth a wise Man's Anger, and you need not purchase them yours.</p>

               <p>I Have seen a Printed Paper, wheren <hi>I</hi> find your pretended Vindication of your Error, in saying, <hi>That the Three Persons in the Holy Trinity are three infinite Spirits:</hi> Tho <hi>I</hi> was the first, <hi>say you,</hi> who had made use of those Terms in such a sense, yet <hi>I</hi> ought not to be reprehended: in opposition to such a Practice, as you conceit to be so excusable, the Learned <hi>Isaac Casaubon</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces these most important Sayings of <hi>Plato, Epictetus,</hi> and <hi>Galen, Pl.</hi>

                  <hi>but it were to be wish'd that those who first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd this term into Divinity, had given us a clear and proper notion of it.</hi> Answ. Their Notion of it plainly imports, That a <hi>Person</hi> is THAT, or SOMEWHAT <hi>which has an Intelligent Being or Essence.</hi> Now it implies no contradiction, that in the one absolutely infinite, and incomprehensible Being, there should be <hi>the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost;</hi> of each of which Three, it may be said. He is THAT which has an <hi>infinite intelligent Essence.</hi> But it may not be said, That the Father is the Son or the Holy Ghost, or that the Son is the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet we must acknowledge, that the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost, have one Essence absolutely infinite, that is to say, that these Three are the one true and eternal God. <hi>The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghost is God; and yet they are not three Gods but one God.</hi> You say, that you have demonstrated, <hi>That tho three finite Spirits must needs be three different Substances, yet it follows not that three infinite Minds must be so. I answer,</hi> You never did, nor ever shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, but that it is the most palpable Contradiction that Words can express, to say, there are <hi>three infinite Minds or Spirits:</hi> An infinite Spirit is a <hi>Being absolutely infinite.</hi> To say then, that there are three infinite Spirits, is to say, there are three Beings or Effences absolutely infinite, that is, there are THREE GODS.</p>

               <p>MY Reflections on the great Wit and Learning I find in your Sermons, make me to hope, That you will with all Christian Candor, and Tranquility of Mind, peruse the Animadversions I shall here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you on some part of your Sermon, on <hi>Acts</hi> 17, 27. <hi>p.</hi> 6. <hi>and</hi> 7. <hi>Such a radical Truth that</hi> God is, <hi>springing up together with the Essence of the Soul, and previous to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thoughts, is not pretended to by Religion. No such thing that I know of is affirmed, or suggested by the Scriptures.</hi> Animadv. 'Tis said expresly, <hi>Genesis</hi> 1. 27. <hi>God created Man in his own Image:</hi> Since <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> most certainly the principal part of Man must be a <hi>Spirit;</hi> man being <hi>created in the Image of God,</hi> in a peculiar manner made partaker of the Eternal <gap reason="foreign">

                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:44343:29"/>
                  <hi>knowledge of him was in that manner innate, and perpetual, there would be no occasion of seeking, nor any hap or hazard in the finding? Such an Inscription would be Self-evident with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Ratiocination, or Study, and could not fail constantly to exert its Energy in their minds.</hi> Answ. The Holy Apostle in these words plainly shews, That the way to find the LORD our GOD, is not to conceive as <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters</hi> do, that He is <hi>far from us;</hi> but to consider, that IN Him we live, and move, and have our Being, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Divine Essence comprehends,</hi> or eminently contains the life, and every motion, or operation, and the nature or essence of every Man in the whole World, and consequently the essence and operations of all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; so that the LORD our GOD must be no other than a Being INFINITE in all Perfection: And since he is IN ALL Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in a peculiar manner in Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Creatures, it must needs follow, That 'tis impossible that any Rational Creature should not <hi>apprehend</hi> this <hi>Fountain of all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in</hi> every <hi>Regular,</hi> or <hi>Orderly</hi> Reflection it makes on <hi>it self</hi> [or its own Being.]<hi>——Such an Inscription,</hi> say you, <hi>would be Self-evident without any Ratiocination, or Study, and could not fail constantly to exert its Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in their Minds.</hi> To this I Answer, That it implyes a contradiction, That it should be <hi>perceiv'd</hi> by the Soul without any <hi>Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> on it: That there is such an <hi>Inscription</hi> on the Rational Soul, you must at length grant, unless you will deny that those words
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44343:30"/>
were written by <hi>Divine Inspiration, which shew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts.</hi> Not only the <hi>Admirable Structure of Animate Bodies,</hi> and such other things as you speak of, but every thing in the whole Creation shews the Existence of the one INFINITE Being. That any Man is <hi>Athei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical</hi> proceeds only from the pravity of his <hi>Will,</hi> perverting <hi>His Understanding.

                  <salute>Honoured <hi>SIR,</hi>

               <p>I Thank you for your Letter, in which you shew so great Candour and Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, That I hope your Design is not so ill as I feared it was; tho I am very averse from several of your Assertions, particularly that concerning the LORD'S PRAYER, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> did not always use it in their Solemn Worship.—To which I Answer, That it cannot be prov'd, That any Bishop of the Primitive Church, or any one of the Inferiour Clergy with the Allowance of his Bishop, did ever undertake to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Publick Worship of Almighty God, without the Use of the LORD'S PRAYER. Some of the greatest Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Church of Christ in this Kingdom, are those Men who pretend to be True Ministers of the Gospel, without true ORDINATION, and in their Congregations never use the LORD'S PRAYER.</p>
               <p>I shall here recite some of my own Words (that have been published in two several Papers:)—<q>It is most evident that those Men are guilty of Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Iniquity, who endeavour to seduce any People from the Communion of the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44343:33"/>
                     <hi>CHURCH</hi> of <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> in which the Fundamental Articles of the Christian Religion are so clearly and fully exprest, and those most important Expressions so frequently repeated, That Persons of the <hi>lowest Intellectuals,</hi> who do not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against the <hi>Light</hi> in frequenting our <hi>Religious Assemblies,</hi> may more easily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Knowledge of All Things that are necessary to their Salvation, than by Hearing or Reading the best Sermons that have been, or shall be preached by any of the <hi>Nonconformists</hi> to the End of the World; which Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is as Evident as it is, That any <hi>Illiterate</hi> Persons may more easily medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on Truths plainly exprest, and frequently suggested to their Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, than <hi>Collect</hi> the same Truths out of divers large Discourses, if they were therein <hi>implyed:</hi> So that it can hardly be imagin'd, how any Man can be in any thing more serviceable to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyer of Souls,</hi> than by Teaching Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to dispise Our CATECHISM and COMMON PRAYER.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SIR, If you sincerely desire the Peace of the Church, I beseech you by the Meekness and Gentleness of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> That you would deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what I have here written in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science

               <p>I Shall not give you the trouble of any Preface, to what I shall write in Vindication of this most important Truth, That the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church in the Publick Worship of Almighty God, did always use a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> or <hi>Form of Sacred Words,</hi> namely the LORD'S PRAYER, the PSALMS, and the GLORIA PATRI. <q>You say, That <hi>Origen</hi> prescribing a methed of Prayer, speaks not a Word of the LORD'S</q> PRAYER, <hi>De Oratione, Sect.</hi> 22.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:44343:34"/>
I Answer, That in the former part of his Treatise, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, He speaks very much of the LORD'S PRAY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER, and plainly shews, That 'twas us'd by all Christians in their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Assemblies. I Pray, SIR, bestow your second THOUGHTS upon these Words, <hi>Page</hi> 66. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap>, <hi>p.</hi> 132, 133. He plainly shews, That in what he speaks of the LORD'S PRAYER, he would be understood to have Respect in a Special Manner to the PUPLICK WORSHIP. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:44343:34"/>
                  <hi>Contra Celsam, Edit. Spenc. pag.</hi> 178. He speaks expresly of COMMON PRAYERS, in which he certainly implies the LORD'S PRAYER, of which he discourses so largely in his Book, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. How great Regard the Primitive Christians had to the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> is manifest by that <hi>Holy Aspiration</hi> of <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> which you cite. <gap reason="foreign">

the contrary, as that famous controverted place of <hi>Iustin. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,</hi> who describing the manner of the PRAYER before the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>LORD'S SUPPER,</hi> says, That the Bishop sent up Prayers and Praises to God with <hi>his utmost Ability,</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> This famous place of <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> is so far from favouring the Conceit, That the Christians in those Days us'd <hi>Extemporary</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in their Religious Worship, that it clearly demonstrates the contrary: For the Word <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, plainly shews, That the Bishop did <hi>send forth,</hi> or <hi>pour out Pryers and Thanksgivings in like manner</hi> as the <hi>Laity</hi> did,

               <p>YOur Letter of the 6th Instant I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. I thank you for your pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me in any thing, wherein you imagine I have been mistaken, tho I think that in some things you misapprehend my meaning.</p>
               <p>You affirm in the first place, That the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church in the public Worship of Almighty God, did always use a Liturgy, or <hi>Form of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Words,</hi> namely, the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and the <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Psalms,</hi> I say the same with you, and I think that I have proved it beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6. of my Book.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer,</hi> I say also, and have proved it, <hi>p.</hi> 36, 37, 38. That it was ordinarily and commonly used, and no more; if so much can be collected from those places, which you Cite out of <hi>Origen,</hi> in his Books <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and <hi>contra Celsum</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> you never find it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the three first Centuries; that which you cite of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Polycarp,</hi> proves only this, That they concluded their Prayers with Praise to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, as I think all Christians now do. Besides, by ascribing too great an Antiquity to the present <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> you put an Argument into the hands of the <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> or <hi>Unitarians,</hi> who will retort upon you, that you have changed that <hi>Apostolical,</hi> or at least most Ancient Composure (as you affirm it to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44343:37"/>
be) for that: Whereas you now say, Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost; the Primitive Church, as in those ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Passages, which you quote, (not to mention any more) said, Glory be to the Father, by the Son, in the Holy Ghost, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>As for the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> I do not say that it excludes the Intention and Fervency of the Heart and Mind, but that it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that together with the Exertion of his Personal Abilities. What you mean by <hi>Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary</hi> Prayers, I do not well understand: if you mean a confused, immethodical Heap of Words, I dislike that as much as you; as you may see <hi>pag.</hi> 40. But if you mean the debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Minister from the Exercise of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, Judgment, Expression, and such like Gifts in Prayer; I must therein disagree from you, 'till I see more satisfactory Proof. As sor your Descant upon the Word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it is a good <hi>Criticism,</hi> that may please the Fancy, but not satisfie the Judgment; and as for <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, it has not Reference to <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but to what <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> related in the precedent Page, which is the 97th of the Edition I use, at <hi>Colen</hi> 1686; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular to the <hi>Eucharistical</hi> Prayer, which the Bishop alone made, and the People only testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their Assent by saying, <hi>Amen</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, Sir, I have briefly consider'd your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and shall crave leave to inform you in short of my Opinion, concerning the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the Primitive Church herein, that so you may not mistake me, <hi>viz.</hi> That they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44343:37"/>
used the Psalms in their Public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, the Lord's Prayer commonly, and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and for other Prayers, the Ministers were left to their own Choice and Liberty: I have one thing more to add, and that is, That you would not imagine every thing to be my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Opinion, which I have related in my Book, or that I thought every thing necessary to be now used, which is contained therein: My Design, as you may see in the Preface, was only nakedly to relate the Customs of the Primitive Church, without giving my particular Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in any one Point whatsoever, unless it be in the Conclusion of the last Section of the Second Part. How far we are to submit to the Authority of our Governours, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Peace of the Church, I neither there nor here determine. I beg Almighty God to inspire our Governours, and People, with a Spirit of Peace and Love, of Unity and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that instead of promoting fiery Dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and rigid Impositions, we may joyn in mutual Condescension and Relaxations.</p>
               <p>I thank you for all your Kindnesses, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech Almighty God to bless your Studies, and make you instrumental for the Advance of his Glory and Honour. I am,</p>

                  <p>I Shall make no other Reply to what you say of the Lord's Prayer in your Letter, than only by repeating what I said in mine, <hi>viz.</hi> that it cannot be prov'd, <q>That any Bishop of the Primitive Church, or any one of the Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy, with the Allowance of his Bishop, did ever undertake to perform the Public Worship of Almighty God, without the Use of the Lord's Prayer.</q>

                  <p>I do most confidently Aver, That the want of the <hi>Practical Understanding of the Lord's Prayer,</hi> is the chief Cause of all the <hi>Sins</hi> and <hi>Errours</hi> in the <hi>Christian World:</hi> Wherefore I earnestly beseech all those that have <hi>Named the Name of Christ,</hi> to joyn with me in the daily Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Divine Sence of these Words deliver'd unto us by our Blessed <hi>SAVIOUR,</hi> as a Compleat Directory for <hi>All Our Desires:</hi>

               <head>A Vindication of the LITURGY of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE Author of these Reflections most sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly resolves, by the Help of Almighty GOD, to <hi>embrace</hi> Truth, and to <hi>reject</hi> Error wheresoever he finds it. He desires, That the Friends of <hi>R. B.</hi> would take these Reflections in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their deepest consideration, with the same candour and benevolence to all Mankind, with which he communicates them to the World.</p>
               <p>I am glad to find these words, <hi>pag.</hi> 233, 234. <q>I would not be understood as if I intended the putting away of all set Times and Places to Worship; God forbid I should think of such an Opinion: Nay, we are none of those that <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the Assembly of our selves together,</hi> but have even set Times and Places, in which we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully meet together to wait upon God, and worship him.</q> These words following in the same Page require our <hi>Animadversion.</hi> 
                  <q>But the Limitation we condemn, is, That whereas the Spirit of God should be the immediate Actor, moreover, Perswader and Influencer of Man, in the particular Acts of Worship, when the Saints are met together, this Spirit is limited in its Operations, by setting up a particular Man, or Men, to preach and pray in Man's Will, and all the rest are excluded from so
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44343:39"/>
much as believing, that they are to wait for God's Spirit to move them in such things, and so they neglecting, that which should quicken them in themselves, and not waiting to feel the pure Breathings of God's Spirit, so as to obey them, are led meerly to depend upon the Preacher, and hear what he will say.</q> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> I shall undertake, by God's assistance, to vindicate the Use of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the principal parts whereof are the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Holy Psalms;</hi> I say, the <hi>Psalms,</hi> for they are to be us'd in our <hi>Religious Assemblies,</hi> as the Means or Instruments to <hi>lift up our Hearts unto God.</hi> I would here avoid all Disputes concerning the <hi>Ordination of Ministers.</hi> In our Assemblies the People bear a part with the Minister or Preacher, in using their Voice in worshiping Almighty God: The <hi>Spirit cannot be limited in its Operations by any thing that is taught</hi> or practised according to any <hi>Order of the Church of</hi> England. We are taught not to <hi>Pray in Man's Will,</hi> but <hi>according to the Will of GOD, which is our Sanctification.</hi> We are taught to <hi>wait for God's Spirit to move us</hi> to the performance of any thing He would have us to do; but we are taught also to believe, that God's Spirit is always ready to assist the <hi>Sincere,</hi> those who desire above all things to do His Will, to worship Him <hi>in Spirit and in Truth,</hi> in Saying or Hearing the Words of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the Congregation. The very moment that any Soul truly devout waits for or expects the assistance of the Spirit of Christ, to help her to perform any known Duty towards GOD, or towards Man, she never fails to receive it. Concerning the <hi>Psalms</hi> I shall speak hereafter. It is the Duty of
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44343:40"/>
all Christians, at all times, and in all places, to retain in their Hearts the <hi>Habit, Ground,</hi> or <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of all those <hi>Holy Desires</hi> which are exprest in the <hi>Lord's Prayer;</hi> this 'tis to pray continually. When the words of this Prayer are recited in the Congregation, it is impossible but those who have the <hi>Habit</hi> of those <hi>Holy Desires</hi> in their Hearts should worship God <hi>in Spirit and in Truth, viz.</hi> in the <hi>act</hi> or <hi>exercise</hi> of those Desires, by the <hi>inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Spirit,</hi> whose operation never ceases, but when Man in his <hi>own Will</hi> or <hi>Self-love</hi> doth suppress or totally extinguish such <hi>Holy Desires</hi> or <hi>Aspirations.</hi> I am very sorry to see so ingenious and learned a person as <hi>R. B.</hi> err so grosly about the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> in which he shews himself tainted with that Impurity of Mind, for which Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> has been so often <hi>corrected, p.</hi> 245. <hi>We know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it self maketh intercession for us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 26. But says <hi>R. B.</hi> 
                  <q>If this Prayer had been such a prescribed Form of Prayer to the Church, that had not been true, neither had they been ignorant what to pray; nor should they have needed the help of the Spirit to teach them, <hi>p.</hi> 245.</q> To this I answer, That it is impossible that any man should <hi>actually know as they ought to know</hi> the sence or meaning of any word in the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> but by an <hi>actual</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Divine Spirit upon his Heart and Mind. I must therefore proclaim to all the World, That it was the Spirit of Error which suggested these words to <hi>R. B.</hi> 
                  <q>If this Prayer had been such a prescribed Prayer to the Church, that had not been true, neither had they been ignorant what to pray; nor should
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44343:40"/>
they have needed the help of the Spirit to teach them.</q> By what I have already said, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that if by these words, <hi>our Adversaries, &amp;c. p.</hi> 264. he means all those who worship God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> he's very <hi>Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable:</hi> 
                  <q>Our Adversaries, says he, whose Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is all, for the most part, <hi>out-side,</hi> and such whose Acts are the meer product of Man's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Will and Abilities; as they can preach, so they can pray when they please, and therefore have their set particular Prayers.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> We acknowledge, that we can never pray as we ought, but by the assistance of the Spirit of God, but his Assistance is always ready for us: If at any time we fail of it, we our selves are the cause we have it not. As to set particular Prayers, we own no Prayer but the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> further than the sense of it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in some part of that Compleat Body of <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayer,</hi> that <hi>Divine Summary</hi> or <hi>Breviary</hi> of the Expressions of all holy Desires, <hi>p.</hi> 266. <q>Because this outward Prayer depends upon the inward, as that which must follow it, and cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably perform'd, but as attended with a superadded Influence and Motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Therefore cannot we prefix set times to pray outwardly, so as to lay a necessity to speak words at such and such times, whether we feel this Heavenly Influence and Assistance or no, for that, we judge, were a tempting of God, and a coming before him without due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</q> To this I answer, That whatever feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we have, or have not in the <hi>Sensitive Powers</hi> or <hi>Faculties</hi> of our Souls, if our <hi>Heart,</hi> our <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Appetite</hi> be rightly affected towards
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44343:41"/>
God, our Prayers will most certainly be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto Him: And His Holy Spirit is always ready to assist every man that believeth in <hi>Iesus,</hi> so to order and dispose his own Spirit, that it may comply with the <hi>Will of God in all things.</hi> It cannot be a Tempting of God, to depend upon him for his gracious Assistance to do his Will: And it is his Will, that in our <hi>Religious Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> we should use Words in Prayer; <q>
                     <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>p.</hi> 268. To desire a man to fall to Prayer e're the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in some measure, less or more, move him thereunto; is to desire a man to see before he open his Eyes.</q> That is an irreverent Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>To fall to Prayer;</hi> but most certainly it is our Duty to call upon all men, who profess Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to observe the Times of the Public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Almighty God; and to testifie to them, that if they will sincerely trust in God for <hi>Christ</hi>'s sake to assist them by his holy Spirit, they shall never fail of his gracious Assistance; He will help their Infirmities, and enable them to cry, <hi>Abba Father, Rom.</hi> 8. 15, 26. <hi>P.</hi> 275. <q>As for the formal customary way of Singing, it hath in Scripture no foundation, nor any ground in true Christianity; yea<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> besides, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> If <hi>by the formal customary way of Singing,</hi> he mean that way of Singing Psalms in <hi>Metre,</hi> or the reading of them in prose, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> is accustomed unto. It is a gross Errour to say, there is no foundation for it in the Scripture; Have we not received a Precept from our Blessed <hi>Lord,</hi> by his Apostle, <hi>to sing and make melody in our Hearts to the Lord?</hi> And can there be any better means to do this, than what the <hi>Apostle</hi> prescribes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44343:41"/>
in these words, <hi>Speaking to your selves in Psalms, and Hymns, and spiritual Songs?</hi> Can there be any better <hi>Psalms, &amp;c.</hi> than those which were most certainly and unquestionably compos'd by <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inspiration?</hi> 
                  <q>Yea, says he, besides all the Abuses incident to Prayer and Preaching, it hath this more peculiar, That oftentimes great and horrid Lyes are said in the sight of God; for all manner of wicked prophane People take</q> upon them to personate the Experiences and Conditions of blessed <hi>David,</hi> which are not <q>only false as to them, but also as to some of more Sobriety, who utter them forth; as where they will Sing sometimes; <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 14. <hi>My heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>My strength is dryed up like a potsheard, and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws, and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</hi> And, <hi>Psal.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</hi> And many more, which those that speak know to be false, as to them.</q> To this I answer, That all the Prayers of wicked prophane People, that is, of those who persist in their Wickedness, whatever words they use in Prayer, <hi>are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord.</hi> What then? Must they be forbid to pray? No surely: But in Praying they must cease to be wicked. And indeed, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that any wicked man should cease to be wicked before he begins to pray. Prayer has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that Priority to ceasing to be wicked, which <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>Priority of Nature.</hi> Before any man can be justly esteemed to be a <hi>Member</hi> of any Christian Assembly or Congregation, he must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that he <hi>believes</hi> the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44343:42"/>
by <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> and consequently that they contain nothing but Truth. And also, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves by the help of God, to take the Truth therein contained to be the Rule of his Life and Conversation. If he be <hi>Sincere</hi> in this Profession (and God only can judge whether he be so, or no, unless he violate his Profession by some no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious contrary Practice) then most certainly he has in his Heart those Holy Desires which are exprest in the <hi>Lord's Prayer.</hi> And as for the <hi>Psalms,</hi> I pray God to make all the Adversaries of the Church of <hi>England</hi> duly sensible of this most important Truth, That though indeed there are many Passages in them, which none of us can apply to himself, as to the <hi>Particularity</hi> of his own Person, yet there is not one Passage in the whole Book, but what every true Christian may and ought to apply to himself, upon account of the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> of the relation He has to the Head, and to every <hi>Member</hi> of the Holy Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church which is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> or in <hi>Earth:</hi> So that every Expression in the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> every sincere Christian (so far as it is intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto him) may use as the Means to stir him up <hi>to Sing and make Melody in his Heart to the Lord;</hi> to form such <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> as shall be most acceptable to God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Certainly, every Man that is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to the Image of the Son of God,</hi> who was all his days here upon Earth, <hi>A man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief.</hi> I say, every <hi>Sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> does most certainly <hi>pour out his Soul before the Lord,</hi> in such Affections as are here exprest in the words of the <hi>Psalmist, My heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my bowels, &amp;c.</hi> I am high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44343:42"/>
delighted with many Passages in <hi>Robert Barclay</hi>'s <hi>Apology,</hi> particularly with this, <hi>p.</hi> 370. <q>It is plain, that men that are taken with Love, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of a Woman, or any other thing, if it hath taken a deep place in the Heart, and possess the Mind, it will be hard for the man so in Love to drive out of his Mind the person or thing so loved: Yea, in his eating, drinking, and sleeping his Mind will always have a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency that way; and in Business, or Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, however intent he be in it, there will but a very short time be permitted to pass, but the Mind will let some Ejaculations forth towards its Beloved. And albeit such a one must be conversant in those things that the Care of this Body and such-like things call for, yet will he avoid, as Death it self, to do those things that may offend the Party so beloved, or cross his Design in obtaining the thing so earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, tho' there may be some small use in them: The great Design, which is chiefly in his Eye, will so balance him, that he will easily look over, and dispense with such petty Necessities rather than endanger the loss of the greater by them. Now, That Men ought to be thus <hi>in love with GOD and the Life to come,</hi> none will deny; and the thing is apparent from these Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 20. <hi>But lay up for your selves treasures in Heaven:</hi> Col. 3. 2. <hi>Set your affections on things above.</hi>
                  </q> In the light of the sincere Love of God may be clearly seen how abominable such Conceits are, which have been publish'd of late by persons of great Wit, professing Christianity, and receiv'd by many with great Applause, namely this, That it may be esteem'd

                  <q>COncerning the Thoughts of Man, I will consider them first singly, and afterwards in Train, or Dependance upon one another: Singly, they are every one a <hi>Representation,</hi> or <hi>Apparence</hi> of some Quality or other Accident of a Body without us; which is commonly call'd an <hi>Object.</hi> Which Object worketh on the Eyes, Ears, and other Parts of Man's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and by diversity of working, produces diversity of Apparances.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>The Original of them all, is that which we call SENSE (for there is no Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Man's Mind, which hath not at first totally, or by parts, been begotten upon the Organs of Sense): The rest are deriv'd from that Original.</q>

               <p>Here he lays the Foundation of all <hi>Sin,</hi> and <hi>Errour:</hi> For certainly nothing can more <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crassate,</hi> and <hi>sensuallize the Intellect,</hi> than such an Opinion, that we cannot have a <hi>Conception</hi> of any thing, but what is <hi>Sensible,</hi> or <hi>Corporeal:</hi> For if this were true, it would necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That we cannot have any Conception, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Apprehension of GOD, <hi>viz.</hi> Of a <hi>Spirit,</hi> or <hi>Being Incorporeal,</hi> Infinite in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.

by which it subsisteth, and <hi>the matter wherein it communicateth;</hi> it followeth of necessity, that it is endowed with Rights correspondent to those wherein the Soveraignty of States consisteth. The Power of the Sword is the Principal of Rights into which the rest are resolv'd, when they are enforc'd to have recourse unto it, for the execution of that, which becomes requisite to make them available. And the Church hath the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, which is used two manner of ways, as the Sword is, either to subdue Strangers, or to cut off Malefactors.</q>

Saints, and all the Histories of Apparitions and Ghosts, alledg'd by the Doctors of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make good their Doctrine of <hi>Hell</hi> and <hi>Purgatory,</hi> the power of Exorcism, and other Doctrines, which have no warrant, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Reason nor Scripture.</q> In the 44th <hi>Chapter</hi> he has provided a comfortable state for the Reprobate, after the Resurrection, instead of that state of ineffable Torments, which all true Christians acknowledge to be signified by the Torments of Hell. <q>The Reprobate, says he, shall be in the estate that <hi>Adam</hi> and his Posterity were in after the Sin committed. The Wicked, says he in the same Chapter, being left in the estate they were in after <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, may at the Resurrection live, as they did, Marry, and give in Marriage, and have gross and corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible Bodies, as all Mankind now have, and consequently may engender perpetually after the Resurrection, as they did before.</q>

I shall most earnestly entreat those young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in Divinity, who shall cast an Eye on these Papers, that they would read all that has been written against <hi>T. H.</hi> by this most Renowned Archbishop, and hy the Right Reverend Father in God the late Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and by the Reverend and Learned Dr. <hi>H. More,</hi> Dr. <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rock,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Cumberland.</hi> Other excellent Men have abundantly confuted his Wicked Errors, but I have been chiefly conversant in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of those I have here mention'd. I cannot but recite a few Lines of my Lord Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s excellent Sermon concerning <hi>the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, Danger, and Remedies of Infidelity,</hi> which <hi>T. H.</hi> would not acknowledg to be a Sin. The Author of the <hi>Leviathan, Cap.</hi> 41. <hi>p.</hi> 286. tells us in plain terms, <q>That we do not read any where (in the Scriptures) that they which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the Doctrin of Christ did therein sin.</q>

               <p>
                  <q>And again, That the Injunctions of Christ, and his Apostles, Men might refufe without Sin.</q> Now, concerning this Assertion, I cannot chuse but say, that had I not been acquainted with the Works of that Author, especially those rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Religion, I should exceedingly wonder at i<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In the 21st of <hi>Matthew</hi> our Saviour asks the <hi>Iews</hi> this Question, <hi>Did ye never read in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures such a thing?</hi> A Question which I must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to the Asserters of this Doctrin: Did they never read in the Scriptures the Sinfulness, the

Danger, the Hainousness of Infidelity? Surely he that runs may read it.</p>
               <p>His Lordship's <hi>Exercitatio in Thomae Hobbii Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophiam,</hi> printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> 1656. prov'd a most effectual <hi>Antidote</hi> against the Plague of the <hi>Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> Errors, which at that time began to spread most dreadfully.</p>
               <p>Since I had fitted these Animadversions for the Press, there came to my Hands a Book, entituled, <hi>An Answer to a late Book publisht by Dr.</hi> Bramhal, <hi>late Bishop of</hi> Derry, <hi>called,</hi> The Catching of the <hi>Leviathan.</hi> I wish some Learned Man would publish a Reply to it, to vindicate the Honour of that most renowned Prelate. If the Charge I have brought against <hi>T. H.</hi> in these Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions be true, that Monument of his Reputation (which some may conceit to have been) erected in this Book, will most certainly, in the Judgment of all Men, fall to the Ground; the weakness whereof in one particular I shall here demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p>He affirms, That <hi>Atheism is a Sin of Ignorance;</hi> and he conceits, that he sufficiently <hi>exposes</hi> the most Reverend Archbishop by this pitiful <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phism.</hi>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> To have an <hi>Aversion</hi> to the Notion or Conception of a <hi>Being Infinite in all Perfection,</hi> is to <hi>Malice</hi> or <hi>Hate</hi> GOD: And such an <hi>Aversion</hi> is the grossest <hi>Atheism.

                  <q>Now I pray thee, Reader, What is all this to thee, or me?</q> Is it nothing to me, that my God is the Infinity of True Beauty, that He

is all that I can desire, all that deserves my Love? The Divine Beauty implies the Glory of infinite Goodness, Wisdom, and Power, and is all this nothing to me? It implies the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Justice of the Divine <hi>Vengeance</hi> on Impenitent Sinners, as they are Impenitent, and the Glory of Infinite Mercy towards Sinners, that repent, or such, who, tho they do not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent, have not so hardened their hearts, but that they are capable of Repentance: And is all this nothing to me? Is it nothing to me, that the Divine Beauty being Infinite, is in all <hi>Things</hi> and <hi>Events (Sin</hi> only excepted); so that whilst I sincerely believe in <hi>IESUS,</hi> all the Objects of my Thoughts are Matter of Joy and Satisfaction unto me? The <hi>King of Terrors</hi> ceases to be terrible, and becomes a most useful <hi>Subject</hi> to those that obey the <hi>Royal Law of Liberty,</hi> and so become Kings, and <hi>More than Conquerors</hi> over all their Enemies.

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Divine Beauty is <hi>All Things</hi> to me.

If I obtain either of them, I have already a sufficient Reward: Yet I hope for a greater from that Lord, whom I have thus endeavoured to serve, and who hath said, <hi>Blessed are the Peace-makers.</hi>

of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>Corrupt</hi> and Destroy Her. I grant, That an <hi>Unlawful Petition</hi> in the Public Prayers, is no sufficient Cause for any Man to separate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from such a <hi>Religious Assembly,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he should he obliged to frequent. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more notoriously repugnant to the Principles of <hi>Common Honesty,</hi> than for any Man to make the most Solemn and Express Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of believing that which indeed he does not believe. Every one that professes himself to be a Member of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> makes the most Solemn and Express Profession of Believing, that <hi>Our Lord Iesus Christ is God of God, Light of Light, Very God of Very God, Begotten, not Made,</hi> 
                  <q>being of One Substance with the Father, by whom all things were made. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</q> 
                  <hi>are the Peace-makers,</hi> but Cursed are they that deny our Lord Jesus Christ to be the True and Eternal God, whosoever thus <hi>detracts</hi> from Him the <hi>Infinity</hi> of his Glory, he does not love Him: And 'tis known to all that read or hear the Holy Scriptures, what the Apostle says: <q>Is any love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be <hi>Anathema, Maran-atha.</hi>

                     <p>I AM heartily sorry that you have given so great Scandal not only to the <hi>Socinians,</hi> by asserting that most detestable Conceit of the <hi>Three Infinite Spirits,</hi> but also to the <hi>Deists,</hi> by denying, that Six of their Seven Propositions may be known without external Revelation; whereas it is most certain that they are all implied in the True Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Idea of God, whose Existence, you grant, may be known without such a Revelation. I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert, That the <hi>principal Motive</hi> that any man can have to believe, that the Holy Scriptures were written by Divine Inspiration, is, That the sence of them is so agreeable to that which the <hi>Only wise God</hi> hath written in the Hearts of all Men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Lord give you Understanding in all things.</hi> So prayeth for you, and for all Men, as he desires that all Sincere Christians should pray for him,</p>

               <p>Tho' I grant, that the Truth of those Seven Propositions may be known without external Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, yet I assert, That 'tis Ten thousand times more casie to come to that Knowledge by the Revelation which Almighty God has given us
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:44343:62"/>
in the Holy Scriptures than without it: And therefore we ought to give continual Thanks to the God of Truth, for vouchsafing to us so great a Blessing. The Seventh Proposition is this: <hi>That when we err from the Rules of our Duty, we ought to repent, and trust in God's Mercy for Pardon.</hi> What it is to Repent no Man shall ever <hi>practically</hi> or <hi>ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually understand,</hi> unless he be taught of <hi>GOD:</hi> And 'tis Ten thousand times more likely that such a Man will be <hi>taught of God,</hi> who with an honest Heart reads or hears <hi>the Holy Scriptures,</hi> than he who is altogether ignorant of them, or who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read them will not believe that they were written by Divine Inspiration. To <hi>Repent</hi> is to cease to live unto our selves, and to live unto Him that dy'd for us, and arose again; of which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> we become <hi>capable</hi> only by the <hi>Death of Christ,</hi> whom the Holy Scriptures call <hi>the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World.</hi> The Apostle says expresly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. That <hi>he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them and rose again.</hi> In the Ninth Chapter of the <hi>Epistle to the Hebrews</hi> are these words: <hi>If the blood of bulls, and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctifieth to the purifying of the flesh, how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal spirit offered up himself without spot to God, purge your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science from dead works to serve the livingood?</hi> From this Concession of the <hi>Deists,</hi> That God is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely just and insinitely merciful, I infer, That His <hi>Hatred</hi> to Sin, and his <hi>Love</hi> to Sinners, are both Infinite. I suppose they will grant, that He is Infinite in Goodness, in Wisdom, in Power, and in all Perfection. From hence I infer, That in His Infinite Wisdom he hath-contriv'd some way
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:44343:62"/>
by his Infinite Power to make a demonstration to <hi>Sinners</hi> of his Infinite <hi>Love, Benevolence,</hi> or <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicativeness of the True Good</hi> even to them, so far as they are capable of it: But it implies a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that they should be capable of, or in a power to receive the <hi>True Good</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Satisfaction,</hi> but only by <hi>Repentance,</hi> or turning of their <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Intellectual Appetite</hi> to God, as to its <hi>principal</hi> or <hi>ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Object.</hi> It implies a contradiction to say, That Infinite Wisdom could contrive a better way than this to bring <hi>Sinners to Repentance, viz.</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate to them, that tho' the <hi>Hatred</hi> which the great and good God has to every Sin is Infinite, nevertheless his <hi>Love</hi> to every Sinner capable of Repentance is also Infinite: And this demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Infinite Justice, and Infinite Mercy and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Goodness of God those that <hi>believe the Gospel</hi> clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive in <hi>the sacrifice of the Death of Christ.</hi> Whatsoever we find in the Holy Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Death of Christ, and the Benefits which we receiue thereby,</hi> is most perfectly agreeable to all those notions of the Divine Justice and Mercy, which are suggested unto us by the <hi>Innate Idea of God;</hi> to the <hi>contemplation</hi> whereof I earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all those Men who call themselves <hi>Deists,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching Almighty God, the Father of Mercies and God of all Consolation, <hi>to lift up the light of his countenance upon them, to give them the light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</hi> I declare to all the World, that I have not such In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation to these <hi>Open Enemies,</hi> as I have to such <hi>Traytors</hi> to the Church of Christ, as the Author of that most execrable Pamphlet, entituled, <hi>The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Gospel.</hi> I shall here impart to the candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der some of my Reflections on that Infamous Scribler, tho' it has been already sufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:44343:63"/>
I consider that Saying of the Wise Man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 19. <hi>In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.</hi> And therefore I would rather chuse to be blamed by my best Friends for using so <hi>few words</hi> in any <hi>Theological</hi> Controversie, than be ever guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of publishing of any one Assertion, especially concerning the Doctrin of the <hi>holy, blessed,</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Trinity,</hi> which I should not be able to <hi>vindicate</hi> against a more <hi>subtile Sophister</hi> than <hi>Socinus</hi> himself.</p>
               <p>A strange Confidence it is in this <hi>Anti-trinitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> to scoff at us for saying, That <hi>the Doctrin of the Trinity is a Mystery:</hi> Does not the holy Apostle say expresly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Without controversie great is the mystery of godliness?</hi> God was manifest in the Flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Is not the Nature of God <hi>incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> to any Finite Understanding? And shall any Man undertake to determine <hi>how</hi> GOD could be made <hi>Man;</hi> how the <hi>Creator</hi> could assume a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Nature?</hi> But, that Christ is <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> is a Truth as certain and unquestionable as it is that these Texts of Scripture were written by <hi>Divine Inspiration, Iohn</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16, 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 28. I shall here recite some of the words of this <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinitarian,</hi> whom surely we may most justly call <hi>Anti-christian:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>P. 48. <q>To this Objection of the <hi>Romanists,</hi> and to others of the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> we have found an Answer, That we must not infer from our own Nature to God's, for that ours is Finite, and Gods is Infinite. Three Persons among Us are three Men, because they agree in one common nature; but the Divine Nature is not a common one, but a singular; and therefore three Persons do not make three Gods. If you understand not this, you must not wonder, at least you must not gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say it, for it is a Mystery which Reason may not presume to fathom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:44343:63"/>
Is there any thing more reasonable than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that in God, the <hi>One Infinite Essence,</hi> there may be a certain <hi>Trinity</hi> which cannot in any wise appertain to any Three Persons of a <hi>Finite Nature?</hi> Can there ever be a more impious Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity than this, to deny the Truth of that which the Almighty and Incomprehensible GOD, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in whose Name we are baptised, has reveal'd unto us concerning Himself, because we cannot find any thing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly like it even amongst the best of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? To say, That we ought not to believe any thing but what our Reason can <hi>fathom</hi> or <hi>comprehend,</hi> is in effect to say, We ought not to believe there is a God, it being <hi>Essential</hi> to the <hi>Deity</hi> to be infinitely beyond the <hi>comprehension</hi> of our Reason.</p>
               <p>P. 40. <q>The great Question concerning the Godhead of Christ is impertinent to our Lord's Design. 2. Fruitless to the Contemplator's own purpose.</q> 3. Dangerous.</p>
               <p>P. 53. <q>There is danger of Blasphemy in examining the silly Question concerning the Eternity of the Godhead of Christ.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Certainly it was most pertinent to our Lord's design, that we should worship the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as the <hi>Only True God;</hi> and this we cannot do, unless we believe Him to be <hi>Eternal.</hi> To question the Godhead of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, is not only fruitless and dangerous, but <hi>diabolically</hi> impious and pernicious. But nothing can more require the greatest ardency of our most zealous Endeavours, than to suppress the confidence of those Men, who pretend by their Reason to baffle the <hi>Divine Wisdom,</hi> and by the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44343:64"/>
force of a little <hi>Sophistry</hi> to eclipse the <hi>Eternal Brightness of the Glory of the Father of Lights.</hi> It is fruitless to the Contemplator's own purpose, to consider, that He whom he believes to be his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is a Person of Infinite Power and Majesty? Will not the genuine force and efficacy of this consideration produce in a true Believer the <hi>Fruit of the Spirit,</hi> viz. <hi>Love, Ioy, Peace, Long-suffering, Gentleness, Goodness, Faith, Meekness, Temperance?</hi> Most certainly he's in great danger of <hi>Hell-fire</hi> that calls this Truth into question, that our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> is the true and eternal God: But nothing can more conduce to our Safety and Everlasting Consolation, than a firm adherence to this Assertion, That our <hi>Saviour</hi> is Almighty, which he could not be, if he were not the True and Eternal God: For, as there is but <hi>One Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> so there is but <hi>One Almighty.</hi> I have seen divers <hi>Excellent Books,</hi> that have been written against this <hi>wicked Pamphlet,</hi> therefore I shall say no more of it, but only this; That I wish its being <hi>burnt</hi> may mind the Author of that Fire <hi>which shall never be quenched.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the writing hereof, I have read a Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet with this <hi>fantastick Title, The Antapology of the Melancholy Stander-by.</hi> In <hi>Pag.</hi> 41. I find such a scandalous Objection against the Creed of St. <hi>Athanasius,</hi> that I think it my Duty, with all possible speed, to publish my Answer to it, and Resentment of it, as coming from one who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses himself to be a Son of the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland:</hi> He recites these words of the Creed: <q>The Father is eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Ghost eternal, and yet they are not Three eternals, but One eternal: As also there
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:44343:64"/>
are not Three Incomprehensibles; nor Three Uncreated, but One Uncreated, and One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible. Suppose now, says this <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus,</hi> a Man should thus argue hence; If there are Three, yet not Three Uncreated, but One Uncreated, then Two of the Three must be Created; for the Three must be either Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</q> or Uncreated; that is, eternally existent. I affirm, That if any Man should thus argue, the Answer would be ready, That the Epithets <hi>Incomprehensible</hi> and <hi>Uncreated,</hi> are attributed to the <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as these Three are One, and have one Essence Uncreated, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, or Incomprehensible. It does no more follow, That if there are Three, yet not Three Uncreated, but One Uncreated, and then Two of the Three must be Created; than that if there are Three, yet not Three Gods, but One God, then Two of the Three must not be God. Here the <hi>Anonymus</hi> plainly discovers the falseness of his Heart; whatever he pretends, he is a <hi>Deserter of the Catholic Faith.</hi> As for his most Impious Endeavours to make his Reader to <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> that most <hi>wholsome Petition</hi> in the <hi>Litiny,</hi> which being rightly used, cures the Soul of all <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Error, O holy, blessed, and glorious Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Three Persons, and One God, have mercy upon us miserable Sinners;</hi> I shall say no more at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent but only this: That if this Writer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Temporal Benefit, as a Priest of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> he deserves the <hi>Character</hi> of a <hi>Thief</hi> and a <hi>Robber.</hi> And as I profess my self to be a True Son of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and consequently of the Universal <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> I make my Appeal against
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:44343:65"/>
