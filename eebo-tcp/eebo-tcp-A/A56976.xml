         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

shall be what thou wilt. Give him
Education in good Letters, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of thy ability, and his capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Season his youth with the love of
his <hi>Creatour,</hi> and make the feare of
his God the beginning of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
If he have an active spirit,
rather rectifie then curbe it; but rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
idlenesse among his chiefest
faults. Above all things, keep him
from vain, lascivious and amorous
Pamphlets, as the <hi>Primmers</hi> of all
Vice. As his judgement ripens, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
his inclination, and tender him
<pb facs="tcp:36476:117"/>
a <hi>Calling,</hi> that shall not crosse it:
Forced <hi>Marriages</hi> and <hi>Callings</hi> sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
prosper; shew him both the
<hi>Mow,</hi> and the <hi>Plough;</hi> and prepare
him as well for the danger of the
<hi>Skirmish,</hi> as possesse him with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the prize. If he chuse the
profession of a Schollar, advise him
to study the most profitable arts: <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,</hi>
and the <hi>Mathematicks,</hi> take up
too great a latitude of the soule, and
moderately used, are good <hi>Recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
but bad <hi>Callings,</hi> being nothing
but their owne <hi>Rewrd:</hi> if he chuse
the profession of a <hi>Souldier,</hi> let him
know, withall, <hi>Honour</hi> must be his
greatest wages, and his enemies his
surest <hi>Paymaster.</hi> Prepare him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the danger of a Warre, and
advise him of the greater mischiefes
of a <hi>Garrison;</hi> let him avoid <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchnesse,</hi>
and <hi>Duels</hi> to the utmost
of his power, and remember he is
not his owne man, and (being his
Countries servant) hath no estate in
<pb facs="tcp:36476:118"/>
his owne life. If he chuse a <hi>Trade,</hi>
teach him to forget his Fathers
<hi>House,</hi> and his Mothers <hi>Wing:</hi> Advise
him to be conscionable, carefull, and
constant: This done, thou hast done
thy part, leave the rest to <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi>
and thou hast done it well.</p>
