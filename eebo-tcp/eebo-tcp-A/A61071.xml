            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He is truly Noble, that knows how to rejoyce in Crosses, as well as in Contents; that will not think of Desperation, nor be urged with Impatience. The Body of a wise man, is a House unto the Soul; but to the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, a Prison: for the discontented man is a slave to his own humours, and a Prisoner in a double sense. Nor can the Soul of a discreet man be confined, more than the windy breath of <hi>Boreas;</hi> or as easie is it to shut up the bright beams of light within a Chrystal. No Prison in the world, be it famous, or infamous, can be so deep, as to bury; so dark, as to blind; so strait, so crooked, so narrow, as to bind the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of a wise man: for wisdom is the wing of the Soul, that bears it not only out of Prison, but to all the parts of the Terrestrial Globe. A continuation of which happiness, is heartily wished by</p>

            <lg>
               <l>AMong those Tales that Story doth repeat,</l>
               <l>I find not one that doth of <hi>Hunger</hi> treat,</l>
               <l>That may compare to ours His <hi>Grace</hi> the DUKE:</l>
               <l>Hath daily giv'n to All a just Rebuke.</l>
               <l>His Glories we in ancient Stories read,</l>
               <l>How, and with whom his <hi>Grace</hi> was pleas'd to <hi>feed:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Not with Ambassadors, who came to view</l>
               <l>Those Rarities they heard of, never knew;</l>
               <l>Nor doth the DUKE his Invitations send</l>
               <l>To Princes, or to those that on them tend,</l>
               <l>But payes his kindness to an <hi>hungry maw;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>His Charity's his Reason, and his Law.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99744:20"/>Shall any Mortal then, that knows a Verse,</l>
               <l>Withdraw his Pen, his bounty to rehearse?</l>
               <l>How many poor distressed Knights hath he</l>
               <l>Freely reliev'd in their Necessity!</l>
               <l>How open is his Table unto all,</l>
               <l>To those that come without, or with a call!</l>
               <l>Nay, which is more, his <hi>Genius</hi> so is bent,</l>
               <l>He'd ne'r admit one Penny should be spent!</l>
               <l>For to say truth, <hi>Hunger</hi> hath hundreds brought</l>
               <l>To <hi>Dine with him,</hi> and all not worth a Groat.</l>
               <l>Some with their Beads unto a Pillar crowd;</l>
               <l>Some mutter forth, some say their Graces loud;</l>
               <l>Some on Devotion came to feed their Muse;</l>
               <l>Some came to sleep, or walk, or talk of News.</l>
               <l>For though they came to <hi>Dine,</hi> they loathed Meat;</l>
               <l>For many had almost forgot to eat.</l>
               <l>My self oft-times did at his Table sit,</l>
               <l>When neither I, nor others eat one bit.</l>
               <l>But come they did, or else they'd been to blame;</l>
               <l>To pay their Duty to the DUKE, they came:</l>
               <l>And of their visits, since they came in love,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His Grace</hi> did daily thankfully approve.</l>
               <l>Some came with jingling Spurs instead of Chink,</l>
               <l>For that was melted on their Mornings drink;</l>
               <l>And drink they must; I never yet knew one</l>
               <l>Could quench his thirst, with reading Doctor <hi>Donne:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Nor is it easie for a common eye</l>
               <l>To draw the substance of an Elegy;</l>
               <l>Nay some, though old, could sooner eat a staff,</l>
               <l>Than suck the marrow of an Epitaph.</l>
               <l>Some came with Rags scarce hid their Bodies o're;</l>
               <l>Some with foul Cuffs, wash't but three months before;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99744:20"/>Some as dull Lovers, in a silent mood,</l>
               <l>Walk't as if melancholy was their food.</l>
               <l>The Learned call them <hi>Amorists,</hi> a name</l>
               <l>As none more frequent in the Book of Fame.</l>
               <l>Those Heroes that in upper Regions move,</l>
               <l>Grew proud below, 'cause they could live to love;</l>
               <l>And with aspiring thoughts, still soaring high,</l>
               <l>They liv'd, and lov'd, and loving, liv'd, to dye.</l>
               <l>These <hi>Amorists</hi> of whom we now do talk,</l>
               <l>Took great delight to trace our private Walk:</l>
               <l>With folded Arms, and Hat below his brow,</l>
               <l>He seems to count his gentle steps, or how</l>
               <l>Much full of misery he now is in,</l>
               <l>Wishing he ne're had lov'd, or ne're had been;</l>
               <l>Anon bethinks himself he did amiss,</l>
               <l>Behold this place <hi>Diana</hi>'s Temple is:</l>
               <l>All Profanation straight way hence must flee,</l>
               <l>Or that great Goddess won't propitious be;</l>
               <l>Then to a corner, with a silent Air,</l>
               <l>Addresses he to <hi>Venus</hi> makes in prayer.</l>
               <l>There leave we him studying a fresh Caress,</l>
               <l>Whilst we press on into the crowd of Guess;</l>
               <l>And such a Crowd was never seen before,</l>
               <l>To visit Dukes, or to approach their dore.</l>
               <l>Some came with Shooes, that fear'd to touch the ground;</l>
               <l>Some with half-hose, to shew their shins were sound;</l>
               <l>Some decay'd Scholars, with their loyns begirt;</l>
               <l>Some with half-sleeves (poor Souls) but ne're a shirt;</l>
               <l>Some so attended in their wretched state,</l>
               <l>Thousands' did hourly round about them wait;</l>
               <l>That men might see, although but single-ey'd,</l>
               <l>Like persons great they were well fortify'd.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99744:21"/>And well observ'd it was, by men of skill,</l>
               <l>Their Births were high, on Mountain, or on Hill.</l>
               <l>Some even ere their <hi>Dinner</hi> had an end,</l>
               <l>Would boldly dare to kill their <hi>bosome-friend:</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And in that act, this was their usual cry,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>So let Blood-suckers, and Back-biters dye.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Some came with Cloaks, though thredbare as their Lawn;</l>
               <l>Some came without; for why? they were at pawn;</l>
               <l>Some though they knew their Pockets had no stock,</l>
               <l>Could talk, look big, and make their Beavers cock.</l>
               <l>And well they might, for as in Bed they lay,</l>
               <l>The Rats had almost eat the brims away;</l>
               <l>For they were so well oy'ld with store of fat,</l>
               <l>For Roast-meat they might pass with Mouse or Rat.</l>
               <l>Yet though the brims were swallow'd by the swarm,</l>
               <l>They left the Crowns to keep their Noddles warm;</l>
               <l>As if the Vermine modestly should say,</l>
               <l>We know your births, though fallen to decay:</l>
               <l>And did demonstrate by their knowing Art,</l>
               <l>Of Hats, for warmth, Crowns was the chiefest part.</l>
               <l>Some Pedagogues to set their Learning forth,</l>
               <l>Discourse in Latin, of <hi>his Graces</hi> worth;</l>
               <l>They that could understand that tongue might speak,</l>
               <l>But all abhorr'd the hideous noise of Greek.</l>
               <l>Perhaps among the Crowd a Sword was seen,</l>
               <l>But rusty grown, in <hi>Holland</hi> it had been:</l>
               <l>And he that wore it, walk't with such a grace,</l>
               <l>As who should say, My steps shall speak my race.</l>
               <l>A waggish Boy not yet discreetly grown,</l>
               <l>To understand the Virtues of the Town,</l>
               <l>Walk't by, but kept at distance, as afear'd,</l>
               <l>Still looking back, and as he look't, he snear'd.</l>

               <l>But all in vain; at which the Captain curs't,</l>
               <l>Whilst standers by, with laughing almost burst.</l>
               <l>For as it afterwards appear'd, his Blade</l>
               <l>Had cut its way through <hi>Europe</hi> since 'twas made;</l>
               <l>And 'cause for many years it did not peep,</l>
               <l>The Captain will'd it might in Scabbard sleep.</l>
               <l>Nor was the Captains courage then adust,</l>

               <l>That it defy'd the rules of Martial Law,</l>
               <l>And dar'd the Captain, if he durst, to draw.</l>
               <l>The angry Captain cryes, <hi>I could be mad,</hi>

               <l>
                  <hi>Thus to be ty'd to what I never had.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Just then a zealous Student passing by,</l>

               </l>
               <l>He gave his grave advice, with whites so ey'd,</l>

               </l>
               <l>The Captain by his frowns appear'd as vex't,</l>
               <l>Which put the Parson quite beside his Text.</l>
               <l>The Guests being met, and all prepar'd to eat,</l>
               <l>What next should come, but what they want, their meat?</l>
               <l>Much bussling then appear'd, a general strife</l>
               <l>There was, contending where to whet a Knife.</l>

               <l>But some whose judgments deeper far could look,</l>
               <l>Would only stamp, and frown, and curse the Cook;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99744:22"/>And justly too: for when they all did think</l>
               <l>To be well-cram'd with store of meat and drink,</l>
               <l>The gen'rous DUKE appear'd, and speaking fair,</l>
               <l>Quoth he, <hi>My Friends, fall to, a Dish of Air</hi>
               </l>

               <l>
                  <hi>Because we know ye all do Stomacks bring.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Much discontent sate on each others brow,</l>
               <l>Their food was thin; however none knew how</l>
               <l>To shew their ill resentments, but as men</l>
               <l>Well-pacifi'd, agreed to come agen.</l>
               <l>But ere that happy day was fully grown,</l>
               <l>A dreadful Fire consumes the Kitchin down:</l>
               <l>Which Fire began not in <hi>his Graces</hi> house,</l>
               <l>But thither came, and Burnt both Rat and Mouse.</l>
               <l>On which the DUKE, to shun a scorching doom,</l>
               <l>Perambulated to <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi>'s Tomb,</l>
               <l>Where <hi>Shakespear, Spencer, Cambden,</hi> and the rest,</l>
               <l>Once rising Suns, are now set in the West;</l>
               <l>But still their lustres do so brightly shine,</l>
               <l>That they invite our Worthies there to Dine,</l>
               <l>Where their moist Marbles seem for grief to weep,</l>
               <l>That they, but stone, should Sacred Reliques keep:</l>
               <l>And some have fancied that they've heard them sing,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Within this place is</hi> Aganippe'<hi>s Spring.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>There our ingenious Train have thought it fit</l>
               <l>To change their Dyet, and to Dine on Wit.</l>
               <l>First with a free consent they all combine</l>
               <l>To pay their visits unto <hi>Cataline,</hi>

               <l>

               <l>To stand near him, b'ing <hi>fair,</hi> and <hi>silent</hi> too:</l>
               <l>For if some Ladies stood but in her stead,</l>
               <l>Their Clappers would go nigh to wake the dead.</l>
               <l>Hard by this famous Dame, with well-grown Locks,</l>

               <l>For two such Dishes at one single meal,</l>
               <l>Would like two Thieves into the Senses steal;</l>
               <l>And such a Surfeit cause, that by their pain,</l>
               <l>They'd judg't unsafe to feed on Wit again.</l>
               <l>Our DUKE by this time spies a <hi>Fairy Queen,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>And as a man surpriz'd with Fits o'th' Spleen,</l>
               <l>Such strange infusions did his passions move,</l>
               <l>That he must live to dote, or dye in love.</l>
               <l>Her to behold, is to be blind, or frantick;</l>
               <l>To speak her Fame, would seem as if Romantick.</l>
               <l>Her eyes shoot Darts, which at the heart you'd feel,</l>
               <l>Who like <hi>Achilles</hi> Lance, both hurt and heal.</l>
               <l>By which the world may judge his <hi>Grace</hi> had skill</l>
               <l>In beauties, finding out those eyes that kill.</l>
               <l>The great <hi>Apelles</hi> was for Painting rare,</l>
               <l>Yet never drew a beauty half so fair.</l>
               <l>Art may contrive a curious <hi>Golden Fleece,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But this <hi>Fair Queen</hi> is Natures Master-piece.</l>

               <l>Or a fair Shepherdess with Garlands crown'd,</l>
               <l>With other Nymphs to dance the Maypole round?</l>

               <l>Next day came tripping in a light-heel'd Girl,</l>
               <l>Adorn'd with Ribbons, Paints, and Bastard-pearl.</l>
               <l>We need not speak of either feet or legs,</l>

               <l>Others reply, <hi>But she's a seeming Saint.</hi>

               <l>Nor was there want of Pocket-pickers there,</l>

               <l>Mean time <hi>his Grace,</hi> whose passion still grew high</l>
               <l>With pangs of pensiveness, was standing by;</l>
               <l>Musing, not minding either Guests, or Meat,</l>
               <l>His busie-brain allow'd no time to eat:</l>
               <l>With starv'ling Body, and with ghastly look,</l>
               <l>He seem'd more like a <hi>Devil,</hi> than a DUKE.</l>
               <l>His Eyes grew gogled, Cheeks were pale and wan;</l>
               <l>Sometimes he sighs, anon doth curse and ban.</l>
               <l>Presently afterwards is heard to cry,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>Oh that I had not lovd, or now could dye!</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Finding no answer to each kind address,</l>
               <l>And that she would not love for love express;</l>
               <l>He with himself resolves when stronger grown,</l>
               <l>To move from thence with thoughts to see the Town.</l>
               <l>Then to the <hi>Gatehouse</hi> went, as nearest to him,</l>
               <l>Where he no sooner came, but divers knew him.</l>
               <l>A Flock of Wretches do <hi>his Grace</hi> environ,</l>
               <l>All lin'd with Vermine, some with Chains of Iron.</l>
               <l>After some mutual Complements were past,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His Grace</hi> to <hi>Covent-garden</hi> maketh haste;</l>
               <l>For some there were that for <hi>his Grace</hi> had staid,</l>
               <l>And till he came, at Post and Pillar plaid:</l>
               <l>And that I briefly may their worth express,</l>
               <l>These the gentilest were of all his Guests;</l>
               <l>Only a faculty they had to curse,</l>
               <l>To Raut, and Huff, like Gyants; Nay, what's worse,</l>
               <l>They'd Ramble all the Night, and Windows break,</l>
               <l>Then in a Crowd to the <hi>Piazza's</hi> sneak.</l>
               <l>Some Whore away their Coyn, and then with grief</l>
               <l>They humbly come, and beg the DUKES relief;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99744:24"/>And swear <hi>God-dam-'em</hi> they <hi>his Grace</hi> will serve,</l>
               <l>And for his sake they'll even dare to starve.</l>
               <l>The DUKE return'd his thanks you well may think,</l>
               <l>But would however stay with none to drink.</l>
               <l>Then to the <hi>Temple, Lincolns-Inne,</hi> and <hi>Grayes,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>He walks, but yet at none of either stayes:</l>
               <l>For his resolves were now for <hi>Newgate</hi> bent,</l>
               <l>Where some of his acquaintance fast were pent.</l>
               <l>First to the <hi>Master-side</hi> without delay,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>His Grave</hi> thought fit he should his Visit pay;</l>
               <l>Having with busie eye the Rooms survey'd,</l>
               <l>He call'd the Nurse, one that was once a Maid:</l>
               <l>And having shewn her where the Cobwebs hung,</l>
               <l>He chid her, and in wrath away he flung;</l>
               <l>Shook hands with some whom he of old had knew,</l>
               <l>And only cry'd, <hi>We're glad you're well, adieu.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Some that ne'r knew him, might perhaps suppose</l>
               <l>Him noble by his Title, and his Cloaths;</l>
               <l>Both were grown ancient, and could justly vye</l>
               <l>With any Dukedom for Antiquity.</l>
               <l>But those that did expect they should behold</l>
               <l>Some gallant Complements in yellow gold,</l>
               <l>Were much mistaken; for the DUKE ne'r went</l>
               <l>To visit any one with such intent:</l>
               <l>For he ne'r lov'd to suffer Cash so near him,</l>
               <l>For which some Wags behind his back would jeer him.</l>
               <l>Now to the <hi>Felons</hi> Jayle he bends his march,</l>
               <l>Where being come, one that was chiefly arch</l>
               <l>Accosted him in complemental strain;</l>
               <l>Whereat the DUKE forthwith vouchsaf't to deign</l>
               <l>An answer; what it was I've quite forgot,</l>
               <l>But as I guess, 'twas either sense, or not.</l>
               <l>

               <l>But only they were Hang'd a while before:</l>

               <l>The <hi>Fleet</hi> he likewise call'd upon, but there</l>
               <l>Were few that knew the DUKE, each one did stare</l>
               <l>Upon <hi>his Grace,</hi> and Censures past aloud;</l>
               <l>For they indeed are generally proud,</l>

               <l>Into the number of a multitude.</l>

               <l>From hence <hi>his Grace</hi> to <hi>Southwark</hi> bends his course,</l>
               <l>And to the <hi>Marshalsey</hi> with eager force</l>

               <l>Complements flew like Hail-stones round about,</l>
               <l>As if the DUKE when in, would ne're get out:</l>
               <l>Forty and odd a Circle round him lay,</l>
               <l>That to get loose, 'twas hard to find the way.</l>
               <l>Besides, I've read it in some Book or Song,</l>
               <l>That each of these were Twenty-thousand strong;</l>
               <l>And I that on his <hi>Grace</hi> did daily watch,</l>

               <l>To be too busie with his private Ware.</l>
               <l>But I can this with modesty assure,</l>
               <l>To scratch, or itch, the DUKE could ne're indure;</l>
               <l>And whether in that Crowd he Vermin got,</l>
               <l>Or Crab-lice had before, I know it not:</l>
               <l>Much honour for the DUKE they joyntly own,</l>
               <l>Talk freely with him, as if wealthy grown.</l>

               <l>The DUKE his grave Advice bestows on all,</l>

                  <hi>Despair's the issue of ignoble minds.</hi>
