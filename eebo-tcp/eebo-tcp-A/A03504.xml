            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Auing of late, for mine owne exerciſe at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
howres, conſummated the tranſlation
of this little Booke, I now boldly aduenture
to commit it to the Preſſe, being the rather
induced thereunto by the incouragement of
certaine of mine acquaintance: not that I ſeeke hereby to
winne praiſe, or publiſh this for any deuotion in print, ſince
I am verily perſwaded, it deſerues not the leaſt title of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation:
and I hold it as a maxime with <hi>Lylie,</hi> that he
which commeth in print, becauſe hee would bee knowne, is
like the foole that goeth into the market, becauſe hee would
be ſeene. Onely I hope, that this my ſimple labour will be a
ſpurre to the riper wits of our time, that the golden works of
this &amp; other famous Poets, may not ſtill lie hidden, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a vaile or myſterie, from the weake capacitie of meaner
iudgements. Concerning my tranſlation, as I cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
commend it: for <hi>quando<expan>

                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

Homerus:</hi> ſo neither will I wholly diſcommend it; in the
one I might ſeeme arrogant; in the other be accounted foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh:
and therefore <hi>puto rectius eſſe, vt ſint mediocria
omnia.</hi> If one write neuer ſo well, he ſhall not pleaſe all; if
neuer ſo ill, he ſhall pleaſe ſome: a dog will barke, though he
lack his teeth; and a dolt wil cenſure, though he want iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I knowe, to ſome curious heads it will bee thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe,
that euery verſe anſweres not their expectation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I haue not word for word concurd with the Author
in my tranſlation: yet if they will but looke a little into the
difficulty of this thing, conſidering the kind of verſe which
I haue vſed, I hope they will reſt ſatiſfied. I only wil anſwere
them out of <hi>Horace, Non verbum verbo curabis red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,
<pb facs="tcp:4375:3"/>
fidus interpres.</hi> And furthermore (beſides the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie
betweene a conſtruction &amp; a translation) they may
know<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there are many myſteries in this writer, which
vttered in Engliſh, would ſhew little pleaſure, and in mine
opinion, are better to bee vntouched, then to diminiſh the
grace of the reſt with tediouſnes &amp; obſcuritie: I haue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
followed the counſell of the aforeſaid <hi>Horace,</hi> teaching
the duty of a good Interpreter, <hi>qui, quae deſperat trac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tata
niteſcere poſſe, relinquit.</hi> By which occaſion, ſome
fewe ſentences I haue in places omitted, ſomewhat added,
ſome what altered, and ſomewhat expounded: that which I
haue added, you ſhall find quoted in the margent. The ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the names (being indeede no names, but onely
wordes correſpondent to the nature of <hi>Frogs</hi> and <hi>Miſe)
ne quis in ijs haereat,</hi> leſt any ſhould therewith be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
I haue engliſhed and inſerted them in the verſe, that
the inferiour Readers ſhould not bee wearied with looking
in the margent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as for the learned, they need not be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
I meane not be a preiudice to any that can do finer; only
I would deſire them to beare with this my ſimple labour,
and to accept it as a thing roughly begun, rather then pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
And if any with this will not bee contented, let him
take in hand, and doe it anew himſelfe, and I doubt not, but
he ſhal find it an eaſier thing to controll a line or two, then
to amend the whole of this interpretation. Farewell.</p>
