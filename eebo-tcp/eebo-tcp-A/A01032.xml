            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <bibl>The 1. Epiſtle of Timothy, the 2. chapt. verſ. the 4.</bibl> VVho vvill haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, &amp;c.</q>
            </head>
            <p>THe reaſons (beloued in the Lord) vvhy the Apoſtle in the former verſes vvill haue, vs to pray vnto God for al men, and in perticular for all that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie are carefully to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of vs.</p>
            <p>The firſt (wherof vve haue already heard) is taken from the great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, vvhich by our prayers to God for kings, &amp; ſuch as are in authority it pleaſeth the Lord to grant to his Church: For our praiers are an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual meanes to procure from God,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18607:3"/>
that by his bleſſing vpon the GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours and their Gouernment, his church <hi>may liue a quiet, and a peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble life, in all Godlineſſe, and honeſtie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond reaſon, (vvhere of alſo vvee haue heard) is from the nature of the thing in Gods ſight, before vvhom it is a good, and acceptable thing, <hi>to pray for all men: and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie for Kings, and thoſe that are in authoritie.</hi> And this vvee haue ſhevved you to be a ſpeciall motiue to moue vs to doe any dutie, but eſpecially to pray for others, to vvit, vvhen vve knovv that it is a good thing not ſo much in mans ſight, as in Gods ſight, and a thing accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in Gods ſight, and that euen according as he is our Sauiour, vvhich is a matter, (as vvee haue ſhevved you) of ſingular moment to be conſidered of vs, for vvee are carefullie to looke to this, vvhat is acceptable in Gods ſight, not ſimply
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18607:3"/>
as vve conſider God in himſelfe in his nature, povver, goodnes &amp;c. but as vvee conſider him in reference to our ſelues, as he is our God, our Sauiour, and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>It follovveth novv, that vve ſpeake of the third reaſon, (vvher vpon the exhortation of the Apoſtle, to this dutie is grounded) and by vvhich all to this laſt reaſon, is made good vnto vs, and clearely confirmed. And it is taken from this vvill of God tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſaluation of men, vvhoſe vvill (as ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is to haue all men to be ſaued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Generallie hence vvee gather, that the vvil of God touching men, ſhould be the rule of our praying for them, and hovv largelie ſoeuer Gods vvill is extended to ſaue men, ſo largely ſhould our prayers be extended to God, for their ſaluation: It vvere a vvretched thing, if vve ſhould not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18607:4"/>
vvill the ſaluation of ſuch as God vvill haue ſaued, or that vve ſhould deſire them to dye in ignorance, vvhom God vvould haue to come to the knovvledge of his truth, as all our other actions, ſo eſpeciallie our praiers, ſhould haue this vvil of God for their foundation, for the knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, is that vvhich muſt rule vs in our life, and order vs in all our actions, &amp; perticularlie in this in our mutuall praying one for another: For he that is ignorant of Gods vvil, can make no acceptable prayer to God, ſeeing nothing can be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to him that is not done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his vvill: VVee knovv, that the promiſe of Chriſt in the Goſpel is this, <hi>that vvhat ſoeuer vvee ſhall aſke the Father according to his vvil, it ſhall be granted vnto vs.</hi> Thus vve ſee God hath gratiouſlie bound himſelfe to heare vs, and grant our petitions if they be according to his vvil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:18607:4"/>
This Argument of the Apoſtle is enlarged by three other grounds, all manifeſting the truth of this point, to vvit, that <hi>God will haue all men to be ſaued,</hi> and opening the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſame.</p>
            <p>The firſt ground is taken from the vnitie of God himſelfe, &amp; the vnitie of the mediatour betvveene God, and man.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ground vvhere by this is confirmed, is taken from the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome made by Chriſt, vvhich vvas for all men, therefore prayer is to be made for all men.</p>
            <p>The laſt ground is ſet dovvne in the 7. verſ. and that is this, that God hath ordained Paſtours to preach this redemption to al men: Al theſe grounds make this point good, that <hi>God vvill haue all men to be ſaued,</hi> and this vvill of God beeing laid dovvne for the ground vvhy vvee ſhould pray for al men vve are carefully
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18607:5"/>
to examine the true meaning thereof.</p>
            <p>This point is that, vvhich moſt diſturbs the peace of Gods Church this day, for the greateſt contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſie is concerning the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this place. For certainlie, it is an vndoubted truth, That ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the extent of Gods vvill, touching the ſaluation of men, ſo is the extent of his Decree, of his Election, and of Chriſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, for the lymits, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of Gods vvill, are the limits, and extents of Gods Decree vnto ſaluation, and the lymi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts of his Decree, are the lymits of his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the lymits of his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are the lymits of the redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption made by Chriſt Ieſus, for all theſe muſt of neceſſitie bee of like extent, none of them can be made either of ſtraiter, or larger extent, then other, vvhere by it is manifeſt:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18607:5"/>
that the ſaluation of mankinde, muſt bee as large, as Gods vvill is to ſaue mankinde: Therefore by conſequence it muſt follovve, that if theſe vvordes, <hi>(God vvill haue all men to be ſaued,)</hi> be ſo to be vnderſtood, that euery perticular man ſhould be ſaued, then alſo Gods Decree muſt bee that euerie perticular man ſhould bee ſaued, and if the Decree of God bee ſuch, then certainlie, Chriſt muſt haue dyed for euerie perticular man, aſvvell for <hi>Cain,</hi> as for <hi>Abell:</hi> for <hi>Eſau,</hi> as for <hi>Iacob:</hi> for <hi>Iudas,</hi> as for <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp;c. And the Couenant of grace made by God in Chriſt, vvith mankinde, muſt include all, and euerie perticular man, but if ſo be that neither Gods Decree, nor Chriſts redemption, nor the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant of grace be made, vvith all, and euery one, nor for all, and euery one, Then certainlie theſe vvords,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18607:6"/>
               <hi>(God vvill haue all men to be ſaued,)</hi> cannot be meant of euery perticular man, let vs come therefore to ſearch by the light of Gods truth, the true meaning of Gods minde in theſe vvords.</p>
            <p>For your clearer vnderſtanding, vvee vvill firſt conſider, the diuers ſorts of meanings, that are giuen of this ſentence, and aftervvards, try vvhich is the truſt.</p>
            <p>Some doe interpret theſe vvords, after this manner they reſtraine the vvord (all) to ſuch only as are really ſaued, as if the meaning vvere this, that as many of mankind as are ſau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is Gods vvill to ſaue them, and certainly it is true, that whoſoeuer is ſaued, it muſt be Gods vvill that he is ſaued but allthough this meaning be tollerable, yet it is needeles, in deciding this controverſie, beſides that it opens a gap to ſome abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, vvherof vve are not to ſpeake at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18607:6"/>
this time, It is an euaſion for vvant if better light in Gods truth to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Gods minde.</p>
            <p>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d meaning of theſe vvords, is vvhen the vvords (all men, about vvhich, all our queſtion is) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of euery perticular man, vvithout exception ſecluding none.</p>
            <p>The third meaning is vvhen theſe vvords (all men) are not taken for euerie perticular man, but as the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture oftentimes vſes this vvord (all) for all ſortes, and kindes of men, of al nations, people, and tounges, of vvhat ſtate or condition ſoeuer they be, and ſo the meaning vvill be this, that no ſort, nor eſtate, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of mankinde, no nation, nor kindred, toung, or ſex is excluded, but that God vvill haue men of all ſortes, degrees, and qualities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and conditions to be ſaued.</p>
            <p>There is yet a fourth meaning, &amp; interpretation of this place, vvhich
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18607:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
might yeeld vs a commodious of theſe vvords, &amp; that ariſeth from the conſideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods wil, either as vve referre it to that, vvhich God himſelfe vvilleth of men, or as vve referre it to that, vvhich is Gods vvil in vs, tovvards men, to make this more plaine: you are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider Gods vvill either as vvee take it for that, vvhich is in God himſelfe, touching the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of men, or as vve referre it to that vvhich God vvilleth to be in vs, &amp; eſpecially in ſuch as preach the Goſpell touching the ſaluation of mankinde.</p>
            <p>Hovv theſe vvords are to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in the firſt reſpect, muſt be gathered out of one of the former meanings, but if vve conſider them in the ſecond reſpect of Gods vvill, then the meaning vvill be this, That it is Gods vvill, that vve, and euery one of vs, that are Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciallie thoſe, that are diſpencers of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18607:7"/>
the miſteries of God, ſhould labour both by praier, &amp; preaching for the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery man vnder the ſun. And ſurely this interpretation might ſtand vvithout any offence becauſe, the Apoſtle brings this as a reaſon vvhy vve ſhould pray for al men, to vvit, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> becauſe it is Gods vvil, that vve ſhould vvithout exception ſeek to ſaue all men, and in this reſpect, this ſence may ſtand for euery perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, for it is the vvill of God, that vve ſhould pray for the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery man, &amp; that vve ſhould preach the Goſpell to euery man, &amp; ſo this vvill of God is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, of that vvhich God vvill haue to be in our practiſe, but not of that vvhich is in his ovvne purpoſe, and yet euen in this ſence, there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception manifeſt in Gods ovvne vvord, for it is not lavvfull to pray for any, that commits the ſince againſt the holy Ghoſt, as is cleere
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18607:8"/>
in the 1. <hi>Epiſ.</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>verſ.</hi> So that the moſt commodious ſenſe that wee can giue to theſe words, it cannot hold for euerie perticular man, vvithout ſome manifeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>Theſe be the foure interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that are applyed to theſe vvords, vvhere of this laſt as it might probably ſeeme to be the Apoſtles meaning, ſo it might ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie euery man, if the nevvnes of it as not beeing yet ſet abroad in the vvorld, vvere not a let, and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to the embracing and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veing of it, therefore not ſtanding vpon it but leauing it to bee of vveight according as it ſhall affect the mind of the hearer. VVe come to ſpeake of the ſecond, and third interpretations, in vvhich ſtands the vvhole controuerſie.</p>

the vvill of the Father to ſaue euery man. To come yet to demonſtrate more manifeſtlie, that this vvill of God, touching the ſaluation of all men, is to be vnderſtood only of all ſortes of men, and in no vviſe of euery perticular man, VVe haue 3. ſtrong arguments laid dovvne in this ſame place by the Apoſ. to <hi>Tim.</hi> The firſt is in theſe vvords, <hi>that God vvill haue all men to come to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of the truth,</hi> VVhich vvords are to be taken in the ſame ſence, vvith the former: for the Apoſt. ioynes them this vvay, <hi>God vvill, that all men ſhould be ſaued, &amp; come to the acknovvledging of the truth.</hi> VVherby it is clear, that Gods vvill touching the ſaluation of all men, can be no larger extended, then Gods vvill touching the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all men to the knovvledge of the truth, Novv that it is not Gods vvill, that euerie perticular man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18607:21"/>
ſhould come to the knovvledge of the truth, is manifeſt by the words of Chriſt himſelf <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 11. vvhere he giues the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his Apoſtles, why hee ſpeake to the people in parables, ſaying, <hi>it vvas becauſe, it vvas not giuen to them to knovv the ſecrets of the kindgdome of heauen,</hi> If then there bee ſome, to vvhom it is not giuen by God to knovv the troath. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee Gods vvill, that euery man ſhould com to the knovvledg of the truth, for other vviſe certainlie, hee vvould giue euery man to knovv it, ſeeing hee doth vvhatſoeuer hee vvill, therefore they muſt ſpeake againſt Gods ovvne mind, ſet dovvn by Chriſt himſelf, &amp; by the Apoſtle in this place, who doth affirme, that it is Gods vvill, that euery perticular man ſhould bee ſaued, ſeeing it is not his vvill, that euery perticular man ſhould come to the knowledg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the ſaluation of all men is no larger, then his vvill is touching their coming to the troath.</p>
            <p>To make it yet further manifeſt, that it is not Gods vvill, that euery man ſhould come to the knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the truth, but his elect alone the Apoſt.ſ hevvs it in the. 11. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> vvhe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

together, except vvee make God a direct enemie to his ovvne vvill, and a vvorker againſt his ovvne pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (vvhich is blaſphemous to thinke, and ſo conſequentlie it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee agreable to Gods truth, that God vvill haue, that euery perticular man to be ſaued, ſeeing it is not his vvill, that euerie perticular man ſhould come to the knowledg of his troath, vvithout vvhich knovvledg it is impoſſible, that any man can be ſaued. The ſecond Argument is in theſe vvords, vvhere the Apo. ſaith, that Chriſt gaue himſelfe a ranſome for all men, vvhere the vvord (all) is to be taken in the ſame ſence, in vvhich it is to be taken, in theſe that God vvil haue (all) men to be ſaued. Now vve haue ſhevved you before, that I. Chriſt did not lay dovvne his life for euery perticular man, but for his ſheepe onlie, vvhich the Father did giue him, there beeing many

other vvho vvere not of his ſhe epe, as himſelfe doth vvitneſſe, and the teſtimony of the <hi>redeemed ones</hi> (cited before) out of the <hi>Reuel.</hi> proues this point euidentlie, vvhereas they vvitnes, that Chriſt had redeemed them by his blod, out of euery tribe, people, and nation, declaring an vniuerſalitie of redemption in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of kindes of men, but denying vniuerſalitie concerning euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man.</p>
            <p>The third Argument is ſet dovvn in the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> vvhere the Apoſ. layes dovvne the third ground, vvhereby he confirmeth the former ſaying to vvit, that God vvill haue all men to be ſaued, vvhich is, that hee is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a preacher of ſaluation to the Gentiles, that is not vnto the Iewes only vvho before Chriſts coming had the promiſes, but alſo to the Gentils, vvho before Chriſts coming vvere excluded from the Couenant
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18607:23"/>
and promiſe. In theſe vvordes vvee haue firſt to gather, that vvhich the aduerſarie takes for their aduantage, that is the vniuerſall publication of the promiſe, and ſaluation to all nations, vvhich notvvithſtanding makes much againſt them, for thus farre vve vvill grant, that as largelie as the Goſpell, and promiſe of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation is extended by God, in the miniſtery thereof: ſo farre it is Gods vvill to extend likevviſe his ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſome, though not to euery one in euery place, vvhere the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is preached: But out of the Apo. vvords to the <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. 2. vve ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrong argument, againſt that ſort of the vniuerſalitie of Gods wil<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and grace, vvhereby it is extended to euery perticular perſon, for the Apoſtle: ſhevves vs plainlie in that place, that the promiſe of entering into Gods reſt is not left in any place to any people, but where the goſpe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

is preached, If therfore the goſpel be not preached vnto al, then certainly the promiſe of entring into Gods reſt, is not vniuerſall, nor made to all, in that ſenſe of vniuerſalitie formerlie alleadged, and if the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe be not made to all, and euery one vniuerſallie, then certainlie it cannot be Gods vvill to ſaue all, and euery one vniuerſallie.

ſaluation to thoſe vvhom hee did knovv vvould not ſo haue abuſed them, as they that had them: he did ſee that the Goſpel, &amp; the vvorks of Chriſt vvould haue vvrought vpon the Sodomites to the preſeruation from that deſtruction vvhich did fal vpon them, and vpon them of <hi>Tirus</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> to humiliation in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, and aſhes, and yet he denyes theſe meanes vnto both.
