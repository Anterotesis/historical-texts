         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short ANSWER to a Paper, Intituled,
Reasons humbly offered to the Honourable the Commons Assembled in Parliament, against
a Bill brought in by Sir Robert Killigrew, and Others, Undertakers and Participants for
the pretended Dreining of Lindsey-Level, in Lincolnshire.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Should need only to say, That the Iournals of both Houses of Parliament, and the Papers now in the custody of the Clerk of
the House of Commons, will prove the notorious false Allegations alledged in the said Papers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That by such Allegations, our Adversaries only endeavour to hinder the Case to be fairly Tried at the Bar of this
Honourable House, the Concurrence of which we have always had, when Heard, and never had a Repulse, but by Tricks and
Delays of a few Self-interested Men, who call themselves the <hi>Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I do affirm the Veracity of the following <hi>CASE;</hi> and on a Fair and Timely Hearing, our Adversaries will have
just cause to Blush at their False Allegations, and illegal Robbing us of our Lawful Estates; which, if tolerated, will make a
large Gap in the Liberty and Property of this Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I have so great a Veneration for my Country, and their Representatives, that I rely entirely on their Iustice;
and that we, the Dremers and Participants of <hi>Lindsey-Level,</hi> shall not be Condemned on such false Allegations, but be
fairly Heard.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If this Honourable House do think the Time short, through the multiplicity of Business, and that our Adversaries
have not Time to Summon the <hi>pretended Country;</hi> we will, with all Humility and Respect, agree with our Opposers, to
begin a-new with our Pretensions, the next Meeting of Parliament; so that they may not pretend any Surprize, but be ready
to Prove what they so unjustly Pretend. <hi>This, with Submission, by</hi>

            <head>The late Earl of LINDSEY's Title, by which himself and his Participants
do Claim Four and Twenty Thousand Acres of Land, in the Fenns in Lincolnshire; and
concerning which, a Bill is now with this Honourable House, to Impower Sir Robert Kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligrew,
Henry Heron, Thomas Wyndham, Wiliam Killigrew, and Edward Heron,
to Settle and Repair their Destroyed Works: And they do Declare, All in this following
Paper is True.</head>
            <p>FIRST, We Claim by the Law, and Authority of several Decrees of Sewers.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We claim the same Equity that former Parliaments have afforded to such Undertakings, we
having in this expended near 80000 <hi>l.</hi> to the very great Benefit of this Kingdom.</p>
            <p>That Commissioners of Sewers were anciently part of the Commission of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That they were Issuable at the King's Pleasure, and that the King (as he who had the Supreme care of things of
Publick Concernment) was bound to grant such Commissions upon al Emergencies.</p>
            <p>That this was the constant Opinion, we find in our Ancientest Book of Common-Law.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> That it was a common Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
we find many such Commissions issued, two especially, long before any Statutes now known in <hi>England</hi> were
made; they were both sent into <hi>Lincolnshire,</hi> and the first into the very parts where the Earl made his Works, and
it that time to have done this very Work that the Earl hath now done.</p>
            <p>But because those Commissions were Temporary, to Persons somtimes Strangers in the place,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and ordinarily in
redress of mischiefs already happened by some former Inundation, some Statutes have from time to time enlarged the
Power of Commissions, to act as well in Prevention as Redress; and appointed those Commissions to Gentlemen, living
on or near the place, who by their timely Notice might prevent, and their Authorities were made constant for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
number of Years.</p>
            <p>The first Statute to this purpose we find in <hi>Henry</hi> the Third's tim,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> which is as ancient as any Statute now known in
<hi>England;</hi> very many subsequent Statutes have enlarged their Powes in such Particulars, as in experience they found
necessary, <hi>viz.</hi> To enable them to Tax all Lands which might receve benefit, or avoid loss; to make new Dreins, if
they, upon their view and observation, found the ancient ones were not sufficient; to distrain and sell, for not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of those Taxes; or in their discretion, to discharge such Land perpetually, or to sell them for Years, or Lives
in Tail, or in Fee.</p>
            <p>And because the Commissioners were Gentlemen of the Country, not ever so intelligent in every scruple of Law,
it is by later Statutes provided, That their Decrees shall not be eaminable but in Parliament, as divers heretofore
have been: but those Parliaments never avoided them, if they found the course taken by their Commissioners might
probably do the work, though it was not yet really done. But on the contrary, rather than lose the benefit that might
thereby accrue to the State (although those Commissioners might in some thing have erred in judgment) they did
confirm their Decrees, and sometimes better the Contract in behalf of the Undertakers, as they did <hi>Tindal</hi>'s Law,
<hi>Lovell</hi>'s Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That those Lands undertaken by the Earl of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> were hu<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ully surrounded in <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth's time, appears
by Presentments at a Session of Sewers at that time.</p>
            <p>That the Earl hath pursued the most effectual course in doing the work, appears by Acts of Sewers, at a Session at
<hi>Donington,</hi> before <hi>Charles Brandon,</hi> Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and many most Eminent Men in 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. who decreed the making
of new Dreins in the very same place, and the same Out-Falls to the Sea, that the Earl hath done; only the Earl hath
made the same, and some more, and much more capacious; and that the Commissioners then laid the Tax generally,
as the Commissioners now laid this last, before their Contract with the Earl.</p>
            <p>That upon great Complaint of the Inhabitants, at a Session of Sewers at <hi>Sempringham, 8 Eliz.</hi> before the Earl of
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> Lord High admiral of <hi>England,</hi> and many more, a general Tax was laid for the Repairing and Enlarging
Dreins to carry away Waters that in those Fenns then annoyed hem.</p>

in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, and such as the Earl himself hath since made; and they then laid a Tax upon the
same Lands, but it was not paid; and so nothing was done.</p>

then finding all former Attempts fruitless, by reason the Inhabitants would never pay the Taxes, nor the Lands, by
reason of the Surrounder, had no Cattel upon them to render Distress, and well understanding that the King was
bound, as is express'd in the Preamble of all Statutes of Sewers, to give direction to Works of this nature and necessity:
Those Commissioners,<note place="margin">

any Contract with the Earl, they yet laid another Tax of 13 <hi>s. 4 d. per</hi> Acre, at a Session at <hi>Sleeford</hi> of 35 Commissioners,

many Lords and Owners of the said Fenns, after many Proposals and Refusals, it was fully agreed, and a perfect Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract

24000 Acres; and as soon as he should have finish'd that part between <hi>Bourne</hi> and <hi>Kime,</hi> &amp;c. he should have 14000 Acres,
as a proportionable part for so much to be put into his possession, when by the Commissioners it should be adjudged
dreined, and this Contract and Decree was confirmed by the Royal Assent, and enrolled in Chancery.</p>

the beginning of the late Troubles, riotous People violently entred and destroyed his Plantations and Corn then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

            <p>1. By the Records above mentioned, it is evident, that these Fenns in question, have been for 200 years hurtfully
surrounded, and the constant endeavours of that Country to have dreined them, but could not effect it, until the
Earl of <hi>Lindsey</hi> did the work.</p>
            <p>2. By the Countries Letter to the King, it is clear, they called for an Undertaker; and by the Earl's Reception,
Treaty, and Contract, in three years time, (none dissenting) 'tis clear, he was not imposed on them, but kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

months, during that three years Treaty, they had still new days appointed for the said payment; by which 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that they did not value those Fenny Lands so much worth in those days: Only the Earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> did pay in his
Tax, as the Commissioners appointed, and he had his 300 Acres, for a Mark an Acre, when the Work was done.</p>
            <p>4. It is also evident, that if the Countrey would have undertook the Dreining, by levying their Taxes, this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
by the Earl had not been: and that no Contract was made, till after three years not payment of the Taxes. Note

who destroyed those publick Works, now to be preferred to the Undertaking, and enjoy the Dreiners Lands, which
we have and shall pay Fifty years Purchase for, when our Works are repaired.</p>
            <p>8. 'Tis also evident by the Decrees,<note place="margin">

planted, plowed, sowed, and reaped, for near Thre years together, that the Dreiners were in Possession, and their
Undertaking fully performed, according to their Contract. It also is as evident by the Dreiners Houses being pulled
down, with their Plantations, Corn, and publick Vorks destroyed, that the Dreiners were thrown out by a Riot
which Rioters and their Abettors, have now held the Dreiners Lands for many Years.</p>
            <p>9. Since His Majesty's Restauration, the Dreiner Bill hath twice Passed the Lords House, and been sent down
this Honourable House, and there twice Commited, and the Business been fully Heard; and at another Session of the</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:101190:2"/>
Parliament, after a full Hearing at a Committee, it was Reported back to the House by Sir <hi>Thomas Meers</hi> (Chair-man,)
where the Business was again (at Sir <hi>Charles Hussey</hi>'s desire) debated at the Bar, and after Counsel fully Heard on both
Sides, it was Resolved by the House, to proceed upon the Dreiners Bill, and did proceed on some of the Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
but for want of time, the Parliament Prorogued before it could be finished.</p>
            <p>10. Sir <hi>Charles Hussey</hi> (who hath not proved himself more than a Commoner, and we believe could not) put in a
Bill in the Name of the Lords and Owners, whose consents he had not.</p>
            <p>11. The Dreiners do not claim by Court or Prerogative Power,<note place="margin">☜</note> to have got an Interest in the Fenns in question, (as
was scandalously alledged) but do claim their Title by the known Laws of Sewers, according to the ancient and daily
practice of 200 Years, as their Records and Decrees do shew, with the Royal Assent enrolled in Chancery; and do
justifie, that all their Proceedings were from first to last, according to the best Works of this Nation, which have so
much enriched the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>12. By the dates of the Deeds of those three above-named Commissioners,<note place="margin">No Parties and Iudges.</note> it is clear they became Adventurers some
Years after the Contract, and so not subject to the scandal of being Parties and Judges, but were as free to adventure in
that Work, as for any Member of this Honourable House to Purchase Land after an Act is Passed for the Sale thereof.</p>
            <p>13. But if the Experience of our days, do now think to amend the Commission of Sewers: let it be amended.</p>
            <p>Or if not clearly understood: let it be better explained.</p>
            <p>Or if it be found of no use for the good of the Nation: let it be repealed.</p>
            <p>But while it is in force and in practice,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> let not the Dreiners be destroyed, for observing and following the direction
thereof as it is in daily practice throughout <hi>England,</hi> and so great Improvements made thereby: For by a moderate
Computation, the Fenns of <hi>England</hi> are near as much ground, as <hi>Holland, Zealand</hi> and half <hi>Freezland,</hi> and as rich a Soil;
by which it may be judged whether the Dreining ought to be encouraged, and the Commission approved.</p>
            <p>14. Our Adversaries cry out, that their Propriety is invaded by these Dreinings, and at the same time they did put
in a Bill to do the same thing, and are now doing it by a Commission of Sewers fraudulently assembled, witness a
Letter to my Lord of <hi>Lindsey,</hi> by the same way: The Country (as they have said) needed no Dreining, though 200
Years Records declare the contrary, and yet themselves would be the Dreiners. They forget that the Riot, which
destroyed above a Hundred thousand Pounds worth of Houses, Goods, and Corn, and ruined Works, which does
destroy all Propriety,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> and root up the foundation of all Laws and Government. They make a publick Contract in the
face of the Country, after Three Years publick Treaty, with the unanimous consent of Thirty two Commissioners, as
is in that Decree expressed, most of them the most eminent Lords and Owners, and in presence of Seven or Eight Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
Commoners, with all their joyful consents; and after Eighty thousand Pounds expended by the Dreiners, their
justice allows them to Ravish from us these Lands, and to keep them so many Years. It seems very strange, that Poor
men are daily hanged for trifling Robberies, to save their Families from starving, and so great a Robbery as our Riot,
to pass for a vertue, to be justified, endeavour to be rewarded instead of punished: And all the Argument for this is,
That (they say) it is their own Land: and their Houses builded with the ruines of ours, is their own too, because they
say so; by which example, any Man may pull down any Man's House, and call it his own. 'Tis humbly desired that
the consequence of this may be fully considered, and then judge who be the Destroyers of all Mens Propriety; when
the will and pleasure of a Multitude may overthrow the Decrees of the most ancient Court of Records in <hi>England:</hi> for
such is the Commission of Sewers, and as Beneficial to the Nation as any. If that Riot had been duly punished, this
Contest had ended many Years since; but by that omission, Men are encouraged to design any thing that has no rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
of Justice; else no Man could hope to be Dreiners of our Lands which we have Paid so dear for,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>
               </note> and so well
deserved of the Nation; That we most humbly desire such Reparation as this House in their Wisdoms shall think fit,
the better to enable us to Repair our ruined Works.</p>
            <p>15. The Dreiners do humbly desire that their merit may be duly considered,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> and the Rioters have their reward, lest
by their Example no Man may be assured of any Propriety, when Multitudes shall be justified for such an eminent Riot,
committed while the Business were in hearing before a Committee of the House of Commons, and when two Justices
of Peace were present, who Read the Orders of both Houses, and commanded that Rout to disperse, but could not
prevail, but before their faces saw a House of 3000 <hi>l.</hi> price pulled down. This well considered, is a high Concern to
the Honour of Parliaments, and to the publick Peace of the Nation, as well to every Man's Interest in <hi>England,</hi> besides
the Dreiners, who are much impoverished by this Riot, their Estates for many Years detained, their Works so ruined,
as will cost Twenty five Thousand Pounds to repair; and thus all Men discouraged from such publick Works, which
deserve a better Approbation than to be neglected now, or formerly destroyed by the Rioters.</p>
            <p>16. 'Tis said by some,<note place="margin">The <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that we had not the Countries consent. The Commission of Sewers does not direct, that
every individual Man should consent under their Hands, neither is any consent requisite, nor directed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
for that were an impossible Work; for if any two or three froward Men by their refusal may hinder the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching
of the Nation, it would make fruitless the whole intention of the Commission, which is not like the Common
Law in other cases; but common sense and constant practice shews that a tacite compliance in them absent, without
any dissenting, does declare a general consenting with those many Thousands, who for Three Years treating were
constantly present, and with joyful Acclamations consented to the Contract made at <hi>Sleeford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>17. Such a Consent as our Adversaries talk of, is as impossible as their discourse of Dreining, without making new
Works; as if our Ancestors were so silly, by so many Acts of Parliaments to Impower the Commissioners to Drein, and
to forbid the only Way of Dreining. But this is like their beating us out of the Country, destroying our Works, and
now complaining to the Parliament, that we did not perform our Contract, by not finishing our Works in the Second
Level, when their Riot drove us away; and all they say to amuse Men, is like these when we answer them as those
who now sign Papers against the Dreiners, are the same Men, or their Heirs, who pulled down our Houses, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
our Works, and such as now hold our Estates by vertue of that Riot; 'tis to be supposed such Men will sign
any thing.</p>
            <p>They talk of leaving this Case to be tried in <hi>Westminster-Hall,</hi> because they know by the 23d. of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. no
Court can alter a Decree of Sewers, having the Royal Assent thereto and Enrolled in Chancery, but a Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Dreiners do declare, That the Proposals and Resolves of the Committee the Fourth of <hi>April,</hi>
               <note place="margin">☜</note> 1662. shall be
