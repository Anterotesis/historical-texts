         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>A
PREFACE,
Opening the true Nature and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of a Saving-Faith.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. THere is no Man that ever
heard the Goſpel, and hath
ſuch a care of his everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
State, as beſeemeth a
reaſonable Creature, but muſt needs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
of how great weight it is, to be
well aſſured of the truth of thoſe ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Revelations delivered to us in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
Scriptures. Much may be known
by the well ſtudied Book of Nature: But
not enough to quiet the mind of Man, by
aſſured hopes of future Happineſs, and
the way thereto: And therefore almoſt all
the Heathen and Infidel World, have their
Augures or Prophets on whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
as Conſcious of the neceſſity of
more than common natural Light: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that, it requireth greater helps and
longer ſtudies, to underſtand the Book of
Nature, than the generallity of Mankind
can uſe: whereas God by his word hath
<pb facs="tcp:45306:3"/>
made all neceſſary truth ſo plain, that
Children in a ſhort time, may grow wiſer
than the Philoſophers.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. No wonder then if it be the great
work of the Prince of Darkneſs, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
of God and Man, to deprive the World
of the benefit of the Sacred Sacriptures;
which he doth, Firſt, By keeping moſt of
the Earth from <hi>knowing it,</hi> for want of
Teachers, moſtly kept out by the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
of Tyrants and Idolatrous Prieſts.
Secondly, By keeping thoſe that hear it
from <hi>believing it.</hi> Thirdly, By keeping
thoſe that believe it from the <hi>right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
of it.</hi> Fourthly, By keeping
thoſe that partly underſtand it, from a <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſidering</hi> what they underſtand.
Fifthly, By keeping Men from a <hi>willing
obedience</hi> to what they know and think
of.</p>
                  <p>§. 3. Among profeſſed Chriſtians it is
the want of a ſound <hi>Belief,</hi> which is the
great cauſe of all Ungodlineſs and Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And no wonder: For it is an high
and excellent work to live on the joyful
belief and hope of an unſeen everlaſting
Life. And in this dark State, <hi>believing</hi>
muſt conquer many difficulties, which
ſlothful Men will rather yield to, than
duely ſtrive to overcome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45306:3"/>
§. 4. Firſt, We have contracted ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
a Love to this kind of life in
Fleſh, that corrupt Nature is loth to think
of any other, becauſe it would not part
with this. And when Men are convinced
only of a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of looking forward
beyond the Grave, this changeth not their
love; but ſtill an unwilling backward
heart receiveth the notices of the Life to
come, but as unpleaſant Phyſick, which
nothing but meer neceſſity will get down:
And how ill a Receiver an unwilling mind
is, experience telleth all the World. Yea
ſo backward and ſenſeleſs is depraved Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that even this <hi>neceſſity</hi> is ſeldom ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
conſidered, till the Sentence of
Death awaken the Soul; and are Men
then fit to begin ſo hard a ſtudy, as muſt
ſhew them the certainty of the Goſpel,
and the Life to come; and to <hi>get</hi> Faith
when they muſt <hi>uſe</hi> it.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. Secondly, And (I write it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated,
and with Lamentation,) it is
not all Mens Lot to have Teachers that
ſhew them the right way, even of found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Belief, and diſcerning the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of the Goſpel, and the Immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Souls. If I ſhould tell you how
many Pariſhes that have Weekly Sermons,
<pb facs="tcp:45306:4"/>
in which Faith, and Chriſtianity, and
Heaven, are mentioned, have Teachers
that cannot confute an Infidel or Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cee,
or teach Men clearly how to be ſure,
that their Faith and Hope are not meer
Errour, and that cannot tell which way
well to prove the truth of their profeſt
Religion, ſome would be offended at it,
that are not offended at their own ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
who are ignorant of ſo needful a part
of the Catechiſme, which every Chriſtian
ſhould be taught.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. Sad numerous inſtances are too
clear a clear a proof.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is become ſo great a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,
whether Faith have any <hi>Evidence</hi> or
not, and whether we can certainly <hi>prove</hi>
the Goſpel to be true, or rather muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
the more by believing it without proof,
that the Papiſts are together by the Ears
about it; and thoſe Proteſtants that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
it, differ among themſelves. But the
moſt keep their peace by not daring to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
it. And how can thoſe Teachers ſhew
the people the aſcertaining Evidence and
Proof, who hold that there is none to be
ſhewn. The objects of Faith are not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to Senſe, (not ſeen, not taſted, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi>
but the truth of the Revelation hath aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb facs="tcp:45306:4"/>
proof: And nothing is provable
but by intelligible Evidence,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The whole Papal Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
holds, That the method of believing
the Goſpel, is to believe it on the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the Church's propoſal, or affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
As if Men muſt believe that Chriſt
hath a Church, and that it is thus Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized,
before they believe that he is the
Chriſt, and hath Authority himſelf, or
any Law that gives Authority. A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of impoſſibles are here ſuppoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Man can be a true believer, (which
I have fully manifeſted elſewhere.)</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Some that ſee how unable the
vulgar and unlearned are, to manage a
matter of ſuch weight and difficulty, and
fearing leaſt a tryal of their Faith againſt
hard objections, ſhould but overturn it,
perſwade the weak only to believe, and
not to doubt, but not to ask, <hi>why?</hi> nor
to ſearch for Reaſons for their Faith; leaſt
diſputing the caſe, and hearing objections
which they cannot anſwer, ſhould make
them Infidels, or crack their Brains.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some tell them that it is only
the inward witneſs of the Spirit in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
that can aſſure them that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
are the word of God. Not telling
<pb facs="tcp:45306:5"/>
them well what that Teſtimony is, nor
how thoſe that yet hear it not ſhall be
convinced of unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Some by overdoing, tell us that the
Scripture ſo ſhineth, <hi>propria luce,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth
its own evidence of Divinity ſo
clearly, that a Man that doth but read it,
though he found it by the high-way, and
never before heard of it, may there ſee
ſufficient evidence that it is all of God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Some by greater overdoing,
diſtinguiſh not the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of Religion,
from the <hi>Integrals</hi> or <hi>Accidents,</hi> nor the
<hi>words</hi> from the <hi>matter,</hi> nor the <hi>Law and
Goſpel</hi> from the <hi>ſubordinate</hi> parts of the
Bible, in point of <hi>evidence</hi> and <hi>neceſſity.</hi>
and ſo would tempt Men to think, that
if any ſentence in our Bibles, tranſlation
or original be miſtaken, we can have no
certainty of the truth of any of the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, And theſe by overdoing
would perſwade us that every word in
the Bible is as much Divine as the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
or Lords Prayer, and hath nothing
in it of humane imperfection in ſtile or
order; but is all ſuch, as God himſelf
would have written, if he had made no
uſe of Man.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, And ſome are ſo afraid of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
<pb facs="tcp:45306:5"/>
and the name of <hi>(Tradition</hi> and the
<hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the <hi>Church,)</hi> that they diſable
their own Faith by rejecting the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
uſe of Tradition, and the Churches
Teſtimony, not being able juſtly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, And too many diſtinguiſh not
<hi>Hiſtorical Evidence</hi> from the <hi>Churches</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Authoritative determination.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, And ſome cannot tell what
<hi>Hiſtorical Evidence</hi> is alſo <hi>Phyſical,</hi> and
what maketh it ſo, as differing from <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
uncertain Teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>And if Teachers of the Foundation
have all theſe groſs defects and more, is
it any wonder if unſtudied Lay-men are
here puzled in the dark.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. I am not now to write a Treatiſe
to tell Men the true method of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Faith: I have done that elſewhere,
eſpecially in <hi>[The Reaſons of Chriſtian
Religion,] [The unreaſonableneſs of Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,]
[The Life of Faith,]</hi> and a ſmall
Book called <hi>[The certainty of Chriſtianity
without Popery.]</hi> But I ſhall here give the
unfurniſhed Reader a few neceſſary Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctions
and Concluſions.</p>
                  <p>§. 8. <hi>Concluſion</hi> I. Divine Faith is a ſort
of <hi>knowledg</hi> with <hi>Truſt</hi> to the credit of
<pb facs="tcp:45306:6"/>
God revealing, and therefore muſt have
evidence, 1. That it is the word of God
that is propoſed. 2. And that God doth
not lie or deceive us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> II. It is the <hi>matter ſignified</hi>
which is the prime neceſſary object of our
Faith: and the <hi>words</hi> only as the vehicle
or ſigns of the <hi>matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> III. No one particular word in
the Bible, or the World is of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to be known; but another may
ſerve that hath the ſame ſignification. If
any <hi>word</hi> were abſolutely neceſſary to be
known, if it be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> none could be
ſaved but <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men: if <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew,</hi>
none could be ſaved but <hi>Grecians</hi> or
<hi>Hebricians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> IV. The Goſpel is not thoſe
<hi>ſame words</hi> that Chriſt <hi>ſpake,</hi> but a <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation</hi>
of them. Its ſuppoſed that he
ſpake in the Language then uſed by the
<hi>Jews,</hi> which was a mixture of <hi>Chaldee</hi>
and <hi>Syriack;</hi> but the Goſpel is written in
<hi>Greek,</hi> ſo that our <hi>Original</hi> thereof is but
a Divine Tranſlation of Chriſts words.</p>
                  <p>Concluſ. <hi>V. Chriſt promiſed and gave
his Spirit to his Apoſtles and Evangeliſts,</hi>
to bring all things that he had taught them to
their remembrance, and to lead them into
<pb facs="tcp:45306:6"/>
all truth, and teach them what to ſay, <hi>ſo
far as to perform their Commiſſion,</hi> To
Diſciple the Nations, Baptizing them in the
name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt,
Teaching them to obſerve all things that he
had Commanded them. <hi>And thus far they
were infallible.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> VI. The words therefore of the
ſeveral writers are ſo far Divine, as to be
the true and certain ſignifiers or expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of ſo much of Chriſts Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
as he ſaw needful for the uſe of
Man, to the end of the World to be made
known.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> VII. But all the Goſpel writers
recite not the ſame matter juſt in the <hi>ſame
words,</hi> nor in the <hi>ſame Order,</hi> nor in the
<hi>ſame Stile:</hi> And as all humane Language
ſavoureth of humane imperfection, and
the faculties of Men are not all of one
degree of ſtrength, and cuſtome varyeth
wiſe Mens Stile; ſo the Apoſtles were but
Men, and the very <hi>Words, Stile</hi> and <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
of their writing had the effects of
ſinleſs humane imperfection, and were
not ſuch as that God himſelf could not
have done it better: But its all of God,
as ſuited to its proper uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45306:7"/>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> VIII. The Goſpel was God's
word Preached by them, before they
wrote it: Eight Years before St. <hi>Matthew</hi>
wrote, and about Sixty Seven, or Sixty
Eight Years before St. <hi>John</hi> wrote the
Goſpel: And it is not to be imagined, that
in their Preaching they ſpake juſt all the
ſame words which they wrote, and no
more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> IX. All the Miracles that were
then wrought, were firſt to confirm the
Goſpel as Preached before the Books were
written.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> X. But God knowing that the
Apoſtles muſt die, and the Goſpel muſt
be infallibly delivered to the end of the
World, inſpired them to write, not only
the Eſſentials, but all that was neceſſary
for the World to know in all Generations,
and leave it as the Sacred Record of his
redeeming Work, his Doctrine, and his
univerſal Law, written infallibly by the
Spirit of Jeſus which he ſent as his Agent
for that work; ſo that the ſame Miracles
which confirmed their words, are now
equally a Seal of the Divine Authority of
their writings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XI. All the words in the Goſpel
are not <hi>Eſſential</hi> to Chriſtianity, nor of
<pb facs="tcp:45306:7"/>
equal neceſſity to be explicitely known,
the Doctrine of Baptiſm and the Lords
Supper, with the Decalogue and Lords
Prayer, contain all the Eſſentials of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
truly underſtood; which Doctrine
of Baptiſm the Church ever expounded in
a few plain Articles called the <hi>Creed:</hi>
And they always took thoſe Sacraments
and that Creed, with the Lords Prayer
and the Decalogue expounded by Chriſt,
as the ſummaries of our <hi>Belief, Deſires</hi>
and <hi>Practice,</hi> to be the Goſpel and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion; The Miniſtry and Church
Order inſtituted by the Spirit of Chriſt,
being an <hi>Integral</hi> part: and theſe they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erenced
from the Subſidiary and Ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
parts of Scripture, in point of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Evidence. And they that believed
theſe were ſaved, whether it was before
the reſt was written, or if they never
heard or underſtood the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XII. And before Chriſt, the
<hi>Law of Moſes</hi> muſt be greatly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the other <hi>Hiſtorical Books and
Propheſies.</hi> As the Law of this Land by
which all men hold their Lands and Lives,
and muſt be governed, greatly differ from
daily verbal Mandates, or written Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions
which the King may give to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb facs="tcp:45306:8"/>
Perſons; ſo the Covenant of Grace,
and the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> much differ from
the particular Meſſages of Prophets,
and the words of Prieſts about that Law,
or the deeds of men. Univerſal and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Laws are of Univerſal and Common
Obligation, and therefore all muſt be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of their Authority: But the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and Salvation of the Land or World,
was not laid on, <hi>e. g.</hi> the Prophets Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
to <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> &amp;c.
Therefore, in theſe Caſes, the People are
left ſometimes to ſee whether Predictions
come to paſs, and its harder for them to
know who is a true Prophet, the neceſſity
being leſſer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XIII. It is therefore greatly to
be noted, that, 1. The Law of Nature
needed no Miracles to Confirm it, being
legible in the Nature of Man and of all
about him. 2. The Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> which
that Nation was to be ruled by, had ſo
full evidence of Divine Authority, that it
was ſcarce poſſible for the Jews of that
Age to doubt of it: The ten Plagues of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the opening of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> and
the Raining of <hi>Quails,</hi> and the forty years
feeding them with <hi>Manna,</hi> the Flaming
Mount, the terrible Sight and Voices, the
<pb facs="tcp:45306:8"/>
Glory of God and the Cloud before the
Tabernacle, the ſwallowing up of Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
by the opened Earth, with other
ſuch ſigns, muſt needs convince the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Gods Revelation: And the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,
and many other means, were
from the firſt, appointed to be a practical
Tradition of it, uninterrupted. But the
Prieſts that were but to obey and teach
this Law needed no new Miracles, the
Law being once ſo fully ſealed. 3. And
ſo when Chriſt came with a new and more
perfect Revelation to ſettle the Law of
Grace in the laſt Edition, he ſealed it by
multitudes of uncontrouled Miracles, and
his own Reſurrection, and the miraculous
effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, by which the
Apoſtles, who were infallibly to Record
his Law and Promiſes, ſealed their Word
with the like wonderful works that Chriſt
had done. But the Law and Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus Sealed and Delivered, the Biſhops,
or Miniſters, who are but to keep and
teach it, need not new Miracles for their
Work. If as ſome Uſurpers pretend,
Chriſt had made Biſhops in Councils Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Legiſlators to make new parts of
Divine Religion for the World, God would
have given them alſo the ſeal of ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Miracles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45306:9"/>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XIV. I have oft ſaid four evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
concur infallibly to prove the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
true: And all are called, <hi>The Witneſs
of the Spirit as one.</hi> 1. The Antecedent
Propheſies. 2. The Miracles, and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
and Aſcenſion of Chriſt, and the
numerous Miracles of the Apoſtles and
firſt Churches. 3. The <hi>propria Lux,</hi> or
inherent impreſſions of God on the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
and all the Scriptures, which greatly
differenceth it from all other Books and
Doctrines. 4. The ſanctifying efficacy of
the Goſpel on all true Believers in all
Nations and Ages of the Earth; which
maketh them a holy, peculiar, heavenly,
juſt and ſober ſort of Perſons, quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
from all other men, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
the work of God by the Goſpel,
and by this his Spirit is a continuing Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
that God doth own it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XV. The <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Believing</hi> as
to the <hi>Matter,</hi> is to believe the firſt ſealed
Goſpel. Firſt, even the <hi>Eſſence of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi>
as paſt doubt. And if there be a
doubt whether the Spirit and Miracles
ſealed every by-word, ſtyle or order, that
muſt not make us doubt of the <hi>Goſpel</hi>
which is ſurely ſealed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XVI. It is undeniable that there
<pb facs="tcp:45306:9"/>
are multitudes of different Readings in the
Old Teſtament and the New, in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
in the Original Tongues: It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
to us, of many, which of them is
the right: It is certain that when there
was no Printing, but it was the Scriveners
Trade to write out Books, many ſlips and
differences would be among them. How
far imperfection of memory or ſtyle might
ſhew it ſelf in the firſt writers in any by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words,
may be doubted without doubting
of the Goſpel or Word of God: It is
treachery to tell men that they can be no
ſurer of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> than of the <hi>various Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi>
or <hi>Skill</hi> of the Writers, Printers or
Tranſlators. But it is certain that no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
hath altered any neceſſary point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XVII. The Order of believing
as to the <hi>Evidence,</hi> is firſt to ſee the
proof of the <hi>Matters</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> by Hiſtorical
Evidence: and in that to ſee the certainty
of the Doctrine, which alſo ſheweth its
own credibility: And this is a ſhort and
ſure proof of our Religion: 1. We may
be as ſure that the main Hiſtory is true,
as that any Hiſtory in the World is true,
2. And if the Hiſtory be true, the Doctrine
muſt needs be true.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XVIII. And this Hiſtory hath
<pb facs="tcp:45306:10"/>
more than a moral uncertain Evidence:
For the underſtanding of which it muſt be
noted, that mans Soul hath two ſort of
Acts;, ſome free and mutable, and ſome
neceſſary by nature and immutable. All
moral acts are free, and changeable: the
Belief that is grounded on them hath but
a moral certainty, which is ſtrictly no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
certainty: All men are lyars: All be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
grounded on mans mere honeſty,
(though it were a general Council that
pretends a judging Authority) is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
Though ſome good mens words
give us ſo great a probability, as that one
may venture his life on it. But the <hi>Love
of a mans ſelf,</hi> and of <hi>felicity,</hi> and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs
to be miſerable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are acts
<hi>Naturally neceſſary.</hi> Therefore the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif
which is well founded on theſe, hath
a <hi>Phyſical Infallible certainty.</hi> Of this ſort
is our beleif that there is ſuch a City as
<hi>Rome, Venice, Paris,</hi> that there were ſuch
men as K. <hi>H. 7. 8.</hi> K. <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c. that the
Statutes of the Land are not Counterfeits;
For 1. Men that love themſelves, of croſs
intereſts, capable of knowing, have all
agreed of the Truth of theſe, and ſo do
to this day. <hi>Argu. 1.</hi> Where the Cauſe is
ofnatural neceſſity, the Effect is of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb facs="tcp:45306:10"/>
certainty: But the cauſe that the willing
and unwilling of contrary Intereſts, have all
knowingly agreed to the things forenamed,
muſt needs be of natural neceſſity: <hi>Ergo,</hi> the
ſaid Agreement is of natural certainty. <hi>Argu. 2.</hi>
There can be no effect without an adequat
Cauſe. But for all knowing Men of contrary
Intereſts and Wills to agree that there is ſuch a
place as <hi>Rome, &amp;c.</hi> that there was ſuch a man
as King <hi>James,</hi> that the Statutes are not coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> if theſe were falſe, is an effect that
hath no Cauſe in Nature: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is naturally
impoſſible. <hi>E. G.</hi> For our Statutes; It was
eaſily knowable in the Age that they were made
in, whether they were counterfeit: For men
hold their Lands and Lives by them, and plead
them daily at the Tribunals for croſs Intereſts
againſt each other: Therefore natural neceſſary
Cauſes would make ſome diſcover it, were
they falſe. And if any had then diſcovered it,
the ſame Cauſes would propagate the Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
That this is the Caſe about the Hiſtory of
the Scripture, and that Jeſus Chriſt Lived,
Taught, wrought Miracles, Dyed, Roſe, Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
ſent down the Holy Spirit, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
by untaught Languagues and Miracles plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Goſpel, and Chriſt gave the ſame Spirit
by the impoſition of their hands on their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
hearers that believed, that they appealed
to their own working Miracles and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens,
to their accuſers, <hi>Gal. 3. 1. 3. 5. Mat.
12, &amp;c.</hi> this I have largely proved elſewhere.
In all this you may ſee that to lay the Faith of
Chriſtians on a pretended judging Power of
<pb facs="tcp:45306:11"/>
the Church, Pope, or Councils, and then firſt
to enquire which is the Church that hath this
Power, is a cheat of ambitious men to catch
the Ignorant. The moſt univerſal agrement in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
Hereticks, and Enemies, and men of
contrary Wills and Intereſts is the beſt Hiſtorical
Evidence of Fact: And the certainty of the
Hiſtory with the quality of the Doctrine it ſelf,
and its effects, is a certain proof that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
is of God. And the particular Books
aud Words muſt have their own Hiſtorical
proof, where there is ſome difference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XIX. <hi>Objective certainty,</hi> muſt ſtill be
diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Mental, Active, Subjective
certainty.</hi> 1. Every thing <hi>true</hi> is <hi>infallibly true,</hi>
ſo far as whoever believeth it to be true is not
deceived. 2. Every thing <hi>true</hi> hath not <hi>aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
evidence,</hi> but ſome things have. 3. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that hath aſcertaining evidence is not
<hi>certainly known</hi> or believed by millions: A mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of inward and outward hinderances keep
men from diſcerning ſuch evidence as aſcertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
others, and might aſcertain them. Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Souls have great advantage, by capacity,
willingneſs, diligence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <q>And experienced
Chriſtians on whom the Goſpel hath made a
ſanctifying change, have the witneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which proveth it to be of God. And
this witneſs of the Spirit is a great and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Seal on all that are ſound believers: but
in a different degree.</q> Yet the unſanctified and
unbelievers that are not negligently or malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
blind, may much diſcern the excellent
effects of the Goſpel on others though they feel
it not in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45306:11"/>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XX. The <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Believing</hi> as to the
<hi>Acts,</hi> is uſually this. Men uſually (though
not always) begin with a <hi>Belief</hi> of men, and
perhaps fallible men, which giveth them but a
<hi>probability</hi> that the Goſpel is Gods word; And
from thence they paſs to a Belief of it as Gods
<hi>word,</hi> which is partly <hi>Divine</hi> (that is, <hi>for Gods
Veracity and Authority)</hi> but not <hi>effectuall,</hi> but is
only the work of a common Grace, not ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
and ſaving. And thence they come to a
<hi>ſaving Divine Faith,</hi> but in a weak degree,
which is to grow ſtronger till it come to full aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XXI. For the underſtanding of all
this, it is very needful that the true nature and
formal cauſe of Divine Faith, be better and
more diſtinctly opened than uſually it is <hi>Faith,</hi>
in its <hi>ratio formalis</hi> muſt not be confounded with
neceſſary previous <hi>Knowledge.</hi> All this Syllogiſm
goeth before it. <hi>(Whatſoever God ſaith is true:
This God ſaith,</hi> Ergo, <hi>this is true,)</hi> Or <hi>(All the
word of God is trne. The Goſpel</hi> or <hi>ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the word of God:</hi> Ergo, <hi>it is true) Major,
Minor,</hi> and concluſion are all but a <hi>Knowledge</hi>
antecedent to Faith in its formal Act, (though I
and others formerly have called the concluſion,
<hi>Faith,)</hi> Yea further, <hi>(whatever is evident truth,
is to be believed and truſted: The Goſpel is evident
truth, therefore it is to be believed or truſted)</hi> This
is yet but Faith's antecedent: <hi>piſteuo, credo fido,</hi>
all ſignifie to <hi>truſt:</hi> And <hi>truſt</hi> is the formal Act
of Faith: But this truſt is in all the three facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul. 1. The underſtanding having
firſt diſcerned the credibility, giveth over doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:45306:12"/>
(in that degree) and reſteth in or truſteth
the diſcerned truth. 2. The <hi>Will</hi> doth with
complacency truſt to and reſt in the ſaid truth
diſcerned, (with the goodneſs alſo diſcerned as
ſure and true.) 3. The e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecutive imperate
Power doth <hi>practically truſt, perform,</hi> and <hi>venture,</hi>
commanded by the Will. So that truly, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Faith is an <hi>intellectual, willing, executive,</hi> or
practical <hi>truſt.</hi> I have oft explained it by ſuch
ſimilitudes as theſe There is but one Phyſitian that
can heal a ſick man: His Enemies defame him
as a deceiver. He ſaith believe or truſt me and
I will freely cure thee: He that truly truſteth
him now, doth it <hi>Intellectually, Conſentingly,</hi> and
<hi>Practically,</hi> and takes his Medicines; A For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Prince tells a poor man or a Priſoner, I
will give thee a Lordſhip in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> if
thou wilt truſt me; ſome ſay he is a deceiver:
Others ſay, the Ship, or Pilot, or Seas are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
He that ſo far truſteth him now, as
to forſake his poor Country, and goe to Sea,
and venture his all upon the truſt, ſhall have
what is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XXII. Here therefore to confute the
Errours of a multitude of Doctors, and to quiet
moſt Souls not otherwiſe to be juſtly quieted, it
is neceſſary to know theſe things. 1. That the
<hi>formal Act of Faith</hi> may be Divine and Saving,
when the foreſaid antecedent knowledge or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
may have ſome miſtakes and inſufficient
<hi>media.</hi> 2. That <hi>Faith may be ſaving,</hi> which reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not to a ſtrong <hi>ſubjective certainty,</hi> nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
always all doubting, even of the truth
of the Goſpel and the Life to come. 3. Yea,
<pb facs="tcp:45306:12"/>
that no ones Faith is abſolutely perfect. 1. Moſt
Perſons begin with a humane belief of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and the common eſtimation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;
that Chriſt is the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and the
Scripture is Gods certain word: This is not a
certain Proof: But if Children or unlearned
Perſons do by ſuch uncertain Arguments believe
the Scripture to be Gods word, and then taſt a
Divine goodneſs in the matter, which maketh
them moſt <hi>willingly</hi> believe it; Theſe Perſons
may by ſo weak a preparation, <hi>Practically truſt
God, and the Goſpel,</hi> as ſo far perceived to be his
word, even with a ſaving Faith.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Armenian</hi> Greek, <hi>Abaſſine, &amp;c.</hi> believeth
<hi>fide humana</hi> the Goſpel to be true, becauſe their
ſeveral Teachers tell them ſo: And they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a goodneſs in it: Theſe on this fallible
ground firſt taking it for the word of God,
knowing that God is true, may yet ſavingly truſt
it as the word of God, and that truſt is a Divine
Faith, though the antecedent means was hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane;
(beſides the ſavour of Truth and
goodneſs in the Word it ſelf.) 2. How few in
the world have true Faith, if none be true that
reacheth not to full undoubting ſubjective cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.
Certainty may be had: Aſcertaining
truth and Evidence there is: But it is not every
unlearned perſon that diſcerneth it A man may
truſt his life in the hand of a Phyſitian, though
he be not undoubtingly certain he can cure him:
He may truſt Life and Eſtate in a Veſſel which
he is not undoubtingly certain will bring him
ſafe to Land. Though an unlearned man is not
ſo well acquainted with Hiſtory as to know with
<pb facs="tcp:45306:13"/>
what Evidence the Goſpel hath been brought
down to our Age, nor ſo good a Logician as to
bring an Argument for Chriſtianity and the
Scriptur, which is not faulty; Yet, if he take
it to be the word of God, and though he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſay [I am undoubtingly certain of it] yet
can ſay <hi>[I am undoubtingly certain there is nothing
which is to be truſted in equality with it: This or
nothing muſt be my hope: therefore, on this I will
venture or lay my life and ſoul and all my hope,
and will obey Chriſt, and forſake all that
ſtands againſt him; For this hope I will live,
and in this hope I will die.]</hi> This will prove a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Faith. 3. Yea, it is certain that there is
nothing abſolutely perfect in this World: And
therefore no ones <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>certainty</hi> is perfect:
even they that feel no actual doubting, have yet
but an Imperfect Faith; elſe they would have
more perfect obedience, patience and joy; The
beſt have need to pray, <hi>Lord increaſe our faith;</hi>
and <hi>Lord I believe, help thou my unbeleif.</hi> The
weakneſs of all our graces and duty comes from
the weakneſs of our faith. And it is not the beſt
Logick which is ever accompanied with the
ſtrongeſt Truſt; Though Reaſon be an excellent
and neceſſary ingredient, ſome truſt in Chriſt
with victorious confidence, who cannot diſpute
beſt for their Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XXIII. Though Peace and holy Joy be
a moſt deſirable effect of Faith, and by which
the ſtrength of it may be much tryed, yet it is
not this, but <hi>Practical conſent to the Covenant of
Grace,</hi> or <hi>Chriſts</hi> terms of Salvation, in which its
ſaving ſincerity conſiſteth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:45306:13"/>
                     <hi>Concluſ.</hi> XXIV. By all this it appeareth how
ambiguouſly the Queſtion <hi>de Reſolutione fidei</hi> is
too oft diſputed: And how fallaciouſly a mans
faith is ſaid to be unſound, if his reaſons be ſome
unſound, and none cogent to prove an undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
abſolute certainty that the Scripture is Gods
word; and that Faith is not ſo reſolved into the
antecedent reaſonings as neceſſarily to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound
if ſome of them are ſo. <hi>That God cannot lie</hi>
is known by Nature. <hi>That the Goſpel is his
word,</hi> is known by its proper notifying evidence
(forenamed), where many things concur. That
therefore the <hi>Goſpel is true,</hi> is known as a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Concluſion. But theſe are by believers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehanded
oft with imperfection, faultyneſs and
diſorder. But <hi>Practical Truſt in God, in Chriſt, in the
Goſpel Promiſe,</hi> is Conſtituted by its <hi>formal object</hi>
which is <hi>Gods Fidelity</hi> or <hi>Veracity,</hi> grounded in
his Perfection, and in the apprehended Truth of
his promiſes. And this effectual <hi>faith</hi> is ſaving.
I have Prefaced this much that the Reader may
the eaſilyer underſtand and profit by the two
following Treatiſes, one written and the other
tranſlated by Mr. <hi>William Lorimer,</hi> my greatly
valued Friend, well known by me to be a man
of Learning and Judgment and exemplary faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
to God and Conſcience, and of a prudent
and peaceable Converſation with men: If the
Reader bring not a diſpoſition of enmity againſt
the Truth. or groſs neglect of it, but a mind
that hath neceſſary manly preparation, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive
willingneſs and reſolution for an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
diligent ſearch, I doubt not but in theſe two
Diſcourſes he will find enough, though not to
<pb facs="tcp:45306:14"/>
remove every difficulty in the Bible, yet to ſave
his Faith from all ſuch aſſaults, as would over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
it, and make it uneffectual to his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And verily a man that hath well digeſted
the matter of ſuch Controverſies, will find that
<hi>Pomponatius, Vaninus, Hobbes, Spinoſa,</hi> &amp;c: were
Ignorant men, that knew not their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,

                  <p>IF thou weigheſt things in the Ballance
of right Reaſon, thou can'ſt not but ſee,
That <hi>Moſes</hi> being the firſt Man by whoſe
Miniſtry Almighty God thought fit to
give a Body of Laws unto a whole Nation,
and to as many of the World beſides, as
ſhould join in communion with that Nation;
it was neceſſary God ſhould enable him to
make it evidently appear unto all rational
Men, that he was ſent and authorized by
God to give Laws unto that Nation: and if
thou read'ſt the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what
thou wilt find in the following Diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
him and them, thou can'ſt not but
likewiſe ſee, that the infinitely Wiſe and
Powerful God did in effect enable him evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
and certainly to prove his Miſſion and
Commiſſion to be from Heaven. For through
God's extraordinary aſſiſtance he gave the
higheſt demonſtrations of his being Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
from above, that can in reaſon be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
of any that ſpeaks or writes unto Men
in the name of God; his works and writings
hear the manifeſt ſignatures of God's Wiſdom,
Power and Goodneſs; his works were ſuch as
could never have been done without the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb facs="tcp:45306:15"/>
of an inviſible Power, far above any
thing that falls under the perceptions of
Senſe; and it is moſt evident to Reaſon, That
that inviſible Power could be no other, than
the infinitely powerful, wiſe and good God,
who made, preſerves and governs the World,
and all things therein. For it could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
be any Evil Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> in his conteſt with
the Magicians of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> did at the very
firſt Encounter, far out-do them, and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Spirit by whoſe aſſiſtance they wrought
their wonders, as evidently appears by <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>'s
Rods ſwallowing up their Rods, <hi>(Exod.
7. 12.)</hi> and by their not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the Frogs again from off the Land of
<hi>Aegypt:</hi> and therefore <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was forced
to call for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> and deſire
them to intreat the Lord to take away the
Frogs from him and his people <hi>(Exod. 8.

Secondly, It could not poſſibly be any Evil
Spirit, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles were wrought
for the higheſt, beſt and excellenteſt ends, to
wit, for the glory of God, and for the good
of his People; they were wrought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
both <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> That the
Lord God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi>
who made, and governs the World, is the
only true God, who is above all to be Feared
and Reverenced, Adored and Worſhipped,
Loved and Obeyed, Pleaſed and Glorified;
and that <hi>Moſes</hi> was his Authorized Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to be believed and obeyed for his ſake, in
all that he ſaid, and commanded in his name:
They were wrought alſo, both to cauſe <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
to let go the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and likewiſe to
make the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> willing to leave <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
and to go with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and take poſſeſſion of
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which the Lord God
had long before promiſed unto their Fathers,
<hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It could not poſſibly be any Evil
Spirit, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles were wrought
to the prejudice of the Devil's intereſt in
the World, and for the deſtroying of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's
Kingdom, by rooting out Idolatry from
among God's People, and driving Idolaters

                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It could not poſſibly be any Evil
Spirit, becauſe the Evil Spirit is the great
Enemy of Mankind, and of all humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
rightly conſtituted; whereas <hi>Moſes</hi>'s
Miracles were wrought for the confirmation
of a Doctrine, which is manifeſtly for the

                  <p>But not to inſiſt upon theſe and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
excellent Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which are
manifeſtly for the good of Mankind, and both
evidence themſelves to have been given unto
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> by an infinitely good God;
and alſo <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles wrought in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of them, to have been from the ſame
cauſe; there is one thing which I cannot but
touch upon, to wit, That whereas other Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers
have ſet up, ſome a Monarchy, ſome
an Ariſtocracy, and others a Democracy, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
was the firſt that Eſtabliſhed a viſible
Theocracy over the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> under which
form of Government, all things were to be
managed by the counſel and direction of the
infinitely wiſe God; the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as
a Kindom of Prieſts, and a Holy Nation,
were to refer all their matters unto God, and
to ask advice and direction of him by <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RIM
and TH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MMIM, in reference to Peace and
<pb facs="tcp:45306:17"/>
War, and all things of any conſiderable im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance,
or difficulty, <hi>(Exod. 19. 5, 6.</hi> &amp; 20.
24, <hi>the latter part, Exod.</hi> 28. 30. Deut. 10.
14, 15, 16, 17. &amp; 12. 11, 12, Levit. 26. 11,
12. &amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>Theſe things put together (if no more
could be ſaid) ſeem abundantly ſufficient to
prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> was Authorized by God to
give Laws unto the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> for no Man
could have wrought ſuch Miracles ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated,
except God had been with him:
and ſuch is the weakneſs of Man's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
that he could never of his own head
have invented ſuch a Law, and ſuch a way
of Government. And if <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Miracles
and Law could not poſſibly be of any Evil
Spirit, nor of Man, they muſt needs have
been of a Good Spirit, and that Good Spirit
could be no other but God: for though God
uſed the Miniſtry of Good and Holy Angels
in giving forth the Law, yet they could not
poſſibly be the Authors of it; and if any of
them had ever pretended unto that Honour,
he would by ſo doing have degenerated into
a proud, arrogant and lying Devil.</p>
                  <p>God himſelf then was the alone Author of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, and the Holy Angels with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
were but Inſtruments and Miniſters, by
whom God gave it unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and indeed
<pb facs="tcp:45306:17"/>
there is nothing in it, but what well becomes
God to be the Author of; there is nothing in it
that doth any way contradict the perfections of
his Nature, or deſtroy the natural notions of
Truth and Falſhood, Good and Evil which
he hath implanted in the mind of Man: nay
many of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws are evidently agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
unto, and Repreſentative of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent
excellencies of the Divine, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
of the humane Nature: and even
thoſe of them which are of a moſt adiapheros
indifferent nature in themſelves, and derive
all their morality from the will and pleaſure
of God, did certainly by Gods appointment
and bleſſing very much promote the happineſs
of his People, <hi>(Deut. 10. 12, 13.</hi> &amp; 11. 12,
to 16. <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 3, to 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 16, 17.)</p>
                  <p>As to what ſome Atheiſts Object from
<hi>Exod. 12. 35, 36.</hi> That <hi>Moſes</hi> taught the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
to cheat the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> of their
Jewels, under pretence of borrowing them,
and that God himſelf is brought in as counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing
the Cheat; which ſeems to be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contrary, both to the perfections of God,
and right Reaſon of Man.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, It is falſe that is Objected, for
there was really no borrowing and lending in
the caſe, but asking and receiving, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
away what God had inclined the hearts
<pb facs="tcp:45306:18"/>
of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> freely to give: and ſo
there could be no cheat under pretence of
borrowing. This Anſwer is grounded upon
the true import of the Hebrew Word <hi>(Shaal)</hi>
which ſignifies <hi>(to ask,)</hi> and accordingly the
place Objected is rendred by <hi>Munſter,</hi> and
the <hi>Tigurin;</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> thus, <hi>[The Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of</hi> Iſrael <hi>asked of the</hi> Aegyptians,
<hi>Jewels,</hi>—and the Lord gave the People
favor in the ſight of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> ſo that
they gave them ſuch thiugs as they asked,
and they carryed them away from the <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;]</hi>
the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> apprehended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be all dead Men, if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
ſtayed in <hi>Aegypt</hi> any longer, and therefore
were willing to give them any thing they
bad, on condition that they would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
gone, <hi>Verſ. 33.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus things were ordered by the wiſe
Providence of God, that the Children of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
might be rewarded for the great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
they had done unto the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moreover, It is very obſervable that ſome
of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Laws were ſuch, that it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to conceive that any Men in their Wits,
would either have given ſuch Laws unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or have themſelves received and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them; unleſs they had been ſure
that God was the Author of them, and that
<pb facs="tcp:45306:18"/>
he would take care to prevent the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences
that might ariſe from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of them. I Inſtance in Two,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Law for the Seventh Year Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
<hi>(Exod. 23. 10, 11,</hi> &amp; <hi>Levit. 25. 4, 5.)</hi>
The Command not to Plow nor Sow every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Year, was of ſuch conſequence, and
might have produced ſo ill effects, that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
would never have attempted to bring the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> under ſuch a Law, nor would they
have been ſuch fools as to have received it,
and ſubmitted to it, unleſs he and they had
been both ſure, that God had Authorized
him to give them that Law, and that God
had undertaken to ſecure them from the
great inconvenience that might ariſe from
their Obſervance of it; for if they had not
been ſure that God had by promiſe engaged
his Providence to Bleſs them with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
great abundance of Cornes on the Sixth
Year, they could not but foreſee that there
would have been a Scarcity and Famine on
the Seventh Year, eſpecially when the Year of
Jubile, which was every Fiftieth Year, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
the Seventh Year Sabbath; for in
that caſe the Law forbade them either to
Plow or Sow for Two whole Years together,
<hi>(Levit. 25. 8,</hi> to 12.) upon which they could
not but foreſee that a Famine would certainly
<pb facs="tcp:45306:19"/>
follow, unleſs God had undertaken by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
Providence to prevent it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Moſes</hi> muſt have been ſure of this, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
he would never have attempted the
giving them ſuch a Law; and he muſt have
made the People ſure of it alſo, otherwiſe
he could not but foreſee that they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have been ſo ſimple as to receive and
ſubmit unto ſuch a Law, as would expoſe
them to the danger of a Famine every Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Year, and in the revolution of Fifty
Years, would unavoidably bring a Famine
upon them. We read in the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus</hi>
where this Law is Recorded, That God
foreſeeing the People would certainly move
this Objection againſt it, he prevented them,
and both moved and anſwered the Objection
himſelf, <hi>Verſ. 20, 21. [If ye ſhall ſay,
What ſhall we eat the Seventh Year? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
we ſhall not Sow, nor gather in our
Increaſe. Then I will command my Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
upon you in the Sixth Year, and it
ſhall bring forth Fruit for Three Years,</hi>
&amp;c.] Here they had God's word of Promiſe,
Sealed with the Broad-Seal of Heaven, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>'s
Miracnlous Works for the ground of
their aſſurance, that God's extraordinary
Providence would ſecure them from Famine.</p>
                  <p>And it was upon this ſo well grounded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,
<pb facs="tcp:45306:19"/>
that they received and ſubmitted to
that Law. And God never failed them in
this, but always fnlfilled with his hand what
he had ſpoken with his mouth; ſo that they
were never forced to travel into other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to buy Corn for the ſupply of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities,
in thoſe Sabbatical Years.</p>
                  <p>The other Law I inſtance in, is, that
which obliged all the Males of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Thrice
a Year to appear before the Lord, at the
place where the Ark of God ſhould be,
<hi>(Exod. 23. 17.</hi> &amp; 34. 23. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16. 16.)
this Law was given and written by <hi>Moſes</hi>
for the Generations to come, and he could
not but foreſee that the People would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to Object againſt it, That if after they
were poſſeſſed of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> all
their Males ſhould Thrice every Year leave
their ſeveral Houſes and Countries, and
meet at one place, as at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or at
any other place where the Ark of God ſhould
happen to be; their Land would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of being frequently invaded, ſpoiled and
waſted by the malitious and covetous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
that lived round about them, and that
therefore it was moſt unreaſonable to deſire
them to be Governed by ſuch a Law: This
Objection, I ſay, <hi>Moſes</hi> could not but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee,
and therefore if he had not been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb facs="tcp:45306:20"/>
that it was God's will and pleaſure that
he ſhould give them ſuch a Law, he would
never have done it of his own head; and
likewiſe if they had not been certain that
<hi>Moſes</hi> was really Authorized and Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
by God to give them ſuch a Law, they
would never have received it, and ſubmitted
unto the obſervance of it, to the viſible ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
the loſs of all that they had in the
World. This God conſidered to be rational,
and therefore for their ſecurity he gave them
his promiſe by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
confirmed his Promiſe, That no Man
ſhould DESIRE their Land, when they
went up to appear before the Lord their God,
Thrice in the Year, <hi>(Exod. 34. 24,)</hi> as if
God had ſaid, Be not afraid leaſt the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
break in upon you, and Burn your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and lay waſte your Countrie, whilſt all
your Males are from home, attending npon
me at the place of my Publick Worſhip, for
when you are about my Work, I will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be with you abroad, but with your Wives
and Children likewiſe at home; and I will
take ſuch care of you and yours, and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all your Concerns, that your envious
and Covetous Neighbours and Enemies ſhall
not ſo much as deſire your Land, much leſs
ſhall they be able to lay it waſte and deſolate
<pb facs="tcp:45306:20"/>
with Fire and Sword, as you may be apt to fear.
It was by this promiſe, and the Miracles wrought
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that both <hi>Moſes</hi> and the People were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that this Law was of God, and that God's
ſpecial Providence would protect his People, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
all their concerns, when they were doing the will
of God according to this Law; and without this
aſſurance if <hi>Moſes</hi> had gone about to impoſe upon
them in a matter of ſuch dangerous conſequence, they
would certainly have refuſed to obey him.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Two Inſtances it manifeſtly appears, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> both knew in himſelf, and evidently proved
unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he was Commiſſioned by God to
give Laws unto them: for if it had been otherwiſe,
he would neither have attempted to give them ſuch
Laws, nor would they have ever received them
and ſubmitted to them. To draw to an end; Let it
be conſidered that <hi>Moſes</hi> Miracles tended all to the
Glory of God the Author of Nature, and to the
advanccment of his Kingdom in the World, as he
is the Author of Grace; and his Writings give us
moſt high, glorious and excellent, and alſo moſt
lovely and deſirable Idea's and Notions of God and
his Perfections. Witneſs God's name, [I AM
THAT I AM, and I AM, <hi>Exod. 3. 14.]</hi> which
ſignifies that he is the firſt and moſt perfect Beeing,
that gives Beeing to all other things, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
implies his eternal and neceſſary Exiſtence from
everlaſting and to everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>And his name, [THE LORD, THE LORD
GOD MERCIFUL and GRACIOUS, <hi>&amp;c. Exod.
34. 6, 7.]</hi> witneſs alſo that deſcription of him,
<hi>Exod. 15. 11. [WHO is like unto thee, O
<pb facs="tcp:45306:21"/>
LORD,—GLORIOUS IN HOLINESS FEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL
IN PRAISES, DOING WONDERS,]</hi>
and that other deſcription of him, <hi>(Deut. 32. 3,
4. I will publiſh the name of the Lord: aſcribe
ye greatneſs unto our God,</hi> &amp;c.) And what is
written of him in <hi>Deut. 4. 35,</hi> to 40. &amp; 10. 14, to 19.</p>
                  <p>Theſe moſt ſublime and excellent Notions of God
and his Perfections, with which <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings
do furniſh us, are proper and fit to raiſe in us a moſt
high eſteem and reverence of God, to make us admire
and adore him, to take us off from the inordinate
love of our ſelves, and of all other Creatures, as
mean and vile, as ſhadows and nothing; and to
draw out our hearts and affections wholly unto him,
to make us love him, and from a principle of Love,
careful to pleaſe him, and fearful to offend him,
<hi>(Deut. 6. 4, 5, 13, 14, 15.</hi> &amp; 10. 12, to 21.)
in fine, to make us hope in him, expect all needful
good things from him, and above all things deſire
to be united unto him, as the moſt glorious, excellent
and bleſſed Beeing, (which was, and is, and is to
come, of whom, through whom, and to whom, are
all things,) that we may be moſt happy in union
with him, <hi>and in the enjoyment of his Love and
Favor for evermore.</hi> I might here ſpeak of that
account which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives of the Creation of the
World, and eſpecially of Mankind; of the Diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and Apoſtacy of Mankind, and of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries
that came upon the World by reaſon thereof:
And of the reſtoring of Man to the favor of God
again by the Mediation of the Meſſias, who was
promiſed and Propheſied of, firſt under the name and
notion of the Seed of the Woman, that was to
<pb facs="tcp:45306:21"/>
bruiſe the Serpents Head, <hi>(Gen. 3. 15.)</hi> then of
the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in which Seed all
the Nations of the Earth were to be Bleſied, <hi>(Gen.
22. 18.</hi> &amp; 26. 4.) and afterwards, of the Seed
of <hi>Jacob</hi> by <hi>Judah,</hi> and ſtiled <hi>SHILOH,</hi> unto
whom the gathering of the People was to be, <hi>(Gen.
28. 14.</hi> compared with <hi>Gen. 49. 10.</hi> &amp; <hi>Numb.
24. 16, 17, 19.)</hi> and laſtly, under the name and
notion of a Prophet like nnto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and who by
conſequence was to be a Lawgiver and Mediator,
<hi>(Deut. 18. 18, 19.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might ſhew the Reader that <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Writings
ſet forth God as placable and reconcileahle, <hi>(Gen. 3.
15.</hi> &amp; 4. 7.) as pleaſed and reconciled <hi>(Gen.
4. 4.</hi> &amp; 8. 20, 21.) and as pleaſed and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
by Faith, <hi>(Gen. 15. 6.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I might demonſtrate, that the account which
<hi>Moſes</hi> gives of theſe things, is highly agreeable to
right reaſon and experience, and that it is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
and ſatisfactory to the mind of Man: But
all this cannot he done in the compaſs of a ſhort
Epiſtle.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may expect that I ſhould at leaſt ſay
ſomething in behalf of the Two following Diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;
but if he do, <hi>he</hi> will be diſappointed: for
having ſaid enough in commendation of the Firſt
Diſconrſe in the beginning of the Second, I will ſay
no more of either, but leave both to ſpeak for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Only I muſt advertiſe the Reader, That the
Tranſlation varies from the Original in ſome Two or
Three things, and this is the reaſon of the variation;
I found that there were ſeveral palpable miſtakes in
the <hi>French</hi> Diſcourſe, and I am reſolved through
<pb facs="tcp:45306:22"/>
God's Grace to follow no Man in known miſtakes:
therefore I mended them. As where the Author
ſays, That the broad Plates for covering the Altar,
made of the Cenſers of <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company,
were Plates of Gold; I ſay, as the truth is, that
they were Plates of Braſs, <hi>(Numb. 16. 39.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, where the Author ſays, That <hi>Moſes</hi>
Condemned Thirty or Forty Thouſand Men, and
commanded them all to be preſently Executed: I
ſay, that he did ſo by ſeveral Thouſands, which is
true, for the number of the Slain was about Three
Thouſand, <hi>(Exod. 32. 28.)</hi> but our Learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
was certainly miſtaken, for his reckoning nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
agrees exactly with the Vulgar Tranſlation, nor
yet with the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Verity. Chriſtian Reader, I
will detain thee no longer from the peruſal of the
Diſcourſes themſelves, and that the uſe of them may

                  <head>A
DISCOURSE
On the Proofs of the
BOOKS of MOSES.</head>
                  <p>1. THE Chriſtian Religion doth
freely acknowledge that the
wit of Man cannot reach the
the height of the Myſteries
which it teacheth, and that the humane
underſtanding is too narrow and limited
to diſcover the grounds of them in the
Eternal ſprings of Truth, where they
would appear to us as clear, as firſt and
ſelf evident Principles, if our ſight could
reach ſo far. Nevertheleſs, it pretends not
that we ſhould believe them abſolutely
without proof, and by a blind Inſtinct:
and God hath not given Man Reaſon and
Underſtanding, to render ſo great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
not onely uſeleſs, but alſo hurtful to
him, by propounding unto him ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of Faith only, againſt which his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
faculty ſhould be in a continual
mutiny and contradictory oppoſition. That
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45306:23"/>
is the caſe of thoſe Sects which are founded
only upon Wild Fancies, Groundleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
and Phanatical Viſions; and which
are Eſtabliſhed upon, and Upheld by, no
other Principle than ſuch an extravagant
abuſe of Reaſon, as that was by which they
were firſt hatcht: Whereas the Chriſtian
Religion is ſuch, that how impenetrable
ſoever be the depth of its myſteries, yet
none can doubt of their truth, but by
ſuch another kind of extravagancy.</p>
                  <p>2. For the buſineſs is not to examine
the poſſibility of thoſe myſteries, nor to
cure the wit of Man, as touching all the
difficulties which it finds to ſubmit unto
them, men would be unreaſonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
to comprehend them, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
comprehend themſelves, and yet doubt
not of their own Exiſtence. It is ſufficient
that it may be demonſtrated to them that
all thoſe ſo unconceivable Truths are link<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
not only with other Truths which
they know, but alſo with ſuch Truths as
of all others are moſt proportionat to their
underſtanding, and whereof they may be
aſſured by the moſt evident and certain
means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:45306:23"/>
3. If men have a certain knowledg of
any thing, it is of matters of Fact; of all
things which they know, there is not any,
wherein it is more difficult to impoſe upon
them, and concerning which there is leſs
occaſion of diſpute; and ſo when it ſhall
be clearly ſhewed them that the Chriſtian
Religion is inſeperably linked with matters
of Fact, whereof the Truth cannot be
queſtioned by men of common honeſty
and integrity, they muſt either ſubmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the belief of all its Doctrines, or elſe
they muſt renounce ſincerity and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>4. For inſtance, if there was ſuch a
Man as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and if he was the Author
of the Books commonly attributed unto
him, then the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion is true: if
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion be true, then Jeſus
Chriſt is the Meſſias; and if Jeſus Chriſt
be the Meſſias, then all that he ſaid and
taught is to be believed, and conſequently
the Trinity, the Incarnation, and all the
other myſterious Doctrines of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion are to be believed.</p>
                  <p>5. It is by this Divine concatenation
of Truths, that God leads Men unto the
true Faith, and that they are enabled to
ſhow that there is nothing more rational,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45306:24"/>
than their ſubmiſſion unto the moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
myſteries; ſo far are they from
deſerving to be charged with weakneſs and
imprudence on that account; and ſince the
great Body of Chriſtian Religion is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
of a very great number of different
Parts which all tend to the ſame end, and
hath had a Being about ſix thouſand years;
it cannot be but that it muſt conſiſt of
very many particular Truths all linked
together as in one chain, and that every
Age muſt have given new proofs thereof:
and conſequently that whereſoever a Man
begins, to what point ſoever he applies
himſelf, he will always meet with ſuch an
abundance of light, that it will be impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to reſiſt and ſtand out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
it.</p>
                  <p>6. But we are ſo much the more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
diligently to apply our ſelves unto an
accurat ſearch for finding out of theſe
Proofs, by how much it hath not pleaſed
God that they ſhould conſiſt in ſuch groſs
and palpable Principles, as might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
at firſt glance, and might be ſeen
equally by all men; they are rather an
heap of circumſtances, which all men
do not put together, or do not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them the ſame way; but which are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45306:24"/>
nevertheleſs ſenſibly evident unto the
meaneſt capacities, when their eyes are
once opened; and do produce (when
they are gathered up and put together) a
certainty if not more full, at leaſt more
intimate and more natural, than that which
we have of ſpeculative and abſtractive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations,
becauſe the ways and means
of attaining unto the aſſurance of thoſe
matters of Fact are more proportionable
and ſutable unto the humane underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and there is no man but will find
the Principles of them in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>7. It is for this end, to give a Specimen
how thoſe matters of Fact are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
whoſe certainty neceſſarily infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the certainty of our Religion, that
we ſhall chooſe to diſcourſe of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
matters of Fact in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Hiſtory,
and of the Truth of his Books, which are
the Foundation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, as
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> is the Foundation of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion according to Saint <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. I think there is no need that I ſhould
firſt prove, before I proceed any further,
That if really there hath been a Man affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
that he was ſent from God, and who
(not deſiring to be believed upon his bare
word, or for ſome Actions not much above
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45306:25"/>
thoſe which we know to be within the
compaſs of humane power) hath for
proof of his miſſion, wrought that aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
multitude of Miracles which we
find Recorded in the Pentateuch, hath evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſhewed that he had power of life
and death, hath commanded the Elements,
and made the whole frame of Nature to
bow at his word and obey his orders, I
ſay, there is no need that I ſhould prove
he ought to be believed, for I doubt not
but that upon ſuppoſition that there hath
been ſuch a Man who hath really done
ſuch things to prove his miſſion from God,
all Men in the World will grant that this
perſon deſerves to be believed in all that
he hath written of that God, in whoſe
name he hath wrought all thoſe Miracles,
and that the Religion which he hath inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted
ought to be received as true and
Divine.</p>
                  <p>9. The moſt obſtinate Spirits of Men
are as it were overwhelmed with the
weight of thoſe Miracles, and find no other
means to ſatisfie their byaſs to unbelief,
than to ſeek to find out ſome frivolous
reaſons on which to ground their doubts
of the truth of thoſe Miracles, and of the
Book that contains them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:45306:25"/>
10. But if they have any remainder of
honeſty &amp; ſincerity, I defie them to go far,
or continue long in thoſe doubts; for they
will find their doubts ſo born down and
vanquiſhed by the abundance of proofs
which accompany this Hiſtory, that they
will be forced either to acknowledg it to
be true, or elſe to fall in with the ſenſeleſs
ſtupidity of thoſe perſons who for fear of
being powerfully perſwaded to believe the
things which Religion teacheth them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvedly
chooſe never to think on them at
all.</p>
                  <p>11. For by what ſuppoſitions will they
pretend to ſhake the certainty of what is
written in thoſe Books, and diſpoſe their
minde to believe that there was never any
ſuch thing? Let them give as much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as they will unto their Fancy, and let it
furniſh them with all the Chymerical
ſuppoſitions that poſſibly it can, yet they
ſhall never be able to conclude any thing
from thence, which hath the leaſt ſhadow
of probability, and which a Man of the
leaſt ſolid Judgment would not be aſhamed
to propound.</p>
                  <p>12. Will they ſay, <hi>there was never ſuch
a Man as</hi> Moſes, <hi>and that whatever hath
been ſaid of him, are fables invented for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45306:26"/>
delight?</hi> But let them conſider that the
<hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians are not the onely
perſons who have been known to ſpeak
and write of this <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſince we find there
are even prophane Hiſtorians who make
mention of him, yet if they deny what is
written of him in the Penteatuch, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
all thoſe things to be Fables, then let
them alſo deny all the Hiſtories in the
World, and affirm them all to be fables;
ſince there is none of them of whoſe Truth
we could be ſure, if it were allowed (as
any way rational) to doubt whether there
was ever a Man called <hi>Moſes,</hi> who brought
the <hi>Jews</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> after a long cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity;
for all the Reaſons by which Men
judge of the Truth of other Hiſtories, are
equally to be found in that of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For
example, no Man doubts but that <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>
and <hi>Cyrus</hi> have been, becauſe many
Authors have written of them, and it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
came into any Mans mind deliberat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to doubt thereof: and it is evident that
neither hath any Man upon ſerious
thoughts ever doubted whether <hi>Moſes</hi> hath
been; this hath been conſtantly believed
by a very numerous people, and by all
who have known, and have converſed both
with him and them; and was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45306:26"/>
by any Body whoſoever. But
moreover there is this difference, that the
Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> have ſingular and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
proofs of their certain truth, which
are not to be met with in any other; for
there was never any Book preſerved with
ſo much care and affection, as that Book
which containeth his Hiſtory, and yet
never had any men more ſenſible and
ſtrong Reaſons, taken from their own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
to diſprove the truth of a Book,
if they could have done it with any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of probability, than the <hi>Jews</hi> have
had to diſprove the truth of the Books of
<hi>Moſes;</hi> ſince by ſo doing, they ſhould
have at once freed themſelves from the
moſt uneaſie Law that ever was, from a
Law (I ſay) that was moſt rigorous and
grievous, moſt dreadful and burdenſome
to the obſervers of it: in ſo much that there
appeareth no motive, that could perſwade
them to ſubmit unto, and endure the whole
burden of it, but a firm perſwaſion of its
infallible Truth and divine Authority.</p>
                  <p>13. <hi>Unbelief then not being able to
keep its ground upon this firſt Chymeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
ſuppoſition, it muſt paſs unto, and fix
upon ſome other; and the Infidel muſt
ſay, for example, that it is true, there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45306:27"/>
was a man called</hi> Moſes, <hi>and this man was
the head of a great</hi> Nation, which he
brought out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but withall, that he
was a great Impoſtor, who deceived that
people by falſe Miracles, and forged all the
prodigious things which he mentions in his
Books, to the end he might the better bring
them under Subjection to the Law he had
deviſed, and by that Law to himſelf, in
making them to eſteem it as come from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and to conſider himſelf as the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of God's Will, in whoſe name he ſpake,
and as having God's Power in his own
hands, to puniſh thoſe that ſhould reſiſt
him.</p>
                  <p>14. The greateſt efforts and endeavors
of humane Wit to diſprove the truth of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Books, may be reduced to ſuch
imaginations as theſe, and yet nothing leſs
rational could be invented; for if men
would in this matter make uſe but of
proofs taken from meer ſenſe, how diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
is it to reconcile the Wiſdom and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
which clearly appear in this <hi>Moſes,</hi> with
ſo black an Imposture! how difficult is it
to comprehend, that this man in an Age
ſo remote, ſo dark and ſo rude, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any help from the Inventions of thoſe
that had gone before, could have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45306:27"/>
to contrive of his own head, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a Law, from which all other Laws
have been obliged to borrow ſomething
or other, but moreover, that he could
have been able to have framed the Idea or
Notion of a God, and that an Idea ſo
great and ſo worthy, that excepting thoſe
who have trodden in his ſteps, there were
never any who have had an Idea of God,
but what was infinitely below it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
all other humane Inventions grow up
to perfection ſucceſſively, and by degrees!
in fine, how ſtrange a thing would it be,
that this firſt born of all Impoſtors ſhould
have hit ſo right in a matter ſo far ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
above the thoughts of men, and
ſhould have known ſo well what ſhould be
due to a God, and what a God ſhould be;
that really Men are ſenſibly convinced
that he muſt be ſuch a God, if he be at
all, and that honeſt hearts ſhould be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly
troubled at it, if ſuch a God were
not.</p>
                  <p>15. But to paſs from this, unto ſuch
things as bear a greater proportion unto
all ſorts of Capacities; let us ſee whether
it be poſſible, that all the Miracles menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in thoſe Books, ſhould be but ſo
many Fables invented by <hi>Moſes;</hi> if this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45306:28"/>
be poſſible, then either he muſt have
hoped to make the <hi>Jews</hi> believe him, or
at leaſt, he muſt have hoped to perſwade
them to Authorize them by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
without believing them, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
with him to conceal the knowledg of
this Cheat from poſterity, for undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
none will ſay that he invented them
upon deſign to paſs for an Impoſtor, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
expecting any advantage thereby;
and withal it muſt be ſuppoſed, either that
the <hi>Jews</hi> believed them to be true, though
they were falſe; or that allowing them to
be falſe, they all with one conſent agreed
in a deſign, to make them paſs for true,
to their Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>16. But what can be imagined more
groundleſs and undefenſible than all this?
could <hi>Moſes</hi> promiſe himſelf, that he
ſhould be able to perſwade the <hi>Jews</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the turning of Rivers into Blood,
the thick palpable Darkneſs which cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all <hi>Aegypt,</hi> for the ſpace of Three
Days, the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> only being free from
it; the Death of all the firſt Born of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi>
in one Night, whileſt the <hi>Jews</hi>
in the mean time felt not the leaſt hurt;
the diviſion of the Red-Sea, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and on each ſide ſtood up in an heap,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45306:28"/>
like two Walls, to make way for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and then fell down
again, and returned to its ordinary courſe,
to ſwallow up, and Drown the Army of
the <hi>Aegyptians;</hi> with all the reſt of thoſe
Miracles which viſibly ſucceeded one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
before that people went out of the
Land of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> could he hope that none
of the <hi>Jews</hi> would doubt of the truth of
all theſe things (if they were falſe) nor
have at leaſt the curioſity to enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
them, of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> who in
all probability were not combined in the
Plot with him?</p>
                  <p>17. Moreover, could he believe that
he ſhould be able eaſily to perſwade them,
to give credit unto what he writes, of
the Forty Years which they ſpent in the
Wilderneſs, which is no leſs than another
Series of Miracles? that he ſhould be able
to make them believe (though there was
no ſuch thing) that he had drawn out of
a Rock, Water enough to quench the
Thirſt of Five or Six Hundred Thouſand
Men: that before their eyes the Earth
had ſwallowed up quick, <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi>
and <hi>Abiram,</hi> after he had advertiſed the
people, that they ſhould die of a ſtrange
and extraordinary kind of Death; that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45306:29"/>
they themſelves had lived for the ſpace of
Forty Years, only upon Food ſent down
from Heaven; and laſt of all, that he
ſhould be able to make them believe that
great and dreadful ſight of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi>
while it appeared all in a Flame, with
ſuch a noiſe of Lightning and Thunder,
that the people who ſtood by, and heard
and ſaw all that paſſed, deſired to treat
and converſe no more, but by Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors
with that God, whoſe glorious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
they thought they could not bear
and live?</p>
                  <p>18. If <hi>Moſes</hi> had been ſo ſenſeleſs and
mad, as to flatter himſelf with this hope,
how unable would he have been even for
that very reaſon alone, to ſucceed, and
bring to paſs any great deſign! and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of carrying matters ſo far, and
bringing them to that Iſſue as he did, ſuch
a mad head would not have failed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil
and confound all its own projects;
where is there an example in all Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
of any cheat of this nature? theſe
are not the ways and methods which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers
take; they do not lay open their
Lies to ſo great a light, and they are too
wary to chuſe Judges ſo hard to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
as the Eyes and Ears of Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45306:29"/>
Thouſand Men, and a whole Nation
of Enemies; they feign ſome obſcure
blind Mitacle, whereof there have been
but few Witneſſes, and cauſe the Fame of
it to be ſpread abroad by their Partiſans;
above all they avoid with great care, the
provoking of humane Nature to riſe up
in contradictory oppoſition to them, which
they would ſurely do, if they ſhould bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
take folks to witneſs of ſuch things, as
wherein they ſhould have ſo great cauſe
to fear to be belied: and there is nothing
which they ſhun ſo much, as the giving
occaſion unto Mens minds, to think of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
upon their Falſhoods, and the inducing
them to make frequent reflections upon
their Lies; they account themſelves hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
that they were once ſuffered to ſcape
without being puniſhed for their cheating
Tricks; and they cannot poſſibly ſo far
root out of their natures all ſenſe of Fear
and Shame, as to dare ſet groſs Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
continually before the eyes of a
whole Nation, taking them to witneſs,
and exciting them by ſuch an unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
boldneſs to enquire into, and conſider
of them, with the greater care and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:45306:30"/>
19. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> be tryed by theſe Rules,
to ſee whether he obſerves any of theſe
precautions, and takes any of theſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
which Nature and Intereſt would
teach the moſt deſperate, yea, and even
the moſt Fooliſh inconſiderate Impoſtors.
He ſpeaks upon every occaſion, both of
the Plagues of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
in the Wilderneſs, and that with a
confidence ſufficient to provoke the moſt
unſenſible, if their Reaſon could have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
to them any colourable pretence
for the contradicting of him; he reports
to them things groſs and palpable, which
could not be unknown to them. God
hath given you (ſaith he) Manna, which
was meat unknown to your Fathers; your
Cloaths were not worn out, no nor your
Shoes, for the ſpace of Forty Years:
which of all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the Truth of this matter of fact?
he joins to all this, ſharp reproofs, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
againſt their paſt unbeleif,
and diſpleaſing Predictions of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly
Behaviour for the future: in fine,
he omits nothing that might have exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated
their Spirits and moved them to
give him the lye, if the things which he
aſcribed to himſelf, had been falſe or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45306:30"/>
In ſo much, that though they be never
ſo true, yet it is a kind of Miracle, that
in all the Rebellions and Murmurings they
were guilty of, there was not found ſo
much as one of them that ever accuſed
him of Impoſture.</p>
                  <p>20. It is certain then, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could
not have a deſign to deceive the <hi>Jews,</hi> and
it is as certain, that it was impoſſible
for him to have really deceived them, and
let not men pretend to make theſe proofs
paſs for probable conjectures, and meer
likelihoods only; for they are demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in matters of Fact, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be rejected by any man, without his
being obliged by purity of Reaſon, to
hold that all matters of Fact, mentioned
in any Hiſtory whatſoever, are doubtful
and uncertain.</p>
                  <p>21. For the ground of all humane cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,
is this, that Men are not fools,
and that there are certain Rules in Nature,
which they always follow in their Actings,
unleſs they be mad, the contrary could no
ſooner be ſuppoſed, but it would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
follow, that there can be nothing
firm and certain. Let it be once grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that men may feign for ſport, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
ſake, That in the time of <hi>Caeſar</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45306:31"/>
and <hi>Pompey,</hi> all Men were ſtruck with a
Diſeaſe, which cauſed them to take the
illuſions of their Fancy, for real Truths;
upon this ſuppoſition, there will remain
nothing certain in all the Revolutions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to have fallen out in thoſe times;
and the Battels of <hi>Pharſalia</hi> and <hi>Actium</hi>
may be reckoned amongſt the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Phanaticks. Thus when matters
are brought to this paſs, That for to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ſuch a thing is not, it muſt be
ſuppoſed (I do not ſay that a whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but) that a very great number of
Men are all really Mad, there is an end
of humane certainty, in matters of Fact,
there is no more place for it, no not with
reſpect to things preſent: Since it is no
leſs ſuppoſable, that the Men of this Age,
yea, and that we our ſelves are Mad, than
that Men of former Ages were all Mad,
and ſo not only all things paſt, ſhall be
to us as if they had never been, but alſo
we ſhall not know what to believe, even
in thoſe things which daily fall under our
Senſes, and we ſhall be no leſs in the
dark, as touching things paſt and preſent,
than we are as touching things to come.</p>
                  <p>22. But now it is paſt all doubt that
the ſuppoſition that <hi>Moſes</hi> deceived the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45306:31"/>
                     <hi>Jews,</hi> is properly of this kind; for not to
ſpeak of the folly he muſt have been
guilty of, if he had taken ſuch a way for
attaining unto that end; it is clear that
it is to make all this people paſs for ſo
many Frantick Fools, to ſay, They really
believed that themſelves paſſed through
the Sea on dry ground, although it was
not true; that they ſaw a Mountain all
in fire, although they did not ſee it; that
they lived upon Manna, whilſt they fed
only upon ordinary Food; that their
Cloaths did not wear out, although they
were often forced to change them; that
they ſaw <hi>Moſes</hi> with a ſtroke of his Rod,
fetch out of a Rock, a Spring of Water, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to quench the Thirſt of Six Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Thouſand Men, although they ſaw
no ſuch thing; to ſay that they believed
all this, though it were all falſe, is to ſay
that they were all Mad.</p>
                  <p>23. Doubtleſs it would be very difficult
to invent either ſecret ways or Engines,
whereby ſuch effects as theſe could be
produced or imitated; and if there were
any man that could do ſo, he would be
ſure to have followers enough, as well as
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and he might make Men believe,
almoſt any thing he pleaſed. And yet it
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45306:32"/>
muſt be granted, that the <hi>Jews</hi> really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that they ſaw all thoſe great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and that they believed thus, even
without the leaſt ſcruple or doubt remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their minds; elſe they would not
have ſubmitted ſo blindly to this Man's
Law, nor ſuffered him to domineer over
them with ſo much Authority, as that he
alone ſhould be able, without Guards and
Arms, to condemn ſeveral Thouſands of
Men to Death, and to cauſe them all to
be preſently Executed, <hi>Exod. 32. 26, 27,
28.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>24. Some perſons have endeavored
(not indeed to do the like, for no man
was ever ſo Mad as to attempt it, but)
to imagine ſeveral ways how <hi>Moſes</hi> might
have deluded the <hi>Jews,</hi> and yet they have
not done any thing to purpoſe. They
pretend, for example, <hi>That to make them
paſs through the Red-Sea, he took his oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of the Ebbing of the Sea, and made
them believe it had divided on purpoſe;
and that when it Flowed again, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
them, it had cloſed again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to its ordinary courſe, that it might
ſwallow up the</hi> Aegyptians. <hi>They pretend
alſo that the Water he fetched out of the
Rock, was nothing elſe but an hidden Spring
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45306:32"/>
which he found out by means of a Wild Aſs,
which ſome Body followed by his order, as it
went thither to drink.</hi> This is ſo pitiful,
that it deſerves no Anſwer, only let it be
conſidered, how a thing ſo common as
the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea could
have been unknown, not only to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi>
who had lived above Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Years in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but likewiſe to the
Natives of that Countrey, who ruſhed
into it ſo inconſiderately; and how could
that Spring have been ſo little, as to lie
hid from ſo many people, that were like
to die for Thirſt, and yet be at the ſame
time abundantly ſufficient to quench
their Thirſt, and the Thirſt of all their
Camels and other Beaſts; and finally, by
what Inchantment could <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
blind the Eyes of all this people,
as to make them believe, that all of a
ſudden, a ſtroke of his Rod had produced
that Spring, which cannot be conceived
to have been leſs than a prodigious Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</p>
                  <p>25. But it is to little purpoſe, for any
Man to endeavor to give the World an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how ſome of thoſe Miracles might
have been wrought, without the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
power of God, ſo long as it muſt be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45306:33"/>
confeſſed, that no ſuch account can be
given of them all. Men muſt either
yield the cauſe, or elſe make the Syſtem
entire, and ſolve all the <hi>Phaenomena:</hi> for
if there remain never ſo few, in which
the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> could not be deceived, that
is ſufficient to convince us, and oblige us
to believe all the reſt; and to look upon
<hi>Moſes</hi> as the Miniſter of God, who would
reveal himſelf to Men: ſince the Laws of
Nature once Violated, ſuffice to teach us,
and make us ſee, that there is ſomething
above Nature; and never Man before Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt, appeared ſo viſibly to have
been entruſted with the power of that
Lord of Nature, as this Man that we
ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>26. It may be ſome will rather chuſe
to ſay, That in truth it is impoſſible, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould have deceived the <hi>Jews,</hi> but,
<hi>That it may very well be, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
have helped on the Cheat, and that
they may have looked upon that heap of
Miracles (as fabulous as they were) as a
thing that might make them to be admired
by other Nations.</hi> But in truth there is
nothing but the deſire of deviſing to ones
felf ſome ground of doubting, what ever
it be, that could produce ſuch a Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45306:33"/>
ſuppoſition; for of all the ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that Infidelity could ſuggeſt, this
certainly is the moſt undefenſible. We
ſhall ſhow by and by, that this people
could not have contributed their help to
this Impoſture, by ſuppoſing, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently,
or ſome time after <hi>Moſes</hi> his
Death, and the Law being already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
amongſt them, ſome new Upſtart
deviſed ſuch a ſtrange way to make them
conſiderable and famous in the World:
and by proving, that their Love to their
Nation would have been ſo far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
them to conſent to it, as that it
will appear that that alone would have
been an invincible obſtacle thereunto;
which is no leſs true, with reſpect to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
than it is with reſpect to any other.
But there is yet infinitely leſs probability,
that the firſt <hi>Jews</hi> would conſent to any
ſuch thing; for who could imagine that
they would have plotted with <hi>Moſes</hi> to
bring themſelves in Subjection to a Law,
which they believed to be the meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of his invention, and that for the
ſame Law (of which they had ſuch an
opinion) they would have ſuffered
themſelves to be uſed ſo rigorouſly, as that
a meer omiſſion in Ceremonies ſhould be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45306:34"/>
puniſhed with Death, and that without
murmuring or repining at it? what more
can be done or ſuffered, on the account
of things that are moſt ſeriouſly managed
and believed, and that are found to be
eſtabliſhed time out of mind? beſides,
that it would be a rare ſight indeed, to
ſee Five or Six Hundred Thouſand Men
all agreed, to report a known Falſhood,
and that none of them all, nor of their
Poſterity, ſhould ever contradict it, and
give the reſt the Lie.</p>
                  <p>27. For there was not one of thoſe
Miracles, whereof every particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of that numerous people, all encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
together, could not but have known
the Falſity (if they had been falſe:)
and, which yet he was to Authorize, as
having ſeen it with his own Eyes, or as
having been done in his own, or his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
time; what a work then had this
been for <hi>Moſes,</hi> to make ſure of ſo many
perſons, and eſpecially amongſt a people
ſo difficult to be Governed? and how
comes it to paſs, that among ſo many,
there ſhould not be either ſome conceited
Fellow, or ſome ſober underſtanding man,
that ſet himſelf to oppoſe ſuch a deſign?
whoſoever ſhould have undertaken to do
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45306:34"/>
ſo, he muſt be very ignorant of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of Man, who cannot ſee that ſuch
an one would quickly have had as many
followers as <hi>Moſes;</hi> or at leaſt, that he
would have been deſirous to acquaint Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
with this Impoſture, and that he
would have eaſily accompliſhed his deſire
or purpoſe to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>28. Beſides, what could be a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and likely means to render the <hi>Jews</hi>
ridiculous among all Nations; ſo far was it
from being a fit means to make them be
admired, and how blind muſt they have
been, not to have ſeen this? for inſtance,
what would the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> have ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
all thoſe Plagues, which <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſays he brought upon them, concerning
that Death of all their Firſt-born, and
that Drowning of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Army in the
Sea? and how came all thoſe other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(whom they braged to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
in ſo extraordinary a manner) to
be ſo enchanted, as to let ſo many fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Stories paſs in the World without
contradiction, unleſs they were alſo in the
Plot againſt themſelves, and were as real
Enemies to, and haters of, their own
Fame and Glory in the World, as it is
imagined and ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45306:35"/>
were ridiculouſly in Love with
theirs.</p>
                  <p>29. Men may invent Fables, I confeſs,
yet they do not carry them to that exceſs
when they would have them to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
and above all, they are very careful
to place the firſt riſe of them in far diſtant
times, and to vail them with the obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and darkneſs of many remote Ages. But
as men never deſign to Paſs for knaves or
fools, ſo they never invent ſuch fabulous
ſtories as may be gainſaid and proved falſe
by living Witneſſes, yea by whole and
much concerned Nations; as for inſtance,
it had been a pretty project in the <hi>Moors,</hi>
when they were returned into <hi>Africa,</hi> after
they had been driven out of <hi>Spain,</hi> if they
had undertaken to make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that they came out of it voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by Miracles like to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Miracles,
and that after the <hi>Mediterranian</hi> Sea had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
it ſelf to make way for their paſſage,
they ſaw it cloſe again to drown an Army
of (I know not how) many Thouſands of
Men that purſued them, and yet the deſign,
we ſpeak of, had been no leſs extravagant in
the <hi>Jews:</hi> for we muſt not repreſent unto
our ſelves thoſe ſo remote times, although
groſs or rude, as ſo dark as they may ſeem
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45306:35"/>
to be, in thoſe times Men heard from one
another; they had the ſame Intereſts, and
the ſame Paſſions that we have: they ſaw
what they ſaw, and felt what was to be
felt as well as we do.</p>
                  <p>30. Theſe two hypotheſes then muſt
be abſolutely abandoned, neither was <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
an Impoſtor that deceived the <hi>Jews;</hi>
neither were the <hi>Jews</hi> in confederacy with
him to carry on the Plot. There remains
nothing to be objected, but <hi>that</hi> Moſes
<hi>was not the Author of the Book that bears
his Name, or at leaſt, that it is but ſince his
death, that all thoſe Miracles which it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
have been added to it.</hi> This is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefs
laſt Refuge; but Reaſon will not
ſuffer a Man that hath the leaſt meaſure
of common ſenſe to take up with it.</p>
                  <p>31. Although we had nothing elſe to
certifie us that theſe are really the Books
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that we have them ſuch as
they were penned by him, but this that
they bear his Name, as they themſelves
witneſs, that they have been always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
unto him, and that it came into
no mans mind until now, to affirm the
contrary; this ſhould be enough, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of this, we could not reaſonably
doubt of their being his, ſince we have
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45306:36"/>
no other aſſurance that any Books written
in former Ages at any conſiderable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
are the Books of thoſe Authors
whoſe they are ſaid to be.</p>
                  <p>32. And let none ſay that there are
Books which, after they had paſſed for a
time under the Name of certain Authors,
have at laſt been found to be ſuppoſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icious;
for without entring upon the Examination
of that matter, I ſay that it is abſolutely
Impoſſible that this could happen to a
Book of the greateſt importance, to which
the certainty of the Authors Name is Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential,
and whereof in all Ages, Men
have had ſo much cauſe, and ſo great an
Intereſt to examine the Origination and
Truth, for as Truth is of ſuch a Nature,
that all things (except falſhood) agree
with it, all things concur to Eſtabliſh it,
and there is neither care nor labour, that
can find out any thing which is able to
overthrow it; ſo on the contrary, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
but falſhood will at laſt be found
out, if we endeavour it: becauſe it cannot
be, but there will be an infinite number
of things that are contrary unto it; and
how great ſoever be the foreſight and cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of Impoſtors, it is not poſſible, though
the humane underſtanding were not ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45306:36"/>
limited as it is, to foreſee all inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
or to ſuit and accommodate every
thing to the preventing of them, when
they are foreſeen; for in fine, though
there were for that purpoſe certain effects,
whereof men were Maſters, and had the
diſpoſal, It is cettain that there is alſo an
infinite number of things, which they have
no power at all to diſpoſe of; to be able
to prevent all things that might diſcover
their forgery, they muſt be in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to diſpoſe of things preſent and to come,
to change the order of all things, and in
a word to command the Nature, the
wits and wills of men at their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>33. But beſides this, we have yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably
more and ſtronger proofs of
the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> than there are of any
other Books. Other Books are in few
peoples hands, and there are not many
who think themſelves concerned in them;
thoſe that are concerned in them, do but
ſeldom mind them, or their Intereſt in
them, and even that Intereſt can be but
comparatively of ſmall importance. But
the Books we ſpeak of, are of a much
different nature; they have always been
in the hands of a whole great Nation;
they have been the object of their conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45306:37"/>
meditation: and ſince they were the
foundation of their Religion, and that a
Religion which abhors lying and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
how could they have ſuffered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be impoſed upon in the matter
of the Authors name, and the Book it
ſelf to be corrupted by the addition of ſo
many Fables? or could it be done without
their knowledg; yea, and who durſt be
ſo bold as ever to attempt it?</p>
                  <p>34. Let men take a full view of that
prodigious Series of Miracles wrought in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the Wilderneſs, and then
judge impartially, whether theſe are things
that could be inſerted into a Book, and
yet that Book be made to paſs for the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal.
This is the moſt that could be
done to ſome inconſiderable Book which
ſhould fall into the hands but of a few
perſons, and with ſome particular Miracle
pretended to have been wrought before a
few witneſſes; and moreover, we ſee that
ſuch things do not ſpread far, nor laſt
long; they are ſcarcely ſooner forged, but
they begin to be queſtioned, in ſo much that
in time they come to be regarded by none,
but the ſimple people, who believe by the
Faith of the next intruder, and do not ſo
much as think of getting clear and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45306:37"/>
notions of the leaſt thing in the World.
But there is nothing upon Earth clear, if
this be not, that ſuch things could not
happen to ſuch a Book, as we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
this to be. I might as well ſay
that it would be no hard matter to inſert
now into the New Teſtament an Hiſtory
as long, and as conſiderable, as that of
<hi>Moſes</hi> his Miracles in <hi>Aegypt</hi> and the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs:
and how ridiculous ſoever this
ſuppoſition appeareth to be, I know not
whither it was not yet more difficult to
inſert ſuch fabulous ſtories into the Books
of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſince the <hi>Jews</hi> had at leaſt as
high an eſteem for their Sacred Books of
the Law, as we have for ours of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
and there were none among them
whoſe moſt near and natural Intereſt it
was not to know what they contained,
had it been only that they might learn
how to ſave themſelves from that death
which they were to ſuffer without reprieve,
upon failure of the performance of ſome
duties preſcribed by their Law.</p>
                  <p>35. But that which invincibly proves
the falſhood of this ſuppoſition, is this,
That there are in a manner two Hiſtories
of <hi>Moſes:</hi> the one written in the Book
that bears his name, the other as it were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45306:38"/>
Engraven on the Ceremonies and Laws ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the practice whereof
is a living Witneſs in behalf of the Book
which Inſtituted them, and even in behalf
of the moſt wonderful things which it
contains; for the greateſt part of thoſe
moſt aſtoniſhing Miracles were repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Ceremonies, and by the other
things which belonged to the Worſhip of
the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion; the Pot of Manna
kept in the Ark, was a ſtanding Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Miraculous Food, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
God fed that People in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
<hi>Aarons</hi> Rod that Budded, was a
Monument of the way, how God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
unto him the Office of High-Prieſthood;
and the Tables of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
were a Memorial of that which is
Recorded in <hi>Exodus,</hi> concerning the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of the Law; the Sacrifice of
the Paſchal Lamb, the Ceremony of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leavened-Bread,
the aſſigning of the
Tribe of <hi>Levy</hi> unto the Miniſtry of the
Temple, did repreſent the deſtroying
Angels paſſing over the Houſes of
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the Death of the Firſt-born
of the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> and the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of thoſe of the <hi>Iſraeletes.</hi> The
brazen Plates which were faſtned to, and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45306:38"/>
covered the Altar, were a memorial of the
Death of thoſe audacious <hi>Levites,</hi> who
willfully contended with <hi>Aarons</hi> Race for
the Prieſthood; in fine, the Ark, the
Tabernacle, all the different Miniſtries of
the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of the Sacrifices and Purifications, all
the Laws, the Aſſignation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> to the two Tribes of
<hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad,</hi> and to the half Tribe of
<hi>Manaſſe;</hi> the Cities of Refuge for ſuch
as ſhould happen to ſlay a Man unwit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly,
all theſe things, I ſay, which it
would be as Ridiculous to deny, as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that there never was any <hi>Jew</hi> in the
World, have a neceſſary reſpect unto,
and connexion with the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and Invincibly prove that they could not
have been written ſince his time.</p>
                  <p>36. For otherwiſe, either all that we
have been now diſcourſing of, muſt alſo
have been Eſtabliſhed ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
after the Publiſhing of the Books aſcribed
unto him; or elſe having been Eſtabliſhed
by <hi>Moſes</hi> by word of Mouth, and without
any Book, ſome other body muſt have
written thoſe Books, and accommodated
them to the Ceremonies and Laws which
were already in uſe, adding thereunto thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45306:39"/>
Miracles, the more to engage the People
unto the obſervance of that Law. But all
this is ſo far void of all probability, that
there was never any till now, that durſt
in earneſt aſſert it.</p>
                  <p>37. How could it be ſaid, for example,
that the Pentateuch was written and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
long after the Death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and
that it cauſed the Eſtabliſhment of the
Law and Worſhip of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion
which it contains? Then it muſt be ſaid
alſo, that the Ark and Tabernacle, which
are the Foundations of that Religion, were
not made till long after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and till
that Book had been publiſhed; but this is
a thing abſolutely impoſſible; for all the
<hi>Jews</hi> firmly believed that their Ark and
Tabernacle were made by <hi>Moſes,</hi> as that
Book relates, and it is not conceivable why
or on what account they could have taken
up ſuch an opinion, if they had made
them both themſelves, after they had ſeen
and recived that Book, which is now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
not to have appeared in the World,
till a long time after <hi>Moſes;</hi> it would
be doubtleſs one of the prettieſt things in
the World, and the moſt unparallel'd, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that this Book having been compiled
all at once, and beforehand with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45306:39"/>
number of Ceremonies and Laws,
as already in uſe, they ſhould afterwards
have been Inſtituted and ſetled; or that
being compiled by degrees, and according
as all thoſe things were Inſtituted and Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
it ſhould always have had (as they
ſay) a retractive effect or influence, and
have wrought backwards, ſo as to cauſe
each of thoſe Inſtitutions to be Aſcribed
unto <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>38. Likewiſe, how could this People,
who at their firſt Imbracing of this Law,
muſt at leaſt have known that it was not
true that it had been in uſe amongſt them
ever ſince <hi>Moſes</hi> his time, and that there
had been a continued Succeſſion of Prieſts
ever ſince <hi>Aaron;</hi> how, I ſay, could this
People have been able to perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Univerſally to believe, that what
was preſcribed by that Book had always
been practiſed amongſt them; and that
the Prieſts whom it Ordained had received
their Miniſtry from <hi>Aaron</hi> by an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Succeſſion. And finally, how up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſame principle could all the other
Tribes and Families have ſuffered the
Tribe of <hi>Levy,</hi> and Race of <hi>Aaron</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
unto themſelves all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
belonging to the Prieſthood,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:45306:40"/>
and to the Office of the High Prieſt?</p>
                  <p>39. There is no leſs abſurdity in the
other Suppoſition, to wit, that the Law
having been given by <hi>Moſes</hi> by word of
Mouth, was preſerved for a time among
the <hi>Jews</hi> by means of Tradition only, and
that afterwards thoſe who committed it
to writing added thereunto all thoſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.
For beſides that, even this would
be a kind of Miracle, and a thing very
hard to conceive, that that People ſhould
have received a Law ſo ſtrict and ſevere as
that was, from a Man who had done no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
extraordinary, for proving that he
had it from God; how could it be, that
<hi>Moſes,</hi> who doubtleſs had the uſe of
writing, ſhould have omitted a thing ſo
neceſſary, and not have committed to
writing a Law that contained ſo many
Obſervations, ſo many Ceremonies, and
ſo many Rules, that it was neceſſary to
have it always before ones Eyes, for fear
of failing in ſome or other point of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
preſcribed by it.</p>
                  <p>40. And indeed we learn alſo from the
Book it ſelf, that <hi>Moſes</hi> did not ſail to
commit it to writing. <hi>Moſes</hi> (as it is
ſaid, <hi>Deut. 31. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.) wrote
this Law, and delivered it unto the Prieſts
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45306:40"/>
the Sons of</hi> Levy,—<hi>and unto all the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and commanded that it ſhould
be read before all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in their hearing,
at the end of every Seventh Year, in the
Feaſt of Tabernacles.</hi> And it is alſo ſaid
in (I do not know how) many places of
that Book, That God commanded <hi>Moſes</hi>
to write that which he revealed to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Mount; if the <hi>Jews</hi> then had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that Law from him only by word of
Mouth, how could they have ever received
a Book which ſhould have contained a Lie
ſo groſs &amp; evident? and which ſhould have
carried in it an expreſs order from God,
which their Law-giver had not obeyed.</p>
                  <p>41. That very Order, to read the Law
every Seventh Year, at the Feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles,
as having been given by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
doth further clearly ſhow, that it could
not have been changed nor corrupted:
for it would have been impoſſible for ſuch
corruptions not to have been diſcovered,
or that being diſcovered, they ſhould have
been ſuffered by a People devoted to that
Law, and whoſe devout Subjection to it
was grounded upon their believing it to
be of God, and written by <hi>Moſes;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
that thoſe Miracles being moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the Eye, ſcattered throughout the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45306:41"/>
Books, repeated in divers places of them,
and linked with the principal tranſactions
therein Recorded, there had been a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of making a new Book to take them
in, and not meerly to alter, for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
an old Book which had been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
received.</p>
                  <p>42. <q>The Infidel then muſt yet once
more return to that pretended vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
humor of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation, and
maintain, that the <hi>Jews</hi> could eaſily ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
this falſification: and that they were
even glad that all thoſe Miracles were
added to their Law, and that their
Chronicles, were filled with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>43. This might have ſome probability,
if the Queſtion were only about a matter
of Civil or Political concernment; as for
example, The <hi>Romans</hi> could have been
content, that one ſhould have told them,
that they were the Off-ſpring of <hi>Aeneas,</hi>
and it may be the <hi>French</hi> would be well
enough pleaſed, that one ſhould derive
their Original from the <hi>Trojans;</hi> theſe are
things which pleaſe ſome Mens Fancies,
and may paſs without contradiction, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Bodies intereſt to oppoſe them: and
they do not interfer with other things
that have been eſtabliſhed, and ſtedfaſtly
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45306:41"/>
believed, time out of mind, and that are
looked upon as the only conſiderable. But
as touching the <hi>Jews,</hi> a People ſo devoted to
their Religion, ſo faithful Obſervers of the
leaſt Traditions, and to whom lying was
ſo ſeverely forbidden, this ſuppoſition is
altogether without any appearance of
truth.</p>
                  <p>44. For I cannot believe, that the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
boldneſs to deny any thing that
makes againſt them, dare adventure ſo
far, as to diſpute all the Evidence we have
of the <hi>Jews</hi> Zeal for their Religion; ſince
even yet to this day, they have ſo great
a veneration for that Law, that though
they have been diſperſed above theſe Six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Hundred Years, and ſee no accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of what was promiſed to them,
notwithſtanding they obſerve it ſtill as
far as they can, with the ſame ſtrictneſs,
as they did at firſt, and wait continually
for the fulfilling of thoſe promiſes; how
improbable is it then, that they ſhould
have ſuffered that which they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as God's own word, to be mixed and
blended with ſuch a fearful multitude of
Lies, rendering themſelves thereby un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of Divine Protection, and liable
to be convicted of Impoſture by the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45306:42"/>
Neighbouring Nations? would not this
have been a venturing to loſe all, for to
gain nothing?</p>
                  <p>45. This might ſuffice to convince all
underſtanding and ſober Men; <q>but if
ſome would yet inſiſt upon the <hi>Jews</hi>
love for their Nation, and pretend that
the deſire of being admired, might have
induced them to permit and promote
this Impoſture;</q> let us ſee whether it
be not quite contrary, and whether there
be the leaſt probability, that they belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
they could advance their own Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by the things contained in that Book,
which ſeem ſo ſhameful to the Nation in
general; and though all had been for the
publick good, let us ſee whether it be
credible, that particular Perſons, and
whole Families, would have willingly
Sacrificed themſelves, and their Intereſts
unto it: eſpecially conſidering, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
did conſtrain them; and that having
nothing to do but to invent, it was in
their choice to take what way they pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and to ſecure the Intereſts of all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
provoking ſo many people to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Frauds.</p>
                  <p>46. Had they only mentioned ſuch
things as might have contributed to their
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45306:42"/>
Honour, as thoſe great Miracles, which
are an Evidence of Gods moſt ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,
it had been abundantly ſufficient
for their deſign, without inventing ſome
things, which it was ſo many Peoples In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
to oppoſe, and other things which
do expoſe that Nation to ſo great contempt.</p>
                  <p>47. For inſtance, what is there more
miſerably baſe, than the Fears and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings
of this People, occaſioned by the
bitter Waters of <hi>Marah,</hi> by the want of
Food, and by the Thirſt they ſuffered in
<hi>Rephidim?</hi> they are hardly ſooner come
out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but they forget all thoſe
great things, which they would make the
World believe, that their God had there
done for them? they think they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
and betrayed; and complain, that
they are treacherouſly brought out of a
Countrey, where they lived at eaſe,
(though they were Captives and Slaves
in it) to deſtroy them in the Wilderneſs:
they Queſtion the Power and Protection
of that God, who had ſo eminently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
for them; and are ready to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel
againſt that very Man, who they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
was choſen by God to deliver them;
now is not this the ſhamefulleſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
weakneſs imaginable? is not this the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45306:43"/>
higheſt Ingratitude, both to their God,
and to <hi>Moſes</hi> their Guide and Captain? what
could their cruelleſt Enemies have invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
more diſhonourable to them? and who
could imagine, that to make themſelves
renowned all the World over, and to cauſe
Men to believe, they were the beloved
People of God, it ſhould ever have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into their thoughts, to paint out and
repreſent themſelves ſo light and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,
ſo unfaithful and ſo abſured, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the ſpace of Forty Years, wherein
they Fed (as themſelves ſay) upon meat
ſent down from Heaven, there paſſed
hardly a Day on which they were not
heard to cry like little Children, and to
wiſh with Tears, they were yet Slaves in
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> that they might fill their Bellies
with Onions and Leeks.</p>
                  <p>48. The whole Five Books of <hi>Moſes</hi>
muſt be almoſt copied out, to recount all
the Unfaithfulneſſes, and all the Faults of
this People, for therein is hardly any other
thing to be ſeen; one would think they
had been reſolved to make their Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
keep even pace, with the Grace and
Favors of their God; almoſt upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
they Rebelled againſt their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;
and were ſcarce delivered from one
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:45306:43"/>
Judgment, when they brought upon
themſelves another: nothing could hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this ungovernable People from falling
continually into the ſame Crimes; not
the example of the Three Thouſand Men,
whom the Sons of <hi>Levy</hi> ſlew by the
commond of <hi>Moſes,</hi> to puniſh them for
their Idolatry; nor the Fire and Plague
from the Lord, which in Two Days time
deſtroyed near Fifteen Thouſand Men for
their Sedition; nor the dreadful Judgment
of the Fiery-Serpents; nor the Tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
Puniſhment inflicted upon them for
their mixing with the Daughters of the
<hi>Midianites,</hi> on which account <hi>Moſes</hi> cauſed
to hang up all the Heads of them againſt
the Sun, and Twenty Four Thouſand of
the People died by the Plague?</p>
                  <p>49. But to ſay all in one word, what
can be imagined more ſtrange, and more
diſgraceful, to their Memory, than that
general Apoſtacy which happened, when
<hi>Moſes</hi> was upon Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and when
thoſe Mad People forced <hi>Aaron</hi> to make
them a Golden-Calf, and to offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unto it, as if it had been unto their
God? Let all the circumſtances of this
Action be well weighed, and it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
appear; that a People which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45306:44"/>
have declared themſelves capable of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into ſuch a Crime, have by ſo doing,
Convicted themſelves of all Vices at once,
and chiefly of Sottiſhneſs and Extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.
They tell us that they were brought
out of an Enemies Countrey, by the
greateſt and moſt unconceivable wonders
that can be imagined; inſomuch, that
there is hardly a moment of time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in all their Hiſtory, in which the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Arm of their God doth not viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
appear; this their God Pardons them
all their Murmurings, and all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſes,
and inſtead of Puniſhing
their Diſtruſt, he Provides for them Meat
and Drink, in places where there had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been any before, and ſatisfies even the
loweſt and groſſeſt of their deſires.</p>
                  <p>50. Nevertheleſs, in the time when
they knew that their Deliverer and Guide
is on the Mount with that ſame God, to
receive his Orders about the Government
of them, a panick and a ridiculous Fear
ſeaſes upon them: they cannot patiently
bear <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſo long abſence, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing well wherefore, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of <hi>Aaron,</hi> a viſible God to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them: they force him to make a
Golden-Calf, which they ſet up upon an
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:45306:44"/>
Altar; they call it the God which
brought them out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and
give to this pretty Deity, made of
Ear-rings, the ſame Honors, and the ſame
Thankſgivings, which they owed, and
had before ſo often given unto the true
God, Creator of Heaven and Earth, who
had choſen them out of all Mankind for
his ſpecial Favorites.</p>
                  <p>51. Truly, they muſt have loſt the
uſe of their Reaſon, who can think that
this People have ſuffered this Narrative of
the Golden-Calf to be added to their Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,
and that they have done it to make
themſelves to be admired and eſteemed by
other Nations; could they imagine that
their Glory and Renown was imperfect
without this, to make up the defects of
it; and is it not on the contrary a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
which can never be rubbed off, and
for which, their Poſterity will blame them
for ever? And is it not rather, one of
the greateſt Miracles in the World, that
this Action of theirs could ever come to
our knowledg, and that the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Nation have not done their utmoſt, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to aboliſh the Memory of it? ſo far
muſt we ſuppoſe the <hi>Jews</hi> to have been
from inventing it againſt themſelves, or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45306:45"/>
from ſuffering to be added unto ſo many
things, which would have made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly
enough to be admired and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed,
an Hiſtorical Narrative, which
covers them with perpetual Ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                  <p>52. So we ſee, that <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who
was far more tender of the intereſs of his
Nation, hath choſen rather to expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
unto the reproach of having violated
the Laws of Hiſtory, by ſuppreſſing this
publick Crime committed by the <hi>Jews</hi> in
the Wilderneſs, than to expoſe them to
the contempt and ſcorn of the World, by
reciting it.</p>
                  <p>53. Moreover, how could be added to
this Hiſtory, the Rebellion of <hi>Corah,</hi>
which is a thing ſo injurious to all his
Poſterity? was their not cauſe to fear,
leaſt ſome one or other of his Family
ſhould have diſcovered the Falſhood of it,
to waſh off the ſtain of it from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
why muſt <hi>Corahs</hi> Family bear
that Mark of Infamy, rather than any
other? did they caſt Lots for it? was it
a thing ſo neceſſary, that they could not
diſpenſe with it? and is it not manifeſt,
that if it had been a Fiction, the whole
Race in one Body, and with one conſent,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45306:45"/>
would have oppoſed it, and deſired the
Authors of that Table, to look out for
ſome other Embelliſhment to their Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>54. But if the laſt words of <hi>Moſes</hi> be
conſidered, where he Denounces againſt
them ſo many Curſes, Threatens them
with ſo many Calamities, and after he
had upbraided them with all their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs,
further Declares, That they
would do the ſame things anew, and for
the Puniſhment thereof, ſhould fall into
remedileſs Miſery and Diſtreſs; that they
ſhould be run down by their Enemies, and
reduced to the utmoſt Extremity, even
to the eating of their own Children;
that their Cities ſhould be deſtroyed,
their Wives and Daughters ſhould be Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed,
their Sacrifices ſhould be Aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and finally, that they ſhould be led
Captives, and diſperſed through all the
Earth, to be deſpiſed and abhorred by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations: if all this, I ſay, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
I know not what a Man he muſt
be, who imagins that this People could
have Conſpired with any Man, be who he
will, that ſhould have ſo grievouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
them.</p>
                  <p>55. But it is above all to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45306:46"/>
that theſe are not the Diſcourſes
only of a Man, that would frighten his
followers, and bare Threatnings of Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
which were to befall the <hi>Jews,</hi> only
in caſe they ſhould groſly tranſgreſs their
Law; for if they ſeem conditional in
ſome places, they are in others, poſitive
and abſolute Propheſies, foretelling that
they ſhould really tranſgreſs their Law,
as they have groſly done, and that all
thoſe Miſeries ſhould light upon them, as
in effect it is come to paſs; how impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
then is it, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould have
been ſo ſimple, or rather ſo ſenſeleſs, as to
ſuffer Propheſies of that Nature, to be
added to their Hiſtory; and that for the
advancement of the Glory of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they ſhould have conſented to a thing
which could never but turn to their
ſhame and diſgrace? for could not they
clearly ſee, that if thoſe Propheſies were
found to be falſe, their Religion would be
accounted an Impoſture, and they would
inevitably loſe the Reputation, which
they might otherwiſe have acquired, by
all the reſt of the wonderful Events men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in their Hiſtory? or that if they
chanced to fall really into thoſe Miſeries
foretold, they would be accounted the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45306:46"/>
worſt of Men: and inſtead of comfort,
could expect nothing but blame, from all
the World, for having fallen into thoſe
Calamities which they were warned of,
and for having fallen into them for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cauſe, but for breaking the Law and
Covenant of their God, whereby they
drew down his Wrath and Indignation
upon themſelves, and their Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>56. Thus then it appears, that when
Men have given the greateſt liberty to
their Fancy, it can produce nothing but
Chymerical and groundleſs Suppoſitions.
<hi>Moſes</hi> did not deceive the <hi>Jews,</hi> he could
have no ſuch deſign, and though he had
had ſuch a deſign, yet it was impoſſible
for him to have compaſſed it by the ways
and meaſures he took: neither did the
<hi>Jews</hi> combine with him to deceive their
Poſterity, and all the other Nations of
the World: nor was it any new Upſtart,
who to make them believe what he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
made uſe of ſuch things as he found
eſtabliſhed and practiſed amongſt them,
either by Tradition, or by Writing: and
it was as impoſſible, that the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhould
have Conſpired in this Impoſture with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
other, as it was, that they ſhould have
done it with <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:45306:47"/>
57. Here you have ſome ſmall part of
what may be ſaid on this great Subject;
for it is not to be thought, that the proofs
which the <hi>Pentateuch</hi> affords of its truth,
can be fully drawn forth: the more we
meditate on it, the more Evidence we ſtill
find of its Divine Original, for it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible
Spring of Light; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being at the pains to unfold and ſet
them forth, if we read the Book it ſelf,
we cannot but feel, or ſenſibly perceive,
that the Language it ſpeaketh, is not the
Language of Men, nor the product of
their Wit: That nothing is further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from the Methods, not only of
Impoſtors and Deceivers, but alſo of the
Prudent and Wiſe Men of the World;
That it is of a moſt peculiar character,
and altogether different from that of Men
acting by their own Spirit: and that
therein are not to be ſeen, either the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
paſſions, or the ordinary intereſts of
Men, or the drifts of prudence and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt,
which may eaſily be ſeen in other
Books that are of humane compoſure:
and in fine, it may be ſenſibly perceived
that it is impoſſible for any to put off the
Man ſo far, as were neceſſary for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
of ſuch a work, wherein ſo little
of Man appears.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:45306:47"/>
58. Nevertheleſs this Book is in being,
we have it in our hands, and it was not
made by chance: It hath been, and yet
is the greateſt and moſt conſiderable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
that ever was in the World, during
the ſpace of above Two Thouſand Years,
the moſt ſingular and famous People in
the World, have been ſo devoted to it,
and enamoured of it, that they have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſuffered it to be out of their ſight:
from this People it is come into the hands
of Chriſtians, that is to ſay, it is ſpread
abroad through the whole Univerſe; and
after Sixteen Hundred Years, theſe Two
ſort of People, irreconcileable Enemies to
one another, do yet look upon it with the
ſame Veneration, diſpute the one againſt
the other for the true meaning of it, and
both of them find in it, the original Title
of that Right which they pretend to have
unto the Heavenly Inheritance, in which
both of them believe, that the reſt of
Mankind have no part or portion.</p>
                  <p>59. Who then dare be bold to ſay, that
it is free for him to ſtand Neuter, and not
to concern himſelf in a matter of this
Importance, nay, who that rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
it, can hinder himſelf from being
concerned? who is there that can let this
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45306:48"/>
Book paſs as it is, not caring to know
whether it be true or falſe, as if it were a
thing, whereof the truth were unſearcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and indifferent? or who ſhall dare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately
to run-counter unto ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of truth and light, as that Sacred
Book holds forth, and without other help,
than that of his own Fancy, and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Reaſon, to Determine, from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of that dark Dungeon, where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath confined him, that there is no
Being in the whole Univerſe, able to work
ſo many Miracles, and that they are but
ſo many Fable and Viſions?</p>
                  <p>60. But the reaſon why ſome perſons
are not moved and affected with theſe
proofs, which are ſo ſenſible unto others,
is becauſe their Intereſt and their Paſſions
have ſo much command of them, that
they ſee other things but by halves. This
is the true Spring of all the Doubts that are
moved againſt Religion, becauſe there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
nothing ſo contrary to their luſts, as
the manner of Life which it preſcribes;
and ſo it is no ways difficult, to conceive
that Mens Luſts ſhould oppoſe a thing
which doth directly fight againſt them,
and can never be eſtabliſhed but by their
Extirpation and Ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:45306:48"/>
61. And indeed this may well be ſo, on
the account of the contrariety that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Religion, and Mens Luſts, ſince
we ſee the like even in natural things;
and if ſometimes the meer imagination
of a thing, which Men do not at all like,
(though it be impoſſible the thing ſhould
ever come to paſs) makes them Act, as
if they really doubted it would come to
paſs, even when they cannot really doubt;
how much more may the neceſſary for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
of all that is dear and near to Men
in the World, be apt to blind them, and
to make them doubt of Religion, unto
the belief of which, the Heart and Will
muſt contribute no leſs than the Reaſon
and Underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>62. To give an inſtance, there is a well
known Perſon of great Wit, and of great
Judgment, but ſo much afraid of Death,
that being one Day asked, if he would
not lay his Life, that there is ſuch a City
as <hi>Rome?</hi> thought the gain were ſmall to
be got by the wager, he freely anſwered,
That he would not; now certainly ſuch
a doubt as that there may not be ſuch
a City as <hi>Rome,</hi> never came into his
thoughts before, and if the propoſal had
been made to him upon any other terms,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:45306:49"/>
than the laying down of this Life, it had
not been poſſible for him to have made
the leaſt heſitation at the matter: but as
ſoon as the Idea of Death preſented it
ſelf to his mind, it wholy took up his
thoughts; all the Evidences he had to
prove it impoſſible, for <hi>Rome</hi> not to be,
vaniſhed and came to nothing: and if
there did not ariſe in his mind a formal
doubt, that all which hath been ſaid for
the exiſtence of <hi>Rome</hi> may be falſe, at
leaſt there came ſomething into his head,
or rather into his heart, which made him
Act, as if he had indeed doubted of
<hi>Romes</hi> exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>63. I know very well, no Man will
confeſs, that addictedneſs to Pleaſures, or
love of Life, can thus far blind him; and
that every one pretends his doubts, are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſincere, and that the averſion he hath
from believing the things of Religion,
proceeds only from his Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;
neither is it good to preſs
Men upon this point, ſince we cannot
make them to ſee that in their our own
hearts, which they ſee not there of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
for the motions of the Heart or
Will, are not like the motions of the
Head or Undeſtanding. Theſe of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:45306:49"/>
Head ariſe, either by degrees, and a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of ratiocinations, or elſe by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
quick and clear light, which makes
us take up our Reſolutions, and fall to
Action; and it is not poſſible that this
ſhould be unknown to us, and that we
ſhould not feel it. But now as for that
which we do by the Byaſs of the Heart,
it is far otherwiſe; for there it is certain
Springs hidden in us, and Born with us,
which prompt us to this or that, without
proceeding in a diſcurſive way of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and almoſt without our knowledg;
and hence it comes to paſs, that except
we reflect frequently and attentively up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the motions of the Heart, and timely
accuſtom our ſelves ſo to do, it is almoſt
impoſſible not to be deceived in Judging
of them; for the Heart (if one may ſo
ſay) doth ſo mix it ſelf with the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or rather doth ſo much maſter it,
that it becomes the principle of all the
Actions, yet ſo as it is ſcarcely perceived
to have any influence upon them.</p>
                  <p>64. But let ſuch doubting Perſons, at
leaſt acknowledg, that they do not do all
that is in their power to get a clear Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of their Doubts: which muſt needs
be from ſome defect in the Will; they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45306:50"/>
will eaſily grant this, if they have the
leaſt meaſure of ſincerity, ſince they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deny, but that the whole Life-time of
Man ſhould be employed in the ſearch of
ſo important a truth, as that of Religion
is, whereas they have ſcarcely thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it a few Minutes, and of all things in
the World, it may be, the truth of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is that, on which they have made
leaſt reflection.</p>
                  <p>65. When Men are brought unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>
ſincere willingneſs, to apply themſelves
unto the ſerious conſideration of the
proofs Religion, it will not be difficult,
yet further to ſet forth unto them, the
Evidences of it, taking the way which
we have here chalked out; for beſides
the proofs taken from matters of Fact,
whereof we have given an Eſſay or Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
in this Diſcourſe, there is yet a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great number of proofs that depend
upon ſenſible perception, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us in great abundance when we
read the Scriptures with attention; and
it is even theſe laſt ſort that deſerve chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to be minded, becauſe they have this
advantage, that in perſwading us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the truth, they move us alſo to love
it, without which all is unprofitable. It
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45306:50"/>
is true, there are but few Perſons duely
qualified with the diſpoſitions neceſſary to
their being feelingly moved and affected
by them, that is to ſay, with a certain
Spiritual Guſt of Truth, and an upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Heart, which are rarely to be
met with; But we muſt at leaſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
to help others unto theſe diſpoſitions,
and to awaken and ſtir up in them that
Spiritual ſenſe, which ſhall be revived in
them ſooner or latter, if ever they believe
in a ſaving manner.</p>

therefore upon Second thoughts, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it would be better to ſubjoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> it
thereunto by way of Appendix, or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Part. Who was the Author of the
Diſcourſe, I do not certainly know; but
it is probable, that <hi>Monſieur du Bois de la
Cour,</hi> who wrote the Diſcourſe on <hi>Paſchal</hi>
his Thoughts, or Meditations on Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> was likewiſe the Author of this
Diſcourſe; for they are frequently bound
together, and were both Publiſhed, the
one in 1671, and the other in 1672, with
the approbation of the ſame Doctors of
the <hi>Sorbon,</hi> excepting one whoſe name is
not ſubſcribed with the other Six, unto
the approbation of this Diſcourſe. But
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45306:53"/>
who ever be the Author, he is a Man of
Parts, and has done worthily in this
Diſcourſe, in which he hath ſhewed his
high Veneration of the Holy Scriptures,
and hath irrefragably proved the truth of
the moſt Signal and Miraculous matters
of Fact, contained in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
and by that means he hath proved the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Original and Authority of all the
Laws and Ordinances given by <hi>Moſes</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and Recorded in his
Books: So that the Tranſlation of it
cannot but be of good uſe unto <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Readers, for confirming them in the Faith,
and ſtrengthening them againſt Tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
unto Infidelity in theſe Backſliding
Times. The Diſcourſe is ſo well Penned
by the Author, that it needs no Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
from any; its own great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
and Uſefulneſs will abundantly
ſuffice to commend it unto any ingenious
Man, that ſhall be at the pains of ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
half an Hour in Reading of it. It
would therefore have been altogether
needleſs for me to have added unto it what
follows here in this Second Part, if there
had not been lately Publiſhed in <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
a Book of <hi>P. Simon</hi>'s, Intituled, <hi>A Critical
Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament;</hi> where,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:45306:53"/>
Book 1. Chap. 5. Pag. 36. in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
of that Chapter he hath theſe very
Words, Moſes <hi>cannot be the Author of the
Books which are attributed to him.</hi> I had
no ſooner Read this in the contents of
the Chapter, but I was deſirous to know
what Arguments he uſed to prove ſuch an
uncouth Aſſertion, as had ſeldom been
heard of from any before, but ſuch as
<hi>Hobs</hi> in his <hi>Leviathan, Pereyre</hi> in his <hi>Syſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
Praeadamiticum,</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi> in his
<hi>Tractatus Theologico-politicus,</hi> all Atheiſts
or Infidels. And thereupon having Read
and Examined all he ſays to prove his Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
I thought it would be neceſſary,
together with the Precedent Diſcourſe, to
Publiſh a few ſhort Animadverſions on
what he has written in his <hi>Critical Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
againſt the <hi>Pentateuchs</hi> being written
by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And that what I have to ſay,
may be the better underſtood, and the
more convincing and ſatisfactory unto the
Reader, I ſhall proceed in this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhew what is the Truth to
be believed, and what is the Belief of the
Chriſtian Church.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What is the opinion of <hi>P.
Simon,</hi> and wherein he agrees with, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45306:54"/>
from the common Faith of the
Church in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Anſwer his Arguments,
whereby he endeavors to prove his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<hi>That</hi> Moſes <hi>could not be the Author
of the Books which are attributed to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for the Firſt, The Truth to be
believed, is (1.) That the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the Old Teſtament, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or firſt Five Books
of the Bible, were written by Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration,
and that God is the primary
Author thereof; this is proved from
<hi>Luke 16. 29, 31. They have</hi> Moſes <hi>and the
Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> &amp;c. And
<hi>Luke 24. 25, 27, 44, 45, 46.</hi> And from
2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. where it is expreſly ſaid,
<hi>That all Scripture,</hi> or the whole Scripture,
<hi>is given by Inſpiration of God.</hi> And 2 <hi>Pet.</hi>
1. 20, 21. where it is expreſly affirmed,
that the firſt thing to be known concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scriptures, is this, <hi>That no Prophecy of
the Scripture, is of any private Interpretation</hi>
(that is, of any Mans own Inventing:)
<hi>for the Prophecy came not in old time by the
will of Man: but Holy Men of God ſpake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The
ſame Truth is clearly proved, from <hi>Pſalm.
147. 19.</hi> compared with <hi>Rom. 3. 2.</hi> &amp;
9. 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:45306:54"/>
(2.) That this being firſt known and
believed, and ſo the Divine Authority of
the Holy Scriptures ſecured, it matters
not very much, whether we ever certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know the names of all the Holy Men
whom God uſed as his Inſtruments, in
writing the ſeveral Books of Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
for there are ſome Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that bear the names of no Man, as
Author of them under God, and yet they
are as much of Divine Authority, as
thoſe Books that have the name of ſome
Prophet, or Apoſtle, expreſſed in their
Title; and the names which Books of
Scripture bear, do not always import,
that the Man whoſe name the Book bears,
was the Writer of the Book, but that the
Book was written of, and concerning him,
and his Acts. Thus the Book of <hi>Joſhua</hi>
is ſo called, becauſe it was written of, and
concerning <hi>Joſhua;</hi> though it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it was not written by him, but by
ſome other Holy Man of God after his
Death; ſee for this Biſhop <hi>Richardſons</hi>
Obſervations on the Old Teſtament, <hi>pag.
45.</hi> the like may be ſaid of ſome other
Books of Holy Scripture. That then
which concerns us moſt, is to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
God be the Author of the ſeveral
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45306:55"/>
Books in the Canon of Scripture; and if
we be once ſure of this, we need not
trouble our ſelves much about the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the names of the ſeveral Men by
whom it pleaſed the Lord God to conſign
them to Writing. <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, in
his Preface to his Expoſition on <hi>Job,</hi> has
this Remarkable ſaying, <q>[<hi>Si Magni cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſdam
viri ſuſceptis Epiſtolis,</hi> &amp;c. If
having received the Letters of ſome
great Man, we ſhould read the Words,
and enquire by what Pen they had been
written, truly it would be ridiculous if
we ſhould endeavor not to know the
Author of the Letters, nor to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the ſenſe, but to find out by what
Pen the ſeveral words of them had been
written: ſince then we know the thing,
and that the Holy Spirit is the Author
of it, what elſe do we in enquiring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Writer, but in reading the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſtand asking by what Pen they
were written.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet (3.) when a Book of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bears the name of its Author, and
an Univerſal Hiſtorical Tradition aſſures
us that ſuch a Man was indeed the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, we are bound to believe it, and
cannot rationally disbelieve it, without a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45306:55"/>
demonſtration to the contrary. Thus we
know the Books of <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and
<hi>Cicero,</hi> to have been written by thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors;
and this is ſo clear and certain a
truth, <hi>(<q>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t de iſtorum librorum Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus
dubitare dementis ſit, utque ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendus
ſit non refellendus qui de iis queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem
movet,</q>)</hi> 
                     <q>That none but a Madman
will doubt of the Authors of thoſe
Books, and he is to be laughed at, and
not confuted, who moves a Queſtion
concerning them;</q> as holy <hi>Auguſt.</hi> writes,
<hi>contra Fanſtum Manich. lib. 32. cap. 21.</hi>
And as he ſays, That he knew the write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of the New Teſtament to be the
writings of the Apoſtles, by the ſame
means that the <hi>Manichees</hi> knew the write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of <hi>Manes,</hi> to be the writings of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi>
ſo I ſay, That by what means we
here in <hi>England</hi> know the late Critical
Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament, to be the
writing of <hi>Pere Simon</hi> a Prieſt of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory;
by the like means we know the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> to be the writing of <hi>Moſes;</hi>
and we ought not to disbelieve it, having
the Univerſal Teſtimony of <hi>Jews, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
Mahumetans,</hi> and many <hi>Heathens,</hi>
to ground our Faith upon; unleſs it be
firſt clearly demonſtrated to us, that it
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:45306:56"/>
implies a contradiction, that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould
have written it; which I know, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pere Simon,</hi> nor any Man elſe can do.
And the reaſonableneſs of what I have
now ſaid will yet further appear, if it be
conſidered that our Lord Chriſt himſelf
gives Teſtimony unto the writings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
in general, <hi>(John 5. 46, 47.</hi> Moſes
<hi>wrote of me, But if ye beleive not his write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
how ſhall ye beleive my words?)</hi> and
both he and his Apoſtles frequently appeal
unto them, and quote paſſages out of
them. This is the truth to be believed,
and this is actually believed by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church. Yet it is no matter of
Faith, that there are no various Lections
in the Scriptures of the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
nay it is a matter evident to
Senſe, that there are various Lections;
it is no matter of Faith, that through the
length and injury of time, and Negligence
of Tranſcribers and Printers, there are
no miſtakes at all in the Originals of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture; on the contrary, we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that there may poſſibly be ſome
miſtakes, even in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> through
the length and injury of time, and the
negligence of Tranſcribers and Printers,
but thoſe miſtakes we believe, do not at
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45306:56"/>
all hinder the Holy Scriptures from being
a perfect Rule of Faith and Life, in all
things neceſſary, to the Glorifying of
God, and Saving of our Souls. Nor laſtly,
is it matter of Faith, That <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote
every Word and Sentence, Chapter and
Verſe, of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> with his own hand.
It is ſufficient that we believe he wrote
it himſelf, or by other perſons, whoſe help
he uſed in the writing of it; and when
it was written, he reviſed it and approved
it, and in this he was aſſiſted by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit, inſpiring, guiding and directing
him. And if there be any thing in the
<hi>Pentateuch,</hi> beſides the miſtakes of Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers
and Printers, that was written af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, it was added upon good
Reaſons by <hi>Joſhua</hi> or <hi>Ezra,</hi> and the great
Aſſembly, who were Men of a Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Spirit, and inſpired by God, in what
they did of that nature.</p>
                  <p>Now in the Second place let us ſee,
what is the opinion of <hi>Pere Simon,</hi> and
wherein he agrees with, or differs from
the common Faith of the Church, in this
matter.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, He agrees with us in theſe
following particulars, (1.) That the
whole Scripture of the Old Teſtament,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45306:57"/>
and conſequently the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> was of
Divine Inſpiration, and that God was the
primary Author thereof; this is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratively
proved from his own expreſs
words; in his Preface, <hi>pag. 4.</hi> 
                     <q>[But
beſides, that this Principle (of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of <hi>Paris,</hi> That the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not equally Divine and Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal)
is dangerous, it is directly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to the Doctrine of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which acknowledges every thing
throughout the whole Scripture for
Prophetical, and to have been inſpired;
wherefore I thought I ought to lay
down ſome Principles, whereby we
might aſcribe every thing in the whole
Scriptures to Prophets or Perſons inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by God, even to the alterations
themſelves, thoſe only excepted, which
had happened through length of time,
or negligence of Tranſcribers.]</q> And
<hi>Book 1. Chap. 1. Pag. 3.</hi> 
                     <q>[I have divided
this work into Three Books, the Firſt
of which, Treats at large of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of the Bible, which I have called
Prophets, with <hi>Joſephus (contra App.)</hi>
and moſt of the Fathers, becauſe they
were in effect directed by the Spirit of
God, and that St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls the whole
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45306:57"/>
Scripture Prophecies. During the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Common-wealth, there were from
time to time among them, theſe ſorts
of Perſons inſpired by God, were it to
write Divine and Prophetick Books, as
the ſame <hi>Joſephus</hi> has remarked, or as
<hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays, to diſtinguiſh betwixt
thoſe that were truly Prophetick, and
others that were not.]</q> And <hi>Pag. 4.</hi>
                     <q>[They (the publick Writers) had the
liberty in collecting the Acts which
were in their Regiſteries, to add, dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
and change, according as they
thought fit, and the Books (as
<hi>Euſebius</hi> ſays) which were declared Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
were reviewed by Perſons inſpired
by God, who Judged whether they
were truly Prophetick or Divine.]</q> And
<hi>Pag. 21.</hi> 
                     <q>[I know it is expreſly forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> either to add or
diminiſh any thing from the Word of
God. But we may Anſwer with the
Author of the Book, Intituled, <hi>Cozri,</hi>
that this prohibition relates only to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Perſons, and not to thoſe whom
God had expreſly commanded to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret
his Will; God promiſed to the
Prophets, and to the Judges of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim,</hi>
who ſucceeded <hi>Moſes,</hi> the ſame
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45306:58"/>
Grace, and the ſame Spirit of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as thoſe had who lived in his time,
and therefore they have held the ſame
Power, not only of Interpreting the
Law, but alſo of making new Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
which were afterwards writ and
placed in the Regiſteries of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.]</q>
And <hi>Pag. 22.</hi> 
                     <q>[The Church has
not the Right of making Books Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
and Divine, as the Prophets had
in the Old Teſtament, but only to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
them Canonical.]</q> In fine, <hi>Book
1. Chap. 1. Pag. 1.</hi> 
                     <q>[None can doubt,
but that the truths contained in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture are infallible, and of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Authority; ſince they proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
from God, who in this has
only made uſe of the Miniſtery of Men
to be his Interpreters. So there is no
Perſon, either Jew or Chriſtian, who
does not acknowledg that the Scripture
being the pure Word of God, is at the
ſame time, the firſt principle and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Religion.]</q> Here is clear
and full proof from his own expreſs
words, of his agreement with us in the
firſt particular before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He agrees with us in this,
That though Men having been the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitories
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:45306:58"/>
of theſe Sacred Books, as well as
of all others, and in their firſt Originals
having been loſt, it was in ſome ſort im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
but that there muſt needs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
ſome changes, as well by reaſon of
the length of time, as the careleſneſs
of Tranſcribers; as it is impoſſible, it may
be, to find one <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bible in all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
without ſome Letter, Sillable, or
Word Miſprinted, yet God by his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Providence hath taken ſuch care of the
Sacred Scripture, as that it is preſerved to
this Day, perfect, intire and uncorrupt,
in all things relating to Faith and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and neceſſary to be believed or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,
in order to Salvation. This is
proved alſo from his own words, <hi>pag. 7.</hi>
                     <q>[The Fathers were perſwaded, that
theſe Errors that were crept into the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the means of theſe Tranſcribers,
had no relation to Faith or good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
or carried any weight to the
framing of the Judgment which we
ought to make of the Scriptures in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
This does not hinder us, but that
we ſhould acknowledg the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
in the preſervation of this
Book, which has paſt through ſo many
hands, and ſo many Ages; a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45306:59"/>
of theſe Errors of Tranſcribers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to the Chronology and Genealogies
in the Books of the Old Teſtament:
but we may ſay with S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> that
theſe difficulties are in the number of
thoſe of which we may ſpeak freely,
and we may be ignorant of, <hi>Salva fide
qua Chriſtiani ſumus.</hi> This ſame Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
has likewiſe not permitted the
<hi>Jews</hi> malitiouſly to corrupt the Holy
Scriptures, as many Fathers ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
them. <hi>Origen,</hi> S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> and
S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> have done them more Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;
and thoſe who at this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
the <hi>Jews</hi> with the ſame thing,
have not throughly examined the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.]
And <hi>pag. 9.</hi> [This Author <hi>(Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riana)</hi>
ſhews very plainly, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
the Vulgar Tranſlation Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,
was not to exempt it from all
ſorts of Faults, but only from Errors
which might introduce a change, either
in Faith or Manners; which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
by ſeveral Authorities, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
by the Teſtimonies of <hi>Andrew de
Vega,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Lanis,</hi> at that time ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
of the Order of Jeſuits, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
at that Council.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:45306:59"/>
Thirdly, He agrees with us in this,
That being ſure that God is the primary
Author of the ſeveral Books of Scripture,
it is no great matter whether we certainly
know or not, the names of the Men by
whom God was pleaſed to commit them
to writing; this is proved from his own
words; in his Preface, <hi>pag. 2.</hi> 
                     <q>[Having
Eſtabliſhed in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
the Prophets or Publick Writers,
who took care of collecting faithfully
the Acts of what paſt of moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in the State, we need not too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
inquire, as uſually Men do, who
were the Authors of each particular
Book of the Bible, becauſe it is certain
that they were all writ by Prophets,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</q> And in <hi>Book 1. Chap. 1. Pag. 3.</hi>
                     <q>[We ought not to ſearch with too much
curioſity, who have been the particular
Authors of every Book of the Bible;
it ſufficeth, according to the Maxime of
<hi>Gregory</hi> the Great <hi>(praefat in lib.</hi> Job) that
theſe Books were written by Prophets.
<hi>Quis haec ſcripſerit, valde ſupervacue
quaeritur, cum tamen Author libri, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Sanctus fideliter credatur.]</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, yet farther, He agrees with
us ſo far as to hold, That in a true and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45306:60"/>
good ſenſe <hi>Moſes</hi> may be the Author of
the whole <hi>Peutateuch.</hi> This is clearly
proved from his own expreſs words; in
<hi>Book 1. Chap. 1. Pag. 3.</hi> 
                     <q>[If theſe Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Writers were in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth
from the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
as is extreamly probable, it will be very
eaſie to ſatisfie all difficulties that may be
brought to ſhew, that the <hi>Pentateuch</hi>
was not wholy written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which
is ordinarily proved by the manner of
its writing, which ſeems to inſinuate,
that ſome other than <hi>Moſes</hi> collected the
Acts, and put them down in writing:
ſuppoſing theſe Publick Writers, to them
we may attribute what relates to the
Hiſtorical part of theſe Books, and to
<hi>Moſes</hi> all that which belongs to the Laws
and Ordinances, and it is this which
the Scripture calls the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi>
thus one may ſay in this ſenſe, that
the whole <hi>Pentateuch</hi> is truly <hi>Moſes</hi>'s,
becauſe thoſe who made the collection,
lived in his time, and did not do it but
by his Order.]</q> And <hi>Pag. 20.</hi> 
                     <q>[Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to this principle, we ought to
expound that paſſage, where it is ſaid
(that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote what God command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him;) for there is nothing more
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45306:60"/>
ordinary in the Scripture, than to aſcribe
unto one perſon what he Orders ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do, chiefly when the thing is
done in his name.]</q> Thus we ſee
wherein <hi>Pere Simon</hi> agrees with us in the
common belief of all Chriſtians. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
with us ſo far, as to acknowledg not
only that the whole Scripture of the Old
Teſtament is of Divine Inſpiration, and
that it is uncorrupt in all things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to Faith and Life, and are neceſſary
to be believed or done, in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but alſo, that the whole <hi>Pentateuch</hi>
is truly <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, becauſe if it was not all
written by himſelf immediately, yet it
was written by others in his time, and in
his name, and by his order; and then
ſure what was ſo written, was reviewed
and approved by himſelf. If <hi>P. Simon</hi> were
ſincere in all this, and did not deny it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
by his ſelf-contradiction, we needed
not much to oppoſe him in this matter;
for we are under no neceſſary obligation
to believe, that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote down with
his own hand all the occurrences of every
Day, during the whole ſpace of the
Churches being in the Wilderneſs; he might
poſſibly appoint ſome other perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of known Integrity, to do that for
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45306:61"/>
him, and in his name: and being ſo done,
and then reviewed and approved by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
it was all one, as if he had done it
with his own hand. But notwithſtanding
this agreement, we ſhall find that there
remains yet a difference between <hi>P. Simon,</hi>
and other Chriſtians, as to this matter;
and that is it we are next to take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He differs from the whole
Church of God, and from himſelf too,
by ſelf-contradiction, in this, <hi>That he
thinks</hi> Moſes <hi>may have written the</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch
<hi>by an humane and fallible Spirit.</hi>
I prove this by conſequence, from his own
words, <hi>Pag. 40.</hi> 
                     <q>[It is true (ſays he)
that the beſt Authors ſometimes fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
little miſtakes, ſo likewiſe do we not
pretend to draw from thence an infallible
conſequence to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> could
not be the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> in
the Order that it is.]</q> Here he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
ſuppoſes, that <hi>Moſes</hi> in writing the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> might fall into little miſtakes,
and ſo he might be the Author of it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the diſorder that is in it;
and is not this to ſuppoſe, that <hi>Moſes</hi>
might write it by an humane and fallible
Spirit? for none I think will ſay, that a
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45306:61"/>
Man writing by Divine Inſpiration, can
fall into any miſtakes, little or great; I
am ſure not into ſuch diſorderly miſtakes,
as he pretends to find in the Hiſtory of
the Creation of Man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He differs from the whole
Chriſtian Church, in affirming, that for
ſo much of the Hiſtorical part of the
<hi>Pentateuch</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote, or might write,
he copied it out of other ancient Books,
or elſe committed to writing what he had
learned from, Oral Tradition. This dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is the ſame upon the matter with
the former, and I prove it alſo from his
own expreſs words, <hi>Book 1. Chap. 3. Pag.
27.</hi> 
                     <q>[A Book of the Wars of the Lord,
of which mention is made in the <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
(Numb. 21. 14.)</hi> is an evident
proof, that the Stories which are related
in the Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
been taken out of ſeveral collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which have been loſt.]</q> And <hi>Pag.
54.</hi> moſt clearly, <q>[We may likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
(ſays he) to the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi>
what we have already ſaid touching the
manner of the inregiſtering the publick
Acts in the time of <hi>Moſes;</hi> this Book
contains the Creation of the World,
and many things which happened many
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45306:62"/>
Ages before him: and in all <hi>Geneſis</hi>
there is no obſervation of Gods dictating
to <hi>Moſes</hi> what is there related, it is not
likewiſe ſaid, that he writ it by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prophecy: but all theſe Hiſtories
and Genealogies are ſimply related, as if
<hi>Moſes</hi> had taken them from ſome Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Books, or elſe had had a conſtant
Tradition.]</q> And in the ſame place,
<q>[<hi>Moſes</hi> without doubt has had other
Records (than the fabulous Books of
<hi>Adam, Seth, Sem, Abraham,</hi> &amp;c.)
were they writ, or were they preſerve
<hi>viva voce</hi> down to him, in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
which God had choſen to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to him in the Worſhip of true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.]</q>
Doth not this look too like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
what I mentioned before, that <hi>Moſes</hi>
might write the Book of <hi>Geneſis</hi> by an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
fallible Spirit? which is contrary
unto <hi>Gal. 3. 8.</hi> &amp; 4. 21, 22, 30. <hi>Rom. 4.
17. 23, 24. 1 Cor. 15. 45. James 2. 23.</hi>
for theſe Scriptures do plainly aſſert the
Divine Original and Authority of the
Book of <hi>Geneſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He differs from the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Jews and Chriſtians, in that he not
only ſays, there may be ſome few things
in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as we now have
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:45306:62"/>
them, which were not written by <hi>Moſes;</hi>
but he poſitively and peremptorily affirms,
that there are <hi>de facto,</hi> a great many things
now in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which could
not be written by <hi>Moſes.</hi> This is proved
from his own words, <hi>Pag. 4, 5.</hi> 
                     <q>[The
publick Writers which were in his time,
and writ out the ancient Acts, have
ſpoke of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Third Perſon,
and have uſed ſeveral other ſuch like
expreſſions, which could not be <hi>Moſes</hi>'s:
but they for all that have never the
leſs Authority; becauſe they can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
only to perſons, which <hi>Moſes</hi> had
commanded to put into writing the
moſt important Actions of his time.]</q>
And <hi>Chap. 2. Pag. 19.</hi> 
                     <q>[We ſhall diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in the Five Books of the Law,
what has been writ by <hi>Moſes,</hi> from what
has been writ by theſe Prophets or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Writers. We may attribute to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
the Commandments and Ordinances
which he gave to the People, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
theſe ſame publick Writers to be
the Authors of the greateſt part of the
Hiſtory. <hi>Moſes</hi> in quality of Legiſlator,
writ all which relates to the Statutes,
and left to the Scribes or Prophets
the care of collecting the Acts of the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:45306:63"/>
moſt material Tranſactions which paſt,
that they might be preſerved to Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.]</q>
And <hi>Pag. 20.</hi> 
                     <q>[But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
with never ſo little attention, the
whole Body of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> we may
obſerve this diverſity of Writers which
I ſpeak of, which will more appear in
the ſequel of this Diſcourſe, where I evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
make the falſity of the reaſons
appear, which the <hi>Jews</hi> uſe to prove,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> is the Author of the whole
Law.]</q> And as was obſerved in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
in <hi>Pag. 36. Contents</hi> of <hi>Chap. 5.</hi>
                     <q>[<hi>Moſes</hi> cannot be the Author of the
Books which are attributed to him.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus I have given a faithful account of
the Judgment of <hi>P. Simon,</hi> and ſhewed
wherein he both agrees with, and differs
from the common Faith of Gods Church.
And ſince he hath the generality of Jews
and Chriſtians, yea Chriſt himſelf and
his Apoſtles againſt him, he had need of
very clear and ſtrong irrefragable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to ſupport his ſingular opinion, to
wit, that (in his ſenſe) <hi>Moſes</hi> could not
be the Author of the Books which are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to him.</p>
                  <p>And now we come in the Third place
to conſider the grounds of his Opinion,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45306:63"/>
and to anſwer the Arguments by which
he endeavors to prove it.</p>
                  <p>His Arguments may be reduced to
Three Heads; Firſt, He argues from the
Repetitions that are in the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi>
Secondly, From the Tranſpoſitions that
are in it. Thirdly, From ſeveral paſſages
in it, where there are ſuch expreſſions, as
ſeem to intimate, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be
the Author of them.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the Firſt, His Argument
from Repetitions, <q>[There are (ſays he,
<hi>Pag. 37.)</hi> many Repetitions of the ſame
thing in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
not <hi>Moſes</hi>'s, but rather theirs
who have made a collection of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, and have joined together
ſeveral Readings or Explanations of the
ſame words, not thinking it convenient
to leave out of their Copies what might
illuſtrate the Text.]</q> And then he gives
Inſtances of theſe Repetitions. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I come to examine his Inſtances in
particular, I anſwer to all in general. Since
<hi>P. Simon</hi> acknowledges that thoſe who
made the collection of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were Men of a Prophetical Spirit,
and Divinely Inſpired, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, what
greater abſurdity is there in <hi>Moſes</hi> his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45306:64"/>
the Author of theſe Repetitions, than
in any other Prophets their being the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of them? Was not God as free to
repeat the ſame thing over and over again
for illuſtrating the Text, by the Miniſtry
of one Prophet, as by the Miniſtry of
another? <hi>P. Simon</hi> ſeems to be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the Rules of Grammar,
than with the Rules of Reaſoning; now I
come to his particular Inſtances.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He begins with <hi>Gen. 7. v. 17, 18,
19, 20, 24.</hi> &amp; <hi>v. 21, 22, 23.</hi> and firſt finds
fault with its being ſaid Five times over in
Five Verſes, <hi>That the Waters prevailed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I Anſwer, If his Self-conceit had not
blinded him, he might have ſeen that there
was good reaſon for, and great Grace in
this Repetition; for as the Waters of the
Flood prevailed gradually, and ſtill roſe
higher and higher, ſo it was fit that the
words ſhould be adapted to the thing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Waters increaſed ſo far on
the Earth, that they bore up the Ark, and
ſet it a floating: and this is expreſſed as
we have it in <hi>Verſe 17.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Waters increaſed to that
degree, that they ſet the Ark a going or
moving progreſſively from one place to
another, and this is expreſſed, as in <hi>Verſe
18.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:45306:64"/>
Thirdly, The Waters increaſed ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly,
that the higheſt Mountains in
the World were covered with them, and
this is ſutably expreſſed, <hi>Verſe 19.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Waters increaſed yet ſo
wonderfully upwards, above the higheſt
Mountains, that they were Fifteen Cubits
under Water, and this is expreſſed, as in
<hi>Verſe 20.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And then Fifthly, and Laſtly, Since the
ſpace of time, in which the Waters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon the Earth, was One Hundred
and Fifty Days, this is appoſitly expreſſed,
as in <hi>Verſe 24,</hi> and laſt of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>What now doth this Man deſerve, who
quarrels with the Spirit of God for theſe
repeated expreſſions which carry ſuch a
Grace in them, being ſo well fitted to the
nature of the thing ſpoken of?</p>
                  <p>Next, he finds fault with the Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Verſ. 21, 22, 23.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Here indeed is a Repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the ſame thing, but it is in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
different words, and who knows
but it might be to aſſure us of the Truth
of the thing, which God foreſaw ſome
Men would not believe, to wit, That the
Flood was ſo Univerſal, as to deſtroy ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
every Living thing from off the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:45306:65"/>
Face of the whole Earth, except <hi>Noah</hi> and
them that were with him in the Ark;
and whatever be ſaid of that, yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denyed, but it is free for God to
expreſs his mind as he pleaſes, if there be
nothing in the expreſſions but what is
true, as certainly there is not in this place.
And it may be, that in expreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
thus, he condeſcended to accomodate
himſelf to the genius of the <hi>Hebrew</hi>
Tongue, and to ſpeak with his People in
their own way of ſpeaking. <hi>P. Simon</hi>
himſelf, confeſſes that there are ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
which have their Grace in the
Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as in the Poems
of <hi>Homer.</hi> 
                     <q>[And (ſays he, <hi>Pag. 40.)</hi>
it may be, that good part of theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions
belong to the genius of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, which is a very
plain Language, and repeats often the
ſame thing by different terms, which
appears in almoſt all the Books of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and which we find even in the
Ordinances of our Kings, and in the
Stile of the Chancery of <hi>Rome,</hi> as well
as in the Stile of our Courts for Civil
Affairs, where ſeveral words are placed
after one another, which ſignifie but
the ſame thing.]</q> Thus he. And this
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45306:65"/>
Anſwer may ſerve to his other Inſtances,
from <hi>Exod. 31. 14, 15, 16.</hi> and <hi>Exod. 32.
15.</hi> But why <hi>Exod. 16. 33.</hi> compared
with <hi>Verſe 36.</hi> &amp; <hi>Levit. 6. 9.</hi> ſhould be
objected, I can ſee no colour of reaſon.
Is it poſſible, that ever a reaſonable Man
ſhould think that theſe paſſages can afford
ſo much as a probable Argument, that
<hi>Moſes</hi> cannot be the Author of the Books
attributed to him! And if <hi>Pere Simon</hi> did
not think that they could do him any
Service in this matter, why did he alledg
them? And moreover, why any Man
ſhould find fault with the expreſſions there
uſed, I do not underſtand, unleſs it be a
fault for Almighty God ſo clearly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to expreſs his mind, as that his People
cannot but underſtand his meaning;
might not <hi>P. Simon</hi> have been affraid, leaſt
God ſhould ſay to him as it is written,
<hi>Matth. 20. 15. Is thine Eye Evil, becauſe
I am Good?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Under this head of Repetitions
is alledged, <hi>Levit. 3. 3.</hi> and here he finds
fault with theſe expreſſions, <hi>(The Fat that
covereth the Inwards, and all the Fat that
is upon the Inwards,)</hi> pretending that
there is no difference between theſe two,
(the Fat that covereth the Inwards) and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45306:66"/>
(all the Fat that is upon the Inwards)
but this critical Objection ariſeth from his
own inadvertency, for if he had weighed
and conſidered the words, he would have
ſeen a manifeſt difference between theſe
two, (the Fat that covereth the Inwards)
and (all the Fat that is upon the Inwards)
and would have perceived that the words
are very ſignificant; and give us plainly
to underſtand, that not only ſome of the
Fat, but all the Fat on the Inwards of the
Sacrifice muſt be taken away, not only
the outward covering of Fat that is upon
the Inwards, but every bit and crum of
Fat that adheres moſt cloſely to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards:
here is an inadequat diſtinction
between theſe two, (the Fat, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and
(all the Fat, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> as there is an inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quat
diſtinction between the part and the
whole, the thing included, and the thing
including.</p>
                  <p>I proceed to his Second Head of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He Argues from the Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Tranſpoſitions that are in the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch.</hi>
To which I Anſwer in general,
That no ſolid Argument can be drawn
from this pretended Diſorder, to prove
that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be the Author of the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45306:66"/>
                     <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> for if any other Man, write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by Divine Inſpiration might be the
Author of ſuch paſſages as are pretended
to be out of their proper places, there
can no reaſon be given why <hi>Moſes</hi> might
not as well be the Author of them; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it was as free for the Spirit of God to
tranſpoſe things by the Pen of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as
by the Pen of any other Man. But as
we have ſhewed, <hi>P. Simon</hi> confeſſes that
the whole <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> (except any little
miſtakes of Tranſcribers that may be in
it) was written by Men Divinely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I Anſwer, That in all ſuch
paſſages God may be ſuppoſed to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
himſelf to the genius of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue, and to have condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to write unto his People in their own
uſual way of writing; if it be true that
<hi>P. Simon</hi> ſays, <hi>Pag. 40, 41.</hi> in theſe words
following, <q>[It ſeems to me that the
<hi>Jews</hi> themſelves did not much regard
writing in Method, as it would be eaſie
to prove by the Stile of the Epiſtles of
<hi>Paul:</hi> and <hi>Haron</hi> a Caraite <hi>Jew,</hi> who has
made literal Commentaries on the
whole <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> obſerves often this
confuſion of Order, which he calls
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45306:67"/>
                        <hi>Haphuck,</hi> and ſays, That it is uſual e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in Scripture to begin with one
thing, then to paſs unto another, and
afterwards to reſume again the firſt.]</q>
If this be true, no reaſon can be given,
why God might not make choice of write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to them by the Pen of <hi>Moſes</hi> in this
very way and method, which was uſual
amongſt them, there being nothing of
Falſhood in it. So much in general.</p>
                  <p>Now let us come to a particular Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of the ſeveral Inſtances he gives
of this pretended diſorder; and Firſt, He
begins with the Hiſtory of the Creation,
and finds fault with its Order, <q>[As that
after the Man and Woman were Created,
<hi>Gen. 1. 27.</hi> The Woman is ſuppoſed not
to be made, and in the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
the manner how ſhe was taken from
<hi>Adams</hi> ſide is deſcribed; nevertheleſs
in the ſame Chapter it was before for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
him, as he was her Husband,
whom ſhe accompanied in the Garden,
to eat the Fruit of a certain Tree.]</q> This
is his firſt Argument, in which there are
ſeveral Falſhoods ſhuffled in, as if it were
to make the Hiſtory of the Creation
ſeem ridiculous. But if any Man will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
and in the fear of God, conſider
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45306:67"/>
the words of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Two firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he will find no ſuch diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or falſhood in them at all. For in the
Firſt Chapter, Man is generally conſidered
according to the common nature of both
Sexes, and there it is affirmed, That on
the firſt Day after the other works of
God were finiſhed, God Created Man,
Male and Female, in his own Image. This
is common to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> the Male
and the Female, that they were both Man,
of the ſame ſpecifical humane Nature, and
that they were both Created by God in
his own Image, on the Sixth Day after
the other Works of God were finiſhed.
But in the Second Chapter, Man is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
more particularly and diſtinctly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the proper differences of Sex;
and the way is deſcribed, how the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
of humane Nature were Created,
each in their own Sex; and (1.) The
Spirit of God by <hi>Moſes</hi> declares how Man
was Created in the Male-Sex, and that
he was put into the Garden before Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that he was appointed to dreſs
and keep it, and allowed to eat of the Fruit
of it, excepting the Fruit of one Tree on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which God forbad him to eat of, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pain of Death. (2.) The Spirit of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:45306:68"/>
God by <hi>Moſes</hi> relates how Man was Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
in the Female-Sex, out of a Rib of
a Male-Sex, and then that the Female be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus of the Male, was Married unto
him, and made one Fleſh with him for
his help and comfort. In all this appears
no Diſorder nor Tranſpoſition, nor is there
the leaſt ſhadow of Falſhood or Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>P. Simon</hi> Objects, Firſt, <q>That af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Man and Woman were Created, as
it is written, Chap. 1. 27. the Woman
is ſuppoſed not to be made, Chap.
2.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, He might have ſaid as well
that the Man is ſuppoſed not to be made in
Chap. 2. But the truth is, neither the
Woman nor the Man are ſuppoſed to be yet
unmade, after they were really made; nor
doth the Second Chapter at all contradict
the Firſt: for what the Firſt and Second
Chapters ſay of the Creation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
relate to the ſame thing, and to the
ſame time; with this difference, that what
the Firſt Chapter relates of Man's Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is expreſſed in a few general Words,
which equally concern both Sexes:
Whereas the Second Chapter gives a full
and particular account of the manner how,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45306:68"/>
and of the order of time in which each
Sex were Created.</p>
                  <p>But he Objects farther, <q>That before
the Woman was made, it vvas forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
the Man as he vvas her Husband,
vvhom ſhe accompanied in the Garden
to eat the Fruit of a certain Tree.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſvver, This is notoriouſly Falſe, I
appeal to common Senſe, vvhether there
be any ſuch thing in the Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
as that <hi>Adam</hi> vvas the Husband of <hi>Eve,</hi>
and that ſhe accompanied him in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
before ſhe vvas made of his Rib. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
indeed vvas forbidden to eat the Fruit
of a certain Tree, before <hi>Eve</hi> vvas Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated;
this is plain in the Text of <hi>Moſes:</hi>
but that he vvas then the Husband of
<hi>Eve,</hi> or conſidered as her Husband be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe had a Being, there is not one
Syllable of this in the Text, nor any thing
from vvhence it can ever be proved. When
<hi>Adam</hi> received that poſitive Command,
he neither vvas her Husband, nor conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
as ſuch, nor did ſhe then accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
him in the Garden; but he rally vvas
the common Root of all Mankind, of
vvhom the ſeveral individuals vvere to
ſpring; he vvas moreover (I believe)
the federal principal and head of all his
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45306:69"/>
Poſterity, (excepting the Meſſias) and
as ſuch he was conſidered in receiving that
Law, which the Lord God revealed unto
<hi>Eve</hi> alſo after ſhe was Created, though it
be not expreſſed in the Text: for ſhe had it
revealed unto her one way or other, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
ſhe had not actually ſinned in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing
it, and we have her own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
related by the Sacred Hiſtorian, that
God had revealed it unto her, Chap. 3. 3.
But whether God revealed it unto her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
or by the mediation of her
Husband, we find not in the Text, and
therefore we cannot certainly ſay, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Two ways it was revealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
her: but we are ſure that one of them
it was, and that is enough.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>P. Simon</hi> has diſcovered himſelf,
and by this inſtance we may Judge what
Spirit he is of; an honeſt Heathen would
have abhorred to have been guilty of ſuch
a groſs Falſification, that he might the
better expoſe the Author of the Hiſtory
of the Creation, whoever he was. Sure
I am, that <hi>Longinus</hi> did not take the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of that Hiſtory to have been a Fool,
when having occaſion to mention the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory
of the Creation, he wrote thus of
<hi>Moſes</hi> whom he believed to be the Author
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45306:69"/>
of it, <q>[He that gave Laws unto the
<hi>Jews,</hi> was a Man of no ordinary parts,
for he hath both conceived and ſpoken
worthily and becomingly of the power
of God. In the very beginning of his
Laws, writing thus, (God ſaid, but
what?) Let there be Light, and it was.
Let the Earth be, and it was.]</q> Such
an high opinion of the Sacred Hiſtorian
had <hi>Longinus,</hi> as is to be ſeen in his Book
<hi>De Sublimi dicendi genere,</hi> extant in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Languages unto this Day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>P. Simon</hi> Inſtances in <hi>Gen.
21. 3, 4, 5.</hi> and ſays, <q>[That to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> one muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
join many Verſes together, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with the laſt and coming up to
the firſt.]</q> That is in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> we
muſt read them backwards, or we cannot
underſtand them. Thus, <hi>Verſ. 5. And</hi>
Abraham <hi>was One Hundred Years old when
his Son</hi> Iſaac <hi>was born unto him.</hi> Verſ. 4. <hi>And</hi>
Abraham <hi>Circumciſed his Son</hi> Iſaac, <hi>being
Eight Days old, as God had commanded
him.</hi> Verſ. 3. <hi>And</hi> Abraham <hi>called the
name of his Son that was born unto him,
whom</hi> Sarah <hi>bare to him,</hi> Iſaac.</p>
                  <p>And then he gives his Reaſon, why theſe
Three Verſes ſhould be read backwards,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45306:70"/>
in theſe numerical words, <q>[This Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
methinks, the Hiſtorian ought to
have kept; for the <hi>Jews</hi> do not name
their Children, till after their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is his Second Argument, under the
head of Tranſpoſitions, to prove that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
could not be the Author of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch.</hi>
And is it not a goodly one? Sure
<hi>P. Simon</hi> muſt have very mean thoughts
of the Learned Men of this Age, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he can perſwade them by ſuch
ridiculous Reaſoning as this, to be of his
opinion, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Pentateuch.</hi> But it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that he have mean thoughts of the
Men of this Age, when he takes upon
him to teach the Sacred Hiſtorian, (whom
himſelf acknowledges to have been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet)
how he ought to have written.
<q>[This Order, methinks, the Hiſtorian
ought to have kept,]</q> ſays <hi>P. Simon.</hi>
And your reaſon, good Father, why the
Hiſtorian ought to have kept the Order
that you fancy to be beſt. Why that we
have in the very next words, <q>[For the
<hi>Jews</hi> do not name their Children till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
their Circumciſion.]</q> Now Reader,
I pray thee conſider what a ſenſeleſs Reaſon
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:45306:70"/>
this is. The Author of the Book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi>
ought to have written in that Order,
as <hi>P. Simon</hi> would have it, and we ought
to read the Three Verſes aforeſaid, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> in this Age do
not name their Children till after their
Circumciſion. But can <hi>P. Simon</hi> prove,
that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, Children were not
named till after their Circumciſion? might
they not be numbred at their Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yea, or before their Circumciſion, in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi>
time? God left it free unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his Poſterity, to name their
Children at vvhat time they pleaſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
at, or after their Circumciſion; and
no Man living can prove, that in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
time, People vvere bound to name
their Children after their Circumciſion,
or that they generally uſed ſo to do; ſuch
Arguments as this of <hi>P. Simons</hi> deſerves
no Anſvver, but to be hiſſed at; and his
Immodeſty, in ſaying, That the Sacred
Hiſtorian ought to have kept the Order
he ſpeaks of, is to be lamented by all that
deſire to fear God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 31. 46.</hi>
                     <q>[This Verſe (ſays he) is methinks
likewiſe out of its Order, as well as all
the Diſcourſe which treats of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45306:71"/>
between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> becauſe
they did not eat till the Alliance was made.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, Here is an Argument little
better than the former, only it is more
modeſtly propoſed. They did not eat till
the Alliance was made; <hi>ergo</hi> all the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
which treats of the Covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> is out of its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
Any Man that attentively reads the
Text of <hi>Moſes,</hi> would conclude the quite
contrary, that ſeeing they did not eat
till the Alliance was made, therefore all
the Diſcouſe that treats of the Covenant,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is in its Order, becauſe it is all ſet
down before the offering of Sacrifice or
killing of Beaſts, and eating of Bread,
mentioned, <hi>Verſ. 54.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Verſ. 46.</hi> there is nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in it, but what is moſt true. It
is moſt true, that <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Brethren gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Stones, it is moſt true, that they
made an heap, and it is as true, that they
did eat there upon the heap. But ſays <hi>P.
Simon,</hi> They did not eat till the Alliance
was made. I Anſwer, Nor does the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian
ſay in <hi>Verſ. 46.</hi> that they did eat
before the Covenant was made; there he
only ſays, That they did eat upon the
heap, but does not ſay when; and a little
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:45306:71"/>
after, in <hi>Verſ. 54.</hi> he tells us when it was
they eat upon the heap, to wit, after the
Covenant was made. So that here is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to cavil at, and find fault with, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the ſame thing is twice expreſſed in
ſomewhat different words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, The matter of Fact is related in
general, without telling what was meant
by it,</hi> (Verſ. 46. They took ſtones and
made an heap: and they did eat there upon
the heap.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The meaning of the heap
of ſtones, and of their eating upon the
heap, is cleared up, and the time menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
when they eat upon the heap; there
it is ſhewed, that the heap of ſtones was
by agreement between <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi>
ordained to be a Witneſs or Token of the
Covenant between them Two, and their
eating upon the heap is clearly implyed,
to have been a federal Feaſt, ſignifying
and ſealing up a laſting Friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Parties Covenanted; and laſt
of all, it is expreſly declared when this
Feaſt upon the heap of ſtones, was, to
wit, after the Covenant between <hi>Jacob</hi>
and <hi>Laban</hi> was made and confirmed by the
Oaths of both Parties, <hi>Verſ. 53, 54.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45306:72"/>
To conclude this Anſwer, Let it be
conſidered, that <hi>Verſ. 46,</hi> ſpeaks only of
the place where they eat, without men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
the time when. But <hi>Verſ. 54,</hi>
ſpeaks only of the time when they eat,
without mentioning the place where, that
is, without mentioning that it was upon
the heap of ſtones; and now why <hi>Moſes,</hi>
yea, why Gods Holy Spirit might not be
the Author of both theſe 46 and 54 <hi>Verſes,</hi>
and of all that comes between them, it
is above my capacity to underſtand. I
dare challenge any Man to bring an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from this place to prove that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
could not be the Author of the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi>
an Argument I ſay, that any Man
of Judgment would not be aſhamed.
of.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 35. 28, 29.</hi>
                     <q>The Death of <hi>Iſaac</hi> there related, ſeems
to be out of its place, (ſays <hi>P. Simon)</hi>
becauſe <hi>Iſaac</hi> died not at that time, and
that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold Twelve Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Death of <hi>Iſaac:</hi> yet nevertheleſs
the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi> begins but at the
<hi>37th.</hi> Chapter of the ſame Book.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, The Death of <hi>Iſaac</hi> hath that
place in the Hiſtory which the wiſdome of
God thought fit to aſſign unto it, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:45306:72"/>
that we ſhould account to be its place,
which Gods Wiſdome by his Prophet hath
put it in. But ſays <hi>P. Simon, Iſaac</hi> died
not at that time. I Anſwer, There is no
other time of his Death mentioned there,
but that after he was One Hundred and
Eighty Years Old, he Died and was Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
which is moſt true; but it is not at
all ſaid by the Sacred Hiſtorian, that <hi>Iſaac</hi>
Died at that time, when his Son <hi>Jacob</hi>
came unto him, unto <hi>Mamre:</hi> for that
had been falſe; and I deſire this may be
taken notice of. But ſays <hi>P. Simon,</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
<hi>was Sold Twelve Years before the
Death of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and yet the Hiſtory of</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
<hi>begins but at the</hi> 37th. <hi>Chapter of the
ſame Book.</hi> I Anſwer, This is indeed true,
for <hi>Iſaac</hi> was Sixty Years Old when <hi>Jacob</hi>
was Born, <hi>Gen. 25. 26.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> was
One Hundred and Thirty Years Old when
he ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh, Gen. 47. 9.</hi> Now
60 and 130. make One Hundred and
Ninety, which is but Ten Years more
than the Years of the Age of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who
Died when he was One Hundred and
Eighty Years Old, that is Ten Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Jacob</hi> ſtood before <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> ſo that
<hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt have Died about the time of
<hi>Joſeph</hi>'s advancement in <hi>Aegypt.,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:45306:73"/>
from <hi>Gen. 41. 53, 54.</hi> compared
with <hi>Gen. 45. 6.</hi> where we ſee that Seven
Years of Plenty, and Two Years of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
had paſſed from the time of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s
advancement, until the time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
coming into <hi>Aegypt. Iſaac</hi> then Living
One Hundred and Eighty Years, could
not Die till about the time of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
either the Year of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
or the Year before his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement;
and if it was the Year be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Advancement, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> Died,
then it was about Twelve Years after <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
was Sold, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> Died: for <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
was Seventeen Years Old when he
was Sold, <hi>Gen. 37. 2.</hi> and Thirty Years
Old when he was advanced in <hi>Aegypt,
Gen. 41. 46.</hi> and conſequently he was
not advanced till the Thirteenth Year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he had been Sold; ſo that <hi>Iſaac</hi> Dying
the Year before his advancement, he muſt
have Died Twelve Years after he was
Sold. But what is all this to the purpoſe?
this doth not prove, that the Relation of
the Death of <hi>Iſaac</hi> is out of its place: for
as I have ſaid, that is its place which the
Wiſdome of God thought fit to aſſign un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
it, and there we find it in the end
of the <hi>35th.</hi> Chapter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:45306:73"/>
But ſays <hi>P. Simon,</hi> 
                     <q>The Hiſtory of
the Selling of <hi>Joſeph</hi> begins but at the
<hi>37th.</hi> Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and yet <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
was Sold Twelve Years before the
Death of <hi>Iſaac; ergo</hi> the Death of
<hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be related after the Selling
of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> but it is related before, and
ſo is out of its place.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, By denying the conſequence;
it follows indeed, that therefore the
Death of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was really after the Selling
of <hi>Joſeph;</hi> and there is nothing contrary
to this in <hi>Gen. 35. 28, 29.</hi> but it doth not at
all follow, that the relation of the Death
of <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt be placed in the Hiſtory,
after the relation of the Selling of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph;</hi>
for God was free to place it where
he pleaſed, and he thought fit to place it
before the relation of the Selling of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi>
in the end of the <hi>35th.</hi> Chapter; And
there was this good reaſon for it, becauſe
the Sacred Hiſtorian was there to finiſh the
Hiſtory of the Life of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and to ſpeak
no more of it afterwards.</p>
                  <p>And having no more to ſay of him,
but that <hi>(Iſaac</hi> being One Hundred and
Eighty Years Old, Died and was Buried
by his Sons <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob,)</hi> the Sacred
Hiſtorian wiſely Judged it better to place
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:45306:74"/>
it where it is, than in the middle of the
Hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 38. 1. And
it came to paſs at that time, that</hi> Judah
<hi>went down from his Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. <q>[There
is no Body (ſays <hi>P. Simon,)</hi> in reading
theſe words, but would at firſt believe
that they were joined with thoſe that
go before them, and that the time is
related in which this Action paſſed.
Nevertheleſs, it is not ſo, and the moſt
Learned Interpreters of the Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
that it happened at another
time.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Here is indeed ſomething
that looks like an Argument, and at firſt
ſight there ſeems to be a great difficulty
in it, not ſo much becauſe it ſeems to be
out of its proper place, for that is eaſily
Anſwered, as before, that whatſoever is in
the place aſſigned unto it by the Wiſdome
of God, is in its own place; but becauſe
the thing here related is ſaid to have come
to paſs <hi>(at that time,)</hi> which at firſt
ſight ſeems plainly to refer unto the Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of <hi>Joſeph:</hi> but it is not true that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
was but newly Married to the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Shuah,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> was Sold into
<hi>Aegypt;</hi> for between the time of the Sale
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45306:74"/>
of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and the time of <hi>Judahs</hi> going
into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with his Father <hi>Jacob,</hi> were
but Twenty Two, or Twenty Three
Years, as evidently appears from hence,
that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was Sold at the Age of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen
Years, and all his Fathers Houſe
went down to him into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> when he
was Forty, or Thirty Nine Years Old.
But it is not poſſible, that within the
compaſs of Twenty Two, or Twenty
Three Years, <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould be Married
unto the Daughter of <hi>Shuah,</hi> and beget
on her Three Sons, <hi>Er, Onan</hi> and <hi>Shelah;</hi>
and that after the Death of <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan,</hi>
and after the youngeſt of them <hi>Shelah,</hi>
was Marriagable, <hi>Judah</hi> ſhould commit
Inceſt with his Daughter in Law <hi>Tamar,</hi>
the Widow of <hi>Er,</hi> and on her beget <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez</hi>
and <hi>Zerah;</hi> and then <hi>Pharez</hi> ſhould
be Married and beget Two Sons, <hi>Hezron</hi>
and <hi>Hamul, (Gen. 38.</hi> throughout, and
<hi>Gen. 46. 12.)</hi> I ſay it is not poſſible in
the ordinary courſe of Nature, that all
this could be done within the ſpace of
Twenty Three Years. Therefore I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the words <hi>[at that time]</hi> in
<hi>Verſ. 1</hi> of <hi>Chap. 38</hi> of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
unto what goes immediately before,
to wit, the Sale of <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:45306:75"/>
Some Anſwer, Firſt, That the words
<hi>[It came to paſs at that time]</hi> do not refer
unto what goes immediately before them,
but that they mediately refer unto the
time when <hi>Jacob</hi> came firſt into <hi>Canaan,</hi>
after he had left <hi>Laban</hi> his Father in Law
in <hi>Meſopotamia;</hi> they do not know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
where to fix the time referred un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
but ſuppoſe it to have been about the
time of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s dwelling at <hi>Succoth,</hi> or at
<hi>Shalem,</hi> (Gen. 33. 17, 18.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Others Anſwer, That the
words <hi>[at that time,]</hi> or according to
the <hi>Hebrew, Baeth Hahi, [in that time]</hi>
do not at all refer unto any thing that
went before, either mediately or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,
but that they are a manner of
Speech common to Jewiſh and other
Writers, ſuch as <hi>(diebus illis,)</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies
a large compaſs of time, within
which a thing came to paſs, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining
the Year: as if the meaning
were no more, but that in ſuch an Age,
ſuch a thing came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, That which ſatisfies me
moſt, and in which I acquieſce, is this,
That this difficulty is only in Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
but not at all in the Original; and
therefore I humbly offer it unto the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45306:75"/>
of the Godly and Learned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be not expedient in this place to

the ſenſe of one <hi>Hebrew</hi> Syllable, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable
difficulty that ſeemed to be in

time it was, that he ſaw the Daughter of

                  <p>
                     <hi>P. Simon</hi> might have made a better uſe

up the difficulty which ſeemed to be in

the beginning of that Chapter, ſeems
not to be placed in the time wherein it
was, foraſmuch as <hi>Jethro</hi> ſeems not to
have come till the Second Year after the
finiſhing of the Tabernacle, as may be
proved out of <hi>Duteronomy.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, That in ſtead of ſolid
Reaſoning, (which a thing of this nature
requires,) here is nothing but gueſſing
and conjecturing, and one conjecture may
be very well Anſwered with another op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
conjecture; he ſays it may be
proved out of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> that <hi>Jethro</hi>
came not nnto <hi>Moſes</hi> till the Second Year
after the finiſhing of the Tabernacle; and
I ſay again, that his poſſible proof, may
poſſibly be Anſwered; and when he has
actually proved it, which he hath not yet
attempted to do, he ſhall be actually An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered;
that is, his proof of it, ſhall
be refuted, if it be falſe, or yielded unto
and acknowledged, if it appear to be true;
and I am ſure this is very fair, and in
reaſon no more can be required. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
it is written, <hi>Numb. 11. 16, 17.</hi> that
the Lord ſaid unto <hi>Moſes, Gather unto me
Seventy men of the Elders of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>whom
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:45306:77"/>
thou knoweſt to be the Elders of the People,
and Officers over them; and bring them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that
they moy ſtand there with thee. And I will
come down,</hi> &amp;c. Now this muſt have
been after the Building of the Tabernacle.
But it is not yet proved, that God gave
this Commandment unto <hi>Moſes</hi> at the
ſame time that <hi>Jethro</hi> his Father in Law
gave him the Councel, Recorded in <hi>Exod.
18. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23.</hi> Nay the Judges that
<hi>Moſes</hi> appointed over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> according to
the advice of <hi>Jethro, Exod. 18. 24, 25,
26.</hi> ſeem to have been many more than
Seventy; and it is not improbable, that
the Seventy Elders and Officers, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<hi>Numb. 11. 16.</hi> were afterwards cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
out of thoſe many Judges formerly
by <hi>Jethro</hi>'s advice ſet over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
unto the Lord at the Tabernacle of
the Congregation, there to receive from
the Lord the Spirit of Government, to
fit them for the due Execution of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
they were called unto.</p>
                  <p>But foreſeeing what may be ſaid for a
tranſpoſition here, I Anſwer, Secondly,
That ſuppoſe it were granted unto <hi>P. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
That <hi>Jethro</hi> did not come unto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi>
till the Second, Year after the finiſhing
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45306:77"/>
of the Tabernacle; what then? will it
follow that therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be
the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch?</hi> I deny that
conſequence; take that relation of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thro</hi>'s
coming unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> which way you
will, and ſuppoſe it to be before the
giving of the Law, or after the making
of the Tabernacle, as you pleaſe; yet it
is ſtill true, there is not the leaſt ſhadow
of falſhood in it: for <hi>Moſes</hi> neither ſays
that it was before, nor that it was after
the Building of the Tabernacle; all that
he writes of the time wherein it was, is,
that when <hi>Jethro</hi> heard of all that God
had done for <hi>Moſes</hi> and for <hi>Iſrael, &amp;c.</hi>
then he came unto <hi>Moſes, &amp;c. Exod. 18.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as for the Year in which <hi>Jethro</hi>
heard of all that God had done for his
People: <hi>Moſes</hi> is ſilent, and makes no
mention of it. That whole narration
then being true, without any mixture of
falſhood, why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it, where it is, as well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prophet could be? But is it not in
that place of the Book of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where
<hi>P. Simon</hi> would have had it to have been?
I Anſwer, <hi>Moſes</hi> might have good reaſon
not to place it there, but juſt where it is.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45306:78"/>
He had other things to write of in the
following Chapters of <hi>Exodus;</hi> all which
things were to be linked together, and
not to be ſeparated by the interpoſition of
the narrative of that viſit which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Law gave him in the Wilderneſs.
As <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſays, and <hi>P. Simon</hi> himſelf
out of him, <hi>Quo ordine quid referatur,
modo conſtet veritas, aut nihili aut parum
intereſt,</hi> it ſignifies nothing, or very little,
in what Order things be related, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
that we find them to be truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 46.</hi> and
ſays he, <q>[Where the Children of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>
are numbered, who went into <hi>Aegypt</hi>
with him, theſe are counted among
them, <hi>Joſeph, Manaſſeh,</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
who could not go with him into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
becauſe they were there before him;
and as that place mentions the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and his Childrens Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who came with him into <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
it is probable, for brevity's ſake, theſe
Two things have been joined together,
as if they had all been <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, This Objection comes from
<hi>P. Simons</hi> heedleſneſs and inadvertency in
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45306:78"/>
reading the Holy Scripture, but hath no
ground in the Text of <hi>Moſes.</hi> For as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,
Manaſſeh</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> could not go
with <hi>Jacob</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> becauſe they were
there before him: ſo for certain they are
not there ſaid to have gone with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Aegypt;</hi> on the contrary it is clearly
enough ſaid, that they did not go with
him into <hi>Aegypt;</hi> for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is ſaid, <hi>Verſ. 20. And unto</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
<hi>in the Land of</hi> Aegypt <hi>were Born</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh
<hi>and</hi> Ephraim. And again, <hi>Verſ.
27. And the Sons of</hi> Joſeph <hi>which were
Born him in</hi> Aegypt, [were] Two Souls.
where it is manifeſtly implyed, that <hi>Joſeph</hi>
and his Two Sons were not then to go into
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> but that they were there already.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To make the thing yet clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>Verſ. 26. That all
the Souls that came with</hi> Jacob <hi>into</hi> Aegypt,
<hi>which came out of his Loins, were Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
and Six;</hi> here <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf is not
reckoned as one of thoſe Sixty Six, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he could not go with himſelf into
<hi>Aegypt,</hi> nor could he come out of his
own Loins: <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo and his Two Sons
are not reckoned as any of the Sixty Six,
becauſe though they came out of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s
Loins, yet they could not go with him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45306:79"/>
                     <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſince they were already in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
before him. But it may be Object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
That <hi>Verſ. 27.</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, <hi>All
the Souls of the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>which
came into</hi> Aegypt, <hi>were Threeſcore and Ten.</hi>
In which number, <hi>Joſeph</hi> and his Two
Sons muſt be included.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, True, they are included in
the number Seventy, though they were
not included in the Number Sixty Six;
yea, and <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf is included in the
number Seventy, and theſe Four, <hi>Jacob,
Joſeph, Manaſſeh, Ephraim,</hi> being added
to Sixty Six, make up the number of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty
Souls, all which came into <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
the 66 came into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
<hi>Jacob</hi> came with them, for if all the Souls
of the Houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> came, then <hi>Jacob</hi>
himſelf came, being head of his own
Houſe; <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo he came into <hi>Aegypt</hi>
before, when he was ſold to the <hi>Iſhmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;</hi>
and his Two Sons they came into
<hi>Aegypt</hi> in the Loins of their Father <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
even as <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tithes unto <hi>Melchize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck</hi>
in the Loins of his Father <hi>Abraham,
(Heb. 7. 9.)</hi> Thus all the 70 Souls came into
<hi>Aegypt;</hi> but the Text of <hi>Moſes</hi> doth not at
all ſay, that all the 70 came into <hi>Aegypt</hi>
at the ſame time and in the ſame way and
manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:45306:79"/>
Eighthly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 35. 26.</hi>
                     <q>where <hi>Benjamin</hi> is counted amongſt the
Children that <hi>Jacob</hi> had in <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi>
and nevertheleſs <hi>Benjamin</hi> was not Born
there, but in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, I do not underſtand by what
Rules of Reaſoning, <hi>P. Simon</hi> puts this
paſſage amongſt the diſorderly Tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he pretends to be in the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch;</hi>
for ſurely, this ſeems rather to
be a contradiction, it being ſaid in the
ſame Chapter, <hi>Verſ. 16, 17, 18.</hi> that <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi>
was Born at <hi>Ephrath.</hi> And yet here
is no real, but only a ſeeming contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
for to make a real contradiction, it
muſt have been ſaid, <hi>[Benjamin was
Born at</hi> Ephrath,) <hi>All theſe are the Sons of</hi>
Jacob, <hi>which were Born to him in</hi> Padan-Aram,
but now it is not ſaid, (all theſe are
the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> which were Born to him
in <hi>Padam-aram,)</hi> but only, <hi>(Theſe are the
Sons of</hi> Jacob, <hi>which were Born to him in</hi>

including <hi>Benjamin</hi> in the number of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s
Sons Born to him in <hi>Padan-Aram;</hi>
for the other Eleven were Born in <hi>Padan-Aram:</hi>
and there was no need here to

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45306:80"/>
ſame Chapter, <hi>That</hi> Benjamin <hi>was Born at</hi>
Ephrath <hi>in the Land of</hi> Canaan, that no

pray mark the expreſſion, it is not ſaid, in
<hi>v. 26. All theſe are,</hi> &amp;c. but, <hi>Theſe are,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>P. Simon</hi> pretends that there are Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſitions,
not only in the Hiſtory, but
likewiſe in the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
Ninthly, and Laſtly, He Objects,
<hi>Exod. 22. 1, 3, 4.</hi> 
                     <q>where (ſays he) to
make a reaſonable conſtruction, what is
ſaid of the Thief in the Third Verſe,
muſt be joined with the Firſt, becauſe
there is a Tranſpoſition; and then one
ought to join the Fourth Verſe with the
Firſt: and moreover the words of the
Fourth Verſe, [if the Theft be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
found in his hand alive,] ought only
to relate to the Ox and Sheep, which
this Verſe makes mention of, and not to
the Aſs, although that is ſpoke of in the
ſame place with the Two other Animals.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, All this is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
one word of proof. The words of
the Law may be reaſonably enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued,
and well enough underſtood, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of <hi>Pere Simons</hi> imaginary
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:45306:80"/>
Tranſpoſition. In the Firſt Verſe, the
Lord God determins in what proportion a
Thief ſhould make reſtitution for an Ox
or a Sheep, in caſe he have killed or ſold
them. In Verſ. 2. The Lord God declares,
that if the Thief be found in the Act of
breaking up, and be killed; the killing of
him ſhall not be accounted Murther, nor
ſhall the killers Blood be ſhed for him,
provided it were in the Night, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Sun-Riſing.</p>
                  <p>But in the Third Verſe, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares,
That the killing of a Thief in the
Day time after Sun-Riſing, ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
Murther, and that the Blood of
the ſlayer ſhould be ſhed for the Blood of
the ſlain Thief: and that for this reaſon
given in the ſame Third Verſe, becauſe
he ſhould not have been killed for the
Theft, but compelled to make full Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
if he was able, but if he was not
able, he ſhould be ſold for his Theft. And
in Verſ. 4. the Lord ſhews in what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
he ſhould be obliged to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
in caſe the Theft were found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
in his hand; not in a Five-fold, nor
Four-fold, but in a double proportion, for
Ox, or Aſs, or Sheep; and thus all is
clear enough in the Order wherein the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:45306:81"/>
Wiſdom of God has placed things, and
there is no need to have recourſe unto a
Tranſpoſition; as to what he Objects,
concerning the Aſs in the Fourth Verſe,
that though it be joined with the Ox and
Sheep, yet what is ſaid of the Theft, its
being found alive in the hand of the Thief,
and of his making double Reſtitution in
that Caſe, ought not to relate unto the
Aſs, but only to the Ox and Sheep.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, This is a bold Aſſertion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proof at all; and there is reaſon
to conclude the contrary, that becauſe the
Aſs is joined with the Ox and Sheep,
therefore what here relates to the Ox and
Sheep, ought alſo to be referred unto the
Aſs; the Aſs was a very uſeful Creature
in thoſe Eaſtern Countries, and that may
be the reaſon why it is joined with the
Ox, both here, and elſewhere, as in the
Tenth Commandment. I know not what
uſe <hi>P. Simon</hi> may have for this Aſs, but it
ſeems by what he writes, that he would
play the Thief, and ſteal it out of this
Fourth Verſe of <hi>Exod. 22.</hi> which if he
ſhould do, he would be guilty, not only
of Theft, but of Sacrilege, for this Aſs
ſtands upon Holy Ground. Thus I have
Anſwered all his Arguments that fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:45306:81"/>
the Second Head of Diſorderly Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.
I paſs to the Third and laſt
head of Arguments, taken from ſeveral
paſſages of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> where he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
there are ſuch expreſſions as ſeem to
intimate, that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He Objects, <hi>Numb. 21. 14.</hi> 
                     <q>A
Book (ſays he) of the Wars of the
Lord, of which mention is made,
<hi>Numb. 21. 14.</hi> is an evident proof, that
the Hiſtories which are related in the
Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> have been taken
out of ſeveral Collections which have
been loſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, It is denyed, that the citing
of the Book of the Wars of the Lord, in
<hi>Numb. 21. 14.</hi> is an evident proof, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
any proof at all of any ſuch thing.
For Firſt, It is not ſo evident that it was a
Book at all, ſome think it was but a Song;
the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>(Sepher)</hi> does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſignifie a Book; but Secondly,
Granting that it was a Book, and not
meerly a Triumphal Song, it is not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
that it was a Book then already writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
it might be a Book to be afterwards
written, which <hi>Moſes</hi> foreſeeing by the
Spirit of Prophecy, refers unto; this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45306:82"/>
with the Original words in the
Text, which are <hi>[Al-ken Jeamar,]
wherefore it ſhall be ſaid</hi> in the Book of
the Wars of the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet Thirdly,
Granting it to have been a Book already
written, <hi>Moſes</hi> his once citing a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
out of it, doth no more prove that he
collected his Hiſtory out of ſuch Books,
then <hi>Paul</hi>'s citing a Teſtimony out of
Heathen Poets, <hi>(Acts 17. 28.</hi> &amp; <hi>Tit. 1.
12.)</hi> doth prove that he Tranſcribed his
Sermons and Epiſtles out of the writings
of Heathen Poets.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He Objects, <q>That the
names of <hi>Hebron</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> which are
in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> were not in beeing
in the time of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, It is ſaid, but not proved, that
the names of <hi>Hebron</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> were not in
beeing in <hi>Moſes</hi> his time; we will ſpeak
of each of them by it ſelf, and</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For <hi>Hebron,</hi> We find it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> as in <hi>Gen. 13. 18.</hi> &amp;
23. 2, 19. &amp; 35. 27. &amp; 37. 14. &amp; <hi>Num.
13. 22.</hi> It was a City in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
it is probable it might be firſt called
<hi>Mamre, (Gen. 13. 18.)</hi> and afterwards
<hi>Arba,</hi> or <hi>Kirjatharba,</hi> and <hi>Hebron.</hi> When
this City began firſt to be called <hi>Hebron</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:45306:82"/>
is uncertain; but it ſeems to have been
called by that name long before <hi>Moſes:</hi>
for it is ſaid, <hi>Gen. 37. 14.</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> ſent
his Son <hi>Joſeph</hi> out of the Vale of <hi>Hebron,</hi>
and <hi>Numb. 13. 22.</hi> we read that the Spies
which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent to ſearch out the Land
of <hi>Canaan,</hi> aſcended by the South, and
came unto <hi>Hebron,</hi> where the Children of
<hi>Anak</hi> dwelt: and that <hi>Hebron</hi> was
built Seven Years before <hi>Zoan</hi> in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
Here <hi>Hebron</hi> is ſpoken of as a City very
ancient, and that was ordinarily called by
that name. Afterwards <hi>Joſhua</hi> gave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Caleb</hi> the Son of <hi>Jephunneh</hi> for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance;
and he drove the <hi>Anakims</hi> out
of it, and took poſſeſſion of it; as we
read in <hi>Joſh. 14. 13, 14.</hi> &amp; 15. 13, 14.
But it is no where ſaid, that <hi>Caleb</hi> chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the name of it and firſt called it <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron.</hi>
I confeſs it is written, that the
name of <hi>Hebron</hi> before, was <hi>Kirjatharba,
Joſh. 14. 15.</hi> &amp; <hi>Jud. 1. 10.</hi> but the
meaning of thoſe words, is, that it was
called <hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> before <hi>Caleb</hi> drove out
the <hi>Anakims,</hi> and took poſſeſſion of it;
but this doth not prove that it was not
alſo called <hi>Hebron</hi> before, and in the time
of <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is was certainly called <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jath-arba</hi>
by the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> before <hi>Caleb</hi>
                     <pb n="122" facs="tcp:45306:83"/>
took it from them; but at the ſame time
it might be called <hi>Hebron</hi> by the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
I thus clearly ſhow that it might be ſo;
it was a City ſcituate on the ſide of a
Hill, as appears from <hi>Joſh. 14. 12, 13, 14.
Caleb</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> give me this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
<hi>Joſhua</hi> granted him his Requeſt, and
gave him <hi>Hebron.</hi> To me it ſeems pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
that the Hill was firſt called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi>
and ſo it was <hi>Kirjatharba</hi> upon
<hi>Hebron;</hi> for certain, the Countrey under
the Hill was called the Valley of <hi>Hebron,</hi>
and as is already obſerved, it was ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time, <hi>Gen. 37. 14.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be the Hill was firſt called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi>
from <hi>Ephron</hi> the <hi>Hittite,</hi> of whom
<hi>Abraham</hi> bought the Cave of <hi>Machphelah</hi>
for a Burying-place, <hi>(Gen. 23. 16, 17, 18,
19.);</hi> this Cave ſeems to have been in the
Hill, and the Field to have been at the
foot of the Hill, before the Mouth of
the Cave; now by an eaſie change of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of a like ſound, it is come to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Hebron,</hi> by the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
becauſe their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> bought it of
<hi>Ephron;</hi> or which comes to the ſame
thing, <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity called it <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron</hi>
from <hi>(Habar,)</hi> becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> and
his Poſterity did as it were enter into civil
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45306:83"/>
Society with the <hi>Hittites,</hi> when he bought
of <hi>Ephron</hi> that part of the Hill, with the
Field and Trees at the Foot of it, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and his Poſterity. It was almoſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity to call it
<hi>Hebron</hi> on theſe accounts, that ſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
name of it might be a laſting memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
of their right to it; but the <hi>Anakims</hi>
who afterwards took poſſeſſion of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
right, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
did not like that it ſhould be called at
all by that name of <hi>Hebron,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called it <hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> only, from <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>
the Father of <hi>Anak, (Joſh. 15. 13.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any ſhould now ſay, that this only
ſhews how the Hill with the Cave and
Field which <hi>Abraham</hi> bought for a Bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place,
came to be called <hi>Hebron;</hi> but
this is nothing to the City, which was
diſtinct from the Hill, Cave and Field. I
Anſwer, Firſt, The City it ſelf was Built
on the ſide of the Hill. Secondly, It is
probable, that in proceſs of time, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
was ſo far enlarged as to take in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
Field, with the Cave and that part
of the Hill in which the Cave was; and
this might give occaſion unto the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
to call the City it ſelf by the name of
<hi>Hebron.</hi> From all which it appears proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45306:84"/>
that it was called <hi>Hebron</hi> by the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites,</hi>
at the ſame time that it was called
<hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> by the <hi>Canaanites;</hi> and that
it was called by that name among the
People of God in the time of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but
after the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were driven out, and
<hi>Caleb</hi> was poſſeſſed of it, it loſt the name
<hi>Kirjath-arba,</hi> and retained only the name
<hi>Hebron.</hi> But againſt this it is Objected
out of <hi>Jerome,</hi> that this City had its name
from <hi>Hebron</hi> the Son of <hi>Caleb,</hi> of whom
we read in 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 42. 43.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, <hi>Maſius</hi> in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary
on <hi>Joſhua, Pag. 247.</hi> on the <hi>15th.</hi>
Verſe of the <hi>14th.</hi> Chapter, declares, that
he did not ſee any ſtrength in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to prove that <hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> was not
called <hi>Hebron</hi> in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> or
that it was firſt ſo called from <hi>Hebron</hi> the
Son of <hi>Caleb;</hi> but the truth is, <hi>Maſius</hi>
himſelf ſeems to have been very much
miſtaken in Judging of the ſenſe of theſe
words <hi>[the Father of</hi> Hebron,] in
1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2. 42. for he ſeems plainly to
take <hi>Hebron</hi> there for the City, and that
(Father of <hi>Hebron)</hi> ſignifies Governor,
or Lord of <hi>Hebron;</hi> whereas it is evident,
that <hi>Hebron</hi> there is a Man's name: for
in the next Verſe, this <hi>Hebron</hi> is ſaid to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:45306:84"/>
have had Four Sons; we muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
then, that one of the Poſterity of
<hi>Caleb</hi> was called <hi>Hebron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then Secondly, I Anſwer, that it is
not clear, that this <hi>Caleb</hi> the Father of
<hi>Hebron,</hi> was the ſame Man with the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leb</hi>
that firſt took <hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> from the
<hi>Anakims;</hi> for <hi>Caleb</hi> that firſt took <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jath-arba</hi>
from the <hi>Anakims,</hi> was the Son
of <hi>Jephunneh, Joſh. 14. 6.</hi> &amp; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
                  <p>But it is expreſly written of
<hi>Caleb,</hi> ſaid to be the Father of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron,</hi>
that he was the Son of <hi>Hezron,
1 Chron. 2. 9, 18, 19, 42.</hi> but <hi>Hezron</hi>
went into <hi>Aegypt</hi> with <hi>Jacob, Gen. 46. 12.</hi>
therefore his Son <hi>Caleb</hi> muſt have lived
long before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and could not be the
ſame with <hi>Caleb</hi> the Son of <hi>Jephunneh,</hi>
who was but Forty Years Old when <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
ſent him to eſpy out the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,
Joſh. 14. 7.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet Thirdly, Granting that <hi>Caleb</hi> the
Son of <hi>Jephunneh,</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> the Son of
<hi>Hezron,</hi> were one and the ſame Man, and
that he is called the Son of <hi>Hezron</hi> only
in a large ſenſe, becauſe he was of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity
of <hi>Hezron;</hi> as <hi>Maſius, Pag. 243.</hi>
thinks that <hi>Hezron</hi> was but his Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or Great Grandfather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſay,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:45306:85"/>
this being granted, it will not follow that
<hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> was firſt called <hi>Hebron,</hi> from
<hi>Hebron</hi> the Son of <hi>Caleb:</hi> on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>Hebron</hi> the Son of <hi>Caleb</hi> might take
his name from the City <hi>Hebron,</hi> the Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
of his Father; the like ſeems to
have happened unto <hi>Gilead</hi> the Son of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir,
1 Chron. 2. 21.</hi> he ſeems to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
his name from Mount <hi>Gilead,</hi> the
place of his Fathers Inheritance, <hi>Deut. 3.
15.</hi> for certain it is, that he did not firſt
give it its name, becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> had done
that long before, as appears from <hi>Gen. 31.
47, 48, 54.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maſius</hi> has one Objection which I muſt
Anſwer, <hi>Kirjath-arba</hi> (ſays he) is an old
name of that City, therefore <hi>Hebron</hi> is a
new name.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, This is but a weak conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
for it might have two old names,
one amongſt the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and the other
amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> as it ſeems <hi>Bethel</hi>
had, of which <hi>Bethel</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Judg. 1.
23. the name of it before was</hi> Luz; and
yet it is probable, that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> called
that City by the name of <hi>Bethel,</hi> long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Houſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> took it from the
<hi>Canaanites.</hi> Some part of the Countrey
very near it was moſt certainly called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel</hi>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:45306:85"/>
from <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time, and it is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely,
that the City it ſelf from that
time forwards began to be called, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Bethel</hi> by <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity; even
<hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf ſeems to make <hi>Luz</hi> to be all
one with <hi>Bethel,</hi> becauſe <hi>Bethel</hi> ſtrictly ſo
called was near <hi>Luz: Gen. 48. 3.</hi> ſays <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob,</hi>
God Almighty appeared to me at <hi>Luz</hi>
in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and Bleſſed me;
but in Chap. 35. Verſ. 1, 3. the ſame Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
is called <hi>Bethel,</hi> and was ſo called at
that time, both by God ſpeaking unto <hi>Jacob</hi>
and by <hi>Jacob</hi> ſpeaking unto his Family; ſays
God unto him, ariſe, go up to <hi>Bethel</hi> and
dwell there: and ſays he to his Family,
let us ariſe and go up to <hi>Bethel;</hi> which
they did, and ſo came to <hi>Luz,</hi> that is, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,
Verſ. 6.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Jacob</hi> there in <hi>Luz</hi> Built an Altar,
and called the place of the Altar <hi>[El-Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel,
Verſ. 7.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all which it ſeems very evident,
that the ſame City was in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by two names, <hi>Bethel</hi> and <hi>Luz;</hi> its
publick name by which the <hi>Canaanites
called it,</hi> and by which it was generally
known to the World, was <hi>Luz;</hi> but its
private name by which God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
called it, was <hi>Bethel;</hi> the like may be
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:45306:86"/>
ſaid, without any abſurdity at all, of <hi>Kir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jath-arba,</hi>
and <hi>Hebron.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, For the name <hi>Dan,</hi> as to what
he Objects, that it was not in Beeing in
the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet it is found in
the <hi>Pentateuch, Gen. 14. 14.</hi> &amp; <hi>Deut.
34. 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, It is freely confeſſed,
that the City <hi>Leſhem</hi> or <hi>Laiſh,</hi> was not
called by the name of <hi>Dan</hi> in the time of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> It was a long time after <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Danites</hi> took <hi>Laiſh,</hi> and changed
its name from <hi>Laiſh</hi> to <hi>Dan,</hi> after the
name of <hi>Dan</hi> their Father, as appears
from <hi>Joſh. 19. 47.</hi> &amp; <hi>Jud. 18. 29.</hi> But
that therefore there was no other place
called by the name of <hi>Dan</hi> in the time of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> I deny the conſequence; the Brook
or Valley of <hi>Eſhcol,</hi> was firſt called <hi>Eſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>col</hi>
in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe of the
Cluſter of Grapes which the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> cut down from thence, when the
Spies ſearched out the Land, <hi>Numb. 13.
24.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, <hi>Mamre</hi>
the <hi>Amorite</hi> had a Brother whoſe name
was <hi>Eſhcol, Gen. 14. 13.</hi> juſt ſo, though
<hi>Laiſh</hi> was not called <hi>Dan</hi> till after <hi>Moſes,</hi>
yet ſome other place might be called <hi>Dan,</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:45306:86"/>
in the time both of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes.
Jerome, Swidas</hi> and <hi>Philoſtorgius,</hi> were of
opinion, that a Spring-head of <hi>Jordan</hi>
was called <hi>Dan,</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Doctors
think that the River <hi>Jordan</hi> was ſo called,
becauſe it ſprings out of <hi>Dan;</hi> and if we
may believe the Learned <hi>Hofman,</hi> in his
<hi>Lexicon univerſale, Pag. 526.</hi> there was
another <hi>Dan</hi> yet diſtinct from <hi>Laiſh-Dan;</hi>
and it was an Hill in the Tribe of <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im,</hi>
on the Rode from <hi>Samaria</hi> to <hi>Sichem;</hi>
if there were then ſeveral <hi>Dans,</hi> it may
probably be ſuppoſed, that even in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s
time, there might be ſome place cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by the name of <hi>Dan,</hi> if not the Hill
<hi>Dan,</hi> on the Rode from <hi>Samaria</hi> to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem,</hi>
at leaſt the Fountain <hi>Dan</hi> ſpringing
out of Mount <hi>Libanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of Prophecy might call <hi>Laiſh Dan</hi> by
an Hiſtorical Prolepſis, as foreſeeing that
it would loſe the name of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> and be
called and known only by the name of
<hi>Dan,</hi> in after Ages. He might be moved to
do this, that his writings might then be
the better underſtood by the People,
when the name of <hi>Laiſh</hi> ſhould be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by the Vulgar, and that City ſhould
only be known by the name of <hi>Dan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:45306:87"/>
I Anſwer, Thirdly, Suppoſe we ſhould
grant with the Learned <hi>Maſius,</hi> that ſome
Prophet after <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſubſtitute the
word <hi>Dan</hi> in the place of <hi>Laiſh,</hi> (and the
ſame may be ſaid of <hi>Hebron)</hi> for to help
the People the better to underſtand and
remember thoſe paſſages of Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
where it occurs, it will not follow
from hence, that <hi>Moſes</hi> cannot be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> as we ſay one
Swallow doth not make the Spring, ſo
one or two little alterations of a word,
and that by the ſame Holy Spirit of Truth
by which <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote; doth not hinder
<hi>Moſes</hi> from being juſtly accounted the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> the changing of a
word or two by God's Spirit for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of God's People in after Ages, is no
ſufficient reaſon to change the name of the
Book, and to denominate it anew from
the perſon by whom it pleaſed God to
make ſuch a change. But though I write
thus, yet I ſhall not eaſily grant that <hi>de
facto,</hi> there has been ſuch an alteration
made in the names before mentioned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
it be firſt clearly and certainly proved,
which no Man that I know hath yet
done: I am ſure <hi>P. Simon</hi> hath not done
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:45306:87"/>
Thirdly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 36. 31.</hi> It is
probable, (ſays <hi>P. Simon,)</hi> that <hi>Moſes</hi>
could not have writ theſe words; <q>[And
theſe are the Kings that Reigned in the
Land of <hi>Edom,</hi> before there Reigned
any King over the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>]</q>
this manner of ſpeaking ſuppoſes the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
of Kings amongſt the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, (1.) This manner of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
only ſuppoſes that Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was to be Eſtabliſhed amongſt the
Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
promiſe of God unto <hi>Jacob</hi> at <hi>Bethel,
Gen. 35. 11, 12.</hi> and this <hi>Moſes</hi> knew ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well by the Spirit of Prophecy, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from <hi>Deut. 17. 14, 15, 18, 19, 20.)</hi>
and therefore he might well ſuppoſe it as
a thing that ſhould certainly come to paſs:
but it not being yet come to paſs, <hi>Moſes</hi>
here declares that <hi>Eſau</hi> was before hand
with <hi>Jacob</hi> as to this matter, for whilſt
<hi>Jacob</hi>'s Poſterity was in Servitude, under
a Rod of Iron in <hi>Aegypt, Eſau</hi> his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
flouriſhed under a Kingly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the Land of <hi>Edom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, (2.) This may ſignifie no
more, but that the Perſons there menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
did Reign Kings in the Land of
<hi>Edom,</hi> before the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45306:88"/>
Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were firſt formed into
an Holy Kingdom and Common-wealth,
according to <hi>Exod. 19. 5, 6.)</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi>
was ſet over them as their Head and King
under God; according to <hi>Deut. 33. 5.</hi>
where it is ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was King in
<hi>Jeſhurun.</hi> Thus it is evident, that there
is no weight at all in this Objection.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, He Objects out of <hi>R. Moſes
Cotſi, Exod. 12. 40.</hi> where <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays,
<q>That the Sojourning of the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was Four Hundred
Years, and yet it is certain, that <hi>Kohath</hi>
Son of <hi>Levi,</hi> who was one of them
that went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> lived but One
Hudred Thirty Three Years, that <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram</hi>
lived only One Hundred Thirty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Years, and that <hi>Moſes</hi> was but
Eighty Years Old when God ſpake to
him, which make in all but Three Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
and Fifty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, This Objection contains a
great Falſhood, in affirming, that <hi>Moſes</hi>
ſays the Sojourning of the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi> was Four Hundred Years;
there is no ſuch ſaying in the Text of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi>
the Text ſays not, that the Children
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> Sojourned Four Hundred Years
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> but that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:45306:88"/>
who Sojourned or dwelt in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> their
Sojourning was Four Hundred and Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Years; here it is not ſaid how many
of the Four Hundred and Thirty Years
were paſt in <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed (there being ſome ambiguity
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> words of the Text,) if it
were not well known that they Sojourned
in other places, both in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and in their Progenitors, <hi>Abraham,
Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> (as <hi>Levi</hi> in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
paid Tithes to <hi>Melchizedec, Heb. 7.
9.)</hi> it might be thought perhaps, that
they Sojourned the whole Four Hundred
and Thirty Years in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but it is a
thing notorious to all, that they Sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and elſewhere,
before they went into <hi>Aegypt:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is very unreaſonable to think, that
the whole Four Hundred and Thirty Years
Sojourning were paſt in <hi>Aegypt;</hi> what
<hi>Pere Simon</hi> intended by this Objection, I
do not well underſtand; for if this were
a good Argument, to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi>
could not be the Author of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi>
it would equally prove, that no
Prophet could be the Author of it, (which
yet is contrary to his own Judgment, if
he believe what he writes,) for as <hi>Moſes</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:45306:89"/>
could not, ſo no other Prophet could be
the Author of any Falſhood. I ſhall ſay
no more to this Objection, becauſe the
Reverend and Learned Dean of <hi>Pauls,</hi> has
Anſwered it at large, in his excellent Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to a Deiſt, unto which I refer the
Reader.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, He Objects, <hi>Gen. 46. 27.</hi> where
it is ſaid, <q>That all the Souls of the Houſe
of <hi>Jacob</hi> who went into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> were
Seventy, and nevertheleſs in counting
the number there related, they are
found to be but Sixty Nine.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, This difficulty (if it deſerve
that name) has been cleared already,
where it was ſhewed, that <hi>Jacob</hi> himſelf
did make the Seventieth.</p>
                  <p>Let any Man count them, and ſetting
aſide <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons Wives, and <hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan</hi>
who died in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> he will
find that the Sum Total, taking in <hi>Jacob</hi>
as head of his own Houſe, is juſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, He Objects, <hi>Numb. 3. 39.</hi>
                     <q>Where are reckoned Twenty Two
Thouſand, but if we join all the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

I Anſwer, By diſtinguiſhing upon the
words of the <hi>39th. Verſe,</hi> thus, All the
Males of the <hi>Levites</hi> that were numbered,
and were to be Devoted unto the Lord,
in exchange for the Firſt-born of the other
Tribes, were Twenty Two Thouſand,
and no more, I grant it, as being the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ſenſe of the words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> All the
Males of the <hi>Levites</hi> that were numbered,
and were partly already Holy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted,
and partly to be Devoted unto the
Lord, were Twenty Two Thouſand, and
no more, I deny it as not being the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
ſenſe of the words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> I
ground my diſtinction upon this, That
all the Males of the <hi>Levites,</hi> of what
ſort ſoever, were numbered from a Month
Old and upwards; now amongſt them
all, of neceſſity there muſt be a certain
number that were Firſt-born Males, and
all ſuch Firſt-born <hi>Levites</hi> as had been
Born from the time of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out
of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> unto the time of that reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
were already Sanctified unto the
Lord in a peculiar manner, and were his
own, Devoted unto him: as appears from
<hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 2, 13. and from the <hi>13th</hi> Verſe
of this ſame Third Chapter of <hi>Numbers.</hi>
Theſe Firſt-born <hi>Levites</hi> then could not
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45306:90"/>
be ſubſtituted in the ſtead of the Firſt-born
of the other Tribes, and ſo become
Holy and Devoted unto the Lord in a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
manner; for as Firſt-born they
were already the Lords, they were Holy
and Devoted unto God; they therefore
muſt have been excepted and left out of
the number of <hi>Levites</hi> that were to be
exchanged for the Firſt-born of the other
Tribes, and ſo to be appropriated unto
God and his Service in a peculiar manner:
But we plainly ſee that Three Hundred
<hi>Levites</hi> are left out, therefore it was on
this account that they were the Lords al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
as they were Firſt-born. The reſt
that were not thus the Lords already,
were fit matter to be Sanctified, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
to God and his Service, inſtead of
the Firſt-born of the other Tribes, and
the number of them all were Twenty
Two Thouſand, and no more. There
are Two things very obſervable in this
Chapter, (1.) That it is expreſsly ſaid of
theſe Twenty Two Thouſand <hi>Levites,</hi> that
they ſhall be the Lords inſtead of the
Firſt-born amongſt the Children of <hi>Iſrael,
Verſ. 45.</hi> therefore ſurely the Firſt-born
of the <hi>Levites</hi> cannot be included in that
number of Twenty Two Thouſand, ſince
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45306:90"/>
they were the Lords already, as well as
the Firſt-born of the other Tribes, and
ſo could not be given unto the Lord in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
for them. (2.) It is obſervable,
that this number of Twenty Two Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<hi>Levites</hi> is compared with the number
of the Firſt-born of the other Tribes, and
the number of the Firſt-born of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Tribes being found to contain Two
Hundred Seventy Three, more than the
number of the <hi>Levites</hi> that were to be
exchanged for them, it is expreſsly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
by God, that this Two Hundred
Seventy Three of the Firſt-born of the
other Tribes, ſhould be redeemed with
Money, at Five Shekles apiece by the Poll,
<hi>Verſ. 46, 47.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which is a demonſtration, that the
Three Hundred <hi>Levites</hi> left out of the
number of <hi>Levites</hi> which were to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed
for the Firſt-born of the other
Tribes, were purpoſely left out in the
caſting up of the Sum Total, as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fit matter to be given unto the Lord in
exchange, becauſe they were the Lords
already, as they were Firſt-born; if it
had not been really thus, they would not
have been purpoſely left out, but would
have been certainly included in the Sum
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45306:91"/>
Total, as they were in the particular
Sums; that ſo there might have been
enow (and more than enow) of <hi>Levites</hi>
to be given in exchange for the Firſt-born
of the other Tribes, and that there might
be no need of giving Five Shekels a piece
for the redeeming of any of them.</p>
                  <p>But now if any ask, why then were
theſe Three Hundred Firſt-born <hi>Levites</hi>
numbered at all, why were they put into
the particular Sums of the Males of the
ſeveral Families, as appears from <hi>Verſ. 22,
28, 34.</hi> and yet left out of the general
Sum of the Males of the whole Tribe,
as appears <hi>Verſ. 39?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, They were numbered, becauſe
God would have it a known truth upon
Record, that there were at that time ſo
many Males of the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi>
and no more; they were put into the
particular Sums, becauſe the particular
Sums were to contain all the Males of
the ſeveral Families, whether they were
Firſt-born or not: but they were left out
of the general Sum, becauſe it was to
ballance the general Sum of the Firſt-born
of the other Tribes, and ſo no
Firſt-born <hi>Levites</hi> were to be taken into
it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:45306:91"/>
Secondly, I Anſwer, That it becomes
not us to call God to an account, and to
ask why he doth ſuch a thing, when we
know certainly that he hath done it; he
giveth not account of any of his matters,
<hi>Job 33. 13.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even an Heathen King, when his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
returned unto him, had ſo
much Reaſon and Religion as to confeſs
unto God's praiſe, <hi>That he doth according
to his Will,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>and none can ſay unto
him, what doeſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4. 35.</p>
                  <p>This is as true of God's way of Write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Word, as it is of his way of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning
the World: But notwithſtanding
of ſome things that may be ſecret, and
to us unaccountable in both, yet we are
ſure in general, that God doth all things
well and wiſely in the one, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, He Objects, <hi>Exod. 16. 35.</hi>
where it is ſaid, <q>That the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did eat Manna Forty Years, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they came unto the Borders of the
Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is pretended that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not
write this Verſe, becauſe he died before
the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> left off eating of
Manna, which was not before they came
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45306:92"/>
to <hi>Gilgal</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Jericho</hi> beyond
<hi>Jordan,</hi> as appears from <hi>Joſh. 5. 10, 11, 12.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, I deny the conſequence of this
Argument, that becauſe the Children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> continued to eat Manna after the
death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> could not
write this Verſe; any ſtrength that this
Argument may ſeem to have, depends
upon a falſe ſuppoſition, that <hi>Moſes</hi> was
no Prophet, and knew no more than
other ordinary Men, or that he did not
write by the Spirit of Prophecy; for if
<hi>Moſes</hi> was a great Prophet (as certalnly
he was, <hi>Numb. 12. 6, 7, 8.</hi> &amp; <hi>Deut. 34.
10.)</hi> and if he knew more than other
ordinary Men, (as certainly he did, <hi>Dent.
31.</hi> from <hi>Verſ. 1,</hi> to 8, and from <hi>Verſ.
27,</hi> incluſively unto <hi>Verſ. 30.)</hi> then he
might eaſily know by the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
how long the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi>
ſhould eat Manna, and when and where
the Manna ſhould ceaſe; and it is moſt
certain, that long before his death the
Lord God revealed unto him, That the
Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould wander, or feed
(as it is rendered on the Margine of our
Bible) in the Wilderneſs Forty Years;
as is evident from <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 26, 33.
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:45306:92"/>
34, 35. and he knew well enough with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
having it immediately revealed to
him, that they had nothing elſe but Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na
to live upon in the Wilderneſs; yet
God might tell him that they ſhould not
be ſtarved, but the Manna ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to them and their Children, till
their Children were entered within the
Borders of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
provided for in an ordinary way
without Manna. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> believing
this, and knowing infallibly that it would
be ſo as the Lord had ſpoken; he might
write of it before his death, in the ſame
manner as he would have done in caſe he
had lived to ſee it all fulfilled; he might
write of it in the Preterit Tenſe, becauſe
the whole Forty Years were almoſt expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
before his death, and they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
eaten Manna for many Years; and as
for the ſhort time that remained in which
they were to have the Manna continued
to them; he was ſo ſure of it, that the
Manna ſhould be continued to them, and
that they ſhould eat of it till they paſſed
over <hi>Jordan,</hi> and entered into <hi>Canaan;</hi>
that he needed not to alter the Tenſe, but
might very well expreſs it altogether in
one and the ſame Preterit Tenſe, for the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45306:93"/>
uſe of that, and ſucceeding Generations,
to whom it would certainly be a thing
paſt.</p>
                  <p>After all the vain attempts made hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
by <hi>P. Simon,</hi> to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> could
not be the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> at
laſt out come the Arguments that <hi>Spinoſa</hi>
had formerly borrowed (as he ſays)
from <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> to prove his poſition,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be the Author of the
Books attributed to him.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Then <hi>P. Simon</hi> Objects,
<hi>Deut. 1. 1.</hi> And to put ſome colour upon
the buſineſs. and to make the Objection
ſeem to have ſome weight in it, he thus
renders the Firſt Verſe of <hi>Deut.]</hi> 
                     <q>Theſe
be the words which <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake unto all
<hi>Iſrael</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan</hi> in the Wilderneſs,]</q>
and then he Argues that the Book of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy</hi>
could not be written by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
becauſe he never went over <hi>Jordan.</hi> but
lived and died on this ſide <hi>Jordan</hi> in the
Wilderneſs; he that wrote thus muſt have
been in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
could not be <hi>Moſes</hi> but ſome Body af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his death, that wrote thus of him,
that he ſpoke ſuch words unto all <hi>Iſrael</hi>
beyond <hi>Jordan.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:45306:93"/>
Anſwer, It ſeems ſtrange to me,
that <hi>P. Simon</hi> who is ſuch a Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Hebrician,</hi> was not aſhamed of
this Argument, whereof the whole
ſtrength lies on the ſignification of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> word <hi>[Beeber;]</hi> indeed if
<hi>Beeber</hi> ſignifie only <hi>(Trans,)</hi> beyond,
then the Argument is good, but if <hi>(Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers)</hi>
ſignifie alſo <hi>[(Cis,)</hi> on this ſide,]
as it is rendered in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bibles, then
the Argument is ſtark nought; we muſt
therefore for clearing of this matter, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what <hi>(Beeber)</hi> ſignifies;</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, I grant that <hi>(Beeber)</hi> doth
ſome times ſignifie (trans, beyond,) I
grant alſo that the Vulgar Latine, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,
and that Edition of <hi>Munſters</hi>
Tranſlation which I have, render it [be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond;]
but that is no proof that <hi>(Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)</hi>
ſignifies always (beyond,) and
that it ſhould be ſo rendered in this place;
for <hi>P. Simon</hi> himſelf finds fault with all
theſe Three Tranſlations, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
that they may be mended in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
places: why then may not this be one
of the places that ought to be mended in
theſe Tranſlations?</p>
                  <p>For Secondly, It is not to be granted,
becauſe it is falſe, that <hi>(Beeber)</hi> always
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45306:94"/>
ſignifies (beyond.) I demonſtrate as
clearly as any thing of this nature can be
demonſtrated, that <hi>(Beeber)</hi> ſignifies
alſo <hi>[Cis,)</hi> on this ſide,] and that in
ſome places it muſt do ſo, and cannot do
otherwiſe; as for inſtance, in <hi>Joſh. 1. 14,
15.</hi> where the ſame words <hi>(Beeber, Hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jarden,)</hi>
are twice repeated, and of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
muſt be Tranſlated (on this ſide
<hi>Jordan)</hi> and cannot be otherwiſe Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.
For whoſoever he was that wrote
the Book of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and when or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it was written, yet ſtill this is true,
That before any of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
over <hi>Jordan,</hi> here <hi>Joſhua</hi> is brought
in, making a Speech to the <hi>Reubenites,
Gadites,</hi> and half Tribe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> in
which Speech he tells them, That <hi>Moſes</hi>
had given them their poſſeſſion <hi>(Beeber,
Haijarden,)</hi> on this ſide <hi>Jordan;</hi> here
<hi>(Beeber)</hi> muſt of neceſſity be rendered
(on this ſide,) and ſo <hi>Maſius</hi> renders it;
for it would have been notoriouſly falſe
for <hi>Joſhua</hi> in that place, and at that time,
to have ſaid, that <hi>Moſes</hi> had given them
their Inheritance beyond <hi>Jordan;</hi> it being
evident to common ſenſe that their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
lay on that ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> on which
<hi>Joſhua</hi> was then ſpeaking to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:45306:94"/>
And in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 4. (Mehaeber Mizze)
i. e. <hi>Eber</hi> with the ſame prefixes twice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
in one Verſe, ſignifies both (on
the one ſide,) and (on the other ſide.)</p>
                  <p>In fine, <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeaking of himſelf in
the firſt Perſon, uſes the ſame expreſſion
<hi>(Beeber Haijarden,)</hi> which muſt be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
(on this ſide <hi>Jordan,) Deut. 3. 8.</hi>
otherwiſe it will be falſe; for <hi>Moſes</hi> was
in the Wilderneſs when he uttered theſe
words, and he ſpoke them of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of <hi>Og</hi> and <hi>Sihon,</hi> which in reſpect of
<hi>Moſes,</hi> did then certainly lie on this ſide
<hi>Jordan,</hi> and not beyond <hi>Jordan;</hi> by all
this it appears, that <hi>P. Simon</hi>'s Argument
is grounded on a falſe bottom, that <hi>(Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber)</hi>
always ſignifies (beyond) which is
notoriouſly untrue. In our own <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Tranſlation it is here rightly rendered (on
this ſide <hi>Jordan.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ninthly, He Objects the laſt Chapter
of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> as that which could not
be written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it gives an
account of his Death and Burial, and of
ſome things that were done after his
Death; and to thoſe that ſay <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote
that Chapter by the Spirit of Prophecy,
<hi>P. Simon</hi> Anſwers, that we ought not to
believe them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:45306:95"/>
Anſwer, Firſt, No Man who believes
that <hi>Moſes</hi> was a Prophet, and the greateſt
Prophet that was before Chriſt, can disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the poſſibility of <hi>Moſes</hi> his writing
that Chapter; and if it be ſaid that it is not
probable he ſhould do it; I Anſwer, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
<hi>Moſes</hi> did as improbable things
as that: he foretold things at a greater
diſtance of time, than was his own
Death and Burial, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
Mourning for him Thirty Days in the
Plains of <hi>Moah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Secondly, I do not affirm that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
wrote that Chapter, at leaſt the Eight
laſt Verſes of it: but ſuppoſe he did not
write it, yet I deny that it follows from
thence that he was not the Author of the
<hi>Pentateuch;</hi> for it may very vvell be ſaid
that that Chapter is really no part of the
<hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or Five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but an
Appendix to it, vvritten by ſome other
hand, as by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> or ſome other Holy
Man of God after the Death of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tenthly, He Objects, <hi>Deut. 31. 22,
24.</hi> as if theſe Verſes, and other parts of
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> could not be vvritten by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> is there ſpoken of in the
Third Perſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:45306:95"/>
Anſvver, What a pitiful Argument is
this! is it not uſual even with Prophane
Authors to ſpeak of themſelves in the
Third Perſon? and doth not <hi>P. Simon</hi>
himſelf acknowledg this in <hi>Pag. 20.</hi> of
his Book, <q>[<hi>Caeſar</hi> (ſays he) ſpeaks
of himſelf in the Third Perſon, in his
Commentaries; <hi>Joſephus</hi> does the ſame
thing in his Hiſtory of the Wars of the
<hi>Jews</hi> againſt the <hi>Romans:</hi> and moreover
he writes his own Elogy,]</q> with what
Conſcience then did <hi>P. Simon</hi> produce this
paſſage, to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not be
the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch:</hi> ſurely any
unprejudiced Man would think that this
paſſage might be more pertinently alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the Author,
at leaſt of the Book of <hi>Denteronomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, He Objects <hi>Gen. 12. 6.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he ſays, <q>[If <hi>Moſes</hi> was the
Author of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> after the
manner as it is at preſent, would he
have uſed this way of ſpeaking, (The
<hi>Canaanite</hi> was then in the Land,) it
is known that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> continued
the poſſeſſion of this Countrey here
ſpoken of, all the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo that
this could not be writ, but after they
had been driven out.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="148" facs="tcp:45306:96"/>
Anſwer, And why might not <hi>Moſes</hi> uſe
that way of ſpeaking, (the <hi>Canaanite</hi> was
then in the Land,) is there any falſhood
in it? is it not a certain truth, That the
<hi>Canaanites</hi> were poſſeſſors of the Land of
<hi>Canaan,</hi> when <hi>Abraham</hi> came firſt, to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ
in it? But ſays <hi>P. Simon,</hi> It is
known that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> continued the
poſſeſſion of that Land, all the time of
<hi>Moſes.</hi> True; it is ſo, underſtanding it of
the Land beyond <hi>Jordan;</hi> but what then?
why then ſays <hi>P. Simon,</hi> This could not
be writ but after they had been driven
out. I deny that conſequence, for I know
that all the Criticks in the World cannot
prove it. This paſſage under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might very well be written by <hi>Moſes,</hi>
though it was well known that the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi>
continued poſſeſſors of the Land
of <hi>Canaan</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> all the time of
<hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> did not write this paſſage to
tell the People that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were
poſſeſſors of <hi>Canaan</hi> beyond <hi>Jordan,</hi> all his
time, which none of them could be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of; but he wrote it to make the
common Ignorant People know, that the
<hi>Canaanites</hi> had been poſſeſſors of that
Land even in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and
that their Father <hi>Abraham</hi> was but a
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45306:96"/>
ſtranger in it, and had not at his firſt
coming ſo much as a foot of Ground in
it that he could call his own, <hi>(Acts 7.
5.)</hi> and that it was of thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi>
that he afterwards bought the Burying-place
at <hi>Hebron,</hi> or <hi>Kirjatharba.</hi> Now
this was a truth, though moſt certain, yet
not ſo evident, but that many of the
common People might poſſibly be Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of it; and therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> writing
this Hiſtory for the benefit of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
People, he might put in this paſſage
once and again, that they might take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of it, and thereby know with
what People it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> lived
after he had left his own Countrey, and
Fathers Houſe, even with the Anceſtors
of thoſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> whom they were now
to deſtroy and drive out of that Land;
and likewiſe that they might thereby be
moved to admire the Faithfulneſs and
Goodneſs of God towards them, in that
he was then putting them in actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of that good Land, which though
promiſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, yet
was never before actually poſſeſſed by him
or them, but was now to be given them
according to promiſe. I find <hi>Aben Ezra</hi>
Anſwering this Objection another way;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45306:97"/>
he ſays, It may be that the <hi>Canaanites</hi> took
that Laud from ſome other People that
were poſſeſſors of it before them. And
<hi>R. Salomon</hi> poſitively affirms, That that
Land fell to the ſhare and Portion of
<hi>Shem,</hi> when <hi>Noah</hi> divided the whole
World amongſt his Sons; and he proves
it by this, That <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> (whom the
<hi>Jews</hi> believe to be <hi>Shem)</hi> was King of
<hi>Salem;</hi> but he thinks that the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
took it violently away from <hi>Shem</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and therefore God promiſed to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
that he would give it to him and
his Seed, becauſe they were of the Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of <hi>Sem,</hi> to whom it did originally
belong; if this were true and could be
proved, it might be thought that <hi>Moſes</hi>
his words here, had reference unto the
<hi>Canaanites</hi> being then in peaceable poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> after they
had driven out another People that was
there before them. But I leave it to the
<hi>Jews</hi> to Anſwer thus; I adhere to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
given above; to which I add, that
the <hi>Canaanites</hi> were actually driven out of
the Two Kingdoms of <hi>Sihon</hi> and <hi>Og,</hi> which
lay on the Eaſt-ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> before the
death of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and ſhortly after his
death they were to be likewiſe driven out
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45306:97"/>
of thoſe Kingdoms which lay on the
Weſt-ſide of <hi>Jordan;</hi> therefore <hi>Moſes</hi>
might very well ſay, That the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
were then in the Land, as intimating
thereby, that now they were partly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out, and partly as it were, a turning
out of the Land, and in a ſhort time it
might be truly ſaid of them, The <hi>Canaanite</hi>
is not now in the Land: By all which, it
plainly enough appears, that there is no
weight in this Objection of <hi>P. Simons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, He Objects <hi>Gen. 22. 14.</hi>
and ſays, <q>[It is not likely that <hi>Moſes</hi>
was the Author of this proverbial way
of ſpeaking, (in the Monnt of the
Lord it ſhall be ſeen) ſince he who has
added this to the Text, tells us that it
was an uſual Proverb in his time; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
that this Mount ſeems to be one of
the Mounts of the Countrey of <hi>Morea,</hi>
and the name of <hi>Morea</hi> was not given
it till a long time after.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, Firſt, What though <hi>Moſes</hi> was
not the Author of this proverbial way of
ſpeaking? <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Iſaac</hi> might be the
firſt Authors of the Proverb, and it might
be continued amongſt God's People from
<hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Iſaac</hi> down to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time;
and <hi>Moſes</hi> writing the Hiſtory of thoſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45306:98"/>
times as he was guided by the Spirit of
God, amongſt other memorable things,
he relates this matter of Fact, that that
proverbial ſpeech had been perpetuated
in the Church of God, and was uſed by
the Godly in his time; ſo that whoever
was the firſt Author of the proverbial
ſpeech, (In the Mount of the Lord it ſhall
be ſeen, or in the Mount the Lord ſhall
be ſeen, <hi>i. e.</hi> in due time and place God
will help and provide for his faithful obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
Servants, and they ſhall ſee it: God
will ſhew himſelf to be a preſent help un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his People that truſt him, in their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
ſtraits and difficulties,) I ſay whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was the firſt Author of this proverbial
Speech, nothing hinders but <hi>Moſes</hi> might
be, and was under God, the Author of
the Hiſtorical Relation of it.</p>
                  <p>Anſwer, Secondly, But how does <hi>P.
Simon</hi> prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
of it? why (ſays <hi>P. Simon,)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he vvho has added this to the Text,
tells us it vvas an uſual Proverb in his
time. Anſvver, A rare vvay of proving
that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not vvrite it, becauſe ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
has vvritten it ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> and added
it to his Text. But good Father, this is
begging not proving. It is the thing in
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:45306:98"/>
queſtion, vvhether another than <hi>Moſes</hi>
vvrote it, and added it to his Text; and
hovv novv do you prove that another
vvrote it and added it to <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Text? for
that is to be proved and not taken for
granted. And it vvill not prove it, to ſay
that he vvho vvrote it, tells us, that it
vvas an uſual Proverb in his time. For
ſuppoſe <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf had both been the
firſt Author of it, and alſo the vvriter of
it, in this place of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he might tell us
that it vvas an uſual Proverb in his time;
he might have been the Author of it at the
Red-Sea, vvhen he ſaid unto the People,
<hi>(Exod. 14. 13.) Fear ye not, ſtand ſtill and
ſee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will
ſhew you to Day;</hi> he might then have put
the People in mind of vvhat God had
done of Old for their Father <hi>Abraham</hi>
vvhen he vvas going to Sacrifice his Son
on the Mount, vvhich the Lord had told
him of; and from thence he might take
occaſion to ſay <q>[In the Mount of the
Lord it ſhall be ſeen, or in the Mount
the Lord ſhall be ſeen, <hi>i. e.</hi> your extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
this Day, ſhall be Gods opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
to ſhevv himſelf to be your preſent
and povverful Helper and Deliverer;]</q>
from vvhich Day forvvard it might have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45306:99"/>
been remembered, and ſo have paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Proverb among the People, and
Tvventy or Thirty Years after, <hi>Moſes</hi>
might vvrite it vvith his ovvn hand. What
incongruity vvould there be in all this,
ſuppoſe it had been thus, That <hi>Moſes</hi> had
been the firſt Author, and likewiſe the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical
Relator of the ſame proverbial
Speech? for my part I can diſcern none
at all; but this I have ſaid, only to ſhew
<hi>P. Simons</hi> pitiful lame way of reaſoning;
for I adhere to what I have written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that whoever was the firſt Author of
the Proverb, whether it was <hi>Abraham</hi> or
<hi>Iſaac,</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>Moſes</hi> might be, and was
the Hiſtorical Relator of it.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>P. Simon</hi> Objects further, That this
Mount ſeems to be one of the Mounts of
the Countrey of <hi>Morea,</hi> and the name of
<hi>Morea</hi> was not given it till a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Granting what <hi>P. Simon</hi> ſays,
That the Mount on which <hi>Abraham</hi> was
to have offered his Son, may ſeem to have
been one of the Mounts of the Countrey
of <hi>Morea,</hi> and that the name of <hi>Morea</hi>
was not given it till a long time after; I
deny that it can be proved from thence,
that <hi>Moſes</hi> was not the Author of the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45306:99"/>
                     <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> and of this paſſage in it; for
the name of <hi>Morea</hi> might be given unto
that Countrey firſt by the All-knowing
God, when he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to
go into it, and offer his Son upon one of
its Mountains, <hi>(Gen. 22. 2.)</hi> and then a
long time after, the Inhabitants of it by
common conſent might give it the very
ſame name of <hi>Morea,</hi> and might be
moved ſo to do, by hearing and believing
a credible report, That God himſelf ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Abraham,</hi> had a long time before
given their Countrey the name of <hi>Mori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah;</hi>
after which time it might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
known in thoſe parts of the
World by the name of <hi>Moriah;</hi> whereas
before it might have been known under
that name, only by <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and
ſome Devout People of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
by this I only intend to ſhew the
inconſequence of <hi>P. Simon</hi>'s Argument;
he is ſtill ſo unhappy in his reaſoning, that
though the premiſſes be granted him, yet
the concluſion will not follow. But now
if by theſe words, <hi>[the name of</hi> Morea
<hi>was not given it till a long time after,] P.
Simon</hi> means, That that Countrey was
not called <hi>Moriah,</hi> till a long time after
<hi>Moſes.</hi> I Anſwer, That he but begs the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:45306:100"/>
Queſtion, and what he affirms without
Proof, I utterly deny, and give this good
Reaſon for my denyal of it; becauſe the
Text ſays expreſly, <hi>(Gen. 22. 2.)</hi> That
God commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to take his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and go into the Land of
<hi>Moriah,</hi> and offer him there for a Burnt-offering,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> From which words it ſeems
very evident, that if that Land was not
called by the name of <hi>Moriah</hi> before, yet
then at leaſt it began to be called by that
name among the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> for we ſee that
God called it by that name, and the ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the name agreeing ſo admirably
well with what followed thereupon; it
is not likely that ever it was wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
amongſt the Poſterity of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
If any ſhould ſay, that it may ſeem the
name <hi>Moriah</hi> was given to that Land ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
after, than before, the Lord had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted
himſelf to <hi>Abraham</hi> on the Mount.</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, That can never be
proved; why might not the Lord God
give it that name before-hand, which
ſhould ſignifie what he was there to do on
the behalf of <hi>Abraham?</hi> The Text ſays,
That God bid <hi>Abraham</hi> get him into the
Land of <hi>Moriah,</hi> and their offer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="157" facs="tcp:45306:100"/>
I Anſwer, Secondly, Granting that it
was given to that Land after the Lord
had manifeſted himſelf to <hi>Abraham</hi> on the
Mount, yet it does not follow that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it muſt be after <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, and in <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>'s
time when the Temple was Built
upon Mount <hi>Moriah, 2 Chron. 3. 1.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Certainly it might have that name long
before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and yet not have it till after
<hi>Abraham</hi> had done offering the Ram in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of his Son; for as <hi>Abraham</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after called the name of that place
<hi>Jehovah-jireh,</hi> the Lord will provide;
with reſpect to the Anſwer which he had
given his Son, <hi>Verſ. 8. My Son, God will
provide himſelf a Lamb for a Burnt-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi>
So he might at the ſame time call
that part of the Countrey the Land of
<hi>Moriah,</hi> or the Land of Viſion, as the
Vulgar Interpreter, and <hi>Symmachus</hi> render
it, becauſe there he had ſeen God in a
moſt ſignal manner, there God had given
him a ſenſible and moſt convincing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
of his ſpecial Providence, and
of his peculiar diſcriminating Grace and
Love to him and his Seed.</p>
                  <p>Thirteenthly, and Laſtly, <hi>P. Simon</hi>
Objects, <hi>Deut. 3. 11.</hi> and thereupon ſays,
<q>[If we diligently read what is writ
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45306:101"/>
concerning the Bed of <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhan,</hi>
we ſhall find that thoſe who have
collected theſe Books, have added ſome
words, to illuſtrate the words of the
Text, by conforming them to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
and cuſtome of their own times.]</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, I have diligently read what is
there written concerning the Bed-ſtead of
<hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> both in the Original,
and in ſeveral Tranſlations, and yet I do not
find by what I read there, either that any
Body beſides <hi>Moſes</hi> collected thoſe Books, or
that he who collected them, hath added
ſome words to illuſtrate the words of the
Text, by conforming them to the practice
and cuſtome of his own time. I ſuppoſe
<hi>P. Simon</hi> would have us believe, that the
laſt words, <hi>[Beammath Iſh,]</hi> (after the
Cubit of a Man) have been added to the
Text after the time of <hi>Moſes:</hi> but he
muſt firſt prove that there was no ſuch
diſtinction of Cubits known in the
World, in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſo that
<hi>Moſes</hi> could not write theſe words, which
expreſs one Member of the diſtinction;
methinks it is very eaſily conceivable that
<hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf might be moved to add this
explication of his own words, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that there might be diverſe ſorts of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:45306:101"/>
Cubits than in uſe, of which ſome might
be longer than others, now if it had been
only ſaid, that Nine Cubits was the length,
and Four Cubits the breadth of the Giants
Bed-ſtead, the Reader would not have
known what Cubits he meant, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
would have ſtill remained igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of the exact meaſure of the Bed-ſtead,
therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> to take away all ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
adds for explication of his own words,
that it was the Cubit of a Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> the
common ordinary Cubit, which was then
ſo well known amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that
there remained no more ground of doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of what meaſure the Giants Bed-ſtead
was; and if any were ſo incredulous as
not to believe <hi>Moſes</hi> relation of the length
and breadth of the Giant Bed-ſtead, they
might go themſelves to <hi>Rabbath,</hi> and there
ſee it and meaſure it by the Cubit of a
Man. But ſome may ſay, How came
King <hi>Og</hi>'s Bed-ſtead to be at that time in
<hi>Rabbath</hi> amongſt the <hi>Ammonites?</hi> I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
it might come to be there any of
theſe Three ways, (1.) In time of War,
the <hi>Ammonites</hi> might have plundered the
Countrey of <hi>Og</hi> King of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and might
have carried his Iron Bed-ſtead with other
ſpoil into their own Countrey; or (2.) King
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45306:102"/>
                     <hi>Og</hi> being to fight with <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
at <hi>Edrei,</hi> and fearing the event of the
Battel, as he had good reaſon, might ſend
his own Iron Bead-ſtead with many other
neceſſary things to <hi>Rabbath</hi> to be ſecured
for him amongſt the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> whither
he might intend to flee, in caſe he ſhould
be vanquiſhed in the Battel at <hi>Edrei,</hi> and
be able to make his eſcape; or (3.) the
<hi>Iſraelites</hi> having Conquered the whole
Kingdom of <hi>Baſhan,</hi> and utterly deſtroyed
all the Inhabitants, King <hi>Og</hi> and all his
Subjects, taken all his Cities, to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Sixty, and poſſeſſed themſelves of
all that belonged to him, or his People;
if this Bed-ſtead was in the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
at that time, it muſt of neceſſity fall
into the hands of the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi>
being at Peace with the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> they
might come and Trade with the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi>
and eſpecially at ſuch a time they might
come to buy part of the Spoil, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
other things their curioſity might
prompt them to buy the Iron Bed-ſtead
of the Giant <hi>Og,</hi> and to carry it into their
own Countrey, which in former times had
been a Land of Giants, as appears from
<hi>Deut. 2. 19, 20, 21.</hi> and no doubt they might
have ancient Monuments of thoſe Giants,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:45306:102"/>
whom they called <hi>Zamzummims,</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
amongſt them, and thoſe that wanted
might be deſirous to have by them ſome
ſuch Monuments of Giants to ſhow, as
well as their Neighbours; and this might
be done before <hi>Moſes</hi> either ſpoke or wrote
the words of that Verſe Objected by <hi>P.
Simon.</hi> Thus you ſee that any of theſe
Three ways, the Iron Bed-ſtead of <hi>Og</hi>
might come to be in <hi>Rabbath</hi> of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Ammon,</hi> when <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the
Book of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are yet Two Objections againſt
<hi>Moſes</hi> his being the Author of the <hi>Penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch,</hi>
which I remember I have read in
<hi>Spinoſa,</hi> his <hi>Tractatus Theologico Politicus,</hi>
and becauſe I would omit nothing of any
Moment, that the Adverſaries have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
againſt the Truth which the Church
of God believes, and I defend, I ſhall here
ſet them down, and Anſwer them, as I
have done with <hi>P. Simon</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>Fourteenthly, Then, <hi>Spinoſa</hi> Objects,
<hi>Deut. 2. 12.</hi> where it is ſaid, <q>That the
Children of <hi>Eſau</hi> deſtroyed the <hi>Horims,</hi>
and dwelt in their ſtead, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did
unto the Land of his Poſſeſſion which
the Lord gave unto them; now he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
that this could not be written by
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:45306:103"/>
                        <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not deſtroy the
<hi>Canaanites,</hi> and take poſſeſſion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
till after his Death.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, At this rate of arguing, a
Man might prove, that our Lord Chriſt
when he inſtituted the Sacrament of the
Euchariſt, did not ſpeak theſe words,
<hi>[This is my Blood which is ſhed for many,
—This is my Body which is given, or
broken for you,]</hi> becauſe his Blood was not
ſhed, nor his Body broken, till the Day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
and yet it is moſt certain that he did
ſpeak thoſe words when he inſtituted the
Holy Sacrament, the Night before his
Death. But then you will ask, why did
our Lord ſpeak ſo, why did he ſay, This
is my Blood which is ſhed, this is my
Body which is broken, when neither was
the one ſhed, nor the other broken? I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,
He did ſo, becauſe it was an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
way of ſpeaking amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> to
expreſs themſelves in the <hi>Preterit</hi> or <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Tenſe,</hi> when they were talking or
writing of a thing that was ſhortly and
certainly to come to paſs; and therefore
the Vulgar Interpeter attending more to
the ſenſe, than to the bare words of our
Lord, renders them, <hi>Hic eſt ſanguis meus
qui pro multis effundetur, hoc eſt corpus me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:45306:103"/>
quod pro vobis tradetur;</hi> this is my
Blood which ſhall be ſhed, and my Body
which ſhall be given; after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may we underſtand the words of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
[as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did, <hi>i. e.</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall
ſhortly and certainly do to the Land of his
Poſſeſſion;] beſides there was this good
reaſon why <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould uſe the <hi>Preterit
Tenſe,</hi> becauſe the thing he was writing of,
was partly paſt already, <hi>Iſrael</hi> had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
deſtroyed the Inhabitants of Two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
and taken actual poſſeſſion of the
Land; and it was partly to be within a
ſhort time, <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſhortly to do ſo by
all the other Inhabitants of the Land of
his poſſeſſion, which God had given him;
<hi>Moſes</hi> then having reaſon to write as he did,
<hi>Spinoſa</hi> had no reaſon to cavil at the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of his expreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Fifteenthly, He Objects, <hi>Deut. 3. 14.</hi>
and from theſe words, <q>[<hi>Jair</hi> called them
after his own name, <hi>Baſhan-havoth-jair,</hi>
unto this Day,]</q> infers that this muſt
have been written long after <hi>Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anſwer, Some think that theſe words,
<hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTO THIS DAY,]</hi> have been after
<hi>Moſes</hi> put in the Margin, and in proceſs of
time have crept into the Text, or elſe that
<hi>Ezdras</hi> hath inſerted them into the Text.
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:45306:104"/>
But there is no neceſſity of Anſwering
thus; for Firſt, <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Book of
<hi>Deuteronomy</hi> ſome Months after <hi>Jair</hi> had
taken the Countrey of <hi>Argob,</hi> and called
it after his own name, <hi>(Baſhan-havoth-jair,)</hi>
therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf might very
well ſay, that the Countrey of <hi>Argob</hi> was
called after the name of <hi>Jair</hi> unto this
Day, that is from the time of <hi>Jair</hi> his
taking of it, and calling it <hi>Baſhan-havoth-jair,</hi>
unto the Day of <hi>Moſes</hi> writing that
part of the Book of <hi>Deuteronomy;</hi> for
there was nothing but truth in his ſo ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Book of
<hi>Deuteronomy</hi> not only for the preſent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,
but alſo for the Generations to
come, according to that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt,
Pſal. 102. 18. This ſhall be written for the
Generations to come;</hi> and conſequently
knew that theſe words, <hi>(unto this Day,)</hi>
would be further verified in after Ages:
Therefore he might purpoſely uſe theſe
words, <hi>(unto this Day,)</hi> as intending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to ſignifie unto the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in their
ſeveral Generations, that the Countrey of
<hi>Argob</hi> was called after the name of <hi>Jair,
(Baſhan-havoth-jair,)</hi> from <hi>Jairs</hi> firſt
taking of it, unto their time; there being
then no falſity nor abſurdity in the words,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45306:104"/>
                     <hi>(unto this Day,)</hi> as here uſed, <hi>Moſes</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
might very well be the Author of
them: nay they are ſo ſignificant with
reſpect to future Generations, as I have
ſhewed, that <hi>Moſes</hi> his Wiſdom appears in
chooſing to expreſs himſelf in ſuch words
as were actually true, when he firſt ſpoke
and wrote them, and yet were to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
verified in all ſucceeding Generations,
ſo long as the <hi>Hebrew</hi>-Commonwealth
ſtood; ſo much for Anſwer unto <hi>Spinoſa</hi>
his Two Objections.</p>
                  <p>I have now gone through all that <hi>P.
Simon</hi> hath written to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi>
could not be the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi>
I have examined all his Arguments, and
Anſwered every one of them; there is not
one good Argument amongſt them all, not
one that can prove his poſition, <hi>That</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<hi>cannot be the Author of the Books attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
to him;</hi> and verily many of them
are (I think) ſuch pitiful trifling things,
that a reaſonable Man and Chriſtian
ſhould be aſhamed of them. The reaſon
why I meddle with no more of his <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Hiſtory,</hi> than what concerns the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tateuch,</hi>
is, Firſt, Becauſe this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figned
to accompany the precedent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
concerning the proofs of the Books
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:45306:105"/>
of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore I thought fit to
deal with <hi>P. Simon</hi> only upon that point,
wherein he ſeemed to contradict what the
Author of the excellent Diſcourſe affirms
and proves: that ſo his Objections being
all Anſwered, that Diſcourſe may remain
firm and unſhaken, and in its full ſtrength,
and that Infidels may not pretend that <hi>P.
Simon</hi> has confuted it; which is ſo far
from being true, that the vain ſucceſleſs
attempt of ſo great a Man (as <hi>P. Simon</hi>
is accounted,) to prove that <hi>Moſes</hi> could not
be the Author of the <hi>Pentateuch;</hi> is an
Argument that the thing is not practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it cannot be done: for if it could,
<hi>P. Simon</hi> is counted as able, and to me ſeems
to have been as willing to have done it, as
any other Man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe if the Divine Truth
and Authority of <hi>Moſes</hi> and his Law, and
of Chriſt and his Goſpel, be well ſecured,
our Chriſtian Religion is ſecured in its
main ſtrength and fundamental grounds,
againſt Atheiſts and Infidels. As for the
reſt of <hi>P. Simon</hi>'s Book, I doubt not but
ſome Men of greater Abilities for ſuch a
work, than I, will in due time thoroughly
examine it, and ſeparate the Chaff from
the Wheat, allowing him his due praiſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45306:105"/>
where he hath done well; and chaſtiſing him
where he hath done evil; you may gueſs by
this, that it will not be ſo difficult to do it, as
ſome may apprehend. In the mean time, if
his vain Cavils at ſeveral expreſſions here and
there in the Holy Scriptures, ſhould be a tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unto any to think meanly of the Scriptures
themſelves; I deſire ſuch, if they can, to read
ſome part of <hi>Origens Philocalia, Chap. 1. Pag. 4,
&amp; 5.</hi> in <hi>Spencers</hi> Edition at <hi>Cambridge, 1658.</hi>
and to conſider that, as <hi>Origen</hi> ſays, <hi>Every one
of the Works of God, do not equally, but ſome more
and ſome leſs, declare and ſhew forth the Glory of
God in his Beeing and Providence;</hi> after the ſame
manner all the parts of God's written Word,
do not equally, but ſome more clearly, and
ſome more obſcurely, evidence themſelves to
be of God. And as there are ſome dark oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences
in Providence that tempt weak and
ſinful Men to doubt of God's Beeing and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
juſt ſo there are ſome dark and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
paſſages in Holy Scripture, that tempt Men
to doubt of the Divine Verity and Authority of
of the Scriptures; and yet as none but Fools,
<hi>(Pſal. 14. 1.)</hi> will disbelieve the Beeing and
Providence of God, becauſe there are ſome
things in his Nature and Providence which they
cannot comprehend; ſo no Wiſe Man will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believe
the Holy Scriptures, becauſe there are
here and there ſome paſſages in them which he
cannot underſtand; <hi>Lo they have rejected the
word of the Lord, and what Wiſdom is in them?</hi>
ſays the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah, (Jer. 8. 9.)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:45306:106"/>
Indeed there can be no true Wiſdom in them
who reject the Word of the Lord; for his Word
believed and practiſed, <hi>is our Wiſdom and our
Underſtanding, and makes us a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
People, (Deut. 4. 5, 6,). The Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of the Lord is ſure, making Wiſe the Simple,</hi>
(Pſal. 19. 7.) If ever then we would be truly
Wiſe, let us againſt all Tentations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
eſteem highly of, and adhere ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto the Holy Scriptures of Truth; for it is
they that are <hi>able to make us wiſe unto Salvation,
through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.
15.)</p>
                  <p>If what I have here written do contribute
any thing towards the helping of Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to keep up in their Souls a due eſteem of,
and reverend regard unto the Holy Scriptures,
and towards the ſtrengthning of them againſt
Tentations to unbelief, I have obtained my end;
and deſire them to let me have the help and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of their Prayers, but let him have all the
Praiſe, who is the Father of Lights, and the God
of all Grace, unto whom be Glory in the
Church by Chriſt Jeſus, throughout all Ages,
World without End, <hi>Amen.</hi>
