            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>FOr a deed which I might have choſen whether or no I would have done, it ſeems ſomewhat uncouth to make any manner of Apology, for I might have ſaved both labours; and therefore I ſhall not make uſe of that Hackny Stale (which hath not been wanting) <hi>Importunity of Friends;</hi> Nor ſhall I colour
<pb facs="tcp:41882:4"/>
my Deſign with any pretext of more Conſequence, than the thing is.</p>
            <p>The naked truth, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon then, why theſe two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſee the light, it is a deſire I had (which Nature it ſelf prompts every Agent to) <hi>opus perficere,</hi> to finiſh what I had begun, and indeed to bleſs God who before my own, hath brought, <hi>A Period to the Grand Conſpiracy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was (I profeſs) a great Alleviation of my ſufferings, to meditate the Parallel between my Saviour and my Soveraign; His great Example ſilenced all murmurs! and ſince it hath pleaſed God to reſtore him in
<pb facs="tcp:41882:4"/>
the greateſt, and nigheſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city this State affords; ſince we enjoy him in his Lively I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage; ſince there ſits upon the Throne, <hi>Carolus nulli niſi Patri ſecundus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſecond to that glorious Martyr, <hi>Quis tam ferreus ut teneat ſe?</hi> who can be ſo Stoical as not to rejoyce, and be exceeding glad? And indeed I never hope to ſee a gladder land, then I ſaw upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count!</p>
            <p>Nor truly did I onely ſtand by, and obſerve, but even then as early as any, theſe two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, even as they are now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, were then preached; But I conceived the Muſick was
<pb facs="tcp:41882:5"/>
too loud then, for a plain ſong to be heard in, and the tinkling of a Cymbal is beſt ſpared, when Trumpets, Shaumes, and Sack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buts ſound up their ſtronger Elegancies; for which cauſe I have choſen a ſtiller hour, and indeed therefore a longer day, that I might take due meaſure of my own affections, and make ſome trial, whether my hopes or my Soveraign, were the bottom of my joy. And,</p>
            <p>Right Worſhipful, it was meet, yea very meet, that I ſhould delay, and proportion my intentions even to your lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; it was meet I ſhould give you the full liberty of that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tryumph, before any thing
<pb facs="tcp:41882:5"/>
of mine ſhould call you off: For next to the happy arrival of our Gracious Soveraign Lord the King, I am bound to bleſſe God for you; for you, whoſe Bounty did ſurprize my hopes; for you, who guilded my black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er letters, and feared not to be an <hi>Obadiah</hi> to the Prophets of the Lord, in the ſaddeſt times.</p>
            <p>Ever muſt my prayers be, <hi>Good luck have thou with thine Honour,</hi> even with that Honour, which was the undoubted evidence of more Loyalty, than Ambition, when your noble Choice was, rather in a minorated degree of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to Attend, then to be onely a thrifty Spectator at the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation

                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been ſaid of old, <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei,</hi> the voice of the people is the voice of God, and indeed when God is the ultimate deſign in it, it is ſo. Now to make a voice to be the voice of the people, and that voice of the people to be the voice of God,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:41882:18"/>
there muſt be a concurrence of theſe three:</p>
                  <p>1. Generality, 2. Unanimity, 3. Gods glory.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, where there is not a general vogue, it may be the voice of a party, but cannot be the voice of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>When our late King of bleſſed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was brought to the Bar, <hi>The Charge was laid in the name of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi> But a wiſe and reſolute Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Lady plainly told them, it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo, ſaying at thoſe words, <hi>Not half the people:</hi> A packt party might, but the voice of the people never brought him thither; for (God knows) thouſands of his people were upon their knees to God for him, when theſe unrighteous Judges did dare to lift up their hands againſt him; ſo that what they deludingly called <hi>Vox po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,</hi> the voice of the people, it was at moſt but <hi>Vox partium,</hi> the voice of a party.</p>
                  <p>But here in my Text we ſeem to have a better account; for 'tis not onely ſaid, all the people, but all the people, <hi>throughout all their tribes were</hi>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:41882:18"/>
                     <hi>at ſtrife:</hi> As if we ſhould ſay, all the people in all the Shires of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Wales;</hi> that is the greateſt part in all theſe places, ſay ſo, or ſo: And this is generally enough to make it <hi>vox populi,</hi> the voice of the people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As there muſt be <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,</hi> even ſo there muſt be <hi>Unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> that is, they muſt ſpeak one and the ſame thing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 19. VVe read of a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and a numerous aſſembly at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> but <hi>ſome cried one thing, and ſome another:</hi> So that though there <note place="margin">32.</note> was Generality, there wanted Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity: and therefore (as before) this could not be <hi>Vox populi ſed parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> not the voice of people, but of parties.</p>
                  <p>Here in my Text we finde no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, all the people in all the tribes, all ſtrove <hi>for one</hi> and the ſame thing, all ſang the ſame tune, all iſſued out this harmony, <hi>Why ſpeak ye not a word of bringing the King back?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, though Generality and Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity may make a voice to be <hi>Vox populi,</hi> the voice of the people; yet there muſt go more then ſo to make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:41882:19"/>
that <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> the voice of God; for the unanimous voice of ſome people, hath rather been <hi>Vox Diaboli,</hi> then <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> rather the voice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, then the voice of God: For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. 1. VVhen the people ſaw that <hi>Moſes</hi> delayed his coming down out of the Mount, <hi>The people gathered themſelves together unto Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, and ſaid unto him, Up, make us gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is <hi>Vox populi,</hi> the voice of the people; but that voice which calleth for artificial gods, <hi>Up, make us gods,</hi> that cannot be <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> the voice of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. At the arraignment of the beſt of Kings, even our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord and Saviour, it is written, <hi>Then anſwered all the people, and ſaid, his blood be upon us, and upon us, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">25.</note> 
                     <hi>upon our children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here was <hi>Generality,</hi> and here was <hi>Unanimity, all the people ſaid, his blood be upon us, and upon our children;</hi> And yet this was not <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> this was not the voice of God; for the curſe of that blood ſticks to this day, to them and their children.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:41882:19"/>
Thirdly, therefore to make that voice, which undoubtedly is <hi>Vox po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli,</hi> the voice of the people; the voice of God, it muſt have a ſincere intention, and a <hi>direct aim at Gods glory.</hi> For, the death and paſſion of our Saviour, it was without doubt the will of God; he became incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and came into the world for that very end: And yet their voice who cryed out, <hi>Crucifige, crucifige;</hi> their voice who ſaid, <hi>Let his blood be upon us, and upon our children,</hi> it was not (though agreeable to his will) <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ox Dei,</hi> the voice of God.</p>
                  <p>For, they did not intend <hi>Gods glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> but their <hi>own ends;</hi> they did not intend the <hi>ſalvation</hi> of mankinde, but the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of a man; they voted what was Gods will, but it was more then they knew, and more then they regarded.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then it is ſaid in the text, <hi>All the people were at ſtrife through all the tribes of Iſrael,</hi> and that not for a private, but for a publick intereſt, for the reducing and bringing back their moſt injuriouſly exiled King: I ſee no reaſon why I may not here ſay,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:41882:20"/>
this <hi>Vox populi,</hi> it was <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> this voice of the people, it was the voice of God: For it was generally all, <hi>throughout all the tribes;</hi> Unanimouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all, <hi>all called for the ſame thing:</hi> And to Gods glory all, for all were for the reſtitution of his anointed; all ſaid, <hi>Why ſpeak ye not a word of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the King?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Uſe I ſhall make of this point, is, That we <hi>may all grow unanimous,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Applic.</note> vote and pray for one and the ſame thing, and that not a private, but a <hi>publick intereſt;</hi> an intereſt in which (God the ſearcher of hearts may ſee) we more prefer <hi>his glory,</hi> then <hi>perſonal accommodations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day of Humiliation lately kept throughout this Nation, what was it for, but onely to make <hi>Vox populi, vox Dei?</hi> to make the voice of the people to become the voice of God; for an <hi>united devotion,</hi> and an <hi>unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prayer,</hi> in a publick and a pious intereſt, draws nigheſt to the voice of God of any we can imagine.</p>
                  <p>In my text it is ſaid, <hi>All the people were at ſtrife:</hi> and indeed to ſuch a loyal, and conſcionable ſtrife as this,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:41882:20"/>
I could exhort all people, I wiſh there were an holy <hi>ſtriving</hi> in every breaſt, which ſhould get faſteſt to God for the obtaining of ſo great a bleſſing, as is <hi>the ſettlement of peace and government, upon the foundations of truth and righteouſneſs.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>And indeed (as before I intimated) the King was ſo gracious, that not ſo much as <hi>Shimei</hi> (who reviled, curſed, and threw ſtones at him) ſuffered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that account.</p>

Now if the deſires of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was as the deſires of <hi>England, To ſettle Peace and Government, upon foundations of Truth and Righteouſneſs;</hi> they could then pitcht upon no better courſe then indeed was done, which was the bringing back of <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the King to the City: For, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Foundation builds upon this ſcore, <hi>That every man may have his right;</hi> and that made <hi>David</hi> himſelf to ſay unto his God, <hi>Thou haſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained my Right, and my Cauſe; Thou</hi>

                  <p>Now the men, both of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they were all convinced; they all very well knew, that the ſeat of the Kingdom was <hi>Davids;</hi> knew <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolon</hi> to have no Title, but what the ſword made him; knew the right of the Throne belonged to him who was fled, to him who was out of the land: And therefore, if they would have peace and government built upon the foundation <hi>of Righteouſneſs,</hi> they could not but conclude, the King himſelf muſt have <hi>his right;</hi> He who was unjuſtly baniſht, muſt in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be called home; He who

                  </p>
                  <p>When the preſent Power, and chief Rulers of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were ſo blinded with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, that <hi>They walked in darkneſs:</hi> When they were ſo bent upon cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, oppreſſion, and injuſtice, that

                  <p>Theſe words upon their very read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, appear to be an Allegory, a Figurative expreſſion, in which of neceſſity there muſt be ſome hidden, or latent meaning: For, the ſtone

which the Builders refuſed, doth not imply the act of a Maſon, or the rejection of a ſtone, but the <hi>contempt of a perſon;</hi> ſo that the perſon couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under this ſtone, and the builders intended by this Metaphor, muſt be our firſt enquiry.</p>
                  <p>Now by Stone in the Text there is generally meant, either <hi>David,</hi> or the <hi>Son of David,</hi> the King, or the Kings Son; a perſon exalted above ordinary men, a perſon exalted above all his brethren.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Scripture ſpeaks of man as man, the Spirit puts a very low va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue and eſteem upon him, calling him, <hi>Duſt, Graſſe,</hi> Eſay 46. yea, <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>

                     <hi>the ſtone of Iſrael:</hi> Under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Shepheard, Expoſitors doubt not, is meant the <hi>Kingly office;</hi> now, he who was to bear that, he is not as a mortall, or a man called Duſt, or Graſs, or Vanity, <hi>But the ſtone of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is a King decyphered at large by any ſort of Stone: for if, <hi>Ex quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis ligno non fit Mercurius,</hi> If every block is not fit to make a Statue, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Stone is not fit to repreſent a <hi>King;</hi> and therefore the ſpirit of God is choice even upon this account: For the Kingly perſon decyphered, he is ſet forth, not ſimply by a ſtone, but by a <hi>tryed ſtone,</hi> a <hi>precious ſtone,</hi> a <note place="margin">Eſay 28. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>corner ſtone;</hi> yea, in my Text, there is yet a gradation higher, for, not onely a ſtone, and a corner ſtone, but <hi>Caput Anguli,</hi> the <hi>Headſtone in the corner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Look then how far a ſtone tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth <hi>Duſt,</hi> a pretious ſtone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth <hi>graſs;</hi> The Head ſtone in the choyſeſt ſtructure ſurpaſſeth <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>

ſuch is the proportion, ſuch the diſtance between man as man, and man as King: As men we are but <hi>duſt,</hi> and <hi>graſs,</hi> and <hi>vanity;</hi> but he who is our King, he is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now truly thus to do, is not with the Spirit of God, to deem a King a ſtone, a <hi>Corner ſtone,</hi> a <hi>Head ſtone:</hi> but a <hi>ſtepping</hi> ſtone, a <hi>ſtirrup</hi> ſtone, a ſtone laid onely for advance to private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, and to raiſe and get up to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal advantages; But, they who ſo did, the Spirit of God puts an eternal brand upon them, calling them, <hi>Children of Belial: A man of Belial;</hi> yea, between the Loyal and the Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 27:</note> the Spirit of God moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 1.</note> diſtinguiſheth: for, they who adhered and went with the King, they are ſaid to be ſuch, <hi>Whoſe hearts God had touched;</hi> but thoſe <note place="margin">1 Sam. 10. 26.</note> who deſpiſed, and brought him no preſents; they who looked upon him,

                  <p>Thoſe whoſe hearts God had touched, they owned, and joyed, and triumphed in their King; they ſhouted and ſaid, not God ſave <hi>Saul,</hi> as a man, <hi>But God ſave the King;</hi> God grant he may live, not as a man, but a King, in Glory and Majeſty, in Power and Greatneſs.</p>
                  <p>But the children of Belial, they hung down their heads like a Bulruſh, and had rather ſee a Kings head on a <hi>block,</hi> then to be, as God would have it, the <hi>head ſtone</hi> of the corner; But in deſpight of all, who deviſed <hi>how to put him by whom God would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt,</hi> the Lord would, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed his own deſign: For,</p>

                  <p>But as <hi>David,</hi> when God from a refuſed ſtone, called him to take his place, and to be Head of the corner, came like gold out of the fire, pure and undefiled; Even ſo the Kings Son, or Son of our <hi>David,</hi> he comes with the ſame <hi>impreſs of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> that he carried forth; no more corrupred by the <hi>King of Spain,</hi> then was <hi>David</hi> by the <hi>King of Gath:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation like a tool in Marble, it hath made a durable impreſſion, as it was with <hi>David,</hi> even ſo we believe it is with him; whether a refuſed ſtone, or a corner ſtone, whether at home, or abroad, he ſerves the ſame God, and the ſame way.</p>

                  <p>The King by whom God reſolved to do great things, he wonted him to troubles, he experienced him with tentations, till he was Thirty years of age, he began not to reign, he was Thirty years old, before he ſate upon the throne, Thirty years old, before he became the Head ſtone in the corner.</p>
                  <p>Now if we look upon our Kings Son, and if we compute his age, we ſhall finde juſt <hi>Davids</hi> year, the firſt year of his actual reign, the firſt year of his being in his own place, the firſt day of his entrance into his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al City, it was the day of his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and the Head of the corner, juſt as was <hi>David</hi> the thirtieth year.</p>

when the caſe was ſo with him, that as it is in that verſe, <hi>Mine own vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard have I not kept,</hi> yet even then they made him the keeper of their vineyards.</p>

                  <p>And yet for all this, in his ſtate of Reparation, behold he comes, as roſe the Son of Righteouſneſs, with healing on his wings, merciful, and gracious as the ſon of <hi>David,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our bleſſed Lord and Maſter, though he was a refuſed and a reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted ſtone, and that by his own too; yet we finde after his reſurrection, he was exalted, and became ſuch a ſtone, that it is written, <hi>On whomſoever it ſhould fall, it would grind him to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10. 18.</note> Yet even then, ſo full was he of grace and mercy, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent his Rebels, and his refuſers, ſhould become ſtones in his building; yea, <hi>living ſtones</hi> under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him their Head, onely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.

                  </p>
                  <p>All that the ſtone ſo refuſed, after his exaltation, requireth of his rebels is, that they liſt themſelves anew,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:41882:44"/>
that they fight under his Banner, that they repent and be obedient.</p>
                  <p>Now the Son of our late King, our long refuſed and deſpiſed ſtone, he ſent his Heralds, and prepared his way, by meſſengers of peace; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claims a generall pardon, upon the ſame terms that did the ſon of <hi>David, repentance, loyalty, and obedience</hi> for the future; and indeed the God of peace himſelf will not give pardon upon other terms: For,</p>

thy Name we give the glory, it was thy goodneſs, it was thy doing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As it was thy goodneſs, even ſo it was thy wiſdom: To keep the rejected Stone from being Head of the corner, there hath been as great plottings, as the wit of man quickned by coveteouſneſs, malice, and ambition could invent: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair this ſtone, and to raiſe it to be Head of the corner, there hath been as great contrivances, as prudence, highthned by love and loyalty could imagine; but neither could effect their purpoſes, it was the wiſdom of God that did the work.</p>

no humble advice that can check his providence: For when his time is, as holy <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>To ſet up on high thoſe that be low, that thoſe which</hi>

                     <hi>hands cannot perform their enterpriſe:</hi> As Dagon fell before the Ark, even ſo muſt and ſhall all parles and counſels before Gods wiſdom: And for inſtance, we ſhall no further then the duty of the day; for, againſt our gracious Soveraign, againſt this ſtone which the Builders refuſed, there was as great proviſion made as hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wiſdom could imagine; <hi>Oaths, engagements, eſtabliſhments</hi> were made againſt it: and that by ſuch who were cried up for the Saints of the earth, men full of <hi>holy pretences, pretended re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, Sabbatarian zeal,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <hi>impulſes of the ſpirit;</hi> yea, enacted it was that none ſhould be a Builder, that did not diſavow this ſtone; none ſhould bear office, han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the ſword, or have benefit of Law, that did not <hi>engage</hi> againſt <hi>King and</hi>

                     <hi>Lords;</hi> yea, it was defined <hi>treaſon,</hi> and made death by pretence of Law, ſo much as to pray for the Head of the corner; and yet for all this, he who <hi>ſitteth in heaven hath laughed them to ſcorn;</hi> he whoſe wiſdom will admit no defeat, he hath broke their bands in ſunder, and maugre all Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and devices of Uſurpers, Traitors and Tyrants; <hi>The ſtone which was thus refuſed, is become the Head of the corner,</hi> and it is the Lords doing, his counſel, his wiſdom did it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it is the Lords doing, for not onely <hi>his goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>his wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>his power</hi> is eminently ſeen in it.</p>
                  <p>It is well known, to keep our Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign from being what he is, to keep the refuſed ſtone from being Head, there was as great a power, as fleſh and blood could well raiſe: there was formidable, and whole armies, armies that feared not to fight, men victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious enough, and expert in war; ſo that indeed the Kings friends, and ſuch as would have raiſed up this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed ſtone, they were like <hi>Iſrael</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Philiſtin tyranny, <hi>They had nor ſword nor spear,</hi> they had not ſo much <note place="margin">1 Sam. 13. 19.</note>

as a leaver left them, all the power was in the enemies hand; and when ſo, then it appears was Gods hour (to uſe an abuſed phraſe) <hi>to bare his arm,</hi> and to ſhew his power: For,</p>

                     <hi>Hoſea</hi> 1. 7.

                  </p>
                  <p>The mercy which we this day bleſs God for, it is a mercy done to the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> and done (bleſſed be his name for it) neither by bow, nor by ſword, nor by battle, by horſes, or horſe-men, but <hi>even by the Lord their God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord our God he hath ſhewed <hi>his power,</hi> not by breaking <hi>the bow,</hi> or ſnapping <hi>the ſpear in ſunder;</hi> but which is a much more admirable effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, by <hi>turning</hi> the <hi>hearts of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> by bowing the hearts of thouſands, and ten thouſands, as the heart of one man; to call for that ſtone which they had refuſed, and to place it, where in all right and juſtice it ought to be, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Anguli,</hi> the Head of the corner.</p>

Amongſt us men, ſuch is our power that we can fetter the <hi>feet,</hi> bind the <hi>hands,</hi> and bridle all <hi>outward violence,</hi> (for when a ſtronger cometh, the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med man is conquered) but a power over <hi>the heart,</hi> that we have not, the power of hearts it is in his hands only, who made the heart; and therefore I conceive, that that is much more the Lords doing, which is done by <hi>hearts,</hi> then that which is done by <hi>hands.</hi>

and raiſe it up, <hi>Hoc factum mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile,</hi> this is a work marvelous in our eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A marvelous bleſſing too:</hi> For, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if it be ſo, that <hi>deſcent</hi> and <hi>temperance</hi> in a King, makes a Land bleſſed, we have then in our King a marvelous bleſſing; for, <hi>He is the ſon of Nobles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That daring and unimitable <hi>preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent!</hi> that Son of blood, who feared not to <hi>unhead our corner,</hi> and throw down the moſt precious ſtone, that ever did Head our Buildings; even he <hi>(to the eternal aggravation of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence)</hi> profeſſed, even <hi>that King</hi> was the off-ſpring of many Kings, the 109th of his Nation; ſo that the ſon of ſuch a King, he muſt needs be the <hi>ſon of Nobles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We finde in the <hi>Hiſtory of Kings</hi> it never went well, either with <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>State,</hi> when the loweſt of the people were made <hi>Prieſts,</hi> or when God permitted a <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:41882:51"/>
ſervant, to ſit upon the Throne of his Soveraign: And we have experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this ſad truth, we have taſted, yea, we were almoſt at the dregs of that bitter cup: But, which is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous bleſſing in our eyes, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous Letters are ſet right, and we have a King which is the ſon of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. <note place="margin">R.

                  </p>
                  <p>And as we have a King the ſon of Nobles, even ſo we have a King, <hi>Who eats in due ſeaſon for ſtrength, and not for drunkenneſs:</hi> A King, whoſe firſt publick act of regality his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom was acquainted with, it was a Proclamation againſt the debaucht and ſwearing, profeſſing <hi>with what parts ſo ever, they may be otherwiſe qualified and endowed,</hi> they ſhall for them be as reprobate ſtones in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; ſo that the heading of our corner with ſuch a ſtone, is, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a marvelous work, but a marvelous bleſſing in our eyes.</p>
                  <p>Now without doubt a marvelous work, and a marvelous bleſſing, is not laid before our eyes, that we ſhould ſhut our eyes upon them, or that we ſhould make no reflection, no uſe of

them; for there is nothing marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, but it carrieth the power of an <hi>Ecce</hi> in it, and calleth upon us for to behold it.</p>
                  <p>Certainly then this work which is the Lords doing, and marvelous in our eyes, it calls upon us:</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>To rejoyce,</hi> 2. <hi>To be thankful,</hi> 3. <hi>To be obedient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To rejoyce;</hi> For if theſe words relate either <hi>to Davids</hi> exaltation to his Throne (as ſome) or to <hi>the ſon of David,</hi> our Saviours reſurrection from the grave; or as we at this time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them, <hi>to our preſent Soveraigns</hi> moſt happy reſtitution; upon all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, the eye may ſee, what did, and what may joy the heart.</p>
                  <p>In relation to the two former Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it is moſt clear, that this marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous work, and this Lords doing, it is a matter of high rejoycing; for the very next verſe to my Text is, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will rejoyce and be glad in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>David,</hi> and all that loved him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced to ſee his day, for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>All Iſrael gathered themſelves unto David in Hebron;</hi> they came as

one man to anoint <hi>David,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with him, I <hi>Chron.</hi> II. v. I, 3.</p>
                  <p>The ſon of <hi>David</hi> (the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain deſigned by this ſtone) he was depreſſed and exalted; a ſtone reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and a ſtone advanced even for our ſakes: he died, and was deſpiſed <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 25.</note> for our ſins, he was raiſed and made Head of the corner for our <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> And therefore the memorial of this marveil; the marvelous things done by God for our redemption, may very well create <hi>a Feſtival,</hi> and give Chriſtians (at leaſt at the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> for) to ſay, <hi>This is the day which the Lord hath made, we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyce and be glad in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for <hi>David,</hi> and the ſon of <hi>David;</hi> even ſo, for the ſon of our <hi>David,</hi> for the marvelous things done by God <hi>for our King,</hi> and in him for us, even for theſe we ought for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</p>
                  <p>It is an old tradition among the Jews, that there was at the building of the ſecond Temple, a <hi>peculiar ſtone</hi> which in the building was oft handed, and as oft thrown out of hand again: But at length when they came either
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:41882:53"/>
to compleat the work, or to leave it a rude and imperfect lump; there was no ſtone that could do the work, no ſtone that could fit the corner, and cloſe up the joynts, but that onely.</p>
                  <p>Now woful experience hath taught our Builders, that ſuch a ſtone was our Royal Soveraign, <hi>Charles the Second;</hi> like this Emphatical ſtone of the ſecond Temple, was the onely <hi>Caput Anguli,</hi> the onely Head ſtone that could cloſe our breaches: And therefore that God of his moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence, would be pleaſed ſo to fit us, that through Gods bleſſing in him we may become an united peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: This is matter of rejoycing, and rejoycing in the Lord too; for though it is our comfort, it was the Lords doings, and <hi>Mirabile in ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis noſtris,</hi> marvelous in our eyes.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, <note place="margin">II.</note> and preſent content is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motive to ſtir us up to joy, and rejoycing: This marvelous work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more than ſo; not onely joy in our hearts, <hi>but thankfulneſs to God;</hi> for as all along we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it was his doings! it is the Lord
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:41882:53"/>
who hath done <hi>great things</hi> for us! it is the Lord who hath turned our captivity! yea, ſo hath the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted our rejected ſtone, that we who ſee it done, may for ever ſit amazed, and be even like to them that <hi>dream:</hi> And therefore not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thee we give the praiſe, to thee the thanks, to thee the glory.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. When <hi>Samuel</hi> had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented their deſired King unto his people, <hi>Samuel</hi> tells, them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the great things which God hath done, it ſhould work in them ſuch a thankfulneſs, as ſhould evidence it ſelf in godly fear, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſervices: For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Samuel</hi> having ſaid, <hi>I will teach you the good, and the right way;</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <note place="margin">23.</note> adds, <hi>Onely fear the Lord, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">24.</note> 
                     <hi>ſerve him in truth with all your heart, for conſider how great things the Lord hath done for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The things that are marvelous in our eyes; this marvelous bleſſing of enjoying without blood, an exiled King; this marvelous work, of ſo ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Head of the corner, it
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:41882:54"/>
ſhould teach us to be thankful to our God, and to expreſſe that thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, not onely as <hi>Samuel,</hi> but ſo alſo as our Soveraign hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>By cordially renouncing all licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, and profaneneſs, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming examples of ſobriety, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:</hi> and indeed unleſs we all ſo do, we ſhall all be found reprobate ſtones, and very caſt-aways in the laſt day.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Is the reſtitution of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign, and the making him, who was ſo ſadly rejected the, Head of the corner, the Lords doing, and marve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in our eyes?</p>
                  <p>Truly, this ſhould teach every of us our bounden duty to our King, and that is to love, honour, and <hi>obey him for the Lords ſake,</hi> not daring by thought, word, or deed to leſſen, or degrade him, whom the Lord hath made <hi>Caput Anguli,</hi> the onely Supream, the Higheſt, the Head of the corner.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Whence there appears to me a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſignal difference between <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and between <hi>Moral</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: For, the Wives of <hi>Jews,</hi> the Children of <hi>Turks,</hi> the Servants of <hi>Pagans;</hi> theſe all reſpectively may give as great obedience, as we can; and yet becauſe it is not done upon a Chriſtian motive, becauſe it is not done for the <hi>Lords ſake;</hi> all this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as to Gods acceptance, and as to Heaven, is of no value: But the ſame obedience done upon the Lords account, the ſame obedience done by us Chriſtians upon the account of <hi>Faith,</hi> it may bring unto us an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting recompence.</p>
                  <p>Whereas then that our deſpiſed is become the Head of the corner, is <hi>the Lords doings,</hi> and marvelous in our eyes; our bounden duty is, not as do Pagons, or Turks, to honour
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:41882:55"/>
our King for <hi>fear,</hi> to love him for his <hi>bounty,</hi> or to obey him upon <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint:</hi> But being it was the <hi>Lords doing,</hi> ſo marvelouſly (almoſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſly) to inveſt him in the Throne of his Father! Being it was the Lords doing to quell the mighty, and the Lords doing to ſet him in his own place; let our obedience be for the <hi>Lords ſake,</hi> let our obedience have more of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> then the <hi>Law</hi> in it, let our allegeance have more of the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> then the <hi>Subject</hi> in it;</p>
                  <p>Yea, that there may be a perfect period to the <hi>Grand Conſpiracy,</hi> both againſt the <hi>Lord anointed,</hi> and the <hi>Lords anointed,</hi> let our converſation be ſuch as become Chriſtians, and our loyalty ſuch as become Chriſtian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: Let us kiſſe the Son leſt he be angry, and let us honour the King, becauſe God harh honoured him: for to Gods glory, and our comfort, we cannot confeſſe in any better Form, then the words of my Text, ever bleſſed be the name of God for it;</p>
