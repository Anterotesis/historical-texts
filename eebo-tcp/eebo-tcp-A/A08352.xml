            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

grudging at her and reuolting from her, and to the assaulting of her maiesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son (whom God long preserue) her royall crowne and dignitie, and particularly and specially to the procuring, raising, aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and strengthening this late most vile and horrible rebellion, beside the rest that are daily to be looked for with wise, ielous, and circumspect expectation.</p>
            <p>It came sorth long before the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren rebellion, as well you wote good reason it is that the childe be gotten afore it be borne, or rather that the father be borne before the childe be gotten. It is not vnknowen how for such reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes assemblies haue bene suspiciously made, substitutes haue bene deputed, and the like by many exercised, to crepe into deceaued subiectes hartes and draw them to be wayling of their supposed miseries, and to a desire of returning to the fansie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full superstitions of Rome. How famous is the deliuerie of badges and tokens (with v. woundes and other superstitious deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) as it were for markes of a faction? How notorious is their byeword of their golden day? It is knowen (for the letters be yet extant in good custodie) how one of
<pb facs="tcp:22558:7"/>
their Northren sacrificers wrote to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his owne faction, <hi>vz.</hi> Sir Iohn Plumtrée, to be satisfied in a matter that troubled his conscience, which was, that he had at one of the rebellious Earles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement sayd Masse before absoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on obteined from the Pope in such forme as other had it. Appeareth it not euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that those receauinges to reconcilement are with admonitions or rather conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not to returne to true Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion which they call schisme, nor to quiet and conformable life according to her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties proceding, which they terme schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall? And what was this els, but to prepare mens hartes by secrete shriftes, whisperinges, exhortations, aduises, and traiterous practises, to repent their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to renounce it, to conceaue a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of not returning to it, and so after such a preparatiue of a pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, indulgence, absolution, or reconcilement, with a glister of treason to purge them cleane of all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest loyaltie, faith, and allegeance. And so the silly abused poore men (be they in worldly respect neuer so riche &amp; politike) are by degrees induced, first to abhorre the course of these times and gouernment,
<pb facs="tcp:22558:7"/>
wherin they are borne in hand that they are out of the Chirch, as it were out of the Arke wrastling for life in the mid maine sea in perill of drowning, and this is their Contrition, which can not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lothing those whom they thinke au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of their danger, of whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Quéenes maiestie is the chiefe. Secondly they are trained to conference and secrete consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make shift for their soules by ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counsell, and this is their Confession, wherin many traiterous deuises are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréed vpon. Thirdly to make vp perfect penance, for amendes they must enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to actuall rebellion, and that is the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Satisfaction to the sea of Rome, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Quéene and realme are encombred.</p>
            <p>But now marke (good readers) now cometh the case that ministreth good cause of consideration to you all. If you (good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) be of great estate or beare charge in the common weale, as counsellers, lieue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenantes, iustices, or in any degrée of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernance, now listen to matter of your charge, to awaken your care and put your duties in execution. If ye be meaner sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes without calling in office, now har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to matter to moue ye to praier to God,
<pb facs="tcp:22558:8"/>
to direct their zeale and trauailes to whom it apperteineth, or rather as he hath he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done miraculously to preserue vs. This baggage, and all other of like sort; yea and some farre worse, can not well be sayd by such fine Italian, suttle, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious heades to remaine or be newly put in practise after the rebellion suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, in respect of the rebellion past, but in hope of thinges to come. Such thinges as were prouided as appeareth by their date long before the rebellion actually raised, <hi>vz.</hi> before sommer was xij. monethes, and at this day watch their times, may not be construed to haue regard to time passed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medilesse, but to a reach of mischiefe whose successe is not yet séene. Full true it is that Papistrie hath no looking beyond this world, but is determined within worldly hopes, and therefore their deuises must be thought to tend to worldly politike endes, and so these pardons not propounded for foules health, but for hazarding of body and soule to serue a worldly fetch of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for aduancing of the Popes and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictes worldly ambition and gaine. There is a new mischiefe in expectation. God presere our gracious Prince, and her
<pb facs="tcp:22558:8"/>
true Counsellers, which shall be the chiefe defence and safetie of vs all. Note some likeliboodes, but with a ielous regard for so precious a iewell as our Quéene is. Our Louanistes for a good while haue written no more. What is the cause? They take them to other weapons, they hang vpon expectation of the successe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion or some like mischiefe, which by their former bookes they haue trauailed to stirre vp and geue occasion. A number of such as finding them selues to féele some harme or lacke by popishe obstinacie made sutes &amp; gaue some hope a while of toward conformitie, now they shrinke backe, and holde out. And why so: Forsooth the men are now in hope, and in desire to sée the lucke of one chaunce more. It is well knowen that some Papicticall fellowes that of late yeares did communicate and frequent common prayer according to the order of our Church, do of late time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like since their reconcilement according to this wicked order, absteine from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and common prayer. And what is the reason? <hi>Aliquid monstri alunt,</hi> they are put in new courage, and will no more stoupe till they sée more how the
<pb facs="tcp:22558:9"/>
world will wagge, for a thing that they know, as they are borne in hand. What maketh the late flying of Papistes in such heapes, as those that tooke shipping ner<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

What intention haue they that runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, leauing letters behinde them to pray fauour of the Quéenes true officers with an intimation or inkling of promise, to be likewise good an other day to those that should shew them fauour now, but vpon a plaine reckoning of some vngraciousnesse in working, to hasten that day of their victorie, triumphe, and abilitie of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensing? Papistes flie not, stirre not, brag not, nor do any thing, nor leaue any thing vndone without hope. This geare por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth much.</p>
            <p>But specially wey, why such vngra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious geare commeth now out that was prouided long agoe? Why after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion it commeth, that should haue had his place before? Forsooth in the sommer 1569. the rebels were not ready, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:22558:9"/>
the worst of this sort stayed. In the winter following, the rebels were taken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ort afore they were ready, and then in an vnseasonable time of winter the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those traiterous Bulles would not helpe. Why come they now then? For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth vpon their hope of that which ought to be our feare. The world is strange, treasons be venturous, no enemie to be neglected, specially nere and domesticall. There is somwhat in working that ought to moue our ialousie, to awake our hede, to sharpe our foresight and endeuour, and to make vs prouide for preuention, but specially to shield our selues by prayer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his wing that is able to defend vs, &amp; in the meane time not to omit those meanes of defence that he putteth in our handes.</p>
            <p>Wherefore let vs all pray for her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, that with courage she follow God in the course that he hath plainly set before her highnes for her preseruation. All ye noble counsellers goe forward in your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable seruice to defend that realme that can not in all likelihode ouerliue the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of her most royall person.
