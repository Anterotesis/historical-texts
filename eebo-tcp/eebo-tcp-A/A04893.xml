            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that they were faine to fetch Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stackes
and Beanestackes, to stop vp
Damines, for feare of drowning all
the Country about, which time also

your Queene of Heauens Temples,
your Alters and Pixes, with your

all drowned, not beyng able to help
themselues and their worshippers,
but perished with bruit beasts, and
the whole country, which shal neuer
be recouered agayn. When also a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute

of England, notwithstanding your
Queen of Heauen, whom you serue
in all blindenesse of Popery. There
came such Rayne, by the space of .v.
weekes, with such fearful Haile that
all the Wheat, Barly, Beans, Otes,
&amp; other grayne, with Apples, peares
and other Fruits, were vtterly lost,
<pb facs="tcp:21971:20"/>
neuer reaped. Mowne, nor gathred,

to Morter with the showre. About
which time also, all Plumsted Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes

the Isle of Hartly: the Marshes of
Herne and Whitslable. Besyde the
miserable Famin that God sent ouer
all this land, when Wheat was at a
French crowne a Bushell, and many
that could get neither Wheat nor
Barly, nor Beans, were glad to eate
Acorn breade, and many to sterue for
lacke of Beans and Acorns: when
Spanish Mules and Iades were
fed with Wheat: besyde the sword,
and Robberies of straungers, that
<pb facs="tcp:21971:20"/>
the Queene of Heauen suffred hir
worshippers to be plagued with al,
that rightly they might accuse them
selues of such vile sinne as caused god
to be angry, which also (and not our
Religion) is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause (as theirs was)
of our Fluds &amp; other Rods of Gods
correction to make holely to liue in
so holy a Religion, bothe vpon the
Papistes and Christians, powred at
this time by Gods Almighty hande
on the Papists for theyr blindnesse,
on the lose liued professours of the
Gospel for their lewd conuersation.
God geue vs al grace truly to repent
and by Iesus Christe, so to seeke for
Pardon, that for him and through
him, all our ignorance, blasphemie &amp;
Idolatrie, weaknesse, lewdnesse, and
Hipocrisy, may be forgeuen in this
world, that in the world to com wee
may haue life euerlastyng. Amen</p>
